AB  - Fossils can document the morphological diversification through time and date lineages, providing relevant characters are preserved. Primascena Klimaszewsi, 1997 was erected for P. subita Klimaszewsi, 1997 on the basis of a single, partly damaged male from Dominican amber. Originally assigned to Rhinocolidae: Paurocephalinae, the genus was subsequently transferred to Psyllidae: Aphalaroidinae. Recently, two undescribed species resembling the fossil species were discovered in Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul), allowing a detailed morphological study of adults and immatures. Based on the morphological study, a revised diagnosis of the genus is provided, including the previously unknown female and fifth instar immatures. Primascena subita is redescribed and P. empsycha n. spec. and P. ruprechtiae n. spec. are formally described and illustrated. An identification key is provided for the species of Primascena. A cladistic morphological analysis supports the placement of the two new species in Primascena, and of this genus in the Aphalaroidinae. It is sister to all but Aphalaroida, though with little support. The two Brazilian species develop on Ruprechtia spp. (Polygonaceae: Eriogonoideae), an unusual psyllid host. Immatures of P. ruprechtiae are free-living on the lower leaf face and do not induce galls.

AB  - Amblyomma species are non-endemic ticks in Egypt, which have been recorded from imported animals. This study was carried out in 2022 to monitor Amblyomma spp. from dromedary camels, cattle, and snakes in Egypt. During this study, 400 camels, 200 cattle, and two snakes (Pythonidae) were inspected for tick infestation. Collected specimens were identified based on morphological characters and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the 12S rRNA gene. Camels were infested by adult specimens of Amblyomma variegatum and Amblyomma lepidum, but no Amblyomma spp. were collected from cattle. Amblyomma variegatum showed high genetic similarity to other A. variegatum from Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome (> 99.99%), and A. lepidum showed high genetic similarity to other A. lepidum from Israel and Sudan (99.99%). Amblyomma latum is recorded in Egypt from the ball python snake for the first time and showed high genetic similarity with South African A. latum (99.87%).

AB  - Simple Summary: Natural enemies of major pests such as parasitoids require sugar-rich food for development and reproduction. In agricultural fields, honeydew excreted by aphids is often the predominant sugar source that parasitoids can consume. Moreover, honeydew can constitute a cue used by parasitoid females to find their aphid host. However, in some species, such as the woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum), honeydew is coated with a thin layer of wax, which could make its consumption harder and prevent the emission of attractive odors for parasitoids. In the present study, we evaluated the benefits in terms of longevity and host searching that could provide honeydew to the main parasitoid of the woolly apple aphid, Aphelinus mali, and infer parasitoid feeding patterns in apple orchards. Results suggested that A. mali is able to consume honeydew in laboratory and field conditions and to benefit from honeydew, as it increased its longevity when honeydew was provided with water. Although no olfactory preference was observed, honeydew also stimulated oviposition by A. mali. The contribution of honeydew to increase the efficiency of A. mali as a biological control agent is discussed.
   Many parasitoids need to feed on sugar sources at the adult stage. Although nectar has been proven to be a source of higher nutritional quality compared to honeydew excreted by phloem feeders, the latter can provide the necessary carbohydrates for parasitoids and increase their longevity, fecundity and host searching time. Honeydew is not only a trophic resource for parasitoids, but it can also constitute an olfactory stimulus involved in host searching. In this study, we combined longevity measurements in the laboratory, olfactometry and feeding history inference of individuals caught in the field to test the hypothesis that honeydew excreted by the aphid Eriosoma lanigerum could serve as a trophic resource for its parasitoid Aphelinus mali as well as a kairomone used by the parasitoid to discover its hosts. Results indicate that honeydew increased longevity of A. mali females if water was provided. Water could be necessary to feed on this food source because of its viscosity and its coating by wax. The presence of honeydew allowed longer stinging events by A. mali on E. lanigerum. However, no preference towards honeydew was observed, when given the choice. The role of honeydew excreted by E. lanigerum on A. mali feeding and searching behavior to increase its efficiency as a biological control agent is discussed.

AB  - The two-spotted stink bug, Bathycoelia distincta Distant (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is a serious pest in South African macadamia orchards. This pest is predominantly controlled using insecticides, thus alternative control methods are essential. The stink bugs arrive as adults in the orchards, during the early nut set season, but little is known about their alternative plant hosts before their arrival. The aim of this study was to develop a PCR-based metabarcoding assay to identify plant material in the gut of B. distincta. Thereafter, the persistence of plant DNA in the gut, after switching food sources, was determined by rearing the stink bugs on Zea mays L. (Cyperales: Poaceae), transferring them to Macadamia sp. and then collecting insects at different time points. As a proof of concept, the assay was tested on insects collected from commercial macadamia orchards to determine if it can identify alternative food sources. The chloroplast gene markers, trnL and trnF, were most successful for plant DNA amplification. The time trial suggested that plant material can be detected 24 h after switching to the alternate food source and one of the samples still contained Z. mays DNA after five days. Various plant species were detected from the orchard collected samples, including known food sources of other stink bugs, such as tea plants (Camellia sinensis L. (Ericales:Theaceae)) and sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L. (Asterales: Asteraceae)). This study provides the first indication of potential alternative food sources of B. distincta. The assay developed in this study can now be implemented for large-scale field surveys to contribute to future integrated pest management strategies.

The purpose of this study is to describe the metamorphosis phase of O. croesus for the length of time needed for metamorphosis and O. croesus survival ability in Mussaenda (Mussaenda pubescens) and Asoka (Saraca asoca) flowers as a database of endemic butterfly conservation policy in Bacan Island. This research was conducted from July to October 2020. The eggs were collected from mussaenda and asoka plants in the Mount Sibela nature reserve on Bacan Island, and then reared in captivity with a cage size of 50 x 50 x 50 cm. The results showed that the survival percentage of O. croesus was in the low category with a value of 55%. Furthermore, it is found out that the time required for the metamorphosis of O. croesus is 93-100 days, including the longer category compared to other Papilio. The results of this study recommend that O. croesus needs attention in the conservation of local resources, considering the low life span and long metamorphosis are feared to be extinct.

AB  - Simple Summary Most arthropods (uniting animals such as the chelicerates, e.g., spiders and their kin, as well as millipedes, centipedes, crustaceans, and insects) have distinct sensory appendages at the second head segment, the so-called antennae. The Arachnida (e.g., spiders and scorpions) do not possess antennae, but have evolved highly specialized sensory organs on different body regions. However, very limited information is available concerning pseudoscorpions (false scorpions). These animals do not seem to possess such specialized structures, but show dominant, multifunctional appendages prior to the first walking leg, called pedipalps. Here, we investigate the neuronal pathway of these structures as well as general aspects of the nervous system. We describe new details of typical arthropod brain compartments, such as the arcuate body and a comparatively small mushroom body. Neurons associated with the pedipalps terminate in two regions in the central nervous system of characteristic arrangement: a glomerular and a layered center, which we interpret as a chemo- and a mechanosensory center, respectively. The centers, which fulfill the same function in other animals, show a similar arrangement. These similarities in the sensory systems of different evolutionary origin have to be interpreted as functional prerequisites. Identifying these similarities helps to understand the general functionality of sensory systems, not only within arthropods. Many arachnid taxa have evolved unique, highly specialized sensory structures such as antenniform legs in Amblypygi (whip spiders), for instance, or mesosomal pectines in scorpions. Knowledge of the neuroanatomy as well as functional aspects of these sensory organs is rather scarce, especially in comparison to other arthropod clades. In pseudoscorpions, no special sensory structures have been discovered so far. Nevertheless, these animals possess dominant, multifunctional pedipalps, which are good candidates for being the primary sensory appendages. However, only little is known about the anatomy of the nervous system and the projection pattern of pedipalpal afferents in this taxon. By using immunofluorescent labeling of neuronal structures as well as lipophilic dye labeling of pedipalpal pathways, we identified the arcuate body, as well as a comparatively small mushroom body, the latter showing some similarities to that of Solifugae (sun spiders and camel spiders). Furthermore, afferents from the pedipalps terminate in a glomerular and a layered neuropil. Due to the innervation pattern and structural appearance, we conclude that these neuropils are the first integration centers of the chemosensory and mechanosensory afferents. Within Arthropoda, but also other invertebrates or even vertebrates, sensory structures show rather similar neuronal arrangement. Thus, these similarities in the sensory systems of different evolutionary origin have to be interpreted as functional prerequisites of the respective modality.

AB  - Cotyledon orbiculata, commonly known as pig's ear, is an important medicinal plant of South Africa. It is used in traditional medicine to treat many ailments, including skin eruptions, abscesses, inflammation, boils and acne. Many plants have been used to synthesize metallic nanoparticles, particularly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). However, the synthesis of AgNPs from C. orbiculata has never been reported before. The aim of this study was to synthesize AgNPs using C. orbiculata and evaluate their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. AgNPs were synthesized and characterized using Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). The antimicrobial activities of the nanoparticles against skin pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin Resistance Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans) as well as their effects on cytokine production in macrophages (differentiated from THP-1 cells) were evaluated. The AgNPs from C. orbiculata exhibited antimicrobial activity, with the highest activity observed against P. aeruginosa (5 mu g/mL). The AgNPs also showed anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta) in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages. This concludes that the AgNPs produced from C. orbiculata possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammation properties.

AB  - Camelina is an interesting crop and producers must adopt cultural practices to achieve the highest yield and oil content possible. Considering the size of the seed, the harvesting phase is crucial to reduce losses and maximize income. Furthermore, in recent years, with the worsening of climatic conditions due to global warming, crop management can no longer follow the classic seasonality but must adapt to new climatic conditions. The possibility of double cropping, that is the process of producing two crops in a single season, allows multiple advantages such as weed control, greater remuneration, and less exposure to bare soil which determine greater resilience of the production system. To enable this, especially in recent years, even a few days of difference in the cultivation phases can guarantee the success of double cropping. For these reasons, the authors compared two different harvesting strategies: direct combining at full maturity (DC); swathing + combining at full maturity (SW). The working performance, cost, and seed losses associated with each harvesting method were calculated. The results highlighted how SW reduced the crop cycle length by 11 days, did not influence seed losses and crop yield but showed lower performance and higher cost with respect to DC.

AB  - The tri-trophic interactions among five cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) cultivars-Copenhagen Market (CM), Red Acre (RA), Vertus Savoy (VS), Sugarloaf (SL) and Danish Ballhead (DBH)-a generalist aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and its parasitoid, Diaeretiella rapae McIntosh, were assessed. Copenhagen Market, known for its reported aphid resistance, recorded the fewest aphids (9.11 per plant; F = 6.50; df = 4, p < 0.01), followed closely by Red Acre (11.83 per plant), which was statistically similar. Upon aphid attack, all cultivars produced plant volatiles that influenced the attraction of the parasitoid, D. rapae. Copenhagen Market consistently showed a higher response across cultivar combinations, attracting 62.59%-67.50% of parasitoids. It also recorded a higher parasitisation rate (39.9%; F = 5.94; df = 4/20, p < 0.01) in a multiple-choice test. The results indicate that cabbage cultivars employ both constitutive and induced resistance, as aphid-resistant cultivars were also found to be more attractive to parasitoids. In addition to plant odour cues, factors such as plant colour, texture and host aphid kairomones can influence the orientation and parasitisation by D. rapae.

AB  - Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is an invasive pest of palms in the Pacific Region, including Hawaii, for which limited management options are available. O. rhinoceros larvae develop in materials rich in organic materials such as green waste and animal manure. Biosolid waste within Hawaii's infestation zone, however, was determined to inhospitable to O. rhinoceros. To determine if the elevated metal salts present in the biosolid waste was responsible for this observation, O. rhinoceros life stages were acutely and chronically exposed to several metal salts at increasing concentrations to determine the impact of these salts on survival, development, and oviposition behavior. Acute (7 days) exposure to mulch rehydrated in solutions of CaCl2, KCl, MgCl2, or NaCl increasing in concentration from 0 to 0.7 M resulted in increased mortality, with concentrations > 0.5 M generally being 100% lethal to both first and second-instar larvae. A similar trend in survival was observed in subsequent experiments using a horticultural grade of Epsom salt (MgSO4) at 1x, 2x, and 5x the recommended application rate. Chronic exposure (eggs reared on mulch through pupation) to Epsom salt at these same rates resulted in significantly delayed instar development and reduced adult biometrics at both 1x and 2x levels. Similar to the acute exposure, eggs exposed to 5x levels did not hatch, or the first instar died soon after emergence. In choice experiments, gravid females showed no oviposition preference for media hydrated with water or 2x Epsom salt but did avoid ovipositing in mulch rehydrated in 5x Epsom salt. These trials demonstrate a potentially novel approach to managing pest populations of O. rhinoceros.

AB  - Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume) essential oil has vast potential as an antimicrobial but is limited by its volatility and rapid degradation. To decrease its volatility and prolong the efficacy of the biocide, cinnamon essential oil was encapsulated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). The characterization of MSNs and cinnamon oil encapsulated with silica nanoparticles (CESNs) was estimated. Additionally, their insecticidal activity against the rice moth Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton) larvae was evaluated. The MSN surface area decreased from 893.6 to 720 m(2) g(-1) and the pore volume also decreased from 0.824 to 0.7275 cc/g after loading with cinnamon oil. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and N2 sorption by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) confirmed the successful formation and evolution of the synthesized MSNs and CESN structures. The surface characteristics of MSNs and CESNs were analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the sub-lethal activity values, the order of toxicity after 6 days of exposure was MSNs > CESN > cinnamon oil > silica gel > peppermint oil. The efficacy of CESNs gradually increases its toxicity more than MSN after the 9th day of exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary Exploiting the tolerance of plants against herbivorous insects is a viable pest management alternative, especially where conventional controls are ineffective. For example, due to the inefficacy of currently adopted practices, new strategies and methods are needed for Spodoptera frugiperda management in maize. This study evaluated the tolerance levels of maize landraces and a conventional hybrid under natural infestation of S. frugiperda. We found promising sources of tolerance among the landraces, evident as tolerance indices that varied across the landraces and hybrid we evaluated. Insect pests such as Spodoptera frugiperda cause significant losses to maize (Zea mays mays). Control of S. frugiperda is difficult, but the use of insect resistant cultivars, including tolerant cultivars, is a promising alternative, and landraces are a potential source of insect resistance. This study investigated tolerance to S. frugiperda in five Brazilian landraces, Amarelao, Aztequinha, Branco Antigo, Palha Roxa, and Sao Pedro, in relation to one conventional (non-Bt) hybrid, BM207, under field conditions. We assessed tolerance as the ratio of insecticide-free to insecticide-protected plants for plant height, stem diameter, and leaf chlorophyll content at two plant stages. Tolerance ratios varied across the maize genotypes, but inconsistently across plant variables, and cluster analysis revealed three groups based on tolerance ratios. A first group contained genotypes similarly tolerant to S. frugiperda, BM207, Palha Roxa, Sao Pedro, and Aztequinha, while the second and third groups each contained single genotypes, Amarelao, and Branco Antigo, which were considered not tolerant. Overall, the landraces Palha Roxa, Sao Pedro, and Aztequinha compared favorably to BM207 in terms of tolerance, and therefore may be valuable for management of this pest, and as germplasm sources to improve tolerance in other cultivars.

AB  - New infestations of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), were discovered in southern California, namely in Rancho Santa Fe and La Mesa (San Diego County) and Highland Park (Los Angeles County) in 2021. We investigated whether these new infestations were related to the previous infestations in La Mesa (2018) and Canyon Lake, Riverside County (2020). We used two mitochondrial genes (COI and COII) and seven polymorphic microsatellite markers to infer the genetic relationship between southern California colonies and their breeding systems. The samples collected from seven localities belonged to five colonies (inter-colony distances ranged from similar to 160 m to 185 km, with an average of 97 km). Of these five colonies, two were simple families, and three were extended families. Structure analyses of microsatellite genotypes grouped the termite samples into three distinct genetic clusters, suggesting at least three independent introduction events in southern California.

AB  - Generalist insect herbivores may be recorded from a great variety of host plants. Under natural conditions, however, they are almost invariably associated with a few primary host species on which most of the juveniles develop. We experimentally investigated the interaction of the generalist moth Helicoverpa punctigera Wallengren (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) with four of its native host plants, two designated primary hosts and two secondary hosts (based on field observations). We tested whether primary host plants support higher survival rates of larvae and whether they are more attractive to ovipositing moths and feeding larvae. We also evaluated whether relative attractiveness of host plants for oviposition matches larval survival rates on them-the preference-performance hypothesis. Moths laid significantly more eggs on two of the four host plant species, one of them a primary host, the other a secondary host. Larvae developed best when reared on the attractive secondary host, developed at intermediate levels on the two primary hosts, and performed worst on the less attractive secondary host. Relative attractiveness of the four host plants to caterpillars differed from that of the moths. Neither adult nor larval attraction to host plants fully supported the preference-performance hypothesis, but oviposition was better correlated with larval survival rates than was larval attraction. Our results suggest the relative frequency at which particular host species are used in the field may depend on factors not yet considered including the long-distance attractants used by moths and the relative distribution of host species.

AB  - Epithelial membrane protein (EMP1), a member of the peripheral myelin protein (PMP22) family, is involved in the development of various human malignancies. However, the expression level of EMP1 and its functional role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain unclear to date. Ferroptosis, a newly characterized form of regulated cell death, plays an essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression levels of EMP1 in HNSCC and normal tissues, as well as to identify the function of EMP1 in regulating ferroptosis during the progression of HNSCC. To further explore the biological function of EMP1 in vitro, transient transfection was used to overexpress EMP1 in the HNSCC cell lines Hep2 and Detroit562. Functionally, our results indicated that EMP1 overexpression could not affect the initiation of ferroptosis directly but reinforced RSL3-induced ferroptosis on HNSCC cells. Furthermore, mechanical study indicated that EMP1 mediated the ferroptosis via cell density-regulated Hippo-TAZ pathway and regulated the expression of Rac1 and NOX1. In addition, our study demonstrated that EMP1 overexpression could promote gefitinib resistance by targeting the MAPK pathway. In summary, our findings indicate that EMP1 may act as an oncogene and serve as a therapeutic target against malignant progression of HNSCC.

AB  - Anchored cells of the basal epidermis constantly undergo proliferation in an overcrowded environment. An important regulator of epidermal proliferation is YAP, which can be controlled by both cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. Here, we report that THY1, a GPI-anchored protein, inhibits epidermal YAP activity through converging molecular mechanisms. THY1 deficiency leads to increased adhesion by activating the integrin-beta(1)-SRC module. Notably, regardless of high cellular densities, the absence of THY1 leads to the dissociation of an adherens junction complex that enables the release and translocation of YAP. Due to increased YAP-dependent proliferation, Thy1(-/-) mice display enhanced wound repair and hair follicle regeneration. Taken together, our work reveals THY1 as a crucial regulator of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions that controls YAP activity in skin homeostasis and regeneration.

AB  - Chronic cocaine use triggers inflammatory and oxidative processes in the central nervous system, resulting in impaired microglia. Mesenchymal stem cells, known for their immunomodulatory properties, have shown promise in reducing inflammation and enhancing neuronal survival. The study employed the cocaine self-administration model, focusing on ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein 1 (Iba-1) and cell morphology as markers for microglial impairment and PLX-PAD cells as a treatment for attenuating cocaine craving. The results revealed an addiction-stage and region-specific impairment in microglia following chronic cocaine exposure, with deficits observed in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) during the maintenance stage and in both the NAc and Dentate Gyrus (DG) during the extinction and reinstatement stages. Furthermore, PLX-PAD cell therapy demonstrated a significant reduction in cocaine craving and seeking behavior, interestingly accompanied by the prevention of Iba-1 level decrease and restoration of microglial activity in the NAc and DG. These findings highlight the unique role of microglia in modulating cocaine addiction behaviors through their influence on synaptic plasticity and neuronal remodeling associated with memory formation. They also suggest that PLX-PAD therapy may mitigate the detrimental effects of chronic cocaine exposure on microglia, underscoring the importance of incorporating microglia in comprehensive addiction rehabilitation strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary We explored the role of exercise in promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function in T2DM mice through the Irisin/TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Ten weeks of exercise training significantly reduced inflammation in the DG region caused by T2DM and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function. However, these positive effects could be reversed by treatment with Cyclo RGDyk, which blocks irisin receptor signaling. The results suggest that exercise may be an effective strategy for alleviating cognitive decline caused by diabetes by activating the irisin signaling pathway.Abstract Neuroinflammation is a major feature of type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM), adversely affecting hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the precise mechanism is not fully understood, and therapeutic approaches are currently lacking. Therefore, we determined the effects of exercise on neuroinflammation and hippocampal neurogenesis in T2DM mice, with a specific focus on understanding the role of the irisin and related cascade pathways in modulating the beneficial effects of exercise in these processes. Ten-week exercise significantly decreased T2DM-induced inflammation levels and markedly promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function. However, these positive effects were reversed by 10 weeks of treatment with cyclo RGDyk, an inhibitor of irisin receptor signaling. Additionally, exercise helped reduce the M1 phenotype polarization of hippocampal microglia in diabetic mice; this effect could be reversed with cyclo RGDyk treatment. Moreover, exercise markedly increased the levels of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin protein while decreasing the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) in the hippocampus of T2DM mice. However, blocking irisin receptor signaling counteracted the down-regulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B in diabetic mice undergoing exercise intervention. Conclusively, exercise appears to be effective in reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis and memory in diabetes mice. The positive effects are involved in the participation of the irisin/TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, highlighting the potential of exercise in the management of diabetic-induced cognitive decline.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique that uses constant, low-intensity direct current to regulate brain activities. Clinical studies have shown that cathode-tDCS (c-tDCS) is effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. Due to the heterogeneity and patient specificity of seizures, patient-specific epilepsy networks are increasingly important in exploring the regulatory role of c-tDCS. In this study, we first set the left hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and amygdala as the epileptogenic zone (EZ), and the left inferior temporal cortex and ventral temporal cortex as the initial propagation zone (PZ) to establish a large-scale epilepsy network model. Then we set tDCS cathode locations according to the maximum average energy of the simulated EEG signals and systematically study c-tDCS inhibitory effects on the propagation of epileptic activity. The results show that c-tDCS is effective in suppressing the propagation of epileptic activity. Further, to consider the patient specificity, we set specific EZ and PZ according to the clinical diagnosis of 6 patients and establish patient-specific epileptic networks. We find that c-tDCS can suppress the propagation of abnormal activity in most patient-specific epileptic networks. However, when the PZ is widely distributed in both hemispheres, the treatment effect of c-tDCS is not satisfactory. Hence, we propose dual-cathode tDCS. For epilepsy models with a wide distribution of PZ, it can inhibit the propagation of epileptiform activity in other nodes except EZ and PZ without increasing the tDCS current strength. Our results provide theoretical support for the treatment of epilepsy with tDCS.

AB  - The lungs are a common site of metastases from malignant tumors. Their removal with a minimal but safe tissue margin is essential for the long-term survival of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a 1940 nm thulium-doped fiber laser (TDFL) and a 1470 nm diode laser (DL) in a pig model of lung surgery that involved the incision and excision of lung tissue. Histopathological analysis was performed on days 0 and 7 after surgery. Neither TDFL nor DL caused significant perioperative or postoperative bleeding. Histological analysis revealed the presence of carbonized necrotic tissue, mixed fibrin-cellular exudate in the superficial zone of thermal damage and bands of deeper thermal changes. The mean total width of thermal damage on day 0 was 499.46 +/- 61.44 and 937.39 +/- 109.65 mu m for TDFL and DL, respectively. On day 7, cell activation and repair processes were visible. The total width of thermal damage was 2615.74 +/- 487.17 mu m for TDFL vs. 6500.34 +/- 1118.02 mu m for DL. The superficial zone of thermal damage was narrower for TDFL on both days 0 and 7. The results confirm the effectiveness of both types of laser in cutting and providing hemostasis in the lungs. TDFL caused less thermal damage to the lung parenchyma than DL.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The aim of the current study was to establish an osseo-disintegration model initiated with a single microorganism in mini-pigs. Materials and Methods: A total of 36 titanium dental implants (3.5 mm in diameter, 9.5 mm in length) was inserted into frontal bone (n: 12) and the basis of the corpus mandible (n: 24). Eighteen implants were contaminated via inoculation of Enterococcus faecalis. Six weeks after implant insertion, bone-to-implant contact (BIC) ratio, interthread bone density (ITBD), and peri-implant bone density (PIBD) were examined. In addition to that, new bone formation was assessed via fluorescence microscopy, histomorphometry, and light microscopical examinations. Results: Compared to the sterile implants, the contaminated implants showed significantly reduced BIC (p < 0.001), ITBD (p < 0.001), and PBD (p < 0.001) values. Around the sterile implants, the green and red fluorophores were overlapping and surrounding the implant without gaps, indicating healthy bone growth on the implant surface, whereas contaminated implants were surrounded by connective tissue. Conclusions: The current experimental model could be a feasible option to realize a significant alteration of dental-implant osseointegration and examine novel surface decontamination techniques without impairing local and systemic inflammatory complications.

AB  - The study of drug delivery systems to the inner ear is a crucial but challenging field. The sensory organ (in the inner ear) is protected by the petrous bone labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth, both of which need to be overcome during the drug delivery process. The requirements for such a delivery system include small size, appropriate flexibility and biodegradability. DNA nanostructures, biomaterials that can arrange multiple functional components with nanometer precision, exhibit characteristics that are compatible with the requirements for inner ear drug delivery. Herein, we report the development of a novel inner ear drug delivery system based on epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-loaded tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs, EGCG@TDNs). The TDNs self-assembled via base-pairing of four single-stranded DNA constructs and EGCG was loaded into the TDNs through non-covalent interactions. Cy5-labeled TDNs (Cy5-TDNs) were significantly internalized by the House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 cell line, and this endocytosis was energy-, clathrin-, and micropinocytosis-dependent. Cy5-TDNs penetrated the round window membrane (RWM) rapidly in vivo. Local application of EGCG@TDNs onto the RWM of guinea pigs in a single dose continuously released EGCG over 4 hours. Drug concentrations in the perilymph were significantly elevated compared with the administration of free EGCG at the same dose. EGCG@TDNs were found to have favorable biocompatibility and strongly affected the RSL3-induced down-regulation of GPX4 and the generation of reactive oxygen species, on the basis of 2 ',7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining. JC-1 staining suggested that EGCG@TDNs successfully reversed the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by RSL-3 in vitro and rescued cells from apoptosis, as demonstrated by the analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Further functional studies showed that a locally administered single-dose of EGCG@TDNs effectively preserved spiral ganglion cells in C57/BL6 mice after noise-induced hearing loss. Hearing loss at 5.6 and 8 kHz frequencies was significantly attenuated when compared with the control EGCG formulation. Histological analyses indicated that the administration of TDNs and EGCG@TDNs did not induce local inflammatory responses. These favorable histological and functional effects resulting from the delivery of EGCG by TDNs through a local intratympanic injection suggest potential for therapeutic benefit in clinical applications.

AB  - Identifying the mechanistic drivers of migration can be crucial in shaping conservation and management policies. The cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) is a relatively poorly understood elasmobranch species that occurs along the U.S. Atlantic coast and undergoes large-scale seasonal migrations. To better understand the drivers and timing of cownose ray seasonal migration in order to inform potential management measures, we analyzed telemetry detections of 51 mature cownose rays (38 female, 13 male) tagged with acoustic transmitters in the Maryland and Virginia portions of Chesapeake Bay. Detections within their summer habitat in Chesapeake Bay and winter habitat in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Florida, were matched with publicly available sea surface temperature (SST) data recorded by data buoys near the areas of tag detections and with local photoperiod and day of year. These variables were used in boosted regression tree models of ray presence (all rays combined, females only, and males only) in each seasonal habitat. Models were developed for presence during the entire summer and winter season, and for the time periods of arrival and departure from both summer and winter habitats. Seasonal presence in both summer and winter habitats was associated with distinct temperature, photoperiod, and date ranges, with temperature as the most influential variable in seasonal models. In models of arrival and departure periods, southward migration (departure from Chesapeake Bay and arrival off Cape Canaveral) was strongly associated with SST for all rays and arrival in the Chesapeake Bay region after northward migration was most strongly associated with day of year. The most influential variable during the period of northward departure from Cape Canaveral differed between males (day of year) and females (SST). This suggests that mature female northward migration may be driven by temperature while male northward migration may be driven by endogenous cues. These findings provide detailed information on the timing of cownose ray arrival at, presence in, and departure from seasonal habitats and provide potential justification for including the species in cross-taxa comparative studies on migratory behavior.

AB  - Gut microorganisms can profoundly influence brain function in the host and their behavior. Since altered brain functional connectivity (FC) has been implicated in various cerebrovascular disorders, including cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, we hypothesized that gut microbiota in mice with cerebral I/R injury would affect brain FC when transplanted into germ-free mice. Metagenomic analysis of germ-free male C57BL/6J mice colonized with microbiota from mice with and without cerebral I/R injury showed a clear distinction in microbiota composition between mice colonized with control and I/R microbiota. The I/R microbiota-colonized mice showed decreased FC in the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, and exhibited increased anxiety as well as diminished spatial learning and memory and short-term object recognition memory. I/R microbiota-colonized mice also had significantly reduced dendritic spine density and synaptic protein levels and exhibited increased hippocampal inflammation. These results indicate that gut microbiota components from mice with cerebral I/R injury can alter animal behavior, brain functional connectivity, hippocampal neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. Moreover, they increase our understanding of the mechanisms through which the gut microbiome contributes to the pathobiology of cerebrovascular diseases.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effects of in vitro maturation (IVM) on the proteome of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from ewes. Extracted COC proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Differences in protein abundances (p < 0.05) and functional enrichments in immature versus in vitro-matured COCs were evaluated using bioinformatics tools. There were 2550 proteins identified in the COCs, with 89 and 87 proteins exclusive to immature and mature COCs, respectively. IVM caused downregulation of 84 and upregulation of 34 proteins. Major upregulated proteins in mature COCs were dopey_N domain-containing protein, structural maintenance of chromosomes protein, ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 2. Main downregulated proteins in mature COCs were immunoglobulin heavy constant mu, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 2, alpha-2-macroglobulin. Proteins exclusive to mature COCs and upregulated after IVM related to immune response, complement cascade, vesicle-mediated transport, cell cycle, and extracellular matrix organization. Proteins of immature COCs and downregulated after IVM were linked to metabolic processes, immune response, and complement cascade. KEGG pathways and miRNA-regulated genes attributed to downregulated and mature COC proteins related to complement and coagulation cascades, metabolism, humoral response, and B cell-mediated immunity. Thus, IVM influenced the ovine COC proteome. This knowledge supports the future development of efficient IVM protocols for Ovis aries.

AB  - Simple Summary To reliably identify the gut contents of plant-feeding insects, the removal of contaminant plant DNA from the insect surface is necessary. Previous approaches have used bleach and alcohol washes to achieve this. We perform a controlled baseline study on a herbivorous insect, the Meadow Spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius), to identify possible contamination that may persist after bleach washes. Despite the reported success of these methods, we find that contamination is still present, leading to unreliable results. We hypothesise that pollen is the main source of contamination, its robust nature making it difficult to remove. We conduct a further three experiments, investigating the effectiveness of more robust bleach washes, sterilised gut excision, and ultraviolet light as alternative sterilisation approaches. Overall, our findings indicate that we are unable to remove surface contamination while still detecting signals that may originate in the gut. In no experiment did we unequivocally detect plant DNA that originated in the P. spumarius gut.Abstract Dietary analysis of herbivorous insects relies on successfully eliminating surface contamination. If this cannot be performed reliably, then it will not be possible to differentiate between plants that the insect is feeding on and plants the insect has been in contact with, either directly or via pollen. Methods in the literature often use bleach and alcohol washes to remove contamination. We perform a controlled metabarcoding baseline study on a herbivorous, xylem-feeding insect, the Meadow Spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius), using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, and identify possible contamination that persists after washes. Despite the reported success of methods in the literature, we find that contamination is still present, leading to possible false-positive results. We hypothesise that pollen is the main source of contamination, its robust nature making it difficult to remove, and conduct a further three experiments with the goal of removing pollen from the surface of Philaenus spumarius. This study investigates the effectiveness of robust bleach/Tween/alcohol washes, sterile gut excision (including combined with Distel application), and ultraviolet light as alternative sterilisation approaches. Overall, our findings indicate that we are unable to remove surface contamination and still detect signals that may originate in the gut. In no experiment did we unequivocally detect plant DNA that originated in the P. spumarius gut.

AB  - Specialist and generalist insect herbivores evolved different strategies to process host-plant metabolites. We explored frass composition in Laothoe populi (L.) caterpillars (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae), a specialist moth species that is closely associated with plants of the Salicaceae (Mirb.) family. We fed the caterpillars with leaves from three willow species (Salix caprea L., S. purpurea L. and S. viminalis L.), one willow hybrid (S. x rubens Schrank) and one poplar species (Populus tremula L.). Using untargeted metabolomics, we compared the chemical composition and variation among leaf and frass samples. We quantified the chemical variation using either a simple index based on the presence and concentration of metabolites (i.e., Bray-Curtis) or an index that additionally accounts for chemical structural-compositional similarity (CSCS) among metabolites. Due to the high degree of dietary specialisation, we expected low host-specific variation in frass composition among the caterpillars. Based on literature, we further hypothesised that ingested salicinoids will be largely modified in the caterpillar gut while flavonoids will be often passively excreted. Finally, we compared chemical variation among the samples when quantified with Bray-Curtis or CSCS metrics. As expected, we found relatively low host-specific variation in the chemical composition of caterpillar frass. Our results further suggest that flavonoids were largely passively excreted by the caterpillars, while salicinoids were metabolised in the gut. Finally, we found that chemical composition measures based on Bray-Curtis overestimated the differences in chemical composition between frass and leaves, suggesting that for these type of samples CSCS measures are better suited to reflect metabolic changes more realistically.
   We studied the metabolism of caterpillars of the poplar hawk-moth (Laothoe populi L.)-a specialist insect herbivore-on different host plants. Caterpillars feeding on the same host plant unveiled small chemical variation in their frass profiles. Ingested flavonoids were most widely passively excreted by the caterpillars, whereas salicinoids were actively metabolised. image

AB  - The Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is a key pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill (Fabaceae), and recently became an economically important pest of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae), in Brazil. This stink bug has two allopatric strains, one prevalent in southern Brazil (SS), and another in the north (NS). The two strains hybridize in central Brazil. Knowledge of host preferences and host suitability of these strains may clarify the contribution of the various gene pools to contemporary adaptive features such as the ability to harm cotton crops. We tested the attraction of the E. heros strains and reciprocal hybrids - female N x male S (HNS) and female S x male N (HSN) - to soybean and cotton leaves and reproductive structures, and evaluated the nymph development and survivorship of the two strains and reciprocal hybrids fed on soybean or cotton. We conducted host-choice experiments with fourth instars and adult females and evaluated the survival of immatures on soybean and cotton plants under laboratory conditions. The SS strain preferred soybean over cotton. Hybrid and NS strains chose randomly between soybean and cotton plants. All strains developed on soybean, with similar survival rates. On cotton, pure strains did not reach adulthood; however, hybrids developed on cotton but with a survival rate of <1%. Our results showed that the SS strain of E. heros was more attracted to soybeans, and NS and hybrid strains had a polyphagous choice behavior, suggesting that current host selection has been mediated by historical and, mainly, contemporary relationships of E. heros strains with these hosts.

AB  - In vitro culture and expansion of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is an essential prerequisite to enhancing livestock productivity through SSC transplantation. Most of the culture media have been observed to be supplemented with serum. However, the use of serum in culture media may exert detrimental effects on SSC maintenance in vitro. An attempt was made to culture SSCs by replacing serum with 5% 'Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR)' in Doom pig (Sus domesticus), one of the valued indigenous germplasm of North-East India. Testes from 7 to 15 days old piglets were used for isolation, enrichment and in vitro culture of putative SSCs using serum-based and serum-free culture media. The cells were characterized for SSC-specific pluripotent markers expression by immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time PCR. The diameter and number of SSC colonies were recorded on days 9, 20 and 30 of culture. Similar morphologies of the SSC colonies were observed in both serum-based and serum-free culture conditions. Colony diameter and colony number were non-significantly higher in serum-free than serum-based media. The cells from both the culture conditions showed high alkaline phosphatase activity. The expression of SSC-specific pluripotent markers was observed in immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time PCR study. The present study revealed that SSCs from porcine species could be maintained in vitro for up to 30 days in serum-free culture using 5% KSR, which is believed to be a promising protein source for improving livestock production, and health care along with their conservation.

AB  - As the development and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) steadily increase, new risk assessment methods that reflect domestic natural ecosystems are being developed. Although LM plants are fundamentally necessary for environmental risk assessment, the introduced gene products and LMO proteins can replace transgenic plants. However, their use is problematic because of instability and indirect assessment data issues. This study proposes a risk assessment tool and scheme for introducing LMO proteins into genetically modified crops. The agroinfiltration method for transient LMO gene expression in plants is a practical tool which can be used to rapidly verify the putative risks of LMO proteins against insects using an LM crop mimic plant with a stably expressed LMO protein. This study used Nicotiana tabacum leaves, which transiently but stably expressed the insecticidal LMO protein Vip3Aa, for LMO risk assessments against Spodoptera litura. The Vip3Aa protein was stably expressed for 5 d in the agroinfiltrated plants, and the protein was active against target insects for environmental LMO risk assessments. In the toxicity evaluation of Vip3Aa-expressing plants against S. litura, the number of deaths was higher in the Vip3Aa-infiltrated N. tabacum-fed group than that in the recombinant Vip3Aa-fed group. In addition, the cumulative number of deaths in the infiltration leaf-fed group was approximately 12-fold higher than that in the protein-fed group under low dosage conditions. This study aimed to develop a transient expression model which can be used to evaluate whether the overall risk of LMO protein is acceptable for use. These results support the usefulness of the transient expression model using an agroinfiltration method as a rapid risk validation tool for LMO proteins against herbivorous insects before producing transgenic plants.

AB  - Simple Summary For 24 years, we studied the interaction of the endemic Balearic lizard Podarcis lilfordi) and the dead horse arum (Helicodiceros muscivorus) on Aire Island, a small coastal islet of the Balearic Archipelago (Spain). From a small initial plant population, the frugivorous activity of lizards apparently resulted in an extraordinary increase in plant abundance over the entirety of Aire Island. The intensity of seed dispersal by lizards was higher in years with lower rainfall and, consequently, with lower availability of other food resources. Thus, the fruits of the dead horse arum were an alternative food strongly exploited during years of food shortage. During the last 24 years, the mutualistic interaction between the dead horse arum, Helicodiceros muscivorus, and the Balearic lizard, Podarcis lilfordi, was studied on Aire Island (Balearic Islands, Spain). From a small population of a hundred plants, the dead horse arum expanded extraordinarily throughout the island, reaching the highest known densities of the species and occupying areas of the island where it was not previously present. The current abundance of plants is a direct effect of the frugivorous activity of the Balearic lizard, which is the main, if not the only, effective seed disperser of the plant on Aire Island. However, abiotic factors predominated over biotic factors in driving abundance of plants. Over the years, plant densities varied significantly depending on the aridity of the island, with higher densities recorded in drier years. Lizards' frugivorous activity and dispersal intensity was inversely correlated with annual rainfall. We found higher dispersal intensity in years with lower rainfall. We propose that the years of lower rainfall are those in which there is a lower prey availability. In such years, lizards compensate the shortage of other trophic resources with a more intense consumption of dead horse arum fruits. The mutualistic interaction is therefore asymmetric, since there is a greater influence of the frugivorous activity of the lizards on the plants than of the plants on lizards. It is, in short, a system chronically out of balance.

AB  - The neuroendocrine protein 7B2 plays a crucial role in the maturation and activity regulation of prohormone convertase 2 (PC2). To elucidate the relationship between 7B2 and PC2 expression in endocrine tissues, we generated synthetic peptide antibodies in guinea pigs. The antigenic peptide sequences were selected to correspond to three different positions in the rat amino acid (aa) sequence: The N-terminal aa 1-14 is situated immediately following the signal sequence, the middle aa 77-90 contains a part of the proPC2 activation domain, and the C-terminal aa 156-168 functions to suppress PC2 activity. These antibodies demonstrated specific reactivity across a diverse array of animal species. The reactivity of these antibodies differed, suggesting that the molecular form of 7B2 differs depending on the endocrine cell, and a different expression pattern was demonstrated in rat and dog pituitary intermediate cells. The colocalization of 7B2 and PC2 in prolactin (PRL) granules in rat pituitary mammotrophs supports the interaction between these proteins. However, the expression intensities of these proteins did not correspond, and epitope-related disparities were detected. These results may be indicative of alterations in the molecular state associated with the dynamics of the interaction between 7B2 and PC2:

AB  - Epidemiologic studies have indicated that chronic hypertension may facilitate the progression of abnormal behavior, such as emotional irritability, hyperactivity, and attention impairment. However, the mechanism of how chronic hypertension affects the brain and neuronal function remains unclear. In this study, 58-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats were used. Their locomotor activity and neuronal function were assessed by the open field test, novel object, and Y maze recognition test. Moreover brain tissues were analyzed. We found that the aged SHR exhibited significant locomotor hyperactivity when compared to the WKY rats. However, there was no significant difference in novel object and novel arm recognition between aged SHR and the WKY rats. In the analysis of synaptic membrane protein, the expression of glutamatergic receptors, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor receptors subunits 2B (GluN2B) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor 1 (GluA1) in the hippocampus of SHR were significantly higher than those of WKY rats. In addition, in the synaptic membrane of SHR's hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a down-regulation of astrocytes was found, though the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) remained constant. Moreover, a down-regulation of microglia in the hippocampus and mPFC was seen in the SHR brain. Long-term exposure to high blood pressure causes upregulation of glutamate receptors. The upregulation of glutamatergic receptors in hippocampus may contribute to the hyper-locomotor activity of aged rodents and may as a therapeutic target in hypertension-induced irritability and hyperactivity.

AB  - Simple Summary A novel type of protease with high stability, high resistance to acid and a wider range of enzyme cutting sites has been developed recently. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the novel protease in weaned piglets. Our results indicate that dietary protease supplementation promotes nutrient absorption, improves small intestine morphology and enhances digestive enzyme activities of weaned piglets. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different protease levels on performance, diarrhea rate, nutrient digestibility, blood metabolites, digestive enzyme activities, and intestinal health of weaned piglets. A total of 96 weaned piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, 28 d of age, initial average BW = 6.55 +/- 0.17 kg) were divided into four groups (4 pigs/pen and 6 replicates/group) according to a completely random block design. Piglets were fed different levels of protease (0, 150, 300 or 600 mg/kg of diet) for 28 d. The results showed that the addition of protease had no significant effect on the growth performance of weaned piglets (p > 0.05), and the addition of 300 mg/kg protease significantly increased the apparent total intestinal digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of amino acids in weaned piglets (p < 0.05), while the addition of 150 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg protease had no significant effect on the digestibility (p > 0.05). The nutrient digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and total energy (GE) showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with increasing protease concentration (p < 0.05). Adding 300 and 600 mg/kg protease significantly decreased serum ALB/GLO levels (p < 0.05) and duodenal pH (p < 0.05) and increased duodenal villus height (p < 0.05). The addition of protease significantly increased jejunal trypsin and chymotrypsin activities (p < 0.01) and duodenal and jejunal mucosal tight junction proteins in piglets. The mRNA expression levels of ZO-1 and CLAUDIN-1 in the duodenum together with ZO-1 and OCCLUDIN in the jejunum of piglets in the 300 and 600 mg/kg protease supplementation groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The results showed that, compared with the control group, protease could promote nutrient absorption, improve small intestine morphology and enhance digestive enzyme activity in weaned piglets. The suitable addition amount was 150-300 mg/kg in the present study.

AB  - Physical exercise protects against cognitive impairment caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). However, the mechanisms through which exercise sends signals from the periphery to the central nervous system remain incompletely understood. This study demonstrated that exercise promotes the secretion of muscle-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which facilitate interorgan communication between the muscle and the brain. Systematic delivery of muscle-derived sEVs enhances synaptic plasticity and alleviated cognitive impairment in CCH. Notably, miRNA sequencing reveal miR-17/20a-5p as key cargos in sEVs involved in the exercise-induced muscle-brain crosstalk. Muscle-derived sEVs are also identified as the primary source of swimming-induced miR-17/20a-5p in circulating sEVs. Mechanistically, miR-17/20a-5p binds to the DEP-domain containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) and activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in the hippocampus. Depletion of miR-17/20a-5p from muscle-derived sEVs impairs the exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Moreover, overexpression of DEPTOR in the hippocampus attenuates the cognitive benefits of exercise. Conversely, hippocampus-specific activation of mTOR reverses these effects, highlighting the crucial role of mTOR in mediating the positive effects of exercise. Collectively, these findings identify miR-17/20a-5p in muscle-derived sEVs as the exercise-induced myokine with potent effects on the brain, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of exercise in managing cognitive impairment.

AB  - Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) produce extracellular matrixes (ECMs), such as collagen and fibronectin, in response to stimulation with transforming growth factor ll (TGFll). The massive ECM accumulation in the liver due to HSCs causes fibrosis which eventually leads to hepatic cirrhosis and hepatoma development. However, details of the mechanisms underlying continuous HSC activation are as yet poorly understood. We thus attempted to elucidate the role of Pin1, one of the prolyl isomerases, in the underlying mechanism(s), using the human HSC line LX-2. Treatment with Pin1 siRNAs markedly alleviated the TGFll-induced expressions of ECM components such as collagen 1a1/2, smooth muscle actin and fibronectin at both the mRNA and the protein level. Pin1 inhibitors also decreased the expressions of fibrotic markers.In addition, it was revealed that Pin1 associates with Smad2/3/4, and that four Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in the linker domain of Smad3 are essential for binding with Pin1. Pin1 significantly regulated Smad-binding element transcriptional activity without affecting Smad3 phosphorylations or translocation.Importantly, both Yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator (TAZ) also participate in ECM induction, and upregulate Smad3 activity rather than TEA domain transcriptional factor transcriptional activity. Although Smad3 interacts with both TAZ and YAP, Pin1 facilitates the Smad3 association with TAZ, but not that with YAP.In conclusion, Pin1 plays pivotal roles in ECM component productions in HSCs through regulation of the interaction between TAZ and Smad3, and Pin1 inhibitors may have the potential to ameliorate fibrotic diseases.

AB  - Jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in the indirect plant-mediated interactions Bioassays showed that the total number of eggs laid by S. exigua on rose twigs decreased significantly after the twigs were treated with exogenous JA. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that the volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) from roses, including alkanes, terpenes, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and esters, were significantly changed following treatment with JA. Based on gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and GC-MS analysis, the electrophysiological responses of S. exigua moths could be elicited by 8 compounds from the JA-induced roses, including 3-carene, 1-dodecanol, methyl stearate, 1-tetradecanol, hexadecane, eucalyptol, b-myrcene, and 1-iodododecane. Among these chemicals, the first 6 exhibited significant repellent activity to ovipositional behaviors of the gravid moths, while the latter 2 were attractive. The inhibition index of methyl stearate at a concentration of 15 mg/ml reached 65.12%. On the other hand, the quantity of the first 6 chemicals increased significantly and the latter two decreased due to the JA induction. These results reveal a new mechanism for resistance in rose plants against S. exigua. After JA induction, the rose plants appear to up-regulate the biosynthesis of the chemicals with repellent activities against S. exigua and, in the meantime, down-regulate the attractant chemicals.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Subterranean termite colonies can be eliminated using baiting systems. However, for a given bait to be effective, the active ingredient must be lethal at concentrations that are also palatable to termites. The insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), has potential for use in termite baits, but its palatability to termites has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to determine what concentrations of 20E, if any, cause termite workers to feed less readily. To test this, paper disks were treated with various concentrations of 20E. Groups of 1000 termites of three different species; the Formosan, the Asian and the Eastern subterranean termite; were placed in arenas. The termites had the option of following a path to feed on either a paper disk containing the 20E, or an untreated disk, and the amount of paper consumed was then compared. The results showed that the Asian subterranean termite had the least tolerance for the 20E, the Formosan subterranean termite had a reduced tolerance, and the presence of the 20E had no impact on the Eastern subterranean termite.
   Effective active ingredients in toxicant bait formulations must be non-deterrent to insect feeding behavior at lethal concentrations. This study evaluated feeding deterrence for Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, C. gestroi (Wasmann), and Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) when provided access to cellulose impregnated with various concentrations of the insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Termites were exposed to 20E concentrations of 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm and to noviflumuron at 5000 ppm in a 24 h choice-test, and the mass of substrate consumption from treated and untreated media pads was compared for each treatment. 20E feeding deterrence was detected at 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm for C. gestroi, and at 2000 ppm for C. formosanus. No significant differences in consumption of treated and untreated substrate was detected at any concentration for R. flavipes. Potential methods for reducing deterrence are discussed.

AB  - Selective neuronal vulnerability (SNV) of specific neuroanatomical regions such as frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (HC) is characteristic of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), although its patho-genetic basis remains unresolved. We hypothesized that physiological differences in mitochondrial function in neuroanatomical regions could contribute to SNV. To investigate this, we evaluated mitochondrial function in human brains (age range:1-90 y) in FC, striatum (ST), HC, cerebellum (CB) and medulla oblongata (MD), using enzyme assays and quantitative proteomics. Striking differences were noted in resistant regions-MD and CB compared to the vulnerable regions-FC, HC and ST. At younger age (25 +/- 5 y), higher activity of electron transport chain enzymes and upregulation of metabolic and antioxidant proteins were noted in MD compared to FC and HC, that was sustained with increasing age (>= 65 y). In contrast, the expression of synaptic proteins was higher in FC, HC and ST (vs. MD). In line with this, quantitative phospho-proteomics revealed activation of upstream regulators (ERS, PPAR alpha) of mitochondrial metabolism and inhibition of synaptic pathways in MD. Microtubule Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) showed overexpression in FC, HC and ST both in young and older age (vs. MD). MAPT hyperphosphorylation and the activation of its kinases were noted in FC and HC with age. Our study demonstrates that regional heterogeneity in mitochondrial and other cellular functions contribute to SNV and protect regions such as MD, while rendering FC and HC vulnerable to NDDs. The findings also support the "last in, first out" hypothesis of ageing, wherein regions such as FC, that are the most recent to develop phylogenetically and ontogenetically, are the first to be affected in ageing and NDDs.

AB  - Broadband near-infrared (NIR) phosphors have received increasing attention for fabricating NIR light sources. In this article, based on our predictions of heavy Mn-doped models obtained using DFT calculations, we successfully synthesize and characterize manganese-based magnetoplumbite-type La(Zn,Mn)Al11O19 phosphors, which crystallize into a hexagonal structure with space-group P6(3)/mmc. Under excitation at 450 nm, it was found that LaZn0.7Mn0.3Al11O19 and LaZn0.2Mn0.8Al11O19 had the optimal emission intensity and the maximum quantum efficiencies were 99% and 55%, respectively. An anomalous near-infrared (NIR) emission band at similar to 730 nm is observed for the LaZnAl11O19 host with heavy Mn2+ doping. The density functional theory calculations and transient and steady-state luminescence investigation suggest that this unusual NIR emission band comes from the Mn2+-Mn2+ dimers. Moreover, the as-prepared phosphor, being integrated into high-powered photonic devices, could operate at high temperature without degeneration, due to the great advantage of the phosphor-in-glass (PiG) approach. Consequently, our study not only develops a viable strategy for synthesising innovative NIR phosphors, but also sheds light on the development of high-power photonic devices and procedures.

AB  - Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are invaluable tools in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line, and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adeno-associated viral (AAV) transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca2+ microwaves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7, or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer in a titre-dependent fashion. Ca2+ microwaves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 wk after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 wk. The phenomenon was robust and observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ microwaves depend on the promoter and viral titre of the GECI, density of expression, as well as the targeted brain region. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artefact. The results show that commonly used Ca2+-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca2+ responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca2+ microwaves, and we provide a potential solution.

AB  - The presence of mammals in the Ma & iacute;z Gordo Formation (late Paleocene-early Eocene), Salta Province (Argentina) has been restricted with doubts to a single specimen, which stratigraphic origin is also uncertain, assigned to the basal notoungulate Simpsonotus. Here, we report the first confidently stratigraphically controlled mammalian fossil from this unit, collected from its uppermost levels dated at 56 Ma (Thanetian-Ypresian boundary). The specimen IBIGEO-P 143 is a poorly preserved left maxillary fragment with M2-3 that constitutes a new notoungulate, Maizotemnus archaeios gen. nov. sp. nov., and it represents the first South American mammal record confidently contemporaneous with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. According to the cladistic study, M. archaeios gen. nov. sp. nov. is closely related to the three middle Eocene 'isotemnids': both species of Pampatemnus (Pa. deuteros and Pa. infernalis) from Northwestern Argentina and Anisotemnus distentus from Argentine Patagonia, though no direct sister taxon was identified. The discovery of M. archaeios gen. nov. sp. nov. increases the diversity of basal toxodontians, expands the known geographic and stratigraphic distributions of Toxodontia, and represents (based on dates) the oldest record for this suborder.

AB  - Despite recent advances in technique of spermatozoa cryopreservation, there are still ejaculates present that fail to meet strict quality standard; mainly due to detrimental effect of imbalance of free radicals. The omnipresence of dead/defective spermatozoa in ejaculates of eutherian species is a major source of excessive free radicals. Though sperm-selection techniques, as well as addition of antioxidants addressed the problem to a certain extent, the major source of free radicals in the semen remained, causing much damage. This study attempts to remove dead/damaged spermatozoa using negative fertility-marker. The effect is unraveled by Hypo -osmotic (HOS), and fluorescein-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin (FITC-PSA) assay, further confirmed by Ca2+-regulating mechanisms and depolarization of sperm membrane potential, reduction in concentration of free radicals and finally by in vitro fertility assay. The study involved functionalization of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) with silane followed by bio-conjugation with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. The nano-purification of semen using anti-ubiquitin conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) (antibody concentrations 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mu g/ml) was attempted. The efficiency of nano-purification was 18.1%-43.8% in the study. The results revealed greater (P <= 0.05) spermatozoa population with intact plasma membrane, acrosome integrity, high mitochondrial membrane potential and pattern-F (least intracellular Ca2+), evidence of low lipid peroxidation and higher total antioxidant capacity in nano-purified groups. More number of spermatozoa were bound to zona pellucida of matured oocytes from nano-depleted than non-depleted group. The findings demonstrate antibody concentration of 1.0 mu g/ml bio-conjugated with IONPs as most efficient in enriching the ejaculate with functional spermatozoa with the highest percentage of zona binding.

AB  - Circadian rhythm disorder (CRD) in space flight can lead to memory impairment, performance decrements and adverse health outcomes, the main manifestations of which are circadian desynchronization, sleep loss and insomnia. Sleep deprivation (SD) provide the means to evaluate these effects and the risks associated with CRD on ground. Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB) has beneficial effects on the treatment of sleep disturbances and memory loss. Fresh GEB (FG), an unprocessed raw tuber of GEB, has been used as functional health food in Asian countries for a long time. However, the research report of FG to ameliorate memory impairment caused by insomnia or lack of sleep is meager. In this study, ICR male mice were sleep-deprived continuously and water extract of FG (WFG) was orally administrated (3 and 9 g/kg/d, i.g) during the SD process lasted for 25 days, except control and model groups gavage administration with water, positive control group with modafinil (MOD, 0.1 g/kg/d, i.g). We studied the effect of WFG on CRD-induced learning and memory impairment using a set of behavioral analyses including the object location recognition test (OLRT), novel object recognition test (NORT), and the passive avoidance test (PAT). In addition, oxidative stress parameters were assessed by measuring the malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) reactivity in serum and hippocampus. Our results revealed that SD decreased discrimination index (DI) in OLRT and NORT, with shorter latency into the dark chamber in PAT. Both WFG and MOD treatment can reverse these changes (P < 0.05). We concluded that WFG treatment improve CRD-induced learning and memory impairment and oxidative stress damage which makes FG a promising candidate as herbal health product of memory decline in CRD.

AB  - Introduction: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent molecules of great interest in the field of regenerative biology since several animal models require their production to promote and favor tissue, organ, and appendage regeneration. Recently, it has been shown that the production of ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is required for tail regeneration in Ambystoma mexicanum. However, to date, it is unknown whether ROS production is necessary for limb regeneration in this animal model. Methods: forelimbs of juvenile animals were amputated proximally and the dynamics of ROS production was determined using 2 & PRIME;7- dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) during the regeneration process. Inhibition of ROS production was performed using the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Subsequently, a rescue assay was performed using exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The effect of these treatments on the size and skeletal structures of the regenerated limb was evaluated by staining with alcian blue and alizarin red, as well as the effect on blastema formation, cell proliferation, immune cell recruitment, and expression of genes related to proximal-distal identity. Results: our results show that inhibition of post-amputation limb ROS production in the A. mexicanum salamander model results in the regeneration of a miniature limb with a significant reduction in the size of skeletal elements such as the ulna, radius, and overall autopod. Additionally, other effects such as decrease in the number of carpals, defective joint morphology, and failure of integrity between the regenerated structure and the remaining tissue were identified. In addition, this treatment affected blastema formation and induced a reduction in the levels of cell proliferation in this structure, as well as a reduction in the number of CD45(+) and CD11b + immune system cells. On the other hand, blocking ROS production affected the expression of proximo-distal identity genes such as Aldha1a1, Rar beta, Prod1, Meis1, Hoxa13, and other genes such as Agr2 and Yap1 in early/mid blastema. Of great interest, the failure in blastema formation, skeletal alterations, as well as the expression of the genes evaluated were rescued by the application of exogenous H2O2, suggesting that ROS/H2O2 production is necessary from the early stages for proper regeneration and patterning of the limb.

AB  - Background: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common sensory deficit worldwide. Current solutions for SNHL, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and hearing assistive devices, do not provide consistent results and fail to address the underlying pathology of hair cell and ganglion cell damage. Stem cell therapy is a cornerstone in regenerative medicine. It provides new hope to treat SNHL by replacing/regenerating damaged hair cells and ganglion cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are an interesting choice in stem cell therapy. Aim of the work: Evaluation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation to improve SNHL management. Methods: An experimental study was conducted using 40 recipient guinea pigs, randomly divided into four groups, along with 4 donor guinea pigs for bone marrow harvesting to isolate BM-MSC. Group I (12 animals) served as the control, receiving neither ototoxic drugs nor stem cell treatment. Group II (12 animals) received intraperitoneal cisplatin (1.5 mg/kg/day for 8 days) to induce sensorineural hearing loss, but no stem cell treatment. Group III (12 animals) received IP cisplatin to induce SNHL, followed by BM-MSC transplantation via round window injection one week later. Groups I, II, and III were euthanized 5 weeks after the last cisplatin injection, and their cochleae were examined using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescent light microscopy to assess the effect of stem cell transplantation on the recovery of neurosensory tissue in the cochlea after cisplatin treatment. Group IV (4 animals) received IP cisplatin to induce SNHL, followed by transplantation of fluorescein-labeled BM-MSC (FLBM-MSC) via round window injection one week later and were euthanized after one week to study stem cell migration and homing. Results: Light Microscopy: Group I exhibited a normal structure in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis. In contrast, Group II demonstrated degeneration in these areas. Group III showed a preserved structure in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis, with statistically significant differences compared to Group II (p < .05). Scanning Electron Microscopy: Group I displayed normal ultrastructure of the organ of Corti, while Group II showed a loss of outer hair cells. Group III demonstrated preserved ultrastructure of the organ of Corti. Fluorescent Light Microscopy: In Group IV, transplanted cells were observed to home into the cochlear lateral wall, organ of Corti, and spiral ganglion. Conclusion: The study showed that BM-MSCs, delivered via round window injection, can migrate to cochlear regions and protect key structures after cisplatin-induced SNHL in guinea pigs, suggesting their potential as a treatment for SNHL.

AB  - The amygdala has been implicated in frustrative nonreward induced by unexpected reward downshifts, using paradigms like consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC). However, existing evidence comes from experiments involving the central and basolateral nuclei on a broad level. Moreover, whether the amygdala's involvement in reward downshift requires a cSNC effect (i.e., greater suppression in downshifted animals than in unshifted controls) or just consummatory suppression without a cSNC effect, remains unclear. Three groups were exposed to (1) a large reward disparity leading to a cSNC effect (32-to-2% sucrose), (2) a small reward disparity involving consummatory suppression in the absence of a cSNC effect (8-to-2% sucrose), and (3) an unshifted control (2% sucrose). Brains obtained after the first reward downshift session were processed for c-Fos expression, a protein often used as a marker for neural activation. c-Fos-positive cells were counted in the anterior, medial, and posterior portions (A/P axis) of ten regions of the rat basolateral, central, and medial amygdala. cFos expression was higher in 32-to-2% sucrose downshift animals than in the other two groups in four regions: the anterior and the medial lateral basal amygdala, the medial capsular central amygdala, and the anterior anterio-ventral medial amygdala. None of the areas exhibited differential c-Fos expression between the 8-to-2% sucrose downshift and the unshifted conditions. Thus, amygdala activation requires exposure to a substantial reward disparity. This approach has identified, for the first time, specific amygdala areas relevant to understand the cSNC effect, suggesting follow-up experiments aimed at testing the function of these regions in reward downshift.

AB  - Objective In recent years, the negative impact of microgravity on astronauts ' nervous systems has received widespread attention. The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology has shown significant positive effects in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The potential benefits of combined frequency stimulation (CFS) which combines different frequency stimulation patterns in ameliorating neurological dysfunctions induced by the microgravity environment, still require in-depth investigation. Exploring the therapeutic effects and electrophysiological mechanisms of CFS in improving various neurological disorders caused by microgravity holds significant importance for neuroscience and the clinical application of magnetic stimulation. Methods This study employed 40 C57BL/6 mice, randomly divided into 5 groups: sham group, hindlimb unloading (HU) group, 10 Hz group, 20 Hz group, and combined frequency stimulation (10 Hz+20 Hz, CFS) group. Mice in all groups except the sham group received 14 d of simulated microgravity conditions along with 14 d of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The effects of CFS on negative emotions and spatial cognitive abilities were assessed through sucrose preference tests and water maze experiments. Finally, patch- clamp techniques were used to record action potentials, resting membrane potentials, and ion channel dynamics of granule neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region. Results Compared to the single-frequency stimulation group, behavioral results indicated that the combined frequency stimulation (10 Hz+20 Hz) significantly improved cognitive impairments and negative emotions in simulated microgravity mice. Electrophysiological experiments revealed a decrease in excitability of granule neurons in the hippocampal DG region after HU manipulation, whereas the combined frequency stimulation notably enhanced neuronal excitability and improved the dynamic characteristics of voltage-gated Na (+) and K (+) channels. Conclusion The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with combined frequencies (10 Hz+20 Hz) effectively ameliorates cognitive impairments and negative emotions in simulated microgravity mice. This improvement is likely attributed to the influence of combined frequency stimulation on neuronal excitability and the dynamic characteristics of Na + and K (+) channels. Consequently, this study holds the promise to provide a theoretical basis for alleviating cognitive and emotional disorders induced by microgravity environments.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have shown that low doses of lithium in the environment can have beneficial effects on mental health. Autism spectrum disorder, a neurodevelopmental disorder in which patients exhibit abnormal behaviors, pharmacological interventions usually relied on a range of psychotropic medications. However, such medications often produce severe side effects or are ineffective in symptoms. Finding alternative ways to improve abnormal behaviors in individuals with autism are warranted, in which case lithium may be a relatively safe and effective medication. Lithium salt therapy is used to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and has neu-roprotective effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of different doses of lithium on neurobehavioural disorders using the rat model of autism established by valproic acid (VPA) injection. Lithium was observed to have an ameliorative effect on the social cognitive, social memory and anxiety levels in the rat model of autism. Immunofluorescence staining showed that subchronic LiCl administration (1.0 mmol/kg) significantly reduced the number of Iba-1 positive cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in VPA group and brought it close to the levels of control group. Significantly lower levels of the pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 were observed in the hippocampus and serum after lithium treatment. In addition, the lithium treatment increased the levels of H3K9 acetylation in the hippocampus of VPA-exposed rats. The results showed a defensive effect of environment -related lithium exposure doses on neurobehavioural deficits in the rat valproic acid model of autism, suggest-ing that it may be a potential drug for the treatment of autism.

AB  - Exposure of the fetal testis to numerous individual environmental chemicals (ECs) is frequently associated with dysregulated development, leading to impaired adult reproductive competence. However, 'real-life' exposure involves complex mixtures of ECs. Here we test the consequences, for the male fetus, of exposing pregnant ewes to EC mixtures derived from pastures treated with biosolids fertiliser (processed human sewage). Fetal testes from continuously exposed ewes were either unaffected at day 80 or exhibited a reduced area of testis immunostained for CYP17A1 protein at day 140. Fetal testes from day 140 pregnant ewes that were exposed transiently for 80-day periods during early (0-80 days), mid (30-110 days), or late (60-140 days) pregnancy had fewer Sertoli cells and reduced testicular area stained for CYP17A1. Male fetuses from ewes exposed during late pregnancy also exhibited reduced fetal body, adrenal and testis mass, anogenital distance, and lowered testosterone; collectively indicative of an anti-androgenic effect. Exposure limited to early gestation induced more testis transcriptome changes than observed for continuously exposed day 140 fetuses. These data suggest that a short period of EC exposure does not allow sufficient time for the testis to adapt. Consequently, testicular transcriptomic changes induced during the first 80 days of gestation may equate with phenotypic effects observed at day 140. In contrast, relatively fewer changes in the testis transcriptome in fetuses exposed continuously to ECs throughout gestation are associated with less severe consequences. Unless corrected by or during puberty, these differential effects would predictably have adverse outcomes for adult testicular function and fertility.

AB  - Mass mortality of the dominant coral reef herbivore Diadema antillarum in the Caribbean in the early 1980s contributed to a persistent phase shift from coral- to algal-dominated reefs. In 2022, a scuticociliate most closely related to Philaster apodigitiformis caused further mass mortality of D. antillarum across the Caribbean, leading to >95% mortality at affected sites. Mortality was also reported in the related species Diadema setosum in the Mediterranean in 2022, though the causative agent of the Mediterranean outbreak has not yet been determined. In April 2023, mass mortality of Diadema setosum occurred along the Sultanate of Oman's coastline. Urchins displayed signs compatible with scuticociliatosis including abnormal behavior, drooping and loss of spines, followed by tissue necrosis and death. Here we report the detection of an 18S rRNA gene sequence in abnormal urchins from Muscat, Oman, that is identical to the Philaster strain responsible for D. antillarum mass mortality in the Caribbean. We also show that scuticociliatosis signs can be elicited in Diadema setosum by experimental challenge with the cultivated Philaster strain associated with Caribbean scuticociliatosis. These results demonstrate the Philaster sp. associated with D. antillarum mass mortality has rapidly spread to geographically distant coral reefs, compelling global-scale awareness and monitoring for this devastating condition through field surveys, microscopy, and molecular microbiological approaches, and prompting investigation of long-range transmission mechanisms.

AB  - We investigated the diet and trophic niche of Kerodon rupestris in Northeastern Brazil for 12 months. The influence of precipitation was evaluated by simple logistic regression. This rodent consumed 23 plant species, mainly the leaves, resulting a low niche breadth. This species presented a greater consumption of leaves of Bauhinia cheilantha, influenced by low rainfall, and fallen flowers of Cenostigma pyramidale, influenced by high precipitation. This rodent showed plasticity in its diet and used different plant resources that provided its survival in semiarid.

AB  - The jaw muscle architecture is crucial for understanding how muscle morphology influences diet and feeding behavior in birds, yet ontogenetic scaling patterns and their characteristics in herbivorous species remain understudied. This study examines the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and fiber length of the jaw muscles in Rhea americana, an herbivorous bird whose chicks are insectivorous during early stages. The main jaw muscles of 19 Rhea americana specimens across four ontogenetic stages were analyzed, including the depressor mandibulae (a jaw depressor) and the adductor mandibulae externus, pseudotemporalis, and pterygoideus lateralis (primarily jaw adductors). Both architectural parameters showed a negative allometric scaling and only significant differences in PCSA were found between immature ages and between these and adulthood in certain adductor muscles. These variations suggest increasing force demands in adductor muscles as chicks transition from an insectivorous to an herbivorous diet. The lower PCSA in early-staged chicks reflects the reduced force required for insectivory, while the increasing PCSA with age enables force generation needed for detaching plants in adults. In comparison to other avian diets, the herbivory of greater rhea seems to be linked to a lower force-generating capacity in the adductor muscle group. This study contributes to expanding the knowledge on avian jaw musculature by exploring postnatal ontogenetic changes and their potential relationship with dietary shifts while providing morphological data that can serve as a comparative basis for understanding the link between diet and morphology in birds.

AB  - With the increasing population, food waste, sewage sludge, and poultry litter management problem are scaling up even in low-income countries. The management of these wastes has therefore been challenging. Anaerobic digestion of food waste alone is not very stable due to its acidic nature and high degradability whereas sewage sludge and poultry litter have low biochemical methane potential and a high nitrogen concentration. Co-digestion of suitably selected substrate leads to enhanced biogas production potential, system stability due to synergetic effects, and resolving the problem of waste management in the vicinity in a holistic approach. However, these wastes have varying characteristics and composition, in terms of carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio, pH, and alkalinity. In addition, millions of the rural household bio-digesters operating in low-income countries are working under ambient conditions and are primarily unheated. Therefore, there is a need of research to assess the viability of biogas production of co-digestion of all above substrates in an optimal mixing ratio operating in an ambient temperature condition. In this study, food waste (FW), sewage sludge (SS), and poultry litter (PL) were co-digested at ratios (SS: PL: FW: 3:2:1, 2:1:1, 1:1:1) with 8% total solid (TS) content at ambient temperature in summer and winter seasons. Biogas yield was highest with mixing ratio of 2:1:1 with the values of 640 L/kgVS in summer while it gave extremely low biogas yield of 106 L/kgVS in winter. The 2:1:1 mixture also had the highest methane composition of nearly 65% as well as the highest VS removal efficiency of 60%, making it the most viable option for increasing biogas production. Mathematical modeling results using Gompertz model and first order model predicted well with R2 value ranging from 0.91 to 0.98, which upheld the experimentally obtained values. Findings from this study suggest that co-digestion substrates (SS:PL:FW) mixing ratio of 2:1:1 is an optimized ratio among the studied co-substrate ratio for enhanced biogas production. Furthermore, winter biogas yield is almost one sixth of summer biogas yield, which means use of temperature enhancement techniques to anaerobic digesters operating at ambient conditions would be essential to increase the biogas yield during winter.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acupressure bladder meridian (ABM) on anxiety in rats. Chronic stress was induced rats to establish rat anxiety model. Shuttle experiment and open field experiments of were used to measure behaviors. The levels of cytokines in serum and hippocampus of rats were detected. Brain neurotransmitters (dopamine, 5- hydroxy tryptamine, norepinephrine) were detected by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect MAPK and BDNF signal pathway in hippocampus of rats. ABM significantly improve behaviors, decreased cytokine levels in serum and hippocampus. ABM restored the changes of neurotransmitters and significantly decreased protein expressions of MAPK signal pathway and increased protein expressions of BDNF signal pathway in hippocampus of rats. The results shown that ABM significantly improved anxiety via inhibition of MAPK signal pathway and increased BDNF signal pathway.

AB  - Transplantation of Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells (NPCs) is a promising regenerative strategy to promote neural repair following injury and degeneration because of the ability of these cells to proliferate, migrate, and integrate with the host tissue. Precise in vitro control of NPC proliferation without compromising multipotency and differentiation ability is critical in stem cell maintenance. This idea was highlighted in recent clinical trials, where discrepancies in NPC culturing protocols produced inconsistent therapeutic benefits. Of note, cell density plays an important role in regulating the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and fate choice of stem cells. To determine the extent of variability produced by inconsistent culturing densities, the present study cultured human-induced pluripotent NPCs (hiPSC-NPCs) at either a low or high plating density. hiPSC-NPCs were then isolated for transcriptomic analysis or differentiation in vitro. Following sequencing analysis, genes involved in cell-cell contact-mediated pathways, including Hippo-signaling, NOTCH, and WNT were differentially expressed. Modulation of these pathways was highly associated with the regulation of pro-neuronal transcription factors, which were also upregulated in response to higher-density hiPSC-NPC culture. Moreover, higher plating density translated into a greater neuronal and less astrocytic differentiation in vitro. This study highlights the importance of precisely controlling culture conditions during the development of NPC transplantation therapies.

AB  - Chiroptera is the only mammalian order that has adapted to active flight, offering a unique platform to study ecomorphological adaptations. While bats exhibit a diverse diet, the focus of this study is on insectivorous bats, specifically four species: Myotis daubentonii, Nyctalus noctula, Plecotus austriacus and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. It is important to note that despite sharing an insectivorous diet, these species occupy different ecological niches, perform distinct feeding strategies and explore varied habitats to capture prey. Using 2-D geometric morphometrics, we analysed a sample of mandibles to identify differences in size and shape among these species. We also investigated ecogeographical variation within their overlapping distribution across continental Europe. Significant differences in both mandibular size and shape were found among the four species. Sexual dimorphism influenced only the mandibular shape of R. ferrumequinum. A latitudinal gradient in mandibular size was found solely in N. noctula, while longitude significantly explained shape variation in M. daubentonii. These findings suggest that even within the ecological guild of insectivorous bats, there exists a diverse range of morphological adaptations that allow these species to occupy distinct ecological niches.
   Insectivorous bats exhibit fascinating morphological adaptations linked to their diverse feeding habits. Our study, using 2D geometric morphometrics, investigated mandible variation among four species across Eurasia and North Africa. Sexual dimorphism in mandible size was observed in the common noctule and Daubenton's bat, with females being larger than males, and geographical factors such as latitude and longitude influenced the size and shape variations, respectively. A complex interplay of factors might be influencing this intriguing intraspecific morphological variation and more detailed ecological information is needed to assess this variation further. image

AB  - Agronomic management and application of growth regulators mitigated the negative effects of water deficit and improved seed oil yield and other traits in camelina. This study assessed the effects of salicylic acid (SA) foliar application and soil application of superabsorbent polymer hydrogel (SPH) on the growth and antioxidant production of camelina (Camelina sativa L.) in 50% and 75% field capacity (FC) groups, as well as in a well-watered treatment. Application of SA and SPH significantly increased camelina yield and its components in 75% FC and well-watered treatments. In the control (no SA or SPH), water deficit reduced seed oil by 13% and 35% in 75% FC and 50% FC, respectively. Application of SA and SPH increased seed oil by 5% and 11%, respectively. Photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and chlorophyll content decreased in the 75% FC and 50% FC treatments. Application of SA and SPH increased in A (26% and 19%) and g(s) (17% and 12%) compared to the control. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidases (POD), catalases (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity increased with increased drought stress. The activity of these enzymes increased when SA was applied. Generally, foliar application of SA was more effective than soil application of SPH in camelina to alleviate the injurious effects of drought stress.

AB  - The 5-year survival of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains low. Murine models may not adequately mimic human PC and can be too small for medical device development. A large-animal PC model could address these issues. We induced and characterized pancreatic tumors in Oncopigs (transgenic swine containing KRASG12D and TP53R167H). The oncopigs underwent injection of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre) into one of the main pancreatic ducts. Resultant tumors were characterized by histology, cytokine expression, exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis. Ten of 14 Oncopigs (71%) had gross tumor within 3 weeks. At necropsy, all of these subjects had gastric outlet obstruction secondary to pancreatic tumor and phlegmon. Oncopigs with injections without Cre recombinase and wild-type pigs with AdCre injection did not show notable effect. Exome and transcriptome analysis of the porcine pancreatic tumors revealed similarity to the molecular signatures and pathways of human PC. Although further optimization and validation of this porcine PC model would be beneficial, it is anticipated that this model will be useful for focused research and development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for PC.This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper.

AB  - The oxidative stress-induced dysregulation of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein- brain-derived neurotrophic factor (CREB-BDNF) cascade has been linked to cognitive impairment in several studies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of minocycline on the levels of oxidative stress markers, CREB, and BDNF in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive impairment. Fifty adult male Sprague Dawley rats were divided randomly into five groups. Group 1 was an untreated control group. Groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 were treated concurrently with LPS (5 mg/kg, i.p) once on day 5 and normal saline (0.7 ml/rat, i.p) or minocycline (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p) or memantine (10 mg/kg, i.p) once daily from day 1 until day 14, respectively. From day 15 to day 22 of the experiment, Morris Water Maze (MWM) was used to evaluate learning and reference memory in rats. The levels of protein carbonyl (PCO), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CREB and BDNF expression and density were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis, respectively. LPS administration significantly increased escape latency to the hidden platform with decreased travelled distance, swimming speed, target crossings and time spent in the target quadrant. Besides, the hippocampal tissue of LPS rats showed increased levels of PCO and MDA, decreased levels of CAT and SOD, and reduced expression and density of BDNF and CREB. Treatment with minocycline reversed these effects in a dose-dependent manner, comparable to the effects of memantine. Both doses of minocycline treatment protect against LPS-induced cognitive impairment by reducing oxidative stress and upregulating the CREB-BDNF signalling pathway in the rat hippocampus.

AB  - Several studies have shown that the oxidative impact of pesticides is most prevalent in rural environments where they are intensively used. At different levels, pyrethroids are reported to promote neurodegeneration; they share the ability to promote oxidative stress, and to induce mitochondrial impairments, a-synuclein overexpression and neuronal cell loss. The present study evaluates the impact of early-life exposure to a commercial formulation containing deltamethrin (DM) and cypermethrin (CYP) at a dose of 1/100 LD50 (1.28 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively). Rats aged 30 days old, treated from the 6th to the 21st day of life, were tested for brain antioxidant activity and a-synuclein levels. Four regions of the brain were analyzed: the striatum, cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus. Our data demonstrated a significant increase in catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) antioxidant levels in the brain regions compared to the controls. Pups exhibited no significant changes in protein carbonyl levels and lipid peroxidation. Striatal a-synuclein expression was significantly reduced in the rats exposed to DM + CYP, while the treatment resulted in a non-significant increase in the other brain areas. These findings indicate unexpected effects of postnatal treatment with the commercial formulation containing DM and CYP on brain redox state and a-synuclein expression, suggesting an adaptive response.

TI  - Effect of the polyphenol flavonoids fisetin and quercetin on the adipogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells
T2  - BIOSCIENCE REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - ADIPOCYTES
AB  - Fisetin and quercetin, polyphenol flavonoids, have been shown to have a wide range of beneficial pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-cancer. Our previous work shows that fisetin also affects the specification of the adipogenic-osteogenic lineage of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by modulating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Although quercetin has a structure similar to that of fisetin, its effects on the functional properties of hMSCs have not yet been investigated. The objective of the present study is to determine the effects of quercetin on the various properties of hMSCs, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation capacity toward adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. The results show that while fisetin increases hMSC adipogenic differentiation, quercetin inhibited adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The inhibition is mediated, at least in part, by the activation of hippo signaling and up-regulation of miR-27b, which inhibits the expression of genes involved in all critical steps of lipid droplet biogenesis, resulting in a decrease in the number of lipid droplets in hMSCs. It is possible that the lack of hydroxylation of the 5 position on the A ring of quercetin could be responsible for its different effect on the adipogenic-osteogenic lineage specification of hMSCs compared with fisetin. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation suggested that fisetin and quercetin possibly bind to serine / threonine protein kinases 4 (STK4/MST1), which is an upstream kinase responsible for LATS phosphorylation. Taken together, our results demonstrate more insight into the mechanism underlying the role of flavonoid fisetin and quercetin in the regulation of adipogenesis.

AB  - Embryonic muscle fiber formation determines post-birth muscle fiber totals. The previous research shows SYISL knockout significantly increases muscle fiber numbers and mass in mice, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study confirms that the SYISL gene, maternal gut microbiota, and their interaction significantly affect the number of muscle fibers in mouse embryos through distinct mechanisms, as SYISL knockout alters maternal gut microbiota composition and boosts butyrate levels in embryonic serum. Both fecal microbiota transplantation and butyrate feeding significantly increase muscle fiber numbers in offspring, with butyrate inhibiting histone deacetylases and increasing histone acetylation in embryonic muscle. Combined analysis of RNA-seq between wild-type and SYISL knockout mice with ChIP-seq for H3K9ac and H3K27ac reveals that SYISL and maternal microbiota interaction regulates myogenesis via the butyrate-HDAC-H3K9ac/H3K27ac pathway. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis shows that SYISL knockout alone significantly increases the number and proportion of myogenic cells and their dynamics, independently of regulating histone acetylation levels. Cell communication analysis suggests that this may be due to the downregulation of signaling pathways such as MSTN and TGF beta. Overall, multiple pathways are highlighted through which SYISL influences embryonic muscle development, offering valuable insights for treating muscle diseases and improving livestock production.

AB  - Quantifying morphology has become increasingly popular with the advent of widely available high-powered computing. Orientation patch count rotated (OPCR) is an important measurement of dental surface complexity and has been shown to relate to diet, with carnivores possessing simple teeth and herbivores exhibiting complex dentitions. This method, however, has primarily been applied to mammals with comparatively little research focusing on dentigerous reptiles. Three methods are currently used to measure dental complexity (Surfer Manipulator, molaR, and MorphoTester), and the comparability of these methods remains untested in saurian datasets. Here, we test for differences among the three dental complexity methods using a dataset comprising lepidosaur and crocodylian teeth. Additionally, we seek to test the hypothesis that phenotypic dental complexity is related to dietary ecology using the molaR and MorphoTester OPCR methods. We find that Surfer Manipulator and 3D-OPCR methods (molaR and MorphoTester) generate different complexities, with molaR and MorphoTester consistently producing higher complexity values. The relationship between diet and dental complexity was recovered using molaR and MorphoTester, with carnivores possessing simple teeth and herbivores exhibiting significantly more-complex teeth, but this trend was not as distinct as when using Surfer Manipulator. Dental complexities were highly dependent on model preparation, in particular the triangle count of each 3D model, with surfaces that possess a greater number of faces exhibiting higher complexities. We present a series of recommendations that will help guide future studies of nonmammalian dentitions. Ultimately, 3D-OPCR methods are a fruitful area of research and represent a relatively untapped avenue of quantitative herpetology.

AB  - Providing mankind with high-quality products of aquaculture is possible only by introduction of modern industrial technologies to fish farming, growing fish based on modern scientific achievements. Assessment of the ecotoxic situation and identification of impacts of various unfavourable factors of aquatic environment on aquatic organisms should be made through morphological studies of the organs that are first to encounter the impact. The study revealed species specifics of the morphology of the liver of the fishes of the Cyprinidae family - Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio), Eurasian carp (Cyprinus carpio), and bighead carp (Hypoph-thalmichthys nobilis), which vary by extent of the motor activity in the aquatic environment, nutrition, etc. We determined that during phylogenetic development of fish that grow in the aquatic environment, there occurs a certain restructuring of the liver: the adaptation to various living conditions were accompanied by changes in a number of parameters of macro-and microscopic architectonics of the liver. Cyprinus carpio and Carassius gibelio (omnivores) have a two-lobe liver, while Hypophthalmichthys nobilis herbivore) has a three-lobe liver. For C. carpio andH. nobilis, a characteristic feature of the liver was presence of the hepatopancreatitis (the liver and the pancreas, associated into a single organ), and in C. gibelio, they are differentiated into individual organs. A peculiarity of the microscopic structure of the liver of the Cyprinidae family is poorly developed interlobular connective tissue, and parenchyma of the liver lobule has a tubular structure as polyhedral, curved thick-walled tubules, the walls of which are hepatocytes. The greatest amounts of cytoplasm and karyoplasms were seen in C. gibelio, equaling respectively 12.98 +/- 1.42 and 0.40 0.02 mu m3. The lowest volume of the indicated parameters was in C. carpio, particularly 2.97 +/- 0.22 and 0.21 +/- 0.01 mu m3, respectively. The lowest nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio was observed in hepatocytes of C. gibelio (0.0316 +/- 0.0024). The conducted morphological studies at the levels of organs, tissues and cells can reveal how the fishes' bodies adapt to particular living conditions and impacts of environmental factors.

AB  - Subterranean termites cause significant damage to agricultural crops and wooden infrastructures worldwide. Coptotermes and Odontotermes were found as the most abundant and damaging genera of subterranean termites in Pakistan. Many conventional synthetic insecticides are being used to combat termite infestations with often unsatisfactory control results. This study assessed the comparative toxicity of some prevailing synthetic insecticides with different modes of action against subterranean termites Coptotermes heimi Wasmann (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) which was found as a dominant termite species in district Sargodha. Filter paper disc -based bioassays revealed that all insecticides showed a significant impact ( P < 0.001) on the mortality of C. heimi workers and this mortality response was directly proportional to insecticidal concentrations and exposure times. Significantly higher mortality was recorded by chlorpyrifos (100.0%) and fipronil (95.0%) at 72 h post -exposure with minimum LC50 values of 1.29 and 2.04%, respectively. Similar trend of effectiveness was exhibited by their LT50 values. Minimum mortality of C. heimi workers was recorded by the formulations of chlorantraniliprole and abamectin. Based on overall study results, it is concluded that chlorpyrifos and fipronil are effective synthetic termiticides and are recommended to the indigenous farmers for combatting subterranean termite infestations.

AB  - The American black bear (Ursus americanus) was long thought to be solitary and its social organization has not been well described. Here, we present new data on black bear social structure. The objectives of the study were to make detailed observations of the behavior of wild black bears to determine their social interactions and structure. We tested whether black bears interacted socially beyond mating and competing for resources, if black bears tracked relationships and interacted regularly even when resources were not limited, and whether the social structure of a population of black bears was based on a matrilinear hierarchy. We collected data by direct observation of bears from 1993 to 2014. Observations of 1210 social interactions at a provisioning site indicated that females compete and form matrilinear hierarchies. Dominant bears established a hierarchy for food, control of space, and control of younger bears. Post interaction scent marking took place, which suggested that dominant females were conditioning subordinates to their scent marks. Affiliative behavior occurred between related and unrelated bears and helped to establish the social structure of the bear community. Based on our data, human-bear conflicts can be reduced by behavioral modifications by humans when they encounter bears. Knowledge of bear behavior and the matrilinear hierarchy provide a basis for non-lethal management of bears that find themselves in a bear-human conflict situation.

AB  - Exposure to lead, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been causally linked to spatial memory deficits and hippocampal changes in animal models. The Inuit community in Northern Canada is exposed to higher concentrations of these contaminants compared to the general population. This study aimed to 1) investigate associations between prenatal and current contaminant exposures and medial temporal brain volumes in Inuit late adolescents; 2) examine the relationship between these brain structures and spatial memory; and 3) assess the mediating role of brain structures in the association between contaminant exposure and spatial memory. Prenatal and current exposures were assessed from blood samples collected at birth and at the time of testing in 71 participants aged 16-22. Volumetric measurements of the hippocampi, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices from T1-weighted images were obtained using the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields method. Spatial navigation memory was evaluated using a computerized Morris Water Maze task. Prenatal lead exposure was associated with a smaller left hippocampal volume ((3 = -0.30, 95% CI = -0.56, -0.05), while current mercury ((3 = -0.34, 95% CI = -0.62, -0.06) and PCB-153 ((3 = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.70, -0.01) exposures were linked to a smaller left entorhinal cortex. The volume of the left entorhinal cortex positively correlated with spatial navigation memory performance ((3 = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.51). These findings suggest specific windows of brain vulnerability to these contaminants, with the entorhinal cortex playing a key role in spatial navigation memory and potentially mediating the effects of exposure.

AB  - Cameraria ohridella is one of the most invasive pests of horse chestnut. Cyantraniliprole is one of the most perspectively active insecticides, which can transport within the plant in several ways, and its efficacy against this pest has not yet been tested. All three modes of application were effective against the target pest, but there was a difference in the time of action between them. However, no demonstrable difference in the speed of action was detected between the doses used. A more intense rate of acropetal translocation was confirmed compared to basipetal translocation. A trend-like effect between the applied concentration of cyantraniliprole and the photon emission intensity per unit area of plant tissue was observed in the translaminar and acropetal treatment settings. In both cases, a clear increase in photon emission was observed, indicating metabolic upregulation. Therefore, we can conclude that biophoton emission measurements can be utilized to conduct efficient pesticide translocation investigations.

AB  - In 2019, we surveyed the Karuna bat cave during spring and autumn seasons and recorded two species of fruit bats; Rousettus leschenaultii and Eonycteris spelaea, and two species of insectivorous bats; Hipposideros armiger and Rhinolophus macrotis. Although there was no variation in colony size of insectivorous bats, the fruit bat population (around 38,000 individuals) was only recorded in autumn which indicated seasonal migration. Occasional killing of bats, unsustainable guano extraction, and tourism development threaten this major cave for bats in Nepal. The study recommends prioritizing scientific research and bat friendly cave conservation actions.

AB  - Cimolodontan multituberculates were a diverse and long-lived group of mammals characterized by large, blade-like lower fourth premolars (p4). Blade-like (plagiaulacoid) dentitions have evolved numerous times in distantly related mammalian lineages. Here we investigate how p4-shape disparity changed through time in the Cimolodonta. We address two hypotheses: (H-1) blade-like dentitions constrain the ability of plagiaulacoid mammals to evolve novel dental morphologies, (H-2) cimolodontan dental evolution proceeded gradually along a morphocline during the Late Cretaceous. We quantify functionally important aspects of p4 shape, including ratios reflecting height (H:L), symmetry (L1:L), and mesial-face height (H1:H), in a large sample of cimolodontans spanning the mid-Cretaceous through early Paleogene of North America (ca. 100-35 Mya). Our results do not support the morphocline hypothesis (H-2) and, instead, show that cimolodontans evolved a wide range of p4 shapes by the mid-Cretaceous, and that p4-shape disparity remained stable through the Late Cretaceous. We hypothesize that the two-stage cimolodontan chewing cycle (slicing-crushing then grinding) imposed functional constraints on p4 morphology. After the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, p4-shape disparity increased sharply, driven by the appearance of the Taeniolabidoidea, Microcosmodontidae, and Eucosmodontidae, in the early Paleocene. We contend that the slicing-crushing functions of the p4 became less important in those taxa, relaxing functional constraints on p4 morphology. Cimolodontans that retained both the slicing-crushing and grinding function of the p4 had a more limited range of p4 morphologies, and probably were largely restricted to animal-dominated omnivory. Taxa that shifted the initial slicing-crushing function from the p4 to the incisors had fewer functional constraints on p4 morphology, and were able to increase their molar grinding capacity to exploit plant-dominated omnivory and herbivory. That the p4 was reduced in herbivorous taxa rather than modified into a broader, multi-cusped tooth lends support to the morphological constraint hypothesis (H-1), and this relationship between p4 morphology and function suggests that retaining a large, blade-like p4 might have limited the range of herbivorous diets cimolodontans could exploit. These findings highlight the ecological and evolutionary limitations that specialized dentitions can impose on mammals by restricting their morphological and, in turn, functional diversification.

AB  - Background Trophic interactions are key processes, which determine the ecological function and performance of organisms. Many decapod crustaceans feed on plant material as a source for essential nutrients, e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids. Strictly herbivorous feeding appears only occasionally in marine decapods but is common in land crabs. To verify food preferences and to establish trophic markers, we studied the lipid and fatty acid composition of the midgut glands of two marine crab species (Grapsus albolineatus and Percnon affine), one semi-terrestrial species (Orisarma intermedium, formerly Sesarmops intermedius), and one terrestrial species (Geothelphusa albogilva) from Taiwan. Results All species showed a wide span of total lipid levels ranging from 4 to 42% of the dry mass (%(DM)) in the marine P. affine and from 3 to 25%(DM) in the terrestrial G. albogilva. Triacylglycerols (TAG) were the major storage lipid compound. The fatty acids 16:0, 18:1(n-9), and 20:4(n-6) prevailed in all species. Essential fatty acids such as 20:4(n-6) originated from the diet. Terrestrial species also showed relatively high amounts of 18:2(n-6), which is a trophic marker for vascular plants. The fatty acid compositions of the four species allow to clearly distinguish between marine and terrestrial herbivorous feeding due to significantly different amounts of 16:0, 18:1(n-9), and 18:2(n-6). Conclusions Based on the fatty acid composition, marine/terrestrial herbivory indices were defined and compared with regard to their resolution and differentiating capacity. These indices can help to reveal trophic preferences of unexplored species, particularly in habitats of border regions like mangrove intertidal flats and estuaries.

AB  - New fossils of the Miocene crown-tragulid Afrotragulus from Chinji and Dhok Pathan Formations of the Pakistan Siwaliks Group represent its first record out of Africa. This material from Babri Wala (ca. 12.6 Ma), Hasnot 6 (ca. 6.5 Ma) and Barnum Brown's B 51 classic locality (ca. 13.7 Ma) constitutes three new species, Afrotragulus akhtari, A. moralesi and A. megalomilos. We reassess Afrotragulus ingroup phylogeny recovering two clades with African and Asian representatives. Our results reject the existence of a strictly African lineage in the genus. Body-size estimates show three tiny Afrotragulus with a size corresponding to the lower spectrum of extant Tragulus. However, both Afrotragulus lineages produced species larger than 10 kg. Previously considered very small tragulids, these new forms demonstrate that size range of Afrotragulus equals that of all living tragulids. The smallest forms could be frugivorous/browsers but A. megalomilos and A. moralesi could be opportunistic feeders, specially accounting for their highly derived dentition. These new Asian Afrotragulus extend the biochronological range of the genus from the lower Miocene to the late upper Miocene. Afrotragulus is surprisingly uncovered here as one of the longest-lived and most successful members of the Tragulidae, existing during ca. 13.5 million years (20-6.5 Ma).

AB  - Cognitive deficits, including spatial working and recognition memory impairment, are a common feature of Alzheimer's disease with current therapies offering limited efficacy. Marrubium vulgare, a member of the Lamiaceae family, has shown potential to alleviate spatial memory impairment in a model of experimental dementia in rats through its antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of M. vulgare on recognition memory in healthy and dementia-affected rats after 21 days of oral administration. Memory performance was evaluated by the novel object recognition test. Levels of neurotransmitters acetylcholine, noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin, as well as the protein expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB), were measured. The expression levels of BDNF and CREB were evaluated via RT-PCR in the cortex and hippocampus. Our result revealed that M. vulgare ameliorated recognition memory impairment in dementia rats by preserving cholinergic function in the hippocampus, increasing NA levels in the brain, and restoring pCREB expression in the cortex following their reduction in the experimental model used. In healthy rats, the extract upregulated the expression of BDNF and pCREB in the cortex. These findings suggest that M. vulgare has potential as a therapeutic agent for cognitive impairments in various neurodegenerative diseases. The potential of Marrubium vulgare to alleviate scopolamine (Sco)-induced deficits in spatial working memory has drawn considerable scientific interest. This effect is partly attributed to its potent antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory (AChEI) activities. This study examined the effects of M. vulgare extract, standardized to marrubiin content, on recognition memory in healthy and Sco-treated rats. Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were divided into four groups. The extract was orally administered for 21 days and Sco (2 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected for 11 consecutive days. Memory performance was assessed using the novel object recognition test. Levels of acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (Sero), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) were evaluated in the cortex and hippocampus via ELISA. BDNF and CREB expression levels were assessed using RT-PCR. The results showed that M. vulgare significantly alleviated Sco-induced memory impairment, preserved cholinergic function in the hippocampus, increased NA levels in the brain, and restored pCREB expression in the cortex following Sco-induced reduction. In healthy rats, the extract upregulated BDNF, pCREB, and Bcl2 expression. Our findings indicate that the neuroprotective effects of M. vulgare may be linked to the modulation of cholinergic function, regulation of NA neurotransmission, and influence on key memory-related molecules.

AB  - Variation and covariation of the molar crown elements of prismatic dentition in the genus Ondatra (Mammalia: Rodentia: Arvicolinae) was studied numerically by means of geometric morphometric and cluster analyses. 31 elements were identified in total, their shapes were described by semilandmarks, their covariation patterns were analyzed by cluster analysis of vectorized Procrustes distance matrices with bootstrap estimations of cluster supports. Within-tooth comparisons recognize the modules that combine crown elements corresponding to the opposing pairs of cusps characteristic of generalized cricetine dentition. Results of comparison of crown elements within each toothrow indicate that integration effect, uniting homologous elements in adjacent teeth into dispersed modules, may be stronger than that uniting opposing elements in the same teeth. Comparison of crown elements of upper and lower toothrows reveals covariation of anterior part of lower M1 and posterior part of upper M3, which underwent coherent complication in the arvicoline evolution. It is concluded that the approach, based on combination of elementaristic GM-description of dental crowns and cluster analysis of covariations of their elements, may become an important tool for exploration of integration patterns of specialized dentition in herbivorous mammals.

AB  - Knowledge of diets is important for understanding species ecology and the mechanism of coexistence of multiple closely related species. Two rhinolophid bats, the greater Japanese horseshoe bat (Rhi-nolophus nippon) and the little Japanese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus cornutus), occur in Japan, but little is known about their diets and interspecific interactions regarding food resources. In this study, we examined the fecal contents of these two species in the Southern Japanese Alps by microscopic analysis over multiple seasons. R. cornutus, which have more skillful flight, consumed nonvolant insects (caterpillars and spiders), whereas R. nippon did not; this indicates that R. cornutus can glean prey better than R. nippon. The larger-bodied R. nippon more frequently consumed hard-bodied beetles, whereas the smaller-bodied R. cornutus more frequently consumed soft-bodied dipterans and neuropterans. Body size differences influenced flight ability and bite force, which resulted in food resource partitioning and enabled multispecies coexistence of these closely related bats. A R. nippon nursery colony consumed a wider variety of insects, such as beetles, moths, and dipterans, during the pregnancy and lactation periods; however, after lactation, they showed a beetle-dependent diet, and before hibernation they again consumed various food resources. A R. cornutus non-nursery colony frequently consumed dipterans and moths in spring; dipterans, moths, and neuropterans in autumn; and moths and neuropterans in winter. These seasonal changes in diet seemed to be related to food supply or reproductive status.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the composition of fatty acids, with particular emphasis on the content of cis9trans11 C18:2 (CLA) acid, the content of minerals, and lipid quality indices in raw milk, pasteurized milk, and in yogurts produced with selected starter cultures enriched with Bifidobacterium bifidum. The GC-FID method was used to determine the fatty acid composition of those dairy products. To analyze the contents of microelements (copper, manganese, iron, and zinc) and macroelements (magnesium, calcium) flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used. The content of phosphorus was determined with the usage of the colorimetric method and the contents of sodium and potassium with emission method. Data analysis showed that such technologies as milk pasteurization and milk fermentation had a significant impact on the fatty acid profile and contents of micro- and macroelements. The lipid quality indices: atherogenicity index (AI), index thrombogenicity (TI), hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic index (H/H), and (n - 6)/(n - 3) ratio, were at similar levels in raw and pasteurized milk and yogurts produced. Starter culture type affected the content of cis-9, trans-11 CLA C18:2 acid in yogurts. Out of the starter cultures applied in the study, only the FD-DVS YC-X16 Yo-Flex starter culture with BB-12 caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in CLA content. The CLA content of the yogurts produced using this starter culture was 2.67 mg/g fat. In raw milk, pasteurized milk, and the second batch of yogurts, the content of cis-9, trans-11 C18:2 acid was significantly lower and reached 2.26 mg/g fat, 2.17 mg/g fat, and 2.30 mg/g fat, respectively. The study indicated that, when it comes to being a source of minerals, yogurts were better than milk. Yogurts were also characterized by significantly (p < 0.05) higher contents of all micro- and macroelements taken into account in this study than the raw milk used to produce them.

AB  - Miniature microscopes have gained considerable traction for in vivo calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon in vivo calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (miniscope analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware. Minian has been validated to reliably and robustly extract calcium events across different brain regions and from different cell types. In practice, Minian provides an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results.

AB  - Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), causing hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis (HPM), significantly impacts Litopenaeus vannamei, leading to economic losses. Using bioinformatics and machine learning, this study characterized EHP infection stages and host-pathogen interactions. Consensus clustering of 2,613 metabolism-related genes from 36 shrimp samples identified four subclasses: healthy (HG), heavily (HEG), moderately (MEG), and lightly infected groups (LEG). Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) revealed subclass-specific metabolic and immune patterns, with HEG showing impaired carbohydrate metabolism and upregulated amino acid degradation, MEG indicating recovery, and LEG demonstrating metabolic normalization. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) linked infection subclasses to pathways like Hippo, JAK-STAT, steroid biosynthesis, and calcium signaling. Machine learning identified 52 characteristic genes involved in EHP proliferation (e.g., RAPTOR), host invasion (e.g., cell surface glycoprotein 1), and host defense (e.g., mucin-5AC). A stacked classifier model predicted infection severity with high accuracy. EHP severely impacts immunity, autophagy, and oxidative stress in early infection, with host responses evolving from detoxification to metabolic recovery and adaptation. Key pathways and genes, including polar tube protein (PTP) and mucin-5AC, were identified as critical to host-pathogen interactions, offering insights into EHP infection dynamics and potential intervention strategies.

AB  - Introduction: The utilization of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) has been demonstrated to exert a substantial positive influence on crop yield enhancement. However, due to the multitude of exposure routes and the persistence of these compounds, humans are routinely exposed to pesticides on a daily basis through dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion. This has serious consequences for the health of living organisms. The existing research on the effects of organophosphorus pesticides on organisms primarily encompasses the impact on vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart, various blood parameters, and potential neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenic effects. However, there is a paucity of research addressing the alleviation of brain tissue damage in OP pesticide poisoning through the microbial-intestinal-brain axis. Objectives: The objective of the present study is to illuminate the biological activity and mechanism of ginsenoside Rg3 in addressing brain injury induced by chlorpyrifos, employing both in vivo and in vitro models. This investigation will elucidate the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the polarization of macrophages in this process. Methods and results: Ginsenoside Rg3 is characterized by notable antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. The results showed that Rg3 improved the cognitive and learning memory impairment after chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure in C57 mice, alleviated macrophage infiltration in the hippocampus, repaired synaptic ultrastructural damage and restored the absence of synapse-related proteins (BDNF, SYP, and PSD-95) through behavioral assays, ameliorated neuronal apoptosis and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) disorders, and mediated the development of MPA axis disorders, while mediating M1/M2 macrophage polarization and attenuating apoptosis in brain tissue. In intestinal tissues, Rg3 improved the intestinal flora of mice, significantly reduced macrophage infiltration, and down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6), while concurrently augmenting the levels of short-chain fatty acids. And the therapeutic role of Rg3 in ameliorating the brain damage induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was substantiated by protein imprinting through the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1 beta signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the results of in vitro experiments demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg3 could attenuate CPF-induced inflammatory responses in BV-2 microglia by modulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed that ginsenoside Rg3 can be utilized as a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate brain tissue damage resulting from OP-type pesticide poisoning. These findings suggest that Rg3 has the potential to serve as a promising clinical drug for the treatment of organs affected by organophosphorus pesticide poisoning. This study offers novel insights into the application of Rg3 in the context of the microbial-gut-brain axis, providing a theoretical foundation for the development of ginsenoside Rg3 in clinical settings and the future development of novel drugs.

AB  - The basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulates different types of memory consolidation via distinct projections to downstream brain regions in multiple memory systems. Prior studies indicate that the BLA projects to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAshell) and that these regions interact to influence some types of behavior. Moreover, previous pharmacological work suggests the BLA and NAshell interact to influence memory. However, the precise role of the BLA-NAshell pathway has never been directly investigated in the consolidation of different types of memory including cued-response, spatial, or inhibitory avoidance (IA) learning. To address this, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received optogenetic manipulations of the BLA or BLA-NAshell pathway immediately following training in different learning tasks. An initial experiment found that optogenetically inhibiting the BLA itself immediately after training impaired cued-response retention in a Barnes maze task in males and females, confirming earlier pharmacological work in males alone. Subsequent experiments found that BLA-NAshell pathway inhibition impaired retention of cued-response and IA learning but had no effect on retention of spatial learning. However, the present work did not observe any effects of pathway stimulation immediately after cued-response or IA learning. Together, the present findings suggest the BLA modulates the consolidation of cued-response and IA, but not spatial, memory consolidation via NAshell projections.

AB  - Simple Summary It has been reported that goats fed a high-concentrate finishing diet had increased the short-chain fatty acid production and concentration; a decreased mean ruminal pH, leading to an increase in the epithelium's permeability; destruction of the tight junctions between cells; and damage to the barrier function. Glutamine, as a conditionally nonessential amino acid, can maintain the acid base balance of body fluids, promote nitrogen balance, and strengthen the mucosa and the integrity of the tight junction proteins. In this study, we aimed to investigate if Gln (Glutamine) would improve the digestive enzymes' activity, the ruminal epithelial barrier and fermentation, and immune responses by supplying energy to the mononuclear cells, improving the ruminal epithelium's morphology and integrity, and mediating the mRNA expression of cytokines and tight junction proteins. The present experiment aimed to research the effects of glutamine (Gln) on the digestive and barrier function of the ruminal epithelium in Hu lambs fed a high-concentrate finishing diet containing some soybean meal and cottonseed meal. Thirty healthy 3-month-old male Hu lambs were randomly divided into three treatments. Lambs were fed a high-concentrate diet and supplemented with 0, 0.5, and 1% Gln on diet for 60 days. The experimental results show that the Gln treatment group had lower pepsin and cellulase enzyme activity, propionate acid concentration, and IL-6, TNF-alpha, claudin-1, and ZO-1 mRNA expression in the ruminal epithelium (p < 0.05); as well as increases in lipase enzyme activity, the ratio of propionic acid to acetic acid, the IL-10 content in the plasma, and the mRNA expression of IL-2 and IL-10 in the ruminal epithelium, in contrast to the CON (control group) treatment (p < 0.05). Taken together, the findings of this present study support the addition of Gln to improve digestive enzyme activity, the ruminal epithelium's barrier, and fermentation and immune function by supplying energy to the mononuclear cells, improving the ruminal epithelium's morphology and integrity, and mediating the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (TJs) and cytokines.

AB  - Endel Tulving's episodic memory framework emphasizes the multifaceted re-experiencing of personal events. Indeed, decades of research focused on the experiential nature of episodic memories, usually treating recent episodic memory as a coherent experiential quality. However, recent insights into the functional architecture of the medial temporal lobe show that different types of mnemonic information are segregated into distinct neural pathways in brain circuits empirically associated with episodic memory. Moreover, recent memories do not fade as a whole under conditions of progressive neurodegeneration in these brain circuits, notably in Alzheimer's disease. Instead, certain memory content seem particularly vulnerable from the moment of their encoding while other content can remain memorable consistently across individuals and contexts. We propose that these observations are related to the content-specific functional architecture of the medial temporal lobe and consequently to a content-specific impairment of memory at different stages of the neurodegeneration. To develop Endel Tulving's inspirational legacy further and to advance our understanding of how memory function is affected by neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, we postulate that it is compelling to focus on the representational content of recent episodic memories.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in pigs caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a global problem which results in substantial economic losses, due to decreased performance and a high incidence of mortality and morbidity. Due to the banning of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) by many countries, it would be valuable to find environmentally friendly and non-antibiotic alternatives to AGPs and to evaluate their effectiveness. Both immunoglobulins and phytomolecules are separately reported as benefiting animal growth, but the efficiency of combinations of immunoglobulins and phytomolecules as AGP alternatives is largely unknown. In this study, the results showed that a mixture of immunoglobulin and phytomolecule administration had positive effects on feed efficiency, diarrhea reduction, intestinal morphology, and coliform control. Combinations of immunoglobulins and phytomolecules can be used as a potential alternative to AGPs in weanling piglets.
   The study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) with an egg immunoglobulin (IgY) combined with phytomolecules (PM) on the growth rate, serum immunity, and intestinal health of weaned pigs challenged with Escherichia coli K88 (E. coli K88). A total of 192 piglets were weaned at 28 days old with an average weight of 7.29 (+/- 0.04) kg. They were randomly divided into four treatments containing eight replicates with six piglets per replicate. The treatment groups were NC and PC fed a basal diet, AGP fed a basal diet supplemented with 75 mg/kg chlortetracycline, 50 mg/kg oxytetracycline calcium, and 40 mg/kg zinc bacitracin, IPM fed a basal diet supplemented with IgY at dose of 2.5 g/kg and 1.0 g/kg and PM at dose of 300 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg during days 1 to 17 and 18 to 42, respectively. On days 7 to 9 of the experiment, piglets in the PC, AGP, and IPM groups were orally challenged with 20 mL E. coli K88 (10(9) CFU/mL), while piglets in the NC group were challenged with 20 mL medium without E. coli K88. The E. coli K88 challenge model was successful as the incidence of post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) of piglets challenged with E. coli K88 was significantly higher than that of those unchallenged piglets during the challenge time (days 7 to 9) and days 1 to 7 of post-challenge (p < 0.05). A diet with combinations of IgY and PM and AGPs significantly decreased the incidence of PWD during the challenge time and days 1 to 7 of post-challenge (p < 0.05) compared to the PC group and significantly improved the ratio of feed to weight gain (F:G) during days 1 to 17 of the experiment compared to the NC and PC groups (p < 0.05). In comparison with the PC group, piglets in the IPM group had significantly higher serum levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM (p < 0.05), but lower serum IL-1 beta on day 17 of experiement (p < 0.05). Besides, diet supplementation with AGP significantly decreased serum IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha on days 17 and 42 (p < 0.05) with comparison to the PC group. Piglets in the IPM group showed a significantly lower level of fecal coliforms (p < 0.05), but a higher villus height of jejunum and ileum and higher ratio of villus height to crypt depth of duodenum and jejunum (p < 0.05) than those piglets in the PC group. In summary, diet supplementation with a mixture of IgY and PM decreased the incidence of PWD and coliforms, increased feed conversion ratio, and improved intestinal histology and immune function.

AB  - Different physical structures play a central role in animal camouflage. However, in evolutionary studies of mimicry, the ecological and evolutionary significance of such structures has been poorly investigated. Larvae of long-bodied craneflies, Cylindrotominae, are all obligate herbivores and resemble plants. They are distinctively characterized by possessing numerous elongated cuticular lobes on the integument. A comprehensive overview of the biology and morphology of cylindrotomids, particularly their larval stages, is laid out, providing original data on nine species. To explore the ecological background of moss resemblance, host-plants of most examined species are clarified, revealing that terrestrial moss-feeding species tend to use specific groups of mosses, either belonging to Bryales or Hypnales. However, the evolution of cryptic forms remains paradoxical, due to the apparent absence of visual predators. Based on histological examinations, extensive internal musculatures within the cuticular lobes on the lateral side are discovered, shedding new light on their function in locomotion. Traditional functional explanations for these lobes, particularly as devices for respiration, locomotion and attachment, are challenged. This study promotes our understanding of the ecomorphology of mimicry devices, which is an angle often dismissed in evolutionary studies of mimicry.

AB  - Demand for n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) exceeds supply. Large-scale studies on effects of season and geography of n-3 PUFAs in marine fish from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (NEAO) may be used to optimize utilization and improve nutrition security. Using a sinusoid model, seasonal cycles of n-3 PUFAs were determined and found to be species-specific and clearly pronounced for the pelagic zooplankton feeding species. The Greenland halibut showed very little seasonal variation. The n-3 PUFA content in North Sea autumn-spawning (NSAS) herring peaked in summer, while Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring and mackerel had their peak in autumn. A time shift of peaks in n-3 PUFAs between the two herring stocks was detected, likely due to different spawning strategies in addition to a delay of n-3 PUFAs flux in the northern regions of the NEAO. This study demonstrates that consideration of nutrient contents, such as n-3 PUFAs, when organizing and structuring fishery approaches may improve overall nutritional yield. Based on total annual Norwegian fish landings and seasonal variation in n-3 PUFA contents, n-3 PUFAs yield could theoretically be increased from 13.79 kilo ton per year from the current fishing tactics, to 15.54 if the pelagic species were only caught during the time of their seasonal n-3 PUFA peaks. Pelagic fish is a good source for dietary n-3 PUFAs, but harvest timing will also influence n-3 PUFAs intake by human consumers. One portion of fatty fish harvested during winter/spring may not meet the weekly intake reference nutritional guidelines for n-3 PUFAs. Marine n-3 PUFAs yields also varied geographically and decreased southwards, with the lowest values in Skagerrak. This study can serve as a model to understand patterns of reproductive cycles and geographical distribution of n-3 PUFAs in fatty fish from the NEAO and the novel approach may be useful to support sustainable, seasonal fishing programmes for optimization of n-3 PUFAs yields.

AB  - The nutritional composition of the diet significantly impacts the overall growth and development of weaned piglets. The current study aimed to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of dietary tryptophan consumption on muscle fiber type transformation during the weaning period. Thirty weaned piglets with an average body weight of 6.12 +/- 0.16 kg were randomly divided into control (CON, 0.14% Trp diet) and high Trp (HT, 0.35% Trp) groups and maintained on the respective diet for 28 days. The HT group of weaned piglets exhibited highly significant improvements in growth performance and an increased proportion of fast muscle fibers. Transcriptome sequencing revealed the potential contribution of differentially expressed circular RNAs toward the transformation of myofiber types in piglets and toward the regulation of expression of related genes by targeting the microRNAs, miR-34c and miR-182, to further regulate myofiber transformation. In addition, 145 DE circRNAs were identified as potentially protein-encoding, with the encoded proteins associated with a myofiber type transformation. In conclusion, the current study greatly advances and refines our current understanding of the regulatory networks associated with piglet muscle development and myofiber type transformation and also contributes to the optimization of piglet diet formulation.

AB  - The world's largest terrestrial mammal, Asian elephants, are known to have enormous feeding needs. Several factors such as season, sex, age, and daily activities influence the amount of food required by an individual. Generally, captive elephants have a limited choice of food on a daily basis compared with that of elephants in the wild. Elephants in captivity are fed according to a prepared feeding schedule, whereas wild elephants are free to choose the type of plants that they consume in their natural habitat. In the past, ecological observations have been widely used to determine the diet of wild elephants. However, the molecular approach has never been carried out. In the present study, we aimed to; 1) identify the plant diet of wild Asian elephants in Taman Negara National Park (TNNP) according to their sex and age using high-throughput DNA metabarcoding; and 2) determine the dietary formulation of captive elephants based on the generated plant metabarcoding database. DNA was extracted from 24 individual fecal samples collected using noninvasive sampling techniques from TNNP and the National Elephant Conservation Centre (NECC) Kuala Gandah. Seven pooled samples from male adult, female adult, male subadult, female subadult, male juvenile, female juvenile, and captive elephants were amplified and sequenced targeting the trnL region (50-150 base pairs). The CLC Genomic Workbench and PAST 4.02 software were used for data analysis. In total, 24 orders, 41 families, 233 genera, and 306 species of plants were successfully detected in the diet of the Asian elephants. The most abundant plant genera consumed were Sporobolus (21.88%), Musa (21.48%), and Ficus (10.80%). Plant variation was lower in samples from male elephants than in those from female elephants. The plant species identified were correlated with the nutrient benefits required by elephants. Adults and subadults consumed more plant species than were consumed by juvenile elephants. However, there was no significant difference between ages and sexes. The findings of this study can be used as guidance by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks for the management of captive elephants, especially in NECC Kuala Gandah.

AB  - Plant volatiles, constitutive or induced, are perceived by insect pests to locate the host plant and also by natural enemies to locate the host insect. These plant volatiles can be utilized to develop attractive or repellant lures for pest management. Studies were carried out to identify the plant volatiles which are induced in pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth due to the herbivory of blister beetle, Mylabris pustulata. The volatiles from healthy uninfested pigeonpea plants and blister beetle-infested plants were collected using the dynamic headspace collection method with Porapaq Q (80-100 mesh) as adsorbent. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 28 compounds were identified from uninfested pigeonpea plants whereas 16 compounds were identified from infested plants. A qualitative analysis showed that a-pinene and 3-hexen-2-one were exclusively detected in infested plants and (Z)-3-bexen-1-yl acetate and acetophenone were released in higher quantities from infested plants than from uninfested one. Electrophysiological evaluation of these volatiles along with other plant volatiles showed that blister beetle antennae eliciting higher responses to eucalyptol at a 1-mu g dose, to nerol at a 10-mu g dose and to benzyl acetate at 100- and 1000-mu g doses. Beetle traps with lures of eucalyptol, benzaldehyde, benzyl acetate, and nerol attracted a very small number of blister beetle adults, suggesting the need for further efforts to standardize lure load and trap design.

AB  - Red-legged pademelons (Thylogale stigmatica) occur as several subspecies in eastern Australia. The northern subspecies (T. stigmatica stigmatica) in north Queensland is considered common; the southern subspecies (T. stigmatica wilcoxi) in north-eastern New South Wales is, by comparison, rare and is listed as threatened. Activity patterns should also vary between these subspecies because T. s. stigmatica emerges from the forest at night to graze, whereas T. s. wilcoxi remains in the forest throughout the 24-h cycle. Using camera traps, we detected pademelons at a greater rate at a Queensland site occupied by T. s. stigmatica than at a New South Wales site inhabited by T. s. wilcoxi; this result is consistent with their conservation status. However, pademelons at these sites displayed remarkably similar activity patterns within rainforest over the 24-h period, a result that was unexpected based on what is known of their diel behaviour.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: Parishin C (Par), a prominent bioactive compound in Gastrodia elata Blume with little toxicity and shown neuroprotective effects. However, its impact on depression remains largely unexplored. Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate the antidepressant effects of Par using a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model and elucidate its molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: The CSDS-induced depression mouse model was used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Par. The social interaction test (SIT) and sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) were conducted to assess the effects of Par on depressive-like behaviours. The levels of corticosterone, neurotransmitters (5-HT, DA and NE) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IL-6) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Activation of a microglia was assessed by immunofluorescence labeling Iba-1. The protein expressions of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-6 verified by Western blot. Result: Oral administration of Par (4 and 8 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, administration significantly ameliorate depression-like behaviors induced by CSDS, as shown by the increase social interaction in SIT, increase sucrose preference in SPT and the decrease immobility in TST and FST. Par administration decreased serum corticosterone level and increased the 5-HT, DA and NE concentration in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, Par treatment suppressed microglial activation (Iba1) as well as reduced levels of IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IL-6) with decreased protein expressions of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-6. Conclusions: our study provides the first evidence that Par exerts antidepressant-like effects in mice with CSDSinduced depression. This effect appears to be mediated by the normalization of neurotransmitter and corticosterone levels, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This newfound antidepressant property of Par offers a novel perspective on its pharmacological effects, providing valuable insights into its potential therapeutic and preventive applications in depression treatment.

AB  - Animals have been used as subjects in biomedical research for a long time. In these studies, tissue collection for RNA profiling is often essential, and hence, the animals are euthanised using standard injectable anaesthetics such as sodium pentobarbital or T-61((R)). Recently, a euthanasia method using an inhalant anaesthetic 'nitrogen gas in foam' (ANOXIA (TM)) has gained further interest as it is claimed to be more animal-friendly. However, little is known on its effect on subsequent RNA analysis. There are also no studies on the interaction effect of these euthanasia methods and different tissue storage conditions such as RNAlater (TM) or snap freezing using liquid nitrogen on RNA measurements. It is very important to investigate if the choice of euthanasia method in research animals as well as the tissue storage condition impact RNA measurements. The current study compared the two euthanasia methods in male piglets and found that the nitrogen anoxia technique (ANOXIA (TM)) could be a suitable alternative to T-61((R)) based on RNA quality parameters because no differences were detected. Storage in RNAlater (TM) significantly increased the RNA integrity in comparison to snap freezing, but no interaction effect of the euthanasia methods and storage conditions on RNA measurements were detected.
   Animals used in research often have to be euthanised, especially when tissue sampling is essential. Recently, a euthanasia method, utilizing an inhalant anaesthetic 'nitrogen gas in foam' in an anoxia box (ANOXIA (TM)), has gained considerable interest as it claimed to be more animal-friendly. However, it is not clear whether the use of this euthanasia method has an influence on RNA measurements. Moreover, there are no studies on the interaction effect of different euthanasia methods on the tissue sample storage conditions. The current study compared RNA measurements from two euthanasia methods (ANOXIA (TM) vs. T-61((R)) injection) and two storage conditions (RNAlater (TM) vs. snap freezing) in 12 male piglets. The nitrogen anoxia method had a significantly higher RNA yield (p < 0.01) compared to the T-61((R)) method. However, no effect of the euthanasia methods on the A260/230 ratio and RIN value was observed. Tissues stored in RNAlater (TM) had significantly higher RIN values (p < 0.001) compared to snap frozen samples. The present study could not find a significant difference between the two euthanasia methods in piglets, with regard to RNA quality measurements. Hence, the nitrogen anoxia technique (ANOXIA (TM)) might be considered as a suitable alternative to T-61((R)) for euthanasia of piglets used in research.

AB  - After stone tools, bone tools are the most abundant artefact type in the Early Pleistocene archaeological record. That said, they are still relatively scarce, which limits our understanding of the behaviours that led to their production and use. Observations of extant primates constitute a unique source of behavioural data with which to construct hypotheses about the technological forms and repertoires exhibited by our hominin ancestors. We conducted two different experiments to investigate the behavioural responses of two groups of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; n = 33 and n = 9) to disarticulated, defleshed, ungulate bones while participating in a foraging task aimed at eliciting excavating behaviour. Each chimpanzee group was provided with bone specimens with different characteristics, and the two groups differed in their respective experience levels with excavating plant tools. We found that several individuals from the inexperienced group used the provided bones as tools during the task. In contrast, none of the individuals from the experienced group used bones as excavating tools, but instead continued using plant tools. These chimpanzees also performed non-excavating bone behaviours such as percussion and tool-assisted extraction of organic material from the medullary cavity. Our findings serve as a proof-of-concept that chimpanzees can be used to investigate spontaneous bone tool behaviours such as bone-assisted excavation. Furthermore, our results raise interesting questions regarding the role that bone characteristics, as well as previous tool-assisted excavating experience with other raw materials, might have in the expression of bone tool-assisted excavation.

AB  - Bait markers are indispensable for ecological research but in small mammals, most markers are invasive, expensive and do not enable quantitative analyses of consumption. Ethyl-iophenoxic acid (Et-IPA) is a non-toxic, quantitative bait marker, which has been used for studying bait uptake in several carnivores and ungulates. We developed a bait with Et-IPA, assessed its palatability to common voles (Microtus arvalis), and determined the dose-residue-relation for this important agricultural pest rodent species. Et-IPA concentrations of 40 to 1280 mu g Et-IPA per g bait were applied to wheat using sunflower oil or polyethylene glycol 300 as potential carriers. In a laboratory study, common voles were offered the bait and blood samples were collected 1, 7, and 14 days after consumption. The samples were analyzed with LC-ESI-MS/MS for blood residues of Et-IPA. Sunflower-oil was the most suitable bait carrier. Et-IPA seemed to be palatable to common voles at all test concentrations. Dose-dependent residues could be detected in blood samples in a dose-dependent manner and up to 14 days after uptake enabling generation of a calibration curve of the dose-residue relationship. Et-IPA was present in common vole blood for at least 14 days, but there was dissipation by 33-37% depending on dose. Et-IPA meets many criteria for an "ideal" quantitative bait marker for use in future field studies on common voles and possibly other small mammal species.

AB  - Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccines have been successfully used for the inhibition of gonadal development and function, but current GnRH-based vaccines often present variability in the response. Cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197) has been used as carrier molecules to enhance an immune response to associated antigens. So, the synthetic mammalian tandem-repeated GnRH hexamer (GnRH6) gene was integrated into the expression plasmid pET-21a. Recombinant GnRH6-CRM197 protein was subsequently overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified through Nickel column affinity chromatography and the antigenicity and biological effects of GnRH6-CRM197 were evaluated in rats. Sixteen 4-month-old adult male rats were randomly divided into two groups: the GnRH6-CRM197 group (n = 8) and the control group (n = 8). The GnRH6-CRM197 group rats were subcutaneously immunized with 100 mu g of GnRH6-CRM197, administered thrice at 2-week intervals with GnRH6-CRM197.The control group received only a white oil adjuvant. Following the initial immunization, the weights of animals were recorded, and blood samples were collected from the orbital sinus at 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, and 7 months. Serum antibody titers and testosterone concentrations were quantified using ELISA and CLIA, respectively. Additionally, testicular tissues were collected for morphological examination. The results revealed a significant increase in serum GnRH antibody titers (p < 0.05), but a significant decrease in serum testosterone concentrations (p < 0.05), and the weight, length, width, and girth of the testis, and the number of spermatogonia cells, spermatocytes, and sperm cells in the immunized rats. Furthermore, seminiferous tubules revealed significant atrophy and no sperm were observed in the immunized animals. Thus, GnRH6-CRM197 may be an effective antigen and a potential immunocastration vaccine.

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus) is an important crop and frequently attacked by the cabbage root fly larvae (Delia radicum). They damage the taproot, cause plant death, and negatively impact yield. Options to control D. radicum with synthetic pesticides are limited, and no tolerance in OSR has been described. We aim to identify natural resistance in OSR accessions to D. radicum as a starting point for plant breeding. We tested OSR accessions for differences in larval feeding damage, larval performance, female attraction, and oviposition preference. Using a subset of the most and least resistant accessions, we analyzed volatile profiles and leaf traits and assessed root metabolic fingerprints. Resistance to larval damage was related to lower aliphatic glucosinolates and higher lignin-related compound levels. Oviposition preference was linked to higher trichome density. Our results suggest breeding efforts should focus on increasing lignin and decreasing specific glucosinolates in OSR roots.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of different functional oligosaccharides on the growth performance, intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota of weanling piglets. A total of 192 weanling piglets were randomly allocated into 4 dietary groups, which were a control (CON), CON + 0.1% xylo-oligosaccharide (XO), CON + 0.1% isomalto-oligosaccharide (IM) or CON + 0.08% mannan-oligosaccharide (MO) diet. Results showed that the XO and MO groups showed lower diarrhea incidence in weanling piglets compared with the CON group (P < 0.05). Colonic goblet cell numbers and the mRNA expression of mucin-2 (P < 0.05) were greater in all functional oligosaccharide groups. Both the XO and MO groups had a greater concentration of sIgA, IL-10, SOD and GSH-Px and higher antioxidase activity, and the XO group had a lower protein expression of NF-kappa B in the ilea of piglets (P < 0.05) compared with the CON group. The XO group had a greater concentration of butyrate and an abundance of Bifidobacterium in the ileum (P < 0.05). The MO group had a greater ileal concentration of acetate compared with the additional dietary treatments and greater butyrate compared with the IM and CON groups (P < 0.05). In summary, XO increased the growth of Bifidobacterium, butyrate production and intestinal antioxidant capacity; however, MO promoted the expression of tight junction proteins and the intestinal immune function to reduce piglet diarrhea.

AB  - Background: Premature infants are highly susceptible to infections that can lead to sepsis with life-threatening organ dysfunctions. The clinical practice of high parenteral glucose supply in preterm infants can exacerbate infection outcomes through excessive glycolysis-induced inflammatory response. This in turn can affect the health of vital preterm organs, including the brain and kidneys. We hypothesized that reduced parenteral glucose supply to infected preterm newborns may help protect against pathology in these two key organs. Methods: Cesarean-delivered preterm pigs were nourished with high or low parenteral glucose levels (21 % vs. 5 %), infused with Staphylococcus epidermidis or saline, and monitored in heated, oxygenated incubators until 22 h. Blood, brain, and kidney samples were collected for histological, immunohistological, q-PCR, ELISA, and biochemical analyses. Results: Infection led to multiple pathological changes (e.g. edema), increased inflammation and tissue injury (indicated by gene expression data) in both brain and kidneys of preterm piglets. Reduced glucose supply in infected animals alleviated histopathological manifestations in the brain, and reduced neuroinflammation with enhanced M2 microglial phenotype. Reduced glucose supply also decreased plasma creatinine, and the severity of renal edema, tubular vacuolization and dilatation. Multiple genes related to innate and Th1 immunity in both organs were dampened by reduced glucose supply. Correlation analysis showed that renal inflammation was more closely connected to systemic inflammation compared to neuroinflammation. Conclusion: Reduced glucose supply can reduce renal and neuro-inflammation during neonatal infection, thereby protecting brain and kidney health in infected preterm neonates.

AB  - In the development of vascular tissue engineering, particularly in the case of small diameter vessels, one of the key obstacles is the blockage of these veins once they enter the in vivo environment. One of the contributing factors to this problem is the aberrant proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from the media layer of the artery to the interior of the channel. Two distinct phenotypes have been identified for smooth muscle cells, namely synthetic and contractile. Since the synthetic phenotype plays an essential role in the unusual growth and migration, the aim of this study was to convert the synthetic phenotype into the contractile one, which is a solution to prevent the abnormal growth of VSMCs. To achieve this goal, these cells were subjected to electrical signals, using a 1000 mu A sinusoidal stimulation at 10 Hz for four days, with 20 min duration per 24 h. The morphological transformations and changes in the expression of vimentin, nestin, and beta-actin proteins were then studied using ICC and flow cytometry assays. Also, the expression of VSMC specific markers such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and smooth muscle alpha-actin (alpha-SMA) were evaluated using RT-PCR test. In the final phase of this study, the sheep decellularized vessel was employed as a scaffold for seeding these cells. Based on the results, electrical stimulation resulted in some morphological alterations in VSMCs. Furthermore, the observed reductions in the expression levels of vimentin, nestin and beta-actin proteins and increase in the expression of SMMHC and alpha-SMA markers showed that it is possible to convert the synthetic phenotype to the contractile one using the studied regime of electrical stimulation. Finally, it can be concluded that electrical stimulation can significantly affect the phenotype of VSMCs, as demonstrated in this study.

AB  - The fisheries industry relies heavily on automatic fish species identification for its socio-economic well-being. Due to the similarity in shape and size of the major carps, it can be difficult to recognise them using morphological features. To recognise these species automatically, our proposed autoencoder network models have been applied to a fish dataset containing 1500 images of three major carps of India. As a feature, the autoencoder model's latent representation is used. After the training phase is complete, the decoder is removed and fish species are categorised using several classifiers. Different variations of autoencoders, such as the Simple Autoencoder, the Deep Autoencoder, and the Deep Convolutional Autoencoder are applied with different hyper parameters. An encouraging maximum accuracy rate of 97.33% is obtained in 250 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001 using Deep Convolutional Autoencoder. Some well-known machine learning classifiers, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, are also used to evaluate the latent representation's effectiveness using the latent representation as a feature vector. The Support Vector Machine-based latent representation of the Deep Convolutional Autoencoder outperformed all other approaches significantly. The models' performance is compared to that of Hu moments, Haralick texture, Weber local descriptor, HOG descriptor etc. with best classifiers along with different deep learning models, such as InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, VGG16 and VGG19. The Deep Convolutional Autoencoder outperforms the other models by 52%, 43.55%, 13.77%, 6.67%, 22.22%, 15.11%, 6.66%, 4.89%, and 9.78% respectively. It demonstrates the efficacy of this systematic study in identifying major carps.

AB  - The pharmacokinetic (PK) change in a drug by co-administered herbal products can alter the efficacy and toxicity. In the circumstances that herb-drug combinations have been increasingly attempted to alleviate Alzheimer's disease (AD), the PK evaluation of herb-drug interaction (HDI) is necessary. The change in systemic exposure as well as target tissue distribution of the drug have been issued in HDIs. Recently, the memory-enhancing effects of water extract of mangosteen pericarp (WMP) has been reported, suggesting a potential for the combination of WMP and donepezil (DNP) for AD treatment. Thus, it was evaluated how WMP affects the PK change of donepezil, including systemic exposure and tissue distribution in mice after simultaneous oral administration of DNP with WMP. Firstly, co-treatment of WMP and donepezil showed a stronger inhibitory effect (by 23.0%) on the neurotoxicity induced by A beta((25-35)) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells than donepezil alone, suggesting that the combination of WMP and donepezil may be more effective in moderating neurotoxicity than donepezil alone. In PK interaction, WMP increased donepezil concentration in the brain at 4 h (by 63.6%) after administration without affecting systemic exposure of donepezil. Taken together, our results suggest that WMP might be used in combination with DNP as a therapy for AD.

AB  - In adults, glucocorticoids are stress hormones that act, partly, through actions on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to increase energy availability. Before birth, glucocorticoids are primarily maturational signals that prepare the fetus for new postnatal challenges. However, the role of the normal prepartum glucocorticoid rise in preparing mitochondria for the increased postnatal energy demands remains largely unknown. This study examined the effect of physiological increases in the fetal cortisol concentration on cerebral mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity near term (similar to 130 days gestation, term similar to 145 days gestation). Fetal sheep were infused with saline or cortisol for 5 days at similar to 0.8 of gestation before the mitochondrial content, respiratory rates, abundance of the electron transfer system proteins and OXPHOS efficiency were measured in their cortex and cerebellum. Cerebral morphology was assessed by immunohistochemistry and stereology. Cortisol treatment increased the mitochondrial content, while decreasing Complex I-linked respiration in the cerebellum. There was no effect on the cortical mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity. Cortisol infusion had regional effects on cerebral morphology, with increased myelination in the cerebrum. The findings demonstrate the importance of cortisol in regulating the cerebral mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity prenatally and have implications for infants born preterm or after glucocorticoid overexposure due to pregnancy complications or clinical treatment.

AB  - Group living is widespread across diverse taxa, and the mechanisms underlying collective decision-making in contexts of variable role division are critical for understanding the dynamics of group stability. While studies on collective behavior in small animals such as fish and insects are well-established, similar research on large wild animals remains challenging due to the limited availability of sufficient and systematic field data. Here, we aimed to explore the collective decision-making pattern and its sexual difference for the dimorphic Tibetan antelopes Pantholops hodgsonii (chiru) in Xizang Autonomous Region, China, by analyzing individual leadership distribution, as well as the joining process, considering factors such as calving stages and joining ranks. The distinct correlations of decision participants' ratio with group size and decision duration underscore the trade-off between accuracy and speed in decision-making. Male antelopes display a more democratic decision-making pattern, while females exhibit more prompt responses after calving at an early stage. This study uncovers a partially shared decision-making strategy among Tibetan antelopes, suggesting flexible self-organization in group decision processes aligned with animal life cycle progression.

AB  - Beside insects, sengis also consume plant material such as leaves, fruits, seeds and floral nectar. It is known that they use olfaction for foraging, but little is known about their vision and visual learning capabilities. Colour vision has been tested in two species, showing that they are likely dichromats (green- and blue-sensitive retinal cone-photoreceptors, meaning red-green colour blind). Our aim was to examine the learning and colour discrimination abilities of another species, Elephantulus edwardii. Using training procedures and choice experiments, we tested the hypotheses that the animals can associate a reward with trained colours and that they can discriminate between different colour hues. The sengis preferred the trained colours over the others, indicating associative learning. They could discriminate between all tested colours (blue, red, green, yellow). The sengis' colour choice behaviour indicates that the animals can use also colour features to find food plant material. Additionally, learning abilities most likely are essential for the sengis' foraging activities, for instance by associating floral or fruit shape, colour or scent with nectar or ripe fruit, to increase the efficiency to locate food sources.

AB  - Ergot alkaloids, a class of mycotoxins associated with ergotism, act as agonists on serotonin (5HT) receptors, specifically 5HT2a, which mediate smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of ergot alkaloid exposure during mid and late gestation on microscopic placental structure and vascular development. Ewes were fed endophyte-infected tall fescue seed containing ergot alkaloids (E+/E+, 1.77 mg ewe(-1) d(-1)) or endophyte-free tall fescue seed (E-/E-, 0 mg ergot alkaloids) during both mid (d 35 to d 85) and late gestation (d 86 to d 133). On d 133 of gestation, a terminal surgery was performed and two placentomes of the type B morphology were collected for microscopic analyses. Amorphous connective tissue regions were larger (p < 0.0001) and more numerous (p = 0.025) in the placentome of ergot alkaloid exposed ewes. Staining showed no difference (p = 0.83) in the number of vessels present, but luminal area of maternal vasculature was 117% greater (p < 0.0001) in ergot alkaloid exposed ewes. Results showed that exposure to ergot alkaloids during gestation slowed maturation of the fetal villi as indicated by greater amorphous connective tissue regions, and altered size and shape of blood vessels to counteract reductions in blood flow caused by vasoconstriction.

AB  - Diosgenin, a natural steroid saponin, holds promise as a multitarget therapeutic for various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. Its efficacy in slowing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke progression has been demonstrated. However, the role of diosgenin in anti-epilepsy and its potential connection to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota remain poorly understood. In this study, exogenous diosgenin significantly mitigated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, learning and memory deficits, and hippocampal neuronal injury. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing revealed a reversal in the decrease of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera in the PTZ-induced mouse epileptic model following diosgenin treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments illustrated the involvement of diosgenin in modulating gut microbiota and providing neuroprotection against epilepsy. Our results further indicated the repression of enteric glial cells (EGCs) activation and the TLR4-MyD88 pathway, coupled with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen, and improved intestinal barrier function in epilepsy mice treated with diosgenin or FMT. This study suggests that diosgenin plays a role in modifying gut microbiota, contributing to the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, ultimately inhibiting epilepsy progression in a PTZ-induced mouse model. Diosgenin emerges as a potential therapeutic option for managing epilepsy and its associated comorbidities.
   Diosgenin holds promise for its potential antiepileptic effects in the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epileptic mouse model. This is attributed to its capacity to restore disrupted gut microbiota, alleviate intestinal inflammation, and mitigate neuroinflammation in mice.image

AB  - Constipation and other digestive disorders are common in older adults. The autonomic nervous system plays a critical role in regulating digestive motility in the intestinal tract. However, studies on age-related changes in autonomic function and receptor expression in the intestinal tract are limited. In this study, we examined the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the autonomic nervous system and the effects of acetylcholine and beta-agonists on intestinal contraction and relaxation in the jejunum of aged rats. Jejunal sections collected from male and female Wistar/ST rats aged 4, 11, and 18 months were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM2 and CHRM3) and beta-adrenergic receptors (beta 2-ADR and beta 3-ADR). The effects of acetylcholine, isoproterenol, and mirabegron were assessed in the isolated jejunum for each age group. There was no significant difference in CHRM2 receptor expression among the age groups; however, CHRM3 receptor expression decreased with age. Additionally, the sensitivity to acetylcholine-induced contractile responses decreased with age. Although beta 2-ADR receptor expression did not differ among the age groups, beta 3-ADR receptor expression increased with age. Despite this, the relaxation response to isoproterenol and mirabegron decreased with age. Our study revealed an age-related decrease in CHRM3 expression and the contractile response to acetylcholine in the small intestine of rats. Although beta-ADR expression, particularly beta 3-ADR, increased with age, the relaxation response to beta-adrenergic agonists gradually decreased.

AB  - Depressive illness has been associated with impaired cognitive processes accompanied by reduced neurotrophin levels, especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and dysfunctions in the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis. In addition, depression is characterized by a decreased functioning of the serotonergic system due to changes in the activity or expression of its receptors including, most significantly, 5-HT1A, 5HT2A, and 5-HT3 in brain regions that regulate mood, emotions, and memory, such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. In this regard, rats treated with clomipramine (CMI) in the neonatal stage show depression-like behaviors that persist into adulthood; hence, this constitutes an adequate model of depression for exploring various molecular aspects associated with the etiology of this disorder. This, study, then, was designed to analyze the long-term effects of early postnatal exposure to CMI on the expression of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5HT3 receptors, as well as BDNF and GR in the following brain regions: PFC, amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, which could be related to alterations in memory and learning, as evaluated using the novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM). Expression of the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT3 receptors, BDNF, and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was assessed by RT-qPCR in the four aforementioned brain regions, all of which play important roles in the control of memory and mood. Findings show that neonatal treatment with CMI causes alterations in memory and learning, as indicated by alterations in the results of the MWM and NOR tests. Expression of the 5-HT1A receptor increased in the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus, but decreased in the PFC, while the 5-HT2A and BDNF receptors decreased their expression in the PFC, amygdala, and hippocampus. There was no change in the expression of the 5-HT3 receptor. In addition, expression of GR in the hippocampus and PFC was low, but increased in the hypothalamus. Taken together, these data show that neonatal CMI treatment produces permanent molecular changes in brain regions related to learning and memory that could contribute to explaining the behavioral alterations observed in this model.

AB  - Vitrification procedures have become indispensable for the preservation of female germplasm and the storage and transport of embryos despite the potential detrimental effects on embryo viability. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of vitrification on porcine embryo developmental kinetics by time-lapse imaging. In the first comparison, cumulus enclosed oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage were either vitrified-warmed or not vitrified (control) prior to in vitro maturation (IVM) and artificial activation (AA). In the second comparison, pronuclear (PN) parthenotes produced after IVM and AA were either vitrified-warmed or not vitrified (control). Embryo development was monitored for 6 d using the Primo Vision time-lapse system, and corresponding cohorts were assessed after incubation under standard in vitro culture (IVC) conditions. The cumulative time taken to progress to most of the developmental stages was significantly longer for embryos of the vitrified groups than for those of the control groups. Analysing the duration for each developmental interval revealed that the 4- to 5cell and 5- to 8-cell periods were remarkably slower in the vitrified groups, compared with the control groups. The incidence of atypical blastomere divisions tended to increase following vitrification of GV oocytes. Under standard IVC conditions, blastocyst formation rates were lower for embryos of the vitrified groups than for those of the control groups. Given that the period of greatest developmental delay coincides with the major embryonic genome activation phase in porcine embryos, we propose that the vitrification of GV oocytes and PN parthenotes adversely impacts epigenetic processes.

We evaluated the co-circulation of the enteroviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in 81 sewage water samples collected between September 2021 and April 2023 from different regions of north and southeast Romania, at the border with Ukraine. We used, for the molecular detection of the pathogens, the multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay produced for respiratory samples and the Respiratory 2.1 Plus panel Biofire Film array. The isolation of enteroviruses was performed on cell culture lines, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. By molecular investigations, we detected the SARS-CoV-2 in 22 (27%) samples, and the human rhinovirus/enterovirus in 64 (79%) samples. By isolation on cell culture lines, 27 samples (33,33%) were positive for non-polio enteroviruses, and no poliovirus strains were isolated, proving the maintenance of the polio-free status in Romania. In an emergency situation, the molecular detection of the pathogens in sewage water using a PCR system integrating sample preparation, amplification, detection, and analysis in 1 h could be implemented.

AB  - Cinnamaldehyde has an effective antimicrobial activity and therefore it received interest as a feed additive in swine nutrition. However, its high reactivity to amino acid residues might affect its efficacy and digestive processes. As an alternative, 20 chemical derivatives were evaluated. The in vitro antimicrobial activities were tested in an in vitro fermentation model. Thereof three compounds were selected and fed to newly weaned piglets. Five dietary treatments were replicated in six pens of four pigs per pen; i.e. control, cinnamaldehyde at 100 and 400 mg/kg, and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, both equimolar to 400 mg/kg cinnamaldehyde. In vitro results showed that 4-nitrocinnamaldehyde has the highest antimicrobial activity; however, this compound is carcinogenic and was not further issued. Cinnamaldehyde had the second-highest activity, particularly against coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli), followed by 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde. All other derivatives showed lower potency, but they were consistently more bactericidal against coliform bacteria and E. coli as compared to Gram-positive bacteria. At pH 7, aldehydes showed stronger bactericidal activity than their corresponding carboxylic acids, which was not the case at pH 5, suggesting a different mode of action. In the in vivo trial, no significant improvements in animal performance or antimicrobial effects were observed. To conclude, apart from 4-nitrocinnamaldehyde, none of the derivatives showed higher antimicrobial potency than cinnamaldehyde. Three selected compounds from in vitro trials failed to demonstrate major positive outcomes in the in vivo trial.

AB  - Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease with constantly evolving pathogens, poses risks to both human and animal health. We investigated the prevalence of Leptospira spp. among horses in Ukraine from 2007 to 2021, encompassing clinical and subclinical cases. The study utilized data from the State Research Institute for Laboratory Diagnostics and Veterinary and Sanitary Expertise (2007-2021) to analyze leptospirosis prevalence in Ukrainian horses. Seroprevalence was calculated for each region. Equine leptospirosis outbreaks were retrospectively analyzed based on serological data from microagglutination reaction (MRA) studies using eight major serogroups. A geospatial analysis, utilizing quantile classification with five data classes, was conducted. Spanning 2007-2021, our analysis evaluated the prevalence and dynamics of equine leptospirosis in Ukraine. Serum samples tested for Leptospira antibodies exhibited varying dynamics over this period, with the highest and lowest rates observed in different years. Among the 125,101 horse serum samples analyzed, 10.8% tested positive for leptospirosis. The incidence rate fluctuated, peaking in certain years. The dominant serovars were Copenhageni (32.8%), Bratislava (16.1%), Grippotyphosa (15.4%), and Canicola (13.2%), while mixed reactions constituted 55.1% of positive cases. The analysis also revealed shifts in the prevalence of specific serovars over time. Geospatial analysis showcased the distribution of positive cases for each serovar across Ukraine's regions. The highest infection rates were observed in the eastern and northern regions, each characterized by distinct serovar prevalence. The etiologic composition map depicted varying serovar proportions among different regions. Furthermore, the density map delineated regions with different risk levels, with several regions falling into the "very high risk" category, while others like Odesa and Lviv were classified as low risk due to fewer positive leptospirosis cases. Detection of specific serovars like Tarassovi, Pomona, and Canicola in horses points to potential pathogen sources such as cattle, pigs, and dogs. The dominance of serovar Copenhageni (serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae), accounting for 32.8% of seropositivity, reflects close contact with rodents, recognized reservoirs of this serogroup. These findings illuminate the evolving prevalence and distribution of leptospirosis in Ukrainian horses, offering vital insights for targeted interventions and disease management strategies. The insights garnered from this study can hold significant value for equine veterinarians, aiding the development of tailored preventive and control measures adapted to specific regions with varying risk levels. Our research offers a comprehensive examination of equine leptospirosis from both ecological and geographical perspectives, unveiling pivotal observations.

AB  - The Dwarf Marsupial Frog, Flectonotus fitzgeraldi (family Hemiphractidae), has been reported to occur only in Trinidad, Tobago, and the Paria Range of Venezuela. This species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, based on its small geographic distribution and the fragmentation of its habitat, which is said to be declining both in extent and quality. Using molecular methods, we confirm herein that the three populations do belong to the same species. However, extensive presence/absence and focused population surveys show that the frog's distribution is more extensive than previously reported in both Trinidad and Venezuela. In Trinidad and Tobago, the frog is abundant in forests wherever its host plants occur, notably the bromeliad Heliconia bihai (Balisier in Trinidad; Bijao in Venezuela) and the aroid Xanthosoma jacquinii (Elephant's Ear). In Venezuela, the species is frequently found where there is suitable habitat, but an exhaustive population study is needed to diagnose its current situation. No evidence was found of habitat decline in Trinidad and Tobago, but in Venezuela the loss of habitat is evident, mainly because of subsistence agricultural activities, which have been developing in northeast Venezuela since at least 1930. The Red List status of this species is in need of revision.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Melatonin improves the quality and in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes under heat stress. Melatonin treatment counteracts the adverse effects induced by heat stress (HS), such as the poor survival rate and maturation rate, distribution of alpha-tubulin and F-actin, expression of NRF2 and GDF9 mRNA. However, HS and melatonin have similar effects on increasing expression of HSP70 and NRF2 mRNA. Furthermore, HS inhibits expression of GDF9 mRNA.
   Melatonin enhances the quality and in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes under heat stress (HS), but the mechanism of melatonin in reducing HS injury on oocytes is not fully understood. In this study, porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were randomly divided into three groups. The COCs of the control group were cultured at 38.5 degrees C for 42 h, and the COCs of the HS group were cultured at 41.5 degrees C for 4 h, and then transferred into 38.5 degrees C for 38 h. The COCs of the HS + melatonin group were cultured with 10(-9) M melatonin under the same conditions as the HS group. The survival rate, maturation rate, distribution of alpha-tubulin and F-actin of the oocytes were assessed. In addition, the expression profiles for genes related to the oocyte maturation, including heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that HS decreased the survival rate and maturation rate, distribution of alpha-tubulin and F-actin, but melatonin treatment could partly counteract these adverse effects. In addition, HS increased expression of HSP70 and NRF2 mRNA, and melatonin treatment had a similar effect on HSP70 expression, but had a contrary effect on NRF2 expression. Furthermore, HS inhibited expression of CDK1 and GDF9 mRNA, but melatonin treatment could weaken the effect on GDF9 expression induced by HS. In summary, melatonin treatment could attenuate the unfavorable effects induced by HS to enhance developmental competence of porcine oocytes during IVM.

AB  - Heath monitors (Varanus rosenbergi) are arguably the most thoroughly studied Australian varanid, largely stemming from long-term research on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. However, research on other populations within this species' disjunct distribution is limited. We opportunistically tracked a heath monitor in the Little Desert National Park, Victoria, after it consumed a painted dragon (Ctenophorus pictus) which we were radiotracking for another study. We report the first record of a heath monitor depredating a painted dragon, as well as the first record of heath monitors repeatedly using a hollow log for shelter. The hollow log was occupied on 10 consecutive occasions over 18 days, and then again on five occasions 9-11 months later. Our observations identify hollow logs as a habitat resource which should be considered in conservation strategies for this threatened monitor lizard. Furthermore, we observed two individuals in close proximity, possibly a breeding pair, in January. This implies that breeding may occur in summer for the Victorian mallee population, as has been reported in other populations, rather than in spring as has been speculated. Research is sorely needed across this species' disjunct distribution across southern Australia. To date, populations of heath monitors in the Victorian mallee have garnered no scientific study, despite their listing as Critically Endangered.

AB  - In this observational retrospective study, an outbreak of Staphylococcus aureus abscesses was correlated with the presence of sharp edges in damaged plastic environmental enrichment within the cages. In 2010, Lawson reported cases of S. aureus mandibulofacial and maxillofacial abscess in mice and proposed excessive barbering or grooming, leading to the mastication and fragmentation of hair, as an aetiopathogenesis of S. aureus abscesses. In contrast, in this study, the presence of hair was not found in any of the histopathology, and abscesses were present in the periorbital area. S. aureus colonises the skin, nasopharynx and intestines, and may cause pyogenic infections if a breach in local defences promotes staphylococcal invasion. Whole genome sequencing and analysis supported the hypothesis that this outbreak resulted from clonal expansion of S. aureus infected C57BL6/J mice imported into the area and infection transmission from humans to mice was ruled out. An additional aetiopathogenesis is proposed for S. aureus abscesses with the sharp edges of damaged plastic environmental enrichment items leading to oral mucosal injury allowing S. aureus entrance into tissues, its carriage into the submucosa, followed by abscess formation.

AB  - Simple Summary Maternal behaviour is a common trait in many mammalian species, and mothers can invest a lot of energy in parental care, ensuring a higher probability of survival for their infants. An interesting question is whether these behaviours are influenced by particular mechanisms and how the offspring can effectively attract the mother's attention. In order to try to answer this question, we studied a group of sows reared in northern Italy (ethical farm Parva Domus, Cavagnolo, Turin) in which lactating and non-lactating females were present. Isolation calls emitted by the piglets were able to generate a state of anxiety in the mothers and can be therefore a valid example of a useful mechanism to request maternal care effectively. Furthermore, we not only observed that lactating females responded and reacted more to the vocalisations of piglets from other broods, but also that less aggressive mothers responded more. Finally, we found that certain vocalisation characteristics may influence the type of response by the mothers. Therefore, several factors seem to play a key role in eliciting response behaviour in sows. Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) possess complex socio-cognitive skills, and sows show high inter-individual variability in maternal behaviour. To evaluate how females-reared under natural conditions-react to the isolation calls of their own piglets or those of other females, we conducted observations and experimental trials. In January-February 2021, we conducted all-occurrences sampling on affiliation, aggression, and lactation (daily, 7:30-16:30 h) on six lactating and four non-lactating females at the ethical farm Parva Domus (Turin, Italy). The trials (30 s each, n = 37/sow) consisted of briefly catching and restraining a piglet. We recorded the sow response (none/reactive/proactive movement towards the piglet; self-directed anxiety behaviours such as body shaking) before and during the trial and under control conditions. Increased levels of anxiety behaviour in sows were accompanied by an increased frequency of responses. Less aggressive sows and lactating sows showed the highest frequencies of response. Finally, the isolation calls' maximum intensity had an influence on the type of response observed, with higher proactive response frequencies following lower intensity isolation calls. Our results suggest that being under lactation could play a key role in increasing sow response levels and that specific acoustic features may influence the response.

AB  - BackgroundPennycress and camelina are two important novel biofuel oilseed crop species. Their seeds contain high content of oil that can be easily converted into biodiesel or jet fuel, while the left-over materials are usually made into press cake meals for feeding livestock. Therefore, the ability to manipulate the seed coat encapsulating the oil- and protein-rich embryos is critical for improving seed oil production and press cake quality.ResultsHere, we tested the promoter activity of two Arabidopsis seed coat genes, AtTT10 and AtDP1, in pennycress and camelina by using eGFP and GUS reporters. Overall, both promoters show high levels of activities in the seed coat in these two biofuel crops, with very low or no expression in other tissues. Importantly, AtTT10 promoter activity in camelina shows differences from that in Arabidopsis, which highlights that the behavior of an exogenous promoter in closely related species cannot be assumed the same and still requires experimental determination.ConclusionOur work demonstrates that AtTT10 and AtDP1 promoters are suitable for driving gene expression in the outer integument of the seed coat in pennycress and camelina.

AB  - The High-Pressure Plankton Observatory (HiPPO) is designed to quantify motions of zooplankton for behavioral study, including swimming and metabolic responses to environmental perturbations. It builds on prior chamber designs while filling gaps in capability for resolving orientation of small (< 1 mm) plankton, tracking their movements over ecologically relevant spatial scales, and recording in flow-through conditions on a vessel at sea. The HiPPO chamber has a direct light path for silhouette imaging of zooplankton as they move vertically and horizontally across a 3.56 cm diameter viewing area. Seawater forced by a high-performance liquid chromatography pump is exchanged continuously through the chamber, but flushing of zooplankton is prevented by fine mesh at the ports. A high-resolution camera/computer setup enables sustained imaging of plankton motions for quantitative analysis. Application of HiPPO to an investigation of larval behavior of deep-sea hydrothermal vent species revealed swimming behaviors similar to those of shallow-water species, including upward and downward helices, meandering, and short hovers. In conditions with microbial biofilm (a potential settlement cue) on a 2024 expedition, vent larvae unexpectedly swam rapidly upward in tight helices at velocities (0.15 cm s(-1)) higher than those observed in prior experiments with no biofilm (0.03 cm s(-1)). Many factors varied between the 2024 and earlier trials, so the difference cannot be attributed with certainty to a cue response. This study describes key new features of HiPPO and demonstrates the system's ability to document novel zooplankton behavior.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is a remote effect of gamma radiation treatment of malignancies. The major part of the studies on the effect of proton irradiation (a promising alternative in the treatment of radio-resistant tumors and tumors located close to critical organs) on the cognitive abilities of laboratory animals and their relation to morphological changes in the brain is rather contradictory. The aim of this study was to investigate cognitive functions and the dynamics of changes in morphological parameters of hippocampal microglial cells after 7.5 Gy of proton irradiation. Two months after the cranial irradiation, 8- to 9-week-old male SHK mice were tested for total activity, spatial learning, as well as long- and short-term hippocampus-dependent memory. To estimate the morphological parameters of microglia, brain slices of control and irradiated animals each with different time after proton irradiation (24 h, 7 days, 1 month) were stained for microglial marker Iba-1. No changes in behavior or deficits in short-term and long-term hippocampus-dependent memory were found, but an impairment of episodic memory was observed. A change in the morphology of hippocampal microglial cells, which is characteristic of the transition of cells to an activated state, was detected. One day after proton exposure in the brain tissue, a slight decrease in cell density was observed, which was restored to the control level by the 30th day after treatment. The results obtained may be promising with regard to the future use of using high doses of protons per fraction in the irradiation of tumors.

AB  - There is great current interest in the field of plant acoustics, including the potential for plants to both perceive and produce acoustic cues. Many plants emit high-frequency clicks under water stress or injury, and the growing root tips of corn seedlings produce audio-frequency clicks. We investigated the possibility that rapid plant movements produce acoustic cues in the form of plant-borne vibration, focusing on the leaf-folding movements of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica. We induced leaf-folding while recording vibrations from the leaf base using a laser vibrometer. Having recorded characteristic and relatively high-amplitude vibrations, we then assessed the source of the vibrations: the physiologic motor that drives movement, or the contact between moving parts of the leaf. Vibrations were produced when folding pinnules contacted neighboring pinnules and the rachis of the stem. The frequency range and amplitude of the vibrations are comparable to other vibrational cues that both plants and insects perceive and respond to. In nature, leaf folding is induced by contact with potential herbivores. Potential receivers of leaf-folding vibrations include the attacking herbivore, for which the leaf movement and vibration may constitute a multimodal startle display; nearby predatory insects, for which the vibration provides a cue of prey location; and leaves on the same or neighboring plants.

AB  - This study integrated machine learning and multi-linear regression modeling approaches in groundwater quality assessment around Obosi, SE Nigeria with the aim of predicting groundwater quality parameters. 42 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for physical (Ec and pH) and heavy metals (As, Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, Pb) using standard methods. The result of physicochemical assessment revealed that Ec, pH, Cr, and Ni were within the recommended standard whereas Cd, Fe, Pb, and As were above with a heavy metal trend spread of Fe > Pb > As > Cd > Cr > Ni. The study area's aquiferous materials are highly permeable and relatively shallow, hence the observed groundwater contamination. Contamination factor results showed that the entire samples were not contaminated, except which had majority of its samples having very high degree of contamination. Pollution load index (PLI) values revealed excellent groundwater quality. The Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HEI), Potential ecological risk index (ERI) and modified degree of contamination (mCd) values reveal that majority of the entire groundwater sample has high contamination. Elemental Contamination Index and overall Metal Contamination Index (MCI) values in the entire sample were less than 5 which implies that they have very low contamination. Water quality index (WQI) and Pollution index of groundwater (PIG) values showed that the water quality is unsuitable for drinking and it requires treatment before usage. Correlation matrix result showed no correlation between the parameters. Principal component analysis results showed that there were loading between parameters. Eight (8) Artificial neural networks (ANN) and multi-linear regression (MLR) models were developed with very high R-2 values, showing that they are efficacious and reliable for the forecasting of the pollution indices. Based on the respective performances, ANN and MLR models should be considered for additional investigation since they showed a high viable inclination in the forecasting of PLI, Igeo, HEI, mCd, ERI, MCI, WQI and PIG.

AB  - In recent decades, glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) have been extensively used in agriculture all over the world. Initially, they were considered safe, but rising evidence suggests that these molecules reach the central nervous system producing metabolic, functional, and permanent alterations that impact cognition and behavior. This theoretical and non-systematic review involved searching, integrating, and analyzing preclinical evidence regarding the effects of acute, sub -chronic, and chronic exposure to glyphosate and GBH on cognition, behavior, neural activity, and development in adult and juvenile rodents following perinatal exposition. In addition, this review gathers the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of glyphosate mediating cognitive and behavioral alterations. Furthermore, clinical evidence of the effects of exposition to GBH on human health and its possible link with several neurological disorders was revised.

AB  - Aim: Activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasome is an essential contributor to neuroinflammation underlying HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). Under pathological conditions, microglia-derived-EVs (MDEVs) can affect neuronal functions by delivering neurotoxic mediators to recipient cells. However, the role of microglial NLRP3 in mediating neuronal synaptodendritic injury has remained unexplored to date. In the present study, we sought to assess the regulatory role of HIV-1 Tat induced microglial NLRP3 in neuronal synaptodendritic injury. We hypothesized that HIV-1 Tat mediated microglia EVs carrying significant levels of NLRP3 contribute to the synaptodendritic injury, thereby affecting the maturation of neurons. Methods: To understand the cross-talk between microglia and neuron, we isolated EVs from BV2 and human primary microglia (HPM) cells with or without NLRP3 depletion using siNLRP3 RNA. EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation, characterized by ZetaView nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and western blot analysis for exosome markers. Purified EVs were exposed to primary rat neurons isolated from E18 rats. Along with green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid transfection, immunocytochemistry was performed to visualize neuronal synaptodendritic injury. Western blotting was employed to measure siRNA transfection efficiency and the extent of neuronal synaptodegeneration. Images were captured in confocal microscopy, and subsequently, Sholl analysis was performed for analyzing dendritic spines using neuronal reconstruction software Neurolucida 360. Electrophysiology was performed on hippocampal neurons for functional assessment. Results: Our findings demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat induced expression of microglial NLRP3 and IL1 beta, and further that these were packaged in microglial exosomes (MDEV) and were also taken up by the neurons. Exposure of rat primary neurons to microglial Tat-MDEVs resulted in downregulation of synaptic proteins- PSD95, synaptophysin, excitatory vGLUT1, as well as upregulation of inhibitory proteins- Gephyrin, GAD65, thereby implicating impaired neuronal transmissibility. Our findings also showed that Tat-MDEVs not only caused loss of dendritic spines but also affected numbers of spine sub-types- mushroom and stubby. Synaptodendritic injury further affected functional impairment as evidenced by the decrease in miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). To assess the regulatory role of NLRP3 in this process, neurons were also exposed to Tat-MDEVs from NLRP3 silenced microglia. Tat-MDEVs from NLRP3 silenced microglia exerted a protective role on neuronal synaptic proteins, spine density as well as mEPSCs. Conclusion: In summary, our study underscores the role of microglial NLRP3 as an important contributor to TatMDEV mediated synaptodendritic injury. While the role of NLRP3 in inflammation is well-described, its role in EVmediated neuronal damage is an interesting finding, implicating it as a target for therapeutics in HAND.

AB  - Depression in astronauts is one of the consequences of space flight effects, negatively impacting their work performances. Unfortunately, the underlying molecular mechanisms in space flight-induced depression are still unknown; however, various neuropsychiatric disorders reported that overexpressed NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the brain triggers various pathological pathways, and inhibiting NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex asserts antidepressant effects. Through our in silico analysis, we found that epigenetic regulator miR-445-3p targets PSD-95 and is hypothesized to down-regulate NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex to prevent neuronal damage associated with depression. Therefore, the present study is aimed to determine the novel insight of the miR-455-3p against the NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the neurobiology of space flight-induced depressive behavior. Using a simulated space environment complex model (SCSE) for 21 days, we induced depressive behavior in rats to analyze miR-455-3p expression and NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the cortex and hippocampus of the SCSE depressed rats through qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Further, an in vitro microgravity model using rat hippocampus cell lines (RHNC) was utilized to identify the independent role of miR-455-3p on (1) NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex and TrKB-BDNF proteins, (2) oxidative stress, (3) nitric oxide level, (4) inflammatory cytokines, (5) mitochondrial biogenesis/ dynamics, and (6) cell survival. Our results showed that miR-455-3p regulates NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the SCSE depressed rats in opposite ways, with the cortex revealing a higher level of miR-455-3p and low-level NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex and the hippocampus showing down-regulated miR-455-3p and up-regulated NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex, indicating a region-specific change in the miR-455-3p and NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the SCSE depressed rats. Further RHNC results also confirmed down-regulated miR-455-3p and up-regulated NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex expression, similar to the findings in the hippocampus of SCSE rats, suggesting that microgravity influences miR-455-3p and associated changes. Additional investigations revealed that miR-455-3p targets PSD-95 and co-regulates NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex along with TrkB-BDNF signaling and exert protective effects against NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, inflammatory cytokines, and mitochondrial defects, suggesting a valuable biomarker for devising depressive disorders.

AB  - Commons (or common-pool resources) are inherently dynamic. Factors that appear to contribute to the evolution of a stable commons regime at one time and place may undergo change that results in the collapse of the commons at another. The factors involved can be very diverse. Economic, social, environmental and political conditions and various drivers may lead to commonisation, a process through which a resource is converted into a joint-use regime under commons institutions and collective action. Conversely, they may lead to decommonisation, a process through which a commons loses these essential characteristics. Evolution through commonisation may be manifested as adaptation or fine-tuning over time. They may instead result in the replacement of one kind of property rights regime by another, as in the enclosure movement in English history that resulted in the conversion of sheep grazing commons into privatized agricultural land. These processes of change can be viewed from an evolutionary perspective using the concepts of commonisation and decommonisation, and theorized as a two-way process over time, with implications for the sustainability of joint resources from local to global.

AB  - Background: Tong-Qiao-Huo-Xue Decoction (TQHXD) is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula widely used in the treatment of vascular dementia (VD). Although it has demonstrated good clinical efficacy, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects on VD remain unclear. Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanisms of TQHXD to provide a scientific basis for the clinical treatment of VD. Methods: The chemical components of TQHXD were qualitatively analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). Network pharmacology predicted the potential protective mechanisms of TQHXD against VD. A rat model of VD was established through bilateral vessel occlusion (2-VO), and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model was used to induce damage to neuronal cells of the hippocampus. In vivo experiments assessed changes in cerebral blood flow, learning and memory capabilities, hippocampal neuronal morphology, dendritic length, dendritic spine density, and synapse number in rats. We examined the expression of synaptic remodeling-related proteins and pathway proteins in the hippocampal region. In vitro assays evaluated cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and expression of synaptic remodeling-related proteins and signaling pathway. Results: Multiple active components were identified in TQHXD. KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that the therapeutic effects of TQHXD on VD may be related to the cAMP signaling pathway. Treatment with TQHXD significantly improved learning and memory performance in VD rats, improved hippocampus morphology, and increased dendritic length, dendritic spine density, and number of synapses. Furthermore, TQHXD improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis, and decreased intracellular ROS levels in vitro. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results collectively demonstrated that TQHXD upregulated the expression of synaptic remodeling-related proteins and pathway-related proteins both in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions: TQHXD treated VD by promoting synaptic remodeling in hippocampal neurons, likely through activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from fetal adnexa namely amniotic membrane/epithelium, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord have hogged the limelight in recent times, as a proposed alternative to MSCs from conventional sources. These cells which are identified as being in a developmentally primitive state have many advantages, the most important being the non-invasive nature of their isolation procedures, absence of ethical concerns, proliferation potential, differentiation abilities and low immunogenicity. In the present review, we are focusing on the potential preclinical and clinical applications of different cell types of fetal adnexa, in wound healing therapy. We also discuss the isolation-culture methods, cell surface marker expression, multi-lineage differentiation abilities, immune-modulatory capabilities and their homing property. Different mechanisms involved in the wound healing process and the role of stromal cells in therapeutic wound healing are highlighted. Further, we summarize the findings of the cell delivery systems in skin lesion models and paracrine functions of their secretome in the wound healing process. Overall, this holistic review outlines the research findings of fetal adnexa derived MSCs, their usefulness in wound healing therapy in human as well as in veterinary medicine.

AB  - The activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) and the deterioration of spatial memory represent prominent pathological and clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the precise intrinsic mechanisms linking these pathological features remain poorly elucidated. In this study, we identified significant upregulation of GSK-3 beta activity in inhibitory interneurons within the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of 3xTg-AD mice. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that targeted overexpression of GSK-3 beta in these interneurons triggered aberrant activation of neural stem cells (NSCs), culminating in apoptotic cell death and consequent deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Utilizing in vivo fiber-optic recording techniques, we further established that GSK-3 beta overexpression in DG inhibitory interneurons elicited hyperactivation of excitatory neurons, thereby disrupting the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance within the DG circuitry. Notably, these pathological alterations were ameliorated through chemogenetic suppression of excitatory neuronal activity. Mechanistically, we determined that impaired GABAergic transmission, characterized by reduced GABA release in the DG region, underlies these observed effects. Pharmacological intervention with GABA receptor agonists effectively rescued AHN impairment and attenuated spatial cognitive deficits. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GSK-3 beta overexpression in GABAergic interneurons compromises AHN and promotes NSC apoptosis via disruption of GABAergic signaling, while pharmacological potentiation of GABAergic transmission exerts neuroprotective effects. This study elucidates a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to AHN impairment in AD and identifies a promising therapeutic target for pro-neurogenic strategies.

AB  - Chemical signals are pivotal in establishing tritrophic interactions among host plants, herbivorous insects, and natural enemies. Previous studies have shown that evolutionarily conserved MaltOBPs in Monochamus alternatus and DhelOBPs in Dastarcus helophoroides contribute to the establishment of pine-pest- natural enemy tritrophic interactions by recognizing the same volatile emitted by the host during crucial developmental stages. We hypothesized that the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of evolutionarily conserved OBPs respectively from pests and enemies are similar. In this study, we identified the promoter region of DhelOBP22 through chromosome walking and discovered that transcription factor BarH1, which have been proved to regulate the expression of MaltOBP19 in M. alternatus, regulates the expression of DhelOBP22 by binding to its promoter region, as evidenced by dual-luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). When the BarH1 gene was silenced using RNAi, the expression of DhelOBP22 was inhibited, leading to the disappearance of the attracted behavior of mated female D. helophoroides adults towards camphene. This study underscores that conserved transcriptional regulation mechanisms play a role in regulating the expression of evolutionarily conserved OBPs respectively from herbivores and natural enemies.

AB  - Extracellular matrix-derived biomaterials, such as gelatin-based hy-drogels, are attractive candidates for sealing internal leakages. However, gelatin derivatives are brittle and suffer from poor adhe-sion. Modifications of gelatin with adhesive catechol moieties have been limited to low degrees of substitution. Here, we propose oxidative oligomerization of catecholic compounds (namely, caf-feic acid [CA]) prior to the coupling reaction to augment the num-ber and availability of grafted catechol groups per carbodiimide conjugation reaction, thereby achieving robust bioadhesion. Ex vivo adhesion tests on pig lungs suggests -33 improvement in adhesion strength compared with gelatin methacryloyl controls due to their enhanced cohesion (i.e., X5.33 and X11.53 improve-ments in stretchability and toughness, respectively). Functionaliza-tion of gelatin with CA oligomers enables rapid formation of physical gels upon exposure to room temperature, tunes the vis-cosity of the gelatin-caffeic acid pre-gel solution for controllable injectability onto multiply curved tissues, and boosts the antioxi-dant effects of CA.

AB  - Disrupted glutamate clearance in the synaptic cleft leads to synaptic dysfunction and neurological diseases. Decreased glutamate removal from the synaptic cleft is known to cause excitotoxicity. Data on the physiological effects of increased glutamate clearance are contradictory. This study investigated the consequences of ceftriaxone (CTX), an enhancer of glutamate transporter 1 expression, treatment on long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of young rats. In this study, 5-day administration of CTX (200 mg/kg) significantly weakened LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses. As shown by electrophysiological recordings, LTP attenuation was associated with weakening of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent signaling in synapses. However, PCR analysis did not show downregulation of NMDAR subunits or changes in the expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunits. We assume that extracellular burst stimulation activates fewer synapses in CTX-treated animals because increased glutamate reuptake results in reduced spillover, and neighboring synapses do not participate in neurotransmission. Attenuation of LTP was not accompanied by noticeable behavioral changes in the CTX group, with no behavioral abnormalities observed in the open field test or Morris water maze test. Thus, our experiments show that increased glutamate clearance can impair long-term synaptic plasticity and that this phenomenon can be considered a potential side effect of CTX treatment.

AB  - This study develops an observational model to assess kidney function recovery and xenogeneic immune responses in kidney xenotransplants, focusing on gene editing and immunosuppression. Two brain-dead patients undergo single kidney xenotransplantation, with kidneys donated by minipigs genetically modified to include triple-gene knockouts (GGTA1, b4GalNT2, CMAH) and human gene transfers (hCD55 or hCD55/ hTBM). Renal xenograft functions are fully restored; however, immunosuppression without CD40-CD154 pathway blockade is ineffective in preventing acute rejection by day 12. This rejection manifests as both T cell-mediated rejection and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), confirmed by natural killer (NK) cell and macrophage infiltration in sequential xenograft biopsies. Despite donor pigs being pathogen free before transplantation, xenografts and recipient organs test positive for porcine cytomegalovirus/porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) by the end of the observation period, indicating reactivation and contributing to significant immunopathological changes. This study underscores the critical need for extended clinical observation and comprehensive evaluation using deceased human models to advance xenograft success.

AB  - Despite four decades of effort, robust propagation of pluripotent stem cells from livestock animals remains challenging. The requirements for self-renewal are unclear and the relationship of cultured stem cells to pluripotent cells resident in the embryo uncertain. Here, we avoided using feeder cells or serum factors to provide a defined culture microenvironment. We show that the combination of activin A, fibroblast growth factor and the Wnt inhibitor XAV939 (AFX) supports establishment and continuous expansion of pluripotent stem cell lines from porcine, ovine and bovine embryos. Germ layer differentiation was evident in teratomas and readily induced in vitro. Global transcriptome analyses highlighted commonality in transcription factor expression across the three species, while global comparison with porcine embryo stages showed proximity to bilaminar disc epiblast. Clonal genetic manipulation and gene targeting were exemplified in porcine stem cells. We further demonstrated that genetically modified AFX stem cells gave rise to cloned porcine foetuses by nuclear transfer. In summary, for major livestock mammals, pluripotent stem cells related to the formative embryonic disc are reliably established using a common and defined Signalling environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It was demonstrated that external stress, such as in vitro maturation (IVM) and vitrification process can induce significantly reduced development capacity in oocytes. Previous studies indicated that antioxidants play a pivotal part in the acquisition of adaptation in changed conditions. At present, the role of the natural potent antioxidant PCB2 in response to IVM and vitrification during ovine oocyte manipulation has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether PCB2 treatment could improve the developmental potential of ovine oocytes under IVM and vitrification stimuli.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiment was divided into two parts. Firstly, the effect of PCB2 on the development of oocytes during IVM was evaluated. Un-supplemented and 5 mu g/mL PCB2-supplemented in the IVM solution were considered as control and experimental groups (C + 5 mu g/mL PCB2). The polar body extrusion (PBE) rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and early apoptosis of oocytes were measured after IVM. Secondly, we further determine whether PCB2 could improve oocyte quality under vitrification stress. The survival rate, PBE rate and early apoptosis of oocytes were compared between fresh group, vitrified group and 5 mu g/mL PCB2-supplemented in the IVM solution after vitrification (V + 5 mu g/mL PCB2).RESULTS: Compared to the control group, adding PCB2 significantly increased PBE rate (79.4% vs. 62.8%, P < 0.01) and MMP level (1.9 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.04, P < 0.01), and decreased ROS level (47.1 +/- 6.3 vs. 145.3 +/- 8.9, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in ATP content and early apoptosis. Compared to the fresh group, vitrification significantly reduced oocytes viability (43.0% vs. 90.8%, P < 0.01) as well as PBE rate (24.2% vs. 60.6%, P < 0.05). However, 5 mu g/mL PCB2-supplemention during maturation had no effect on survival, PBE or early apoptosis in vitrified oocytes.CONCLUSION: PCB2 could effectively antagonise the oxidative stress during IVM and promote oocyte development.

AB  - Negative experiences during adolescence, such as social isolation (SI), bullying, and abuse, increase the risk of psychiatric diseases in adulthood. However, the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases induced by these factors remain poorly understood. In adolescents, stress affects the intestinal homeostasis in the gut-brain axis. This study determined whether adolescent SI induces behavioral abnormalities by disrupting colonic function. Adolescent mice exposed to SI exhibit spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in the hippocampus (HIP). SI decreased the differentiation of mucin-producing goblet cells, which was accompanied by alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota, particularly the depletion of mucin-feeding bacteria. Treatment with rebamipide, which promotes goblet cell differentiation in the colon, attenuated SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in the HIP and decreased cystine, a downstream metabolite of homocysteine. Treatment with cystine ameliorated SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and increased microglial C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) levels in the HIP. Inhibition of CCL7 receptors by antagonists of CC motif chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 3 (CCR3) in the HIP prevented spatial cognitive deficits induced by SI. Infusion of CCL7 into the HIP following microglial ablation with clodronate liposome induced spatial cognitive deficits. These findings suggest that adolescent SI decreases serum cystine levels by damaging the colonic goblet cells, resulting in spatial cognitive deficits by triggering microglial activation in the HIP. Our results indicate that increased CCL7 expression in hippocampal microglia may contribute to spatial cognitive deficits by activating CCR2 and CCR3.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the endothelial cell density (ECD) and hexagonality of the cornea in the different regions of healthy swine corneal endothelium using specular microscopy. Twenty-four eyeballs from 12 male, 6-month-old Large White pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) were studied. Contact specular microscopy was performed in the central, superior, inferior, lateral and medial regions. The corneal parameters analysed in this study were ECD and hexagonality. The ECD in the central region was 1865 cells/mm2; in the upper region, it was 1877 cells/mm2, in the lower region, it was 1854 cells/mm2, in the lateral region, it was 1847 cells/mm2, in the medial region, it was 1831 cells/mm2. Hexagonality in the central region, was 53%; in the upper region, it was 54%, in the lower region, it was 54%, in the lateral region, it was 54%, in the medial region, it was 54%. There was no significant difference regarding to the evaluated parameters in all corneal regions evaluated. No statistically significantly differences were observed in ECD and hexagonality between the left and the right eyes. This study demonstrates that ECD and hexagonality of the central cornea area represent the entire endothelial mosaic.

AB  - Vocal recognition is widespread in the animal kingdom, and a necessary tool for offspring survival in some groups. Temporal patterns of animal vocalisations can facilitate communication and convey information such as identity, emotional state, or motivation of the caller. While pinniped (i.e., walrus, eared and true seals) vocalisations are generally well studied, and captive pinnipeds show strong timing abilities, little is known about the temporal structure of their calls in the wild. Here, we followed Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) during spontaneous search efforts at the Cape Cross Seal Reserve in Namibia. To investigate the temporal and rhythmic patterning of Cape fur seal attraction calls, we analysed call bouts of 80 mothers and 148 pups. We assessed the relative vocal efforts undertaken by mothers and pups by calculating calling rates, inter-call intervals (periods of silence between vocalisations), and the total time spent calling per bout. To explore the rhythmic structure of the calls, we visualised their temporal patterns by plotting the calling events and frequency histograms of the inter-onset-intervals between each two consecutive vocalisations in a bout. A normalized Pairwise Variability Index was calculated for each individual to investigate underlying patterns and compared between mothers and pups. Pups produced more calls per search, vocalised at higher rates, and took shorter breaks between consecutive vocalisations than females. Even though female vocalisations were much longer, there was no significant difference in the total time females and pups spent vocalising per bout. All animals vocalised at seemingly random intervals, with no distinguishable rhythmic pattern, suggesting that these do not encode identity information during mother-pup reunions. However, numerical analysis showed a potential asynchronous patterning within the age classes, possibly used in anti-masking. Our results indicate that Cape fur seal females and pups invest their energy differently during a search, and while their total calling effort is comparable, reunions seem to be driven mostly by the young.

In sheep, the leptin surge is eliminated with maternal overnutrition and an elevated dam body condition score (BCS), but this has not been assessed in dairy cattle. The aim of this study was to characterize the neonatal profile of leptin, cortisol and other key metabolites in calves born to Holstein cows with a range of BCS. Dam BCS was determined 21 d before expected parturition. Blood was collected from calves within 4 h of birth (d 0), and on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Serum was analyzed for concentrations of leptin, cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides, and total protein (TP). Statistical analysis was performed separately for calves sired by Holstein (HOL) or Angus (HOL-ANG) bulls. Leptin tended to decrease after birth in HOL calves, but there was no evidence of an association between leptin and BCS. For HOL calves, the cortisol level increased with an increasing dam BCS on day 0 only. Dam BCS was variably associated with the calf BHB and TP levels, depending on the sire breed and day of age. Further investigation is required to elucidate the impacts of maternal dietary and energy status during gestation on offspring metabolism and performance, in addition to the potential impact of the absence of a leptin surge on long-term feed intake regulation in dairy cattle.

AB  - Despite advances in the management of iron deficiency in heart failure (HF), the mechanisms underlying the effects of treatment remain to be established. Iron distribution and metabolism in HF pathogenesis need to be clarified. We used a porcine tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy model to find out how HF development influences hepatic and myocardial iron storing, focusing on ferritin, the main iron storage protein. We found that cumulative liver congestion (due to the decrease of heart function) overwhelms its capacity to recycle iron from erythrocytes. As a consequence, iron is trapped in the liver as poorly mobilized hemosiderin. What is more, the ferritin-bound Fe3+ (reflecting bioavailable iron stores), and assembled ferritin (reflecting ability to store iron) are decreased in HF progression in the liver. We demonstrate that while HF pigs show iron deficiency indices, erythropoiesis is enhanced. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation and hepatic hepcidin suppression might indicate stress erythropoiesisinduced in HF. Furthermore, assembled ferritin increases but ferritin-bound Fe3+ is reduced in myocardium, indicating that a failing heart increases the iron storage reserve but iron deficiency leads to a drop in myocardial iron stores. Together, HF in pigs leads to down-regulated iron bioavailability and reduced hepatic iron storage making iron unavailable for systemic/cardiac needs.

AB  - Vision plays an essential role in the life of many animals. While most mammals are night-active (nocturnal), many have adapted to novel light environments. This includes diurnal (day-active) and crepuscular (twilight-active) species. Here, we used integrative approaches to investigate the molecular evolution of 112 vision-related genes across 19 genomes representing most marsupial orders. We found that four genes (GUCA1B, GUCY2F, RGR, and SWS2) involved in retinal phototransduction likely became functionally redundant in the ancestor of marsupials, a group of largely obligate nocturnal mammals. We also show evidence of rapid evolution and positive selection of bright-light vision genes in the common ancestor of Macropus (kangaroos, wallaroos, and wallabies). Macropus-specific amino acid substitutions in opsin genes (LWS and SWS1), in particular, may be an adaptation for crepuscular vision in this genus via opsin spectral sensitivity tuning. Our study set the stage for functional genetics studies and provides a stepping stone to future research efforts that fully capture the visual repertoire of marsupials.

AB  - Seasonal energetic challenges may constrain an animal's ability to respond to changing individual and environmental conditions. Here, we investigated variation in heart rate, a well-established proxy for metabolic rate, in Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), a species with strong seasonal changes in foraging and metabolic activity. In 19 adult females, we recorded heart rate, subcutaneous temperature and activity using biologgers. Mean heart rate more than doubled from winter to summer. Typical drivers of energy expenditure, such as reproduction and activity, explained a relatively limited amount of variation (2-6% in winter and 16-24% in summer) compared to seasonality, which explained 75% of annual variation in heart rate. The relationship between heart rate and subcutaneous temperature depended on individual state via body mass, age and reproductive status, and the results suggested that peripheral heterothermy is an important pathway of energy management in both winter and summer. While the seasonal plasticity in energetics makes Svalbard reindeer well-adapted to their highly seasonal environment, intraseasonal constraints on modulation of their heart rate may limit their ability to respond to severe environmental change. This study emphasizes the importance of encompassing individual state and seasonal context when studying energetics in free-living animals. This article is part of the theme issue 'Measuring physiology in free-living animals (Part II)'.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a fast-growing neurodevelopmental disorder throughout the world. Experiencing early life stresses (ELS) like maternal separation (MS) is associated with autistic-like behaviors. It has been proposed that disturbance in the gut-brain axis-mediated psychiatric disorders following MS. The role of disruption in the integrity of gut-brain barrier in ASD remains unclear. Addressing this knowledge gap, in this study we aimed to investigate role of the gut-brain barrier integrity in mediating autistic-like behaviors in mouse models of MS stress. To do this, mice neonates are separated daily from their mothers from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 14 for 3 hours. During PND58-60, behavioral tests related to autistic-like behaviors including three-chamber sociability, shuttle box, and resident-intruder tests were performed. Then, prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and colon samples were dissected out for histopathological and molecular evaluations. Results showed that MS is associated with impaired sociability and social preference indexes, aggressive behaviors, and impaired passive avoidance memory. The gene expression of CLDN1 decreased in the colon, and the gene expression of CLDN5, CLDN12, and MMP9 increased in the PFC of the MS mice. MS is associated with decrease in the diameter of CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus. In addition, MS led to histopathological changes in the colon. We concluded that, probably, disturbance in the gut-brain barrier integrities mediated the autistic-like behavior in MS stress in mice.
   MS via disruption of the gut-brain barrier integrities as well as change in the hippocampus leads to autistic-like behavior in mice. image

AB  - Background: Experimental coronary artery interventions are currently being performed on non-diseased blood vessels in healthy animals. To provide a more realistic pathoanatomical scenario for investigations on novel interventional and surgical therapies, we aimed to fabricate a stenotic lesion, mimicking the morphology and structure of a human atherosclerotic plaque. Methods: In an interdisciplinary setting, we engineered a casting mold to create an atherosclerotic plaque with the dimensions to fit in a porcine coronary artery. Oscillatory rheology experiments took place along with long-term stability tests assessed by microscopic examination and weight monitoring. For the implantability in future in vivo setups, we performed a cytotoxicity assessment, inserted the plaque in resected pig hearts, and performed diagnostic imaging to visualize the plaque in its final position. Results: The most promising composition consists of gelatin, cholesterol, phospholipids, hydroxyapatite, and fine-grained calcium carbonate. It can be inserted in the coronary artery of human-sized pig hearts, producing a local partial stenosis and interacting like the atherosclerotic plaque by stretching and shrinking with the vessel wall and surrounding tissue. Conclusion: This artificial atherosclerotic plaque model works as a simulating tool for future medical testing and could be crucial for further specified research on coronary artery disease and is going to help to provide information about the optimal interventional and surgical care of the disease.

AB  - Background The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play important roles in various signaling transduction networks of biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, MAPK signaling pathways in cold-active yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa have not been reported comprehensively. Methods and results In the present study, MAPK gene (RmMAPK) was first cloned and characterized from Antarctic sea ice yeast R. mucilaginosa AN5. The full length of the RmMAPK gene is 1086 bp and encodes a 361 amino acids protein with a predicted molecular mass of 40.9 kDa and a pI of 5.25. The RmMAPK contains 11 MAPK conserved subdomains and the phosphorylation motif TGY located in the activation loop of the kinase. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot assay revealed that the expression and phosphorylation level of RmMAPK up-regulated rapidly and significantly when yeast cells were subjected to low temperature (4 degrees C), high salinity (120 parts per thousand NaCl) and heavy metal (2 mmol/L CuCl2). Conclusions All data suggested that the MAPK cascades might act as a key function in response to extreme stresses, such as low temperature, high salinity and heavy metal.

AB  - The study of herbivorous insects underpins much of the theory that concerns the evolution of species interactions. In particular, Pieridae butterflies and their host plants have served as a model system for studying evolutionary arms races. To learn more about the coevolution of these two clades, we reconstructed ancestral ecological networks using stochastic mappings that were generated by a phylogenetic model of host-repertoire evolution. We then measured if, when, and how two ecologically important structural features of the ancestral networks (modularity and nestedness) evolved over time. Our study shows that as pierids gained new hosts and formed new modules, a subset of them retained or recolonised the ancestral host(s), preserving connectivity to the original modules. Together, host-range expansions and recolonisations promoted a phase transition in network structure. Our results demonstrate the power of combining network analysis with Bayesian inference of host-repertoire evolution to understand changes in complex species interactions over time.

AB  - The number of deaths due to malignant neoplasms is increasing year by year. For this reason, new ways of preventing them and supporting treatment are being sought. One of them is adding plant extracts to food to increase its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerogenic activity. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of different wild-grown fruits (chokeberry, elderberry, hawthorn and sea-buckthorn) added to wheat-flour cookies on the proliferation of: (i) normal BJ lines (fibroblasts); (ii) tumor cells of the MCF-7 (breast cancer) and (iii) WM793 (melanoma) lines. Methanol-acetone extracts were prepared from previously baked wheat-flour cookies fortified with fruits in order to use them in the further part of the research to prepare mixtures with concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL; 1 mg/mL; 1.5 mg/mL; 2.5 mg/mL. The viability and cytotoxicity of normal and neoplastic cells was examined. It was observed that the WM793 melanoma tumor line appeared to be more susceptible to the action of the tested extracts with the addition of selected wild-grown fruits compared to MCF7 breast cancer cells. Moreover, the greatest significant effect on the inhibition of WM793 cells among extracts with a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL was proved in the case of sea-buckthorn (p < 0.05). In terms of the inhibition of the MCF7 line, the effect was proved only in the case of sea buckthorn (p < 0.05), while the viability of these neoplastic cells was at most affected by elderberry and chokeberry extracts (p < 0.05).

TI  - Spine impairment in mice high-expressing neuregulin 1 due to LIMK1 activation
T2  - CELL DEATH & DISEASE
LA  - English
AB  - The genes encoding for neuregulin1 (NRG1), a growth factor, and its receptor ErbB4 are both risk factors of major depression disorder and schizophrenia (SZ). They have been implicated in neural development and synaptic plasticity. However, exactly how NRG1 variations lead to SZ remains unclear. Indeed, NRG1 levels are increased in postmortem brain tissues of patients with brain disorders. Here, we studied the effects of high-level NRG1 on dendritic spine development and function. We showed that spine density in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was reduced in mice (ctoNrg1) that overexpressed NRG1 in neurons. The frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was reduced in both brain regions of ctoNrg1 mice. High expression of NRG1 activated LIMK1 and increased cofilin phosphorylation in postsynaptic densities. Spine reduction was attenuated by inhibiting LIMK1 or blocking the NRG1-LIMK1 interaction, or by restoring NRG1 protein level. These results indicate that a normal NRG1 protein level is necessary for spine homeostasis and suggest a pathophysiological mechanism of abnormal spines in relevant brain disorders.

AB  - Non-native plants are typically released from specialist enemies but continue to be attacked by generalists, albeit at lower intensities. This reduced herbivory may lead to less investment in constitutive defences and greater investment in induced defences, potentially reducing defence costs. We compared herbivory on 27 non-native and 59 native species in the field and conducted bioassays and chemical analyses on 12 pairs of non-native and native congeners. Non-natives suffered less damage and had weaker constitutive defences, but stronger induced defences than natives. For non-natives, the strength of constitutive defences was correlated with the intensity of herbivory experienced, whereas induced defences showed the reverse. Investment in induced defences correlated positively with growth, suggesting a novel mechanism for the evolution of increased competitive ability. To our knowledge, these are the first linkages reported among trade-offs in plant defences related to the intensity of herbivory, allocation to constitutive versus induced defences, and growth.

AB  - Ethyl caffeate (EC) is a phenylpropanoid compound derived from Elephantopus scaber. In our previous work, EC was investigated to have a strong synergistic antifungal effect against azole-resistant strains of Candida albicans when combined with fluconazole (FLU). However, the protective effect and mechanism of EC + FLU on oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) caused by drug-resistant strains of C. albicans have not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of EC combined with FLU against C. albicans-resistant strains that lead to OPC. An OPC mouse model revealed that EC + FLU treatment reduced fungal load and massive hyphal invasion of tongue tissues, and ameliorated the integrity of the tongue mucosa. Periodic acid-Schiff staining results showed more structural integrity of the tongue tissues and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration after EC + FLU treatment. Phosphorylation of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and other proteins in the EFGR/JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)/c-JUN (transcription factor Jun) signaling pathway was significantly downregulated by EC + FLU. EGFR and S100A9 mRNA expression were also reduced. The above results were verified in FaDu cells. ELISA results showed that the concentration of inflammatory factors in the cell supernatant was significantly reduced after EC combined with FLU treatment. Molecular docking revealed that EC exhibited high binding energy to EGFR. In conclusion, EC enhances the susceptibility of azole-resistant C. albicans to FLU, and the underlying mechanism is related to the inhibition of the EGFR/JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway. This result suggests that EC has potential to be developed as an antifungal sensitizer to treat OPC caused by azole-resistant C. albicans.

AB  - 'Dysbiosis' of the adult gut microbiota, in response to challenges such as infection, altered diet, stress, and antibiotics treatment has been recently linked to pathological alteration of brain function and behavior. Moreover, gut microbiota composition constantly controls microglia maturation, as revealed by morphological observations and gene expression analysis. However, it is unclear whether microglia functional properties and crosstalk with neurons, known to shape and modulate synaptic development and function, are influenced by the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated how antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiota influences microglial and neuronal functions in adult mice hippocampus. Hippocampal microglia from adult mice treated with oral antibiotics exhibited increased microglia density, altered basal patrolling activity, and impaired process rearrangement in response to damage. Patch clamp recordings at CA3-CA1 synapses revealed that antibiotics treatment alters neuronal functions, reducing spontaneous postsynaptic glutamatergic currents and decreasing synaptic connectivity, without reducing dendritic spines density. Antibiotics treatment was unable to modulate synaptic function in CX3CR1-deficient mice, pointing to an involvement of microglia-neuron crosstalk through the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis in the effect of dysbiosis on neuronal functions. Together, our findings show that antibiotic alteration of gut microbiota impairs synaptic efficacy, suggesting that CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling supporting microglia is a major player in in the gut-brain axis, and in particular in the gut microbiota-to-neuron communication pathway.

TI  - BMP4 overexpression induces the upregulation of APP/Tau and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
LA  - English
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system. Its pathogenesis is complex and is related to the abnormal expression of the amyloid beta (A beta), APP, and Tau proteins. Evidence has demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is highly expressed in transgenic mouse models of AD and that endogenous levels of BMP4 mainly affect hippocampal function. To determine whether BMP4 participates in AD development, transgenic mice were constructed that overexpress BMP4 under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. We also performed MTT, FACS, transfection, TUNEL, and Western blotting assays to define the role of BMP4 in cells. We found that middle-aged BMP4 transgenic mice exhibited impaired memory via the Morris water maze experiment. Moreover, their hippocampal tissues exhibited high expression levels of AD-related proteins, including APP, A beta, PSEN-1, Tau, P-Tau (Thr181), and P-Tau (Thr231). Furthermore, in multiple cell lines, the overexpression of BMP4 increased the expression of AD-related proteins, whereas the downregulation of BMP4 demonstrated opposing effects. Consistent with these results, BMP4 modulation affected cell apoptosis via the regulation of BAX and Bcl-2 expression in cells. Our findings indicate that BMP4 overexpression might be a potential factor to induce AD.

The louse fly fauna of Vietnam is relatively understudied compared to other countries in the Southeast Asia region. In this study, we describe a new species of the genus Icosta Speiser, 1905 (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), Icosta korzuni sp. n., collected from the lesser coucal Centropus bengalensis (Gmelin, JF, 1788) in Cat Tien National Park, Vietnam. This new species is distinguished from other Icosta species by the morphology of laterite 3, wing length, arrangement of wing microtrichia, body coloration, and its geographical distribution. Additionally, we provide an updated key to the subgenus Icosta Speiser, 1905.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict challenges conservation worldwide, which requires innovative management solutions. We developed a prototype Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate interactions between humans and solitary bull Asian elephants in the Periyar-Agasthyamalai complex of the Western Ghats in Kerala, India. The main challenges were the complex behavior of elephants and insufficient movement data from the region. Using literature, expert insights, and field surveys, we created a prototype behavior model that incorporates crop habituation, thermoregulation, and aggression. We designed a four-step calibration method to adapt relocation data from radio-tagged elephants in Indonesia to model elephant movements in the model domain. The ABM's structure, including the assumptions, submodels, and data usage are detailed following the Overview, Design concepts, Details protocol. The ABM simulates various food availability scenarios to study elephant behavior and environmental impact on space use and conflict patterns. The results indicate that the wet months increase conflict and thermoregulation significantly influences elephant movements and crop raiding. Starvation and crop habituation intensify these patterns. This prototype ABM is an initial model that offers information on the development of a decision support system in wildlife management and will be further enhanced with layers of complexity and subtlety across various dimensions.

AB  - Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) presents a powerful tool for revealing molecular-level metabolite information, complementary to the anatomical insight delivered by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thus playing a significant role in in vivo/in vitro biological studies. However, its further applications are generally confined by spectral congestion caused by numerous biological metabolites contained within the limited proton frequency range. Herein, we propose a pure-shift-based 1H localized MRS method as a proof of concept for high-resolution studies of biological samples. Benefitting from the spectral simplification from multiplets to singlet peaks, this method addresses the challenge of spectral congestion encountered in conventional MRS experiments and facilitates metabolite analysis from crowded NMR resonances. The performance of the proposed pure-shift 1H MRS method is demonstrated on different kinds of samples, including brain metabolite phantom and in vitro biological samples of intact pig brain tissue and grape tissue, using a 7.0 T animal MRI scanner. This proposed MRS method is readily implemented in common commercial NMR/MRI instruments because of its generally adopted pulse-sequence modules. Therefore, this study takes a meaningful step for MRS studies toward potential applications in metabolite analysis and disease diagnosis.

AB  - There is intense interest in developing long-lasting, potent, and broad-spectrum antiviral disinfectants. Ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) can undergo surface redox reactions (Ce3+ & LRARR; Ce4+) to generate ROS without requiring an external driving force. Here, we tested the mechanism behind our prior finding of potent inactivation of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses by silver-modified CNPs, AgCNP1 and AgCNP2. Treatment of human respiratory viruses, coronavirus OC43 and parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) with AgCNP1 and 2, respectively, prevented virus interactions with host cell receptors and resulted in virion aggregation. Rhinovirus 14 (RV14) mutants were selected to be resistant to inactivation by AgCNP2. Sequence analysis of the resistant virus genomes predicted two amino acid changes in surface-located residues D91V and F177L within capsid protein VP1. Consistent with the regenerative properties of CNPs, surface-applied AgCNP1 and 2 inactivated a wide range of structurally diverse viruses, including enveloped (OC43, SARS-CoV-2, and PIV5) and non-enveloped RNA viruses (RV14 and feline calicivirus; FCV). Remarkably, a single application of AgCNP1 and 2 potently inactivated up to four sequential rounds of virus challenge. Our results show broad-spectrum and long-lasting anti-viral activity of AgCNP nanoparticles, due to targeting of viral surface proteins to disrupt interactions with cellular receptors.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are suggested to play important roles in the pathogenesis and progress of human diseases with heterogeneous regulation in different types of cells. However, limited technique is available for profiling miRNAs with both expression and spatial dynamics. Here, we describe a platform for multiplexed in situ miRNA profiling in acute tissue slices. The technique uses diamond nanoneedles functionalized with RNA-binding proteins to directly isolate targeted miRNAs from the cytosol of a large population of cells to achieve a quasi-single-cell analysis for a tissue sample. In addition to a quantitative evaluation of the expression level of particular miRNAs, the technique also provides the relative spatial dynamics of the cellular miRNAs in associated cell populations, which was demonstrated to be useful in analyzing the susceptibility and spatial reorganization of different types of cells in the tissues from normal or diseased animals. As a proof-of-concept, in MK-801-induced schizophrenia model, we found that astrocytes, instead of neurons, are more heterogeneously affected in the hippocampus of rats that underwent repeated injection of MK-801, showing an expression fingerprint related to differentially down-regulated miRNA-135a and miRNA-143; the associated astrocyte subpopulation is also more spatially dispersed in the hippocampus, suggesting an astrocyte dysregulation in the induced schizophrenia animals.

AB  - IntroductionVarious herbivorous insects prefer toxic plants as their hosts, although this may appear paradoxical. They have evolved specific adaptations (called counter-defenses) against the toxins. For example, the two-component chemical defense system of plants of the Brassicaceae family against herbivores consists of glucosinolates (GLSs) and the activating enzyme myrosinase. GLS hydrolysis by myrosinase leads to isothiocyanates (ITCs), which are toxic and deterrent to many insect herbivores. Two different types of counter-defenses can be distinguished: a preemptive counter-defense that prevents the GLSs from being hydrolyzed to ITCs due to metabolic redirection and direct counter-defense, where the ITCs are formed but then metabolized to non-toxic conjugates. In general, preemptive counter-defense is only a possibility if the plant stores a precursor of the toxin, which is activated upon attack. Preemptive counter-defense is believed to be more efficient due to the lower exposure to ITCs, but this has not been satisfactorily demonstrated experimentally.MethodsHere, we derive on theoretical grounds the conditions under which preemptive counter-defense reduces exposure to ITCs compared to direct counter-defense by studying the dynamics of GLS defense and counter-defense with two separate ordinary differential equation models. We model how herbivory transfers the GLSs to the insect gut with the leaf material. Thereafter, we describe the insects' exposure to toxins by deriving the dynamics of ITCs in the gut during feeding with the two types of counter-defenses.Results and discussionBy calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the ITC concentrations, we show, based on empirical data, that herbivores with a preemptive detoxification system are usually less exposed to ITCs. In addition, our models explain how the decline in the level of ITCs is achieved by both counter-defenses, which helps to understand the overall mechanisms and benefits of these techniques. Our results may also apply to plant defenses by inactive toxin precursors other than GLSs as well as to insects that sequester such precursors for their own defense.

AB  - The aim of this work was to determine endometrial mRNA expression and uterine protein localization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 during the estrous cycle and peri-implantation period in sows. Uterine tissues were collected from pregnant sows on days 12, 14, 16, and 18 after artificial insemination and from non-pregnant animals on days 2 and 12 of the estrous cycle (day 0 1/4 day of estrus). Using immunohistochemistry, a positive signal for VEGF and its receptor VEGFR2 was found in uterine luminal epithelial cells, endometrial glands, stroma, blood vessels, and myometrium. A VEGFR1 signal was only found in endometrial and myometrial blood vessels and stroma. By day 18 of gestation, the mRNA expression levels of VEGF, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 were higher than those observed on days 2 and 12 of the estrous cycle and on days 12, 14, and 16 of gestation. Then, a primary culture of sow endometrial epithelial cells was established to define the potential of the selective in-hibition of VEGFR2 after treatment with inhibitor SU5416 and determine its effects on the expression pattern of the VEGF system. The endometrial epithelial cells treated with SU5416 showed a dose -dependent decrease in VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 mRNA expression. The present study provides additional evidence on the importance of the VEGF system during peri-implantation, as well as on the specific inhibitory activity of SU5416 in epithelial cells, which, as demonstrated, express the protein and mRNA of VEGF and its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Diarrhea as a symptom of different enteric infections leads to poor animal health and performance at weaning, followed by economic losses. Phytogenic feed additives, e.g., grape extracts, have shown antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties and these might have beneficial effects on growth trends of weaning piglets and, thereby, potentially reduce the need for antibiotic treatments following weaning. An 8-week feeding trial investigated the potential effects of grape extract (GE) in a model with a negative control (NC) and positive control (PC; antibiotic treatment). Despite no changes in animal performance, dietary GE improved the digestibility of selected nutrients at the same, or even at higher level, as PC. Additionally, there was no clear effect of dietary intervention on the microbial metabolites from the ileum and colon at the end of the trial. These results indicated beneficial effects of GE compared to antibiotic treatment, as often applied at weaning.</p>
   <br></p>
   Enteric diseases in piglets, such as post-weaning diarrhea (PWD), often require antibiotic treatment of the entire litter. Grape polyphenols may help overcome PWD and thereby reduce the need for antibiotics. The potential of a grape extract (GE; continuous in-feed supplementation) on performance of weaning piglets, compared with both negative (NC; corn-based diet) and positive control (PC; NC + in-feed antibiotic (amoxicillin) in a therapeutic dosage for day 1-day 5 post weaning) was assessed. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and microbial metabolites were also evaluated on two sampling points (day 27/28 and day 55/56). We assigned 180 weaning piglets (6.9 & PLUSMN; 0.1 kg body weight (BW)) to 6 male and 6 female pens per treatment with 5 piglets each. Animals from PC showed higher BW on day 13 compared with NC and GE, and a tendency for higher BW on day 56 (p = 0.080) compared to NC. Furthermore, PC increased the average daily feed intake in the starter phase (day 1-day 13), and the average daily gain in the early grower phase (day 14-day 24). Overall, GE improved the ATTD at the same level as PC (ash, acid-hydrolyzed ether extract), or at a higher level than PC (dry matter, organic matter, gross energy, crude protein, P). There were no effects on microbial metabolites apart from minor trends for lactic acid and ammonia. Dietary inclusion of GE may have beneficial effects compared to therapeutic antibiotics, as frequently used at weaning.</p>

AB  - IntroductionPerennial Chinese licorice, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, is an important medicinal plant. Diorhabda tarsalis, a leaf beetle, is a serious insect pest on the plant and cause serious yield losses every year and is attracted to healthy and pest-damaged licorice by plant volatiles. AimThe biologically active components of the volatiles released from G. uralensis have not been reported; the components of the volatiles that attract D. tarsalis need to be identified. Such compounds could potentially be used for monitoring and mass-trapping pests. MethodsGC-EAD, GC-MS, EAG, Y-shaped olfactometer behavioral bioassays, and field trials were performed to identify the components and composition of active volatiles. ResultsMale and virgin female adults were generally attracted to volatiles from licorice, and volatiles from pest-infested plants were more attractive. Four compounds from licorice elicited a significant electrophysiological response (EAD) and were confirmed by EAG, including hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-hexenal. With the exception of the (E)-2-hexenal, these molecules significantly attracted adults in individual behavioral bioassays, and a proportional mixture corresponding to beetle-damaged licorice of hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-hexenal (8.78:15.26:57.24:18.72) was most effective for attracting D. tarsalis in the field, attracted a mean of 26 +/- 7.19 beetles per trap. DiscussionD. tarsalis was attracted to volatiles from healthy and herbivore-induced G. uralensis under both laboratory and field conditions. The aforementioned compounds show considerable potential for commercial application to monitor and control D. tarsalis populations.

AB  - The Apgar score is widely used for global evaluation of the neonate in a minimally invasive way, it assesses neonatal vitality through a range of scores on clinical signs of health and vitality, such as reflexes, respiration rate, and mucosal coloration. The neonatal period is fundamental for lambs survival, that is dependent on complex interactions between maternal ability and newborn viability, as newborn lambs require milk and immunological protection that are dependent of mutual maternal-filial behaviour. The aim of this study was to determine the vitality of Suffolk newborn lambs by the modified Apgar method. Thirty-seven ewes were used and their lambs were classified at 5 min of age by the modified Apgar method. The ewes? body condition score, number of lambs born, and birth weight were recorded. Behaviour was evaluated by measuring, in minutes, the intervals between birth and sternal recumbency, the adoption of quadrupedal position, time until first suckling, and duration of first suckling. Blood samples were collected from the lambs between 24 and 36 h of age to determine gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. Of the 37 births observed, 20 were singles and 17 twins, resulting in 54 newborn lambs, which 27 were classified as high, 11 as moderate and 16 as low Apgar, and the percentages of deaths were 8% (n = 1), 10 % (n = 2) and 81.25 % (n = 13), respectively. The causes of death were: starvation-hypoglycemia-hypothermia complex (10/16, 62.5 %), pneumonia (3/16, 18.75 %), and stillbirth (3/16, 18.75 %). The concentration of gamma-glutamyltransferase in the lamb's serum with low Apgar was significantly (p-value 0.0027) lower (462.4 IU/L) than in lambs born with moderate (1616.8 IU/L) and high (3177.7 IU/L) Apgar. Birth weight (r = 0.39 and p = 0.0015) and APGAR (r = 0.61 and p < 0.0001) were correlated with survival. The vitality evaluation did predict survival ability and passive immunity transfer characteristics.

AB  - Reconstruction of damaged nerves remains a significant unmet challenge in clinical medicine. Topographical and mechanical stimulations play important roles to repair peripheral nerve injury. The synergistic effects of topography and mechanical rigidity may significantly accelerate nerve regeneration. In this work, a nerve-guiding collagen/polylactic acid (PLA) electrospun scaffold is developed to facilitate peripheral nerve repair. The obtained anisotropic PLA electrospun scaffolds simulate the directional arranged structure of nerve realistically and promote axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve injury when compared with the isotropic PLA electrospun scaffolds. Moreover, the collagen-modified PLA electrospun scaffolds further provide sufficient mechanical support and favorable microenvironment for axon regeneration. In addition, it is observed that collagen-modified PLA electrospun scaffolds facilitate the axon regeneration by regulating Yes-associated protein (YAP) molecular pathway. Taken together, the engineered collagen-modified anisotropic PLA electrospun scaffolds may be a potential candidate to combine topography and mechanical rigidity for peripheral nerve regeneration is engineered.

AB  - At the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (Novosibirsk, Russia) for over 85 generations, gray rats have been selected for high aggression toward humans (aggressive rats) or its complete absence (tame rats). Aggressive rats are an interesting model for studying fear-induced aggression. Benzopentathiepin TC-2153 exerts an antiaggressive effect on aggressive rats and affects the serotonergic system: an important regulator of aggression. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of TC-2153 on key serotonergic-system enzymes - tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) - in the brain of aggressive and tame rats. Either TC-2153 (10 or 20 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered once intraperitoneally to aggressive and tame male rats. TPH2 and MAOA enzymatic activities and mRNA and protein levels were assessed. The selection for high aggression resulted in upregulation of Tph2 mRNA in the midbrain, of the TPH2 protein in the hippocampus, and of proteins TPH2 and MAOA in the hypothalamus, as compared to tame rats. MAO enzymatic activity was higher in the midbrain and hippocampus of aggressive rats while TPH2 activity did not differ between the strains. The single TC-2153 administration decreased TPH2 and MAO activity in the hypothalamus and midbrain, respectively. The drug affected MAOA protein levels in the hypothalamus: upregulated them in aggressive rats and downregulated them in tame ones. Thus, this study shows profound differences in the expression and activity of key serotonergic system enzymes in the brain of rats selectively bred for either highly aggressive behavior toward humans or its absence, and the effects of benzopentathiepin TC-2153 on these enzymes may point to mechanisms of its antiaggressive action.

AB  - The interest in astrocytes, the silent brain cells that accumulate polyamines (PAs), is growing. PAs exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidepressant, neuroprotective, and other beneficial effects, including increasing longevity in vivo. Unlike neurons, astrocytes are extensively coupled to others via connexin (Cx) gap junctions (GJs). Although there are striking modulatory effects of PAs on neuronal receptors and channels, PA regulation of the astrocytic GJs is not well understood. We studied GJ-propagation using molecules of different (i) electrical charge, (ii) structure, and (iii) molecular weight. Loading single astrocytes with patch pipettes containing membrane-impermeable dyes, we observed that (i) even small molecules do not easily permeate astrocytic GJs, (ii) the ratio of the charge to weight of these molecules is the key determinant of GJ permeation, (iii) the PA spermine (SPM) induced the propagation of negatively charged molecules via GJs, (iv) while no effects were observed on propagation of macromolecules with net-zero charge. The GJ uncoupler carbenoxolone (CBX) blocked such propagation. Taken together, these findings indicate that SPM is essential for astrocytic GJ communication and selectively facilitates intracellular propagation via GJs for negatively charged molecules through glial syncytium.

AB  - Population fluctuations of Aphis gossypii, Chloridea virescens,Anthonomus vestitus, Dysdercus peruvianus and Pectinophora gossypiella, besides their natural enemies were studied during the entire phenological period of a Tang & uuml;is cotton crop at La Molina (Lima), using three sampling techniques: direct plant evaluation, plant shake falls and pitfall traps. A. gossypii was the most abundant pest, being more important in the vegetative development, followed by D. peruvianus and P. gossypiella, , both with greater importance in the fructification stage. Predatory insects and spiders were recorded during the whole crop period, where the most frequent were, in predatory insects Hippodamia convergens, , Hyalochloria denticornis and Rhinacloa forticornis, , and in spiders Misumenops s sp. morpho 1, Zelotes laetus and Theridion volubile. . Parasitoidism was low or scarce in most of the pests, highlighting Lysiphlebus testaceipes as A. gossypii parasitoid due to its abundance in the vegetative development of the cotton field.

AB  - Awareness that others have human qualities (humanizing) generally results in a more favorable treatment of those others. Recent research has found that nonhuman entities (e.g., animals, the planet) also benefit when people view them as having human qualities (anthropomorphizing). Do those benefits of humanizing also extend to the animals we consume? Two studies were conducted to address that question. In both studies, participants were given a short writing task designed to elicit an anthropomorphized view of the target followed by measures of their diet plans and decisions regarding dilemmas that pitted human interests against animal and environmental interests. In study 1 (n = 58) the target animal was a cow and in study 2 (n = 146) the target animals were a cow and a pig. The key finding, consistent across both studies, was that gender moderated the effect of the anthropomorphism manipulation. Females expressed less interest in eating beef (Study 1) and more willingness to try a meat-free diet (Study 2) after anthropomorphizing the food animals compared with the control condition. In contrast, males expressed more interest in eating beef and less willingness to try a meat-free diet after anthropomorphizing food animals. The gender differences can be understood as resulting from differences in the way men and women view animals and meat consumption. The pattern found with meat-eating plans did not extend to decisions on the animal-related dilemmas. Thus, anthropomorphizing food animals is not uniformly beneficial or harmful to the animals, but depends on the gender of those asked to humanize.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different sealing strategies on aerobic stability and feed value of corn silage supplied to finishing lambs. The treatments were set up according to the silo sealing strategy: BP (black polyethylene film), BP + Bagasse (black polyethylene film + sugarcane bagasse) and BP + Silostop (Silostop (R) Orange oxygen barrier film + black polyethylene film). Six lambs per treatment were used, totaling 18 animals in an experimental period of 63 days. The silage from LP treatment presented the highest aerobic stability, however with lower dry matter digestibility coefficients. No significant differences were detected among treatments for intake and performance of lambs. But for final body weight, weight gain, daily average gain, feed efficiency and dry matter intake, the best results, in absolute value, were found for lambs fed with silage from LP + Bagasse treatment. The silage sealed exclusively with black polyethylene film showed greater aerobic stability. The different sealing strategies used in this experiment did not influence the performance of finishing Dorper x Santa Ines lambs.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an economically important oilseed tree. Seed meals of C. oleifera have a long history of use as biocontrol agents in shrimp farming and as cleaning agents in peoples' daily lives due to the presence of theasaponins, the triterpene saponins from the genus Camellia. To characterize the biosynthetic pathway of theasaponins in C. oleifera, members of gene families involved in triterpenoid biosynthetic pathways were identified and subjected to phylogenetic analysis with corresponding members in Arabidopsis thaliana, Camellia sinensis, Actinidia chinensis, Panax ginseng, and Medicago truncatula. In total, 143 triterpenoid backbone biosynthetic genes, 1169 CYP450s, and 1019 UGTs were identified in C. oleifera. The expression profiles of triterpenoid backbone biosynthetic genes were analyzed in different tissue and seed developmental stages of C. oleifera. The results suggested that MVA is the main pathway for triterpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Moreover, the candidate genes for theasaponin biosynthesis were identified by WGCNA and qRT-PCR analysis; these included 11 CYP450s, 14 UGTs, and eight transcription factors. Our results provide valuable information for further research investigating the biosynthetic and regulatory network of theasaponins.

AB  - Cats (Felis catus) kill millions of native Australian mammals and birds each year. The prey naivety hypothesis suggests this is due to native wildlife failing to recognise cats as predators. The Mata Hari Judas (MHJ) queen technique, where confined female cats are put into prolonged oestrus, has recently been trialled in situ as a method to attract and capture feral cats. This created the opportunity to observe how native wildlife respond to a live cat, or their olfactory and auditory cues, using camera trap detections before and after the introduction of a MHJ queen or its cues. Daily detection rates of eastern grey kangaroos, Australian magpies, noisy miners and northern brown bandicoots around the live cat did not differ between baseline and live cat periods, suggesting these species may not recognise live cats as a threat. However, red-necked wallabies and grey butcherbirds reduced activity in response to live cats or their cues. This study demonstrates that native Australian wildlife exhibit variable behavioural responses to cats and their cues. As predator control strategies evolve, integrating behavioural ecology into their design will be critical for their effectiveness, such as prioritising species that lack predator awareness.

AB  - Ecologists are increasingly using bioacoustics in wildlife monitoring programs. Remote autonomous sound recorders provide new options for collecting data for species and in contexts that were previously difficult. However, post-processing of sound files to extract relevant data remains a significant challenge. Detection algorithms, or call recognizers, can aid automation of species detection but their performance and reliability has been mixed. Further, building recognizers typically requires either costly commercial software or expert programming skills, both of which reduces their accessibility to ecologists responsible for monitoring. In this study we investigated the performance of open-source call recognizers provided by the monitoR package in R, a language popular among ecologists. We tested recognizers on sound data collected under natural conditions at nests of two endangered subspecies of black-cockatoo, the Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus (n = 23 nests), and the south-eastern red-tailed black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne (n = 20 nests). Specifically, we tested the performance of binary point matching recognizers in confirming daily nest activity (active or inactive) and nesting outcome (fledge or fail). We tested recognizers on recordings from nests of known status using 3 x 3-h recordings per nest, from early, mid and late stages of the recording period. Daily nest activity was correctly assigned in 61.7% of survey days analysed (n = 60 days) for the red-tailed black-cockatoo, and 62.3% of survey days (n = 69 days) for the glossy black-cockatoo. Fledging was successfully detected in all cases. Precision (true positive / true positive + false positive) of individual detections was 70.2% for the south-eastern red-tailed black-cockatoo and 37.1% for the Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo. Manual verification of outputs is still required, but it is not necessary to verify all detections to confirm an active nest (i.e., nest is deemed active when true positives are identified). We conclude that bioacoustics combined with semi-automated post-processing can be an appropriate tool for nest monitoring in these endangered subspecies.

AB  - Previously, we developed a porcine bronchial epithelial cell line designated as PBE cells and demonstrated that this cell line possesses functional Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), triggering the expressions of interferons (IFNs), antiviral factors, and inflammatory cytokines after its stimulation with the synthetic double-stranded ARN poly(I:C). In this work, we aimed to further characterize the PBE cell line as a reliable in vitro model for investigating swine influenza virus (SIV) infection and immunity. We evaluated the capacity of two SIV subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2, to replicate and induce cytopathic effects in PBE cells and to modulate the expressions of IFNs, antiviral factors, inflammatory cytokines, and negative regulators of the TLR signaling. We demonstrated that PBE cells are susceptible to both H1N1 and H3N2. SIV infected PBE cells inducing notable cytopathic effects as shown by the alteration of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and cilia. Both SIV subtypes replicated in PBE cells in similar proportion and altered TEER values in comparable magnitudes. However, SIV H3N2 induced higher alterations of cilia than H1N1. SIV infection induced changes in all the immune factors evaluated in PBE cells. We detected quantitative differences when the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 were compared. The fold expression changes of IFN-beta, Mx1, Mx2, IFITM1, OAS1, OAS2, and OASL were higher in PBE cells infected with H3N2 than in cells challenged with H1N1. In addition, although both subtypes stimulated IL-8 expression, only the H3N2 induced IL-6 in infected PBE cells. SIV H1N1 and H3N2 also upregulated the expressions of the negative regulators A20, BCL-3, and MKP-1, while only H1N1 increased SIGIRR and Tollip. Immortalized respiratory cell lines from pigs can be useful in vitro systems for the study of viral infections and immune responses. These studies are of importance in the context of influenza infections not only for the agricultural field because pigs are natural hosts of these viruses but also because these animals serve as intermediate reservoirs of viruses that can threaten humans' health. We demonstrated here that the PBE cell line can be a useful in vitro model to study SIV infection and immunity.

AB  - Herbivorous insects play important roles in agriculture as pests or as weed biological control agents. Predicting the timing of herbivore insect population development can thus be of paramount importance for agricultural planning and sustainable land management. Numerical simulation models driven by temperature are often used to predict insect pest population build-up in agriculture. Such simulation models intend to use station-derived temperatures to drive the development of the target insect, although this temperature may differ substantially from that experienced by the insect on the plant. To improve the estimations, it has been suggested to replace air temperature in the model by land surface temperature (LST) data. Here, we use a numerical simulation model of insect population dynamics driven by either air temperature (combined with atmospheric temperature soundings) or land surface temperature derived from satellites to predict the population trends of the leaf beetle Ophraella communa, a potential biological control agent of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe. For this, we conducted an extensive field experiment that included caged O. communa populations at five sites along an altitudinal gradient (125-1250 m a.s.l.) in Northern Italy during 2015 and 2016. We compared our model predictions using air or land surface temperature with observed beetle population build-up. Model predictions with both air and land surface temperatures predicted a similar phenology to observed populations but overestimated the abundance of the observed populations. When taking into consideration the error of the two measurement methods, the predictions of the model were in overlapping timeframes. Therefore, the current model driven by LST can be used as a proxy for herbivore impact, which is a novel tool for weed biocontrol.

AB  - Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a widely used method for plant genetic modification. However, its efficiency in tea plants is notably low, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, hindering advancements in the molecular breeding and biology of tea plants. In this study, tobacco was utilized as a model to investigate the effects of various concentrations of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on Agrobacterium transformation efficiency. The results demonstrated that at an EGCG concentration of 0.4 mg/mL, Agrobacterium nearly lost its ability to transform tobacco. Additionally, malondialdehyde content in Agrobacterium was measured before and after EGCG treatment. The findings indicated that EGCG treatment led to an increase in malondialdehyde content. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in Agrobacterium flagellar synthesis and secretion systems were down-regulated under EGCG stress. Furthermore, flgE, virB4, and virB6 were identified as hub genes through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). These results elucidate the dynamic mechanisms by which EGCG affects Agrobacterium at both the physicochemical and molecular levels, providing a theoretical basis for optimizing genetic transformation in tea plants.

AB  - Pigs are vital sources of food and biological products. However, viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV) pose significant threats to the global swine industry, resulting in substantial financial losses. Currently, there are no available drugs or effective vaccines to combat these viruses. This study presents a small molecule, denoted as C14, which demonstrates promising potential to target porcine CD163, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of PRRSV, and S273R of ASFV, and exhibits activity against both PRRSV (half maximal effective concentration [EC50] = 0.34 mu M) and ASFV (EC50 < 0.1 mu M). By employing the strategy of similar topological structure binding properties of protein targets (STSBPT), interactions between C14 and targets were further analysed. The results indicate that the 5-& Aring; regions of C14 within the active pockets of these macromolecular targets exhibit highly similar structural features, which may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs. Chemical synthesis, docking simulations, and antiviral activity assays were further conducted, and it was found that the structure of C14 is devoid of redundant elements, making it a prime candidate as core scaffold for subsequent structural optimization. This study provides a valuable reference for the development of multi-target antiviral drugs against PRRSV and ASFV.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNA) are a kind of endogenous biological macromolecules that play significant roles in many biological processes, including adipogenesis, a precisely orchestrated process that is mediated by a large number of factors. Among them, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), is undoubtedly the most important regulator of adipocyte development in all types of adipose tissue. The formation of intramuscular fat (IMF), is a key factor that influences the meat quality in livestock animals. PPARG has been demonstrated to show a positive correlation with IMF deposition although the regulatory mechanism involved is not known. This study demonstrates that PPARG mediates IMF deposition by producing multiple exonic circRNAs (circPPARGs). Three circPPARGs promote adipogenic differentiation and inhibit the proliferation of intramuscular preadipocytes and these effects are conserved across several species including buffaloes, cattle and mice. Notably, circPPARG1 interacts with PPARG protein to inhibit the transcription of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) involved in lipolysis. In addition, the positive effects of circPPARG1 on IMF deposition were identified in mice in vivo. Thus, PPARG drives IMF deposition, not only through the common transcription factor pathway, but also by producing circRNAs. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PPARG in IMF deposition.

AB  - Herein we report a simple protocol for the valorisation of a common urban biowaste. The lignocellulosic biomass obtained after the pre-treatment of pine needle urban waste is efficiently transformed into a low-cost support (PiNe) for the immobilization of Pd nanoparticles. The final Pd/PiNe heterogeneous catalyst features a small particle size (4.5 nm) and a metal loading (9.9 wt%) comparable with most commercially available and generally used counterparts. In this contribution, we tested the catalytic efficiency of the Pd/PiNe system in two representative cross-couplings, Heck and Hiyama reactions, and compared the results obtained with commercial Pd/C catalyst. The good reactivity in the biomass-derived solvent (GVL) confirms that the Pd/PiNe heterogeneous catalyst is a valid system that can be integrated into a waste valorization chain within a circular economy approach. In addition, the efficiency of the catalyst has also been extended to perform the challenging consecutive Hiyama-Heck reaction to afford differently substituted (E)-1,2-diarylethenes.

AB  - Monitoring feeding time in ruminants is one means to quantify feed intake. In grazing cattle offered feed sup-plement blocks, time spent licking can provide valuable information in estimating the level of blocks being ingested. This current study aimed to 1) assess an ear-tag accelerometer's capability to identify the licking behaviour at supplement blocks in grazing cattle and 2) evaluate the performance of the ear-tag accelerometer and radio-frequency identification (RFID) system to predict the individual time spent licking. Two breed groups of Angus (n = 7) and Brahman (n = 7) beef heifers were kept in two separate yards over 28 days. Each heifer was fitted with an ear-tag containing a tri-axial accelerometer set at 12.5 Hz frequency. Feed supplement blocks were provided through an RFID-equipped automatic supplement weighing unit within each yard, with access to the unit being given daily only from 16:00 h - 20:00 h. The accelerometer classification model developed using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm could distinguish between licking and non-licking behaviours, with an accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, Cohen's kappa coefficient, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 86%, 93%, 0.88, 0.70, and 0.77 for Angus and 87%, 93%, 0.89, 0.73, and 0.79 for Brahman heifers. Time spent licking predicted by accelerometers were acceptable with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 22% and 11%, modelling efficiency (MEF) of 0.81 and 0.94, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.88 and 0.96, and a ratio of root mean square prediction error (RSR) of 0.44 and 0.25, for Angus and Brahman heifers, respectively. However, the RFID system derived predictions of time spent licking in grazing heifers were unacceptable for both breeds. Overall, the ear-tag accelerometer offers the potential to predict individual time spent licking in grazing cattle to estimate block supplement intake.

AB  - Background Hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is inevitable in complicated liver surgery and is a major factor leading to postoperative complications and liver dysfunction. Studies have shown that the paracrine mechanisms of stem cell may be essential to tissue repair and functional improvement after transplantation. However, the role of the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell secretome (ASC-secretome) in liver regeneration in large animals remains to be determined. Methods Twenty-four miniature pigs were subjected to laparoscopic liver ischaemia-reperfusion combined with partial hepatectomy and divided into the following four groups: the saline group, the DMEM group, the ASC group and the ASC-secretome group. Serum and liver tissue samples were collected before the operation and at 1, 3 and 7 days after the operation, and changes in tissue pathology, serum inflammation, liver function, angiogenesis-related factors and liver tissue regeneration-related genes and proteins were evaluated. Results Detailed histological analysis showed that ASCs and the ASC-secretome changed pathological damage to liver tissue after liver ischaemia-reperfusion combined with partial hepatectomy (1 and 3 days: p < 0.01). Compared with the saline and DMEM control groups, the ASC-secretome group had significantly reduced expression levels of ALP (1 and 3 days: p < 0.05), ALT (1 day: p < 0.01; 3 days: p < 0.05) and AST (1 and 3 days: p < 0.01), which promoted the recovery of liver function. Moreover, detection of the expression levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta (1 day: p < 0.01; 3 days: p < 0.05), IL-6 (1 and 3 days: p < 0.05) and IL-10 (1 and 3 days: p < 0.01) in serum confirmed that the ASC-secretome had obvious anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, the ASC-secretome increased the expression levels of ANG-1 (3 days: p < 0.01), ANG-2 (3 and 7 days: p < 0.01) and VEGF (1 and 7 days: p < 0.05; 3 days: p < 0.01) and promoted angiogenesis during liver regeneration. Moreover, it promoted the mRNA expression of HGF and Cyclin D1 (1 and 3 days: p < 0.01); increased the levels of p-STAT3 (1 and 3 days: p < 0.01), PCNA and Ki67 (1 and 3 days: p < 0.01; 7 days: p < 0.05); inhibited the negative feedback of SOCS3 (1 and 3 days: p < 0.01); and decreased the mRNA expression of TGF-beta (3 days: p < 0.01). The cytokines and growth factors detected in the ASC-secretome included TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, ANG-1, ANG-2, VEGF and b-FGF. Conclusion The ASC-secretome alleviates the inflammatory response induced by ischaemia-reperfusion combined with partial hepatectomy in miniature pigs and promotes liver regeneration.

AB  - Selective pressures exerted on the feeding behaviour of animals have been extensively studied to understand their foraging patterns. In herbivores, specific within-plant patterns of resource exploitation have been reported, but their determinants remain poorly understood. Here, we describe and decipher the determinants of the foraging pattern of the pollen beetle Brassicogethes aeneus, a pollinivorous insect that is a pest of oilseed rape Brassica napus. This insect feeds from flowers for almost all of its life cycle, except for a couple of weeks preceding blossoming. During this period, only flower buds are available and the insect destroys them to feed from the pollen they contain, causing serious yield losses. We found that during this critical period, pollen beetles exhibit a stereotypic intra-inflorescence feeding pattern that depends on flower bud maturity. To explain this pattern, we first deciphered the selective pressures driving pollen beetles' feeding behaviour. Using a set of manipulative laboratory experiments, including behavioural experiments on plant tissues and artificial substrates, chemical characterization of plant tissues and performance experiments, we show that the pollen beetles' feeding behaviour does not seem to be driven by specialized metabolites or an attempt to reach an optimal nutrient balance, but rather by a process of maximization of total macronutrient intake. Next, using optimal diet choice models, we found that one aspect of the intra-inflorescence feeding pattern, the preference for young over old flower buds, could be well-explained through the lens of total macronutrient intake maximization per unit of time to access the resource. Our study provides new insights into small-scale foraging patterns and highlights the need to characterize and assess the relative influence of several components of diet quality when deciphering selective pressures driving foraging patterns.

AB  - Plants perceive and respond to herbivore insect eggs. Upon egg deposition on leaves, a strong hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death can be activated leading to egg desiccation and/or dropping. In Brassica spp., including many crops, the HR-like mechanism against eggs of cabbage white butterflies (Pieris spp.) is poorly understood. Using two Brassica species, the crop B. rapa and its wild relative B. nigra, we studied the cellular and molecular plant response to Pieris brassicae eggs and characterized potential insect egg-associated molecular patterns (EAMPs) inducing HR-like cell death. We found that eggs of P. brassicae induced typical hallmarks of early immune responses, such as callose deposition, production of reactive oxygen species and cell death in B. nigra and B. rapa leaf tissue, also in plants that did not express HR-like cell death. However, elevated levels of ethylene production and upregulation of salicylic acid-responsive genes were only detected in a B. nigra accession expressing HR-like cell death. Eggs and egg wash from P. brassicae contains compounds that induced such responses, but the eggs of the generalist moth Mamestra brassicae did not. Furthermore, wash made from hatched Pieris eggs, egg glue, and accessory reproductive glands (ARG) that produce this glue, induced HR-like cell death, whereas washes from unfertilized eggs dissected from the ovaries or removal of the glue from eggs resulted in no or a reduced response. This suggests that there is one or multiple egg associated molecular pattern (EAMP) located in the egg glue a that teresponse in B. nigra is specific to Pieris species. Lastly, our results indicate that the EAMP is neither lipidic nor proteinaceous. Our study expands the knowledge on the mechanism of Brassica-Pieris-egg interaction and is a step closer toward identification of EAMPs in Pieris egg glue and corresponding receptor(s) in Brassica.

AB  - Understanding the circumstances under which insect herbivores will adopt a novel host plant is a longstanding question in basic and applied ecology. While geographic variation in host use can arise through differences in both herbivore preference and plant characteristics, there is a tendency to attribute geographic variation in host use to regional differences in herbivore preference alone. This is especially true for herbivores specialized to one or a few plant species. We compared how geographic variation in herbivore preference and host plant origin shape regional differences in host plant use by the specialized herbivore, Euphydryas phaeton. In parts of its range, E. phaeton uses only a native host, Chelone glabra, while in others, it also uses an introduced host, Plantago lanceolata. We offered female butterflies from each region the non-native host plant sourced from both regions and compared their oviposition behavior. The non-native host was almost universally rejected by butterflies in the region where only the native plant is used. In the region where butterflies use both hosts, females accepted non-native plants from their natal region twice as often as non-native plants from the other region where they are not used. Acceptance differed substantially among individual butterflies within regions but not among plants within regions. Thus, both individual preference and regional differences in both the insect and non-native host contributed to the geographic variation in different ways. These results highlight that, in addition to herbivore preference, regional differences in perceived plant suitability may be an important driver of diet breadth.

AB  - Cooperative behaviors are evolutionary stable if the direct and/or indirect fitness benefits exceed the costs of helping. Here we discuss cooperation and behaviors akin to cooperation in subsocial group-living species of two genera of herbivorous spider mites (Tetranychidae), i.e., the largely polyphagous Tetranychus spp. and the nest-building Stigmaeopsis spp., which are specialized on grasses, such as bamboo. These spider mites are distributed in patches on various spatial scales, that is, within and among leaves of individual host plants and among individual hosts of single or multiple plant species. Group-living of spider mites is brought about by plant-colonizing foundresses ovipositing at local feeding sites and natal site fidelity, and by multiple individuals aggregating in the same site in response to direct and/or indirect cues, many of which are associated with webbing. In the case of the former, emerging patches are often composed of genetically closely related individuals, while in the case of the latter, local patches may consist of kin of various degrees and/or non-kin and even heterospecific spider mites. We describe and discuss ultimate and proximate aspects of cooperation by spider mites in host plant colonization and exploitation, dispersal, anti-predator behavior, and nesting-associated behaviors and conclude with theoretical and practical considerations of future research on cooperation in these highly rewarding model animals.

AB  - Foraging trails of leafcutter colonies are iconic scenes in the Neotropics, with ants collecting freshly cut plant fragments to provision a fungal food crop. We hypothesised that the fungus-cultivar's requirements for macronutrients and minerals govern the foraging niche breadth of Atta colombica leafcutter ants. Analyses of plant fragments carried by foragers showed how nutrients from fruits, flowers and leaves combine to maximise cultivar performance. While the most commonly foraged leaves delivered excess protein relative to the cultivar's needs, in vitro experiments showed that the minerals P, Al and Fe may expand the leafcutter foraging niche by enhancing the cultivar's tolerance to protein-biased substrates. A suite of other minerals reduces cultivar performance in ways that may render plant fragments with optimal macronutrient blends unsuitable for provisioning. Our approach highlights how the nutritional challenges of provisioning a mutualist can govern the multidimensional realised niche available to a generalist insect herbivore.

AB  - Brown marine macroalga Padina gymnospora (Phaeophyceae, Ochrophyta) produces both secondary metabolites (phlorotannins) and precipitate calcium carbonate (CaCO3-aragonite) on its surface as potential defensive strategies against herbivory. Here, we have evaluated the effect of natural concentrations of organic extracts (dichloromethane-DI; ethyl acetate-EA and methanol-ME, and three isolated fractions) and mineralized tissues of P. gymnospora as chemical and physical resistance, respectively, against the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus through experimental laboratory feeding bioassays. Fatty acids (FA), glycolipids (GLY), phlorotannins (PH) and hydrocarbons (HC) were also characterized and/or quantified in extracts and fractions from P. gymnospora using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (CG/MS) or GC coupled to flame ionization detector (FID) and chemical analysis. Our results showed that chemicals from the EA extract of P. gymnospora were significantly important in reducing consumption by L. variegatus, but the CaCO3 did not act as a physical protection against consumption by this sea urchin. An enriched fraction containing 76% of the new hydrocarbon 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-heneicosatetraene exhibited a significant defensive property, while other chemicals found in minor amounts, such as GLY, PH, saturated and monounsaturated FAs and CaCO3 did not interfere with the susceptibility of P. gymnospora to L. variegatus consumption. We suggest that the unsaturation of the 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-heneicosatetraene from P. gymnospora is probably an important structural characteristic responsible for the defensive property verified against the sea urchin.

AB  - Conflict mitigation strategies reduce losses caused by wildlife crop depredations, yet farmers often choose to use techniques that are not very effective or not to use strategies at all. We conducted a study in Himachal Pradesh in northern India to understand what factors drive farmers to adopt certain mitigation strategies against crop-foraging rhesus macaques. We employed an action-research approach and tested the effectiveness of four physical deterrents, two chemical repellents, three acoustic repellents, and two psychological techniques in preventing monkeys from entering crop fields. We conducted the deterrent trials on farm plots that farmers had temporarily abandoned due to primate crop-foraging. The number of available plots and their location restricted our ability to conduct replicate deterrent trials. We also interviewed 70 farmers before and after the deterrent trials to understand their willingness to try nonlethal techniques to deter crop-foraging monkeys. Simple fences using locally available materials successfully reduced primate depredations, and farmers agreed to adopt these techniques. However, a stated willingness to adopt new strategies may not translate to actual implementation, because farmers' use of mitigation strategies is a complex behavior influenced by various factors. Also, the lack of trial replication affected our ability to confirm our results. Determining whether researchers can apply our findings to a wider population requires additional research. Addressing changes in human behavior and attitudes toward mitigation strategies is critical for implementing regionally effective nonlethal mitigation strategies.

AB  - Psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are common. A bidirectional relationship has been well described where not only patients with epilepsy have a higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities but also patients with primary psychiatric disorders are at an increased risk of developing seizures. The aim of this review is to highlight the complex relationship between epilepsy and common psychiatric disorders and to answer the question whether psychotropic medications are proconvulsant by reviewing the preclinical and clinical literature. The evidence shows that the majority of psychotropic medications are not proconvulsant when used in therapeutic doses with the exception of a subset of medications, mainly bupropion IR and certain antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine. An effective treatment of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy must consider not only the potential therapeutic effect of the drug, but also its potential iatrogenic effects on the seizure disorder.

AB  - (Background) The transition from in utero to ex utero life is associated with rapid changes in the brain that are both protective and required for newborn functional activities, allowing adaption to the changing environment. The current study aimed to reveal new insights into adaptations required for normal ongoing brain development and function after birth. (Methods) Time-mated dams were randomly allocated to fetal collection at gestational age 68 or spontaneous term delivery followed by neonatal collection within 24 h of birth. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine mature myelin formation and neuronal nuclei coverage. RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA expression of key markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage, neuronal development, and GABAergic/glutamatergic pathway maturation. (Results) Mature myelin was reduced in the subcortical white matter of the neonate, whilst neuronal nuclei coverage was increased in both the hippocampus and the overlying cortical region. Increased mRNA expression in neonates was observed for oligodendrocyte and neuronal markers. There were also widespread mRNA changes across the inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic pathways in neonates. (Conclusions) This study has identified important adaptations in the expression of key neurodevelopmental structures, including oligodendrocytes and neurons, that may be essential for appropriate transition in neurodevelopment to the postnatal period.

AB  - Renal tubule cells act as a primary site of injury in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), with dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control (MQC) closely associated with progressive kidney dysfunction in this context. Our investigation delves into the observed inactivation of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and consequential dysregulation of MQC within renal tubule cells among DKD subjects through bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomics data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis unequivocally underscores the robust diagnostic accuracy of YAP1 and MQC-related genes for DKD. Furthermore, we observed YAP1 inactivation, accompanied by perturbed MQC, within cultured tubule cells exposed to high glucose (HG) and palmitic acid (PA). This pattern was also evident in the tubulointerstitial compartment of kidney sections from biopsy-approved DKD patients. Additionally, renal tubule cell-specific Yap1 deletion exacerbated kidney injury in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, Yap1 deletion disrupted MQC, leading to mitochondrial aberrations in mitobiogenesis and mitophagy within tubule cells, ultimately culminating in histologic tubular injury. Notably, Yap1 deletion-induced renal tubule injury promoted the secretion of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), potentially augmenting M1 macrophage infiltration within the renal microenvironment. These multifaceted events were significantly ameliorated by administrating the YAP1 activator XMU-MP-1 in DKD mice. Consistently, bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomics data from the GEO dataset revealed a noteworthy upregulation of tubule cells-derived chemokine CXCL1 associated with macrophage infiltration among DKD patients. Crucially, overexpression of YAP1 via adenovirus transfection sustained mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA copy number, oxygen consumption rate, and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, but attenuated mitochondrial ROS production, thereby maintaining MQC and subsequently suppressing CXCL1 generation within cultured tubule cells exposed to HG and PA. Collectively, our study establishes a pivotal role of tubule YAP1 inactivation-mediated MQC dysfunction in driving DKD progression, at least in part, facilitated by promoting M1 macrophage polarization through a paracrine-dependent mechanism.

AB  - Metastatic growth of ovarian cancer cells into the peritoneal cavity requires adaptation to various cellular stress factors to facilitate cell survival and growth. Here, we demonstrate the role of PVT1, one such stress induced long non-coding RNA, in ovarian cancer growth and metastasis. PVT1 is an amplified and over-expressed lncRNA in ovarian cancer with strong predictive value for survival and response to targeted therapeutics. We find that expression of PVT1 is regulated by tumor cells in response to cellular stress, particularly loss of cell-cell contacts and changes in matrix rigidity occurring in a YAP1-dependent manner. Induction of PVT1 promotes tumor cell survival, growth, and migration. Conversely, reducing PVT1 levels robustly abrogates metastatic behavior and tumor cell dissemination in cell lines and syngeneic transplantation models in vivo. We find that reducing PVT1 causes widespread changes in the transcriptome leading to alterations in cellular stress response and metabolic pathways including doxorubicin metabolism, which impacts chemosensitivity. Together, these findings implicate PVT1 as a promising therapeutic target to suppress metastasis and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.

AB  - The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a highly contagious pathogen in pigs. This study aimed to investigate the impact of PRRSV infection on cellular metabolism, particularly focusing on lipid metabolism to understand its role in promoting viral replication. We conducted a metabolic analysis on MARC145 cells before and after PRRSV infection. Our results demonstrated that the most significant alterations in cellular metabolism, accounting for 40.8 % of total changes, were related to lipid metabolism. These changes were primarily driven by the activation of sterol regulatory-element binding proteins (SREBPs), critical regulators of lipid biosynthesis. To understand the mechanisms behind SREBPs activation by PRRSV, we investigated the involvement of upstream effectors, specifically protein kinase B (AKT) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1). Our findings indicated that PRRSV infection triggered AKT activation, leading to the subsequent activation of PCK1. Activated PCK1 then phosphorylated insulin-induced genes (INSIGs), resulting in their degradation. This degradation facilitated the translocation of SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus. Additionally, we observed that PRRSV infection stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which played a critical role in activating AKT. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PRRSV enhances lipid synthesis through a ROS-dependent AKT/PCK1/INSIG/SREBPs signaling axis, which provides new insights into the metabolic strategies employed by PRRSV.

AB  - Magnesium alloys have gained popularity in orthopedic implants due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, which eliminates the need for secondary surgeries for removal. However, uncontrolled rapid degradation of most magnesium alloys can lead to early failure of implants with unexpected accumulation of gas, disturbing regeneration of surrounding tissues. In this article, we introduce new Mg-Zn-Zr-Mn magnesium alloys with biocompatible elements in low concentrations, which can form single-phase alloy and diminish corrosion due to galvanic corrosion due to multiple phases. These alloys also demonstrated outstanding mechanical properties with tensile strength of 332 MPa and excellent biocompatibility. Degradation tests were conducted in vitro by electrochemical tests and measuring mass loss and hydrogen gas released, and nearly constant degradation behavior was observed. In vivo degradation experiments were done using goats as models, and long-term observation demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and controlled degradation pattern of our new Mg alloys. Our results provided insights into the in vitro and in vivo performance of our new Mg alloys, and they can be highly promising for widespread use in orthopedic implants.

AB  - The use of omega fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation could be a beneficial strategy to improve health and production in ruminants. In this study, the effect of the dietary addition of c9, t11 and t10, c12 isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in pure soybean oil (T1) was compared with pure soybean oil (T2) and soybean oil discarded after frying fish (Centropomus undecimalis, Pagrus pagrus, and Caranx crysos; T3) on the fatty acid profile in ewe milk and the tissues of their lambs. Forty-five multiparous ewes (East Friesian x Katahdin), 32 to 35 months old, 70 days pregnant, were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental diets. The fatty acid profile, total solids, fat, protein, and lactose in milk were determined 14 days postpartum. Fifteen lambs from each treatment were sacrificed at 70 days of age, and the fatty acid profiles in perirenal fat, muscle, and brain were determined. In milk, fat and total solids content were lower with T1. On the other hand, linoleic acid content, the sum of omega-6 and DHA were higher in T1 compared to other groups (p < 0.05). In the brain, stearic acid and linoleic acid concentration increased with T1; eicosapentaenoic acid decreased and omega-3s increased with T3, while DHA was lower in T2 (p < 0.05). The addition of CLA isomers or discarded soybean oil in ewe diet from pregnancy to lactation is advantageous for the ewe since less energy in the form of milk fat is lost. In addition, increasing the concentration of omega fatty acids in ewe diet to improve omega fatty acids in lamb's brain could be a feed strategy to increase their productivity and health.

AB  - One-quarter of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) experience acute kidney injury (AKI)-an abrupt reduction or loss of kidney function associated with increased long-term mortality. There is a critical need to identify early and real-time markers of AKI in ADHF; however, to date, no protein biomarkers have exhibited sufficient diagnostic or prognostic performance for widespread clinical uptake. We aimed to identify novel protein biomarkers of AKI associated with ADHF by quantifying changes in protein abundance in the kidneys that occur during ADHF development and recovery in an ovine model. Relative quantitative protein profiling was performed using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra-mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) in kidney cortices from control sheep (n = 5), sheep with established rapid-pacing-induced ADHF (n = 8), and sheep after ~4 weeks recovery from ADHF (n = 7). Of the 790 proteins quantified, we identified 17 candidate kidney injury markers in ADHF, 1 potential kidney marker of ADHF recovery, and 2 potential markers of long-term renal impairment (differential abundance between groups of 1.2-2.6-fold, adjusted p < 0.05). Among these 20 candidate protein markers of kidney injury were 6 candidates supported by existing evidence and 14 novel candidates not previously implicated in AKI. Proteins of differential abundance were enriched in pro-inflammatory signalling pathways: glycoprotein VI (activated during ADHF development; adjusted p < 0.01) and acute phase response (repressed during recovery from ADHF; adjusted p < 0.01). New biomarkers for the early detection of AKI in ADHF may help us to evaluate effective treatment strategies to prevent mortality and improve outcomes for patients.

AB  - Chronic stress exposure during development can have lasting behavioral consequences that differ in males and females. More specifically, increased depressive behaviors in females, but not males, are observed in both humans and rodent models of chronic stress. Despite these known stress-induced outcomes, the molecular consequences of chronic adolescent stress in the adult brain are less clear. The stress hormone corticosterone activates the glucocorticoid receptor, and activity of the receptor is regulated through interactions with co-chaperones-such as the immunophilin FK506 binding proteins 5 (FKBP5). Previously, it has been reported that the adult stress response is modified by a history of chronic stress; therefore, the current study assessed the impact of chronic adolescent stress on the interactions of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with its regulatory co-chaperone FKBP5 in response to acute stress in adulthood. Although protein presence for FKBP5 did not differ by group, assessment of GR-FKBP5 interactions demonstrated that adult females with a history of chronic adolescent stress had elevated GR-FKBP5 interactions in the hippocampus following an acute stress challenge which could potentially contribute to a reduced translocation pattern given previous literature describing the impact of FKBP5 on GR activity. Interestingly, the altered co-chaperone interactions of the GR in the stressed female hippocampus were not coupled to an observable difference in transcription of GR-regulated genes. Together, these studies show that chronic adolescent stress causes lasting changes to co-chaperone interactions with the glucocorticoid receptor following stress exposure in adulthood and highlight the potential role that FKBP5 plays in these modifications. Understanding the long-term implications of adolescent stress exposure will provide a mechanistic framework to guide the development of interventions for adult disorders related to early life stress exposures.

AB  - Objective The online detection of thrombus and visualization are of great importance in the extracorporeal circulatory system. In this paper, a noninvasive and online detection method of thrombus in extracorporeal circulation based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is proposed. Methods Firstly, this paper investigates the effect of sensor size on the imaging performance through joint simulation. Secondly, a 16 -copper electrode EIT sensor with a diameter of 20 mm is designed based on the simulation results, a cyclic flow experimental platform is built, and static and cyclic flow experiments are designed. Instead of thrombus, pig blood clots of 3-6 mm in size are placed in fresh pig blood samples and image using the Tikhonov regularization algorithm. The 3 mm and 5 mm clots are placed in the circulation system, and the images of the size and position of the clots in the sensor section are reconstructed by the EIT system and compared with the results taken by the high-speed camera. Results The simulation results show that the image correlation coefficients (IC) are greater than 0.06 for the sensor diameters of 20 mm and 30 mm when the target-to-sensor area ratio (AR) is not less than 0.01, and the imaging effect is well. The static imaging results show that the relative size coverage ratio is less than or equal to 0.1. The circulating flow experiments show that the normalized relative conductivity value changes of 80 and 200 are detected as the clots pass through the sensor, and the results show that the method is capable of detecting clots in the circulatory system. Conclusion The method has the advantages of real-time and noninvasive, and is expected to be applied to the detection of thrombus in vitro.

AB  - ET is used in camel reproduction to increase the reproductive potential of elite females selected for production and show. This retrospective study analyzed the association between factors related to embryo flushing (flushing fluid turbidity and debris), embryo quality (grades 1-4), recipient uterine status (tone and endometrial microcalcifications (EM)), farm and its locations (Qassim and Hail), as well high and low temperature on the likelihood of establishment of the 2-month pregnancy rate (PR) in dromedary camels. A total of 4360 embryos were transferred to 2947 recipients in this study. Logistic regression analysis (binary) was applied to evaluate the association between the selected factors and PR in month two. The likelihood of PR was affected by embryo quality (p < 0.01), EMs (p < 0.01), and farm (p < 0.05) and its location (p < 0.01). Transferring embryos to low (p < 0.01) or medium (p < 0.05) EM recipients decreased the likelihood of PR by similar to 1.3 times compared to uteri without EM. Grade 3 or 4 embryo transfer decreased the likelihood of PR by similar to 1.9 and 2.6 times, respectively, compared to grade 1 embryos (p< 0.01). In Saudi Arabia, applying an ET program in dromedaries in the Hail region raised the prediction of PR over the Qassim region by 1.2 times. Temperature changes had no effect on PR; however, higher temperature only affected the PR when grade 4 embryos were transferred. In conclusion, the likelihood of PR was higher with the transfer of grade 1 or 2 embryos in an EM-free uterus in the Hail region (Saudi Arabia). PR was only affected by higher temperature in the case of transferring grade 4 embryos.

AB  - Microglia are the primary phagocytes in the central nervous system and clear dead cells generated during development or disease. The phagocytic process shapes the microglia phenotype, which affects the local environment. A unique population of microglia resides in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of neonatal mice, but how they influence the neurogenic niche is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that phagocytosis contributes to a pro-neurogenic microglial phenotype in the V-SVZ and that these microglia phagocytose apoptotic cells via the engulfment receptor Jedi-1. Deletion of Jedi-1 decreases apoptotic cell clearance, triggering a neuroinflammatory microglia phenotype that resembles dysfunctional microglia in neurodegeneration and aging and that reduces neural precursor proliferation via elevated interleukin-1b signaling; interleukin-1 receptor inhibition rescues precursor proliferation in vivo. Together, these results reveal a critical role for Jedi-1 in connecting microglial phagocytic activity to the maintenance of a pro-neurogenic phenotype in the developing V-SVZ.

AB  - The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is an amphibious, egg-laying mammal of high conservation value that is found only in Australia. The zoonotic bacterium Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo was discovered in platypuses in prior studies, but little is known about its epidemiology. Samples in the Platypus Serum Bank were tested in 2023 and the results were combined with historical records. Antibodies against L. interrogans serovar Hardjo were found in 50% of 464 serum samples from 411 platypuses collected from 14 river basins in southeastern Australia between 1981 and 2012; prevalence remained high over three decades in the Shoalhaven River population. Seroprevalence increased with age, suggesting environmental exposure. Individual platypuses had persistent titres, some for six years. Seropositive females lactated, juveniles were recruited into the population, and there were no reports of clinical leptospirosis. Three necropsied platypuses were seropositive and had mild nephritis with leptospires in the renal tubules. The high seroprevalence, persistent titres, lack of disease, mild renal lesions, and renal colonisation suggest the platypus may be a maintenance host. Sympatric cattle had L. interrogans serovar Hardjo titres, but the spatial association with seropositive platypuses was statistically weak. Other mammalian wildlife species and sheep also have L. interrogans serovar Hardjo titres; therefore, a complex ecological network must be considered. A landscape-wide study is recommended to properly assess transmission pathways and confirm who is infecting whom.

AB  - Terpenoids in plants are mainly synthesized by terpene synthases (TPSs), which play an important role in plant- environment interactions. Gossypium arboreum is one of the important cotton cultivars with excellent pest resistance, however, the biosynthesis of most terpenoids in this plant remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of leaves from intact and Helicoverpa armigera-infested cotton plants. The results showed that the H. armigera infestation mainly induced the JA signaling pathway, ten TPS genes were differentially expressed in G. arboreum leaves. Among them, a novel terpene synthase, GaTPS1, was heterologously expressed and functionally characterized in vitro. . The enzymatic reaction indicated that recombinant GaTPS1 was primarily responsible for the production of (E)-alpha-bergamotene. E )-alpha-bergamotene. Moreover, molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that two amino acid residues, A412L and Y535F, distinctly influenced the catalytic activities and product specificity of GaTPS1. The mutants GaTPS1-A412L and GaTPS1Y535F resulted in a decrease in the proportion of products (E)-alpha-bergamotene E )-alpha-bergamotene and D-limonene, while an increase in the proportion of products (E)-(1-farnesene, E )-(1-farnesene, alpha-pinene and (1-myrcene. Our findings provide valuable insights into understanding the molecular basis of terpenoid diversity in G. arboreum , , with potential applications in plant metabolism regulation and the improvement of resistant cotton cultivars.

AB  - The challenges posed by climate change and increasing world population are stimulating renewed efforts for improving the sustainability of animal production. To meet such challenges, the contribution of genomic selection approaches, in combination with assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), to spreading and preserving animal genetics is essential. The largest increase in genetic gain can be achieved by shortening the generation interval. This review provides an overview of the current status and progress of advanced ARTs that could be applied to reduce the generation time in both female and male of domestic ruminants. In females, the use of juvenile in vitro embryo transfer (JIVET) enables to generate offspring after the transfer of in vitro produced embryos derived from oocytes of prepubertal genetically superior donors reducing the generational interval and acceleration genetic gain. The current challenge is increasing in vitro embryo production (IVEP) from prepubertal derived oocytes which is still low and variable. The two main factors limiting IVEP success are the intrinsic quality of prepubertal oocytes and the culture systems for in vitro maturation (IVM). In males, advancements in ARTs are providing new strategies to in vitro propagate spermatogonia and differentiate them into mature sperm or even to recapitulate the whole process of spermatogenesis from embryonic stem cells. Moreover, the successful use of immature cells, such as round spermatids, for intracytoplasmic injection (ROSI) and IVEP could allow to complete the entire process in few months. However, these approaches have been successfully applied to human and mouse whereas only a few studies have been published in ruminants and results are still controversial. This is also dependent on the efficiency of ROSI that is limited by the current isolation and selection protocols of round spermatids. In conclusion, the current efforts for improving these reproductive methodologies could lead toward a significant reduction of the generational interval in livestock animals that could have a considerable impact on agriculture sustainability.

AB  - Impaired wound healing remains a significant clinical challenge, often exacerbated by bacterial infections and persistent inflammation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has demonstrated efficacy in combating bacterial infections; however, its utility in wound healing is limited due to its inability to address inflammation. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a PDT-based sequential therapy. Our approach effectively eliminates bacteria by generating sufficient reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO). It subsequently mitigates inflammation through sustained NO release and oxygen delivery. Additionally, we incorporated a pH-sensitive indicator to enable a sequential therapeutic schedule, optimizing the timing of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory interventions during wound healing. We demonstrate that this therapy enhances anti-infection efficacy, alleviates wound inflammation, and fosters a supportive environment for skin and superficial skeletal muscle repair in mouse, rabbit, and pig models. Collectively, our findings highlight the transformative potential of this strategy for advancing PDT in the treatment of wound healing.

AB  - Clostridium collagenase has provided superior clinical results in achieving digestion of immediate and accumulating devitalized collagen tissue. Recent studies suggest that debridement via Clostridium collagenase modulates a cellular response to foster an anti-inflammatory microenvironment milieu, allowing for a more coordinated healing response. In an effort to better understand its role in burn wounds, we evaluated Clostridium collagenase's ability to effectively minimize burn progression using the classic burn comb model in pigs. Following burn injury, wounds were treated with Clostridium collagenase or control vehicle daily and biopsied at various time points. Biopsies were evaluated for factors associated with progressing necrosis as well as inflammatory response associated with treatment. Data presented herein showed that Clostridium collagenase treatment prevented destruction of dermal collagen. Additionally, treatment with collagenase reduced necrosis (HMGB1) and apoptosis (CC3a) early in burn injuries, allowing for increased infiltration of cells and protecting tissue from conversion. Furthermore, early epidermal separation and epidermal loss with a clearly defined basement membrane was observed in the treated wounds. We also show that collagenase treatment provided an early and improved inflammatory response followed by faster resolution in neutrophils. In assessing the inflammatory response, collagenase-treated wounds exhibited significantly greater neutrophil influx at day 1, with macrophage recruitment throughout days 2 and 4. In further evaluation, macrophage polarization to MHC II and vascular network maintenance were significantly increased in collagenase-treated wounds, indicative of a pro-resolving macrophage environment. Taken together, these data validate the impact of clostridial collagenases in the pathophysiology of burn wounds and that they complement patient outcomes in the clinical scenario.

AB  - In the present study, neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane in combination with ketamine was investigated on TNF-alpha induced necroptosis of neurons and cognitive impairment in the rat model. The results demonstrated that exposure to TNF-alpha/z-VAD led to a significant decrease in viability of HT-22 neuronal cells. However, incubation of HT-22 cells with ketamine plus sevoflurane inhibited decrease in viability induced by TNF-alpha/z-VAD exposure. The increase in production of ROS by TNF-alpha/z-VAD exposure in HT-22 cells was effectively suppressed on pre-treatment with ketamine plus sevoflurane. Moreover, suppression of TNF-alpha/z-VAD induced ROS production in HT-22 cells by ketamine plus sevoflurane pretreatment was higher in comparison to ketamine or sevoflurane treatment alone. Treatment of HT-22 cells with ketamine plus sevoflurane suppressed TNF-alpha/z-VAD induced increase in RIP1 and p-MLKL protein expression. Ketamine plus sevoflurane treatment effectively reversed decrease in movement speed as well as total distance traveled in TNF-alpha injected rats. The number of neurons in rat hippocampus injected with TNF-alpha showed a significant decrease more specifically in carbonic anhydrase-3 region. However, no significant change in the density of neurons was observed in the hippocampus of rats pretreated with ketamine plus sevoflurane by TNF-alpha injection. The increase in expression of p-MLKL and p-RIP3 by TNF-alpha injection was effectively reversed in rats on treatment with ketamine plus sevoflurane. In silico studies revealed that ketamine interacts with p-MLKL protein in different confirmations with the binding affinities ranging from -9.7 to -8.4 kcal/mol. It was found that ketamine binds to p-MLKL protein by interacting with alanine (ALA A:295), proline (PRO A:306), glutamine (GLN A: 307) and isoleucine (ILE A:293) amino acid residues. In summary, ketamine plus sevoflurane combination alleviates TNF-alpha/z-VAD induced decrease in viability of HT-22 cells in vitro and rat hippocampus neurons in vivo. Moreover, ketamine plus sevoflurane combination prevented TNF-alpha injection induced cognitive impairment in rats. Therefore, sevoflurane plus ketamine combination can be developed as a potential therapeutic regimen for treatment of isoflurone induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - The sense of smell allows for the assessment of the chemical composition of volatiles in our environment. Different factors are associated with reduced olfactory function, including age, sex, as well as health and lifestyle conditions. However, most studies that aimed at identifying the variables that drive olfactory function in the population suffered from methodological weaknesses in study designs and participant selection, such as the inclusion of convenience sample or only of certain age groups, or recruitment biases.We aimed to overcome these issues by investigating the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) cohort, a population-based cohort, by using a validated odor identification test. Specifically, we hypothesized that a series of medical, demographic and lifestyle variables is associated with odor identification abilities. In addition, our goal was to provide clinicians and researchers with normative values for the Sniffin' Sticks identification set, after exclusion of individuals with impaired nasal patency.We included 6,944 participants without acute nasal obstruction and assessed several biological, social, and medical parameters. A basic model determined that age, sex, years of education, and smoking status together explained roughly 13% of the total variance in the data. We further observed that variables related to medical (positive screening for cognitive impairment and for Parkinson's disease, history of skull fracture, stage 2 hypertension) and lifestyle (alcohol abstinence) conditions had a negative effect on odor identification scores. Finally, we provide clinicians with normative values for both versions of the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test, i.e. with 16 items and with 12 items.

AB  - Kidney extraction time has a detrimental effect on post-transplantation outcome. This study aims to improve the flush-out and potentially decrease ischemic injury by the addition of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) to the flush medium. Porcine kidneys (n = 22) were extracted during organ recovery surgery. Pigs underwent brain death induction or a Sham operation, resulting in four groups: donation after brain death (DBD) control, DBD H2S, non-DBD control, and non-DBD H2S. Directly after the abdominal flush, kidneys were extracted and flushed with or without H2S and stored for 13 h via static cold storage (SCS) +/- H2S before reperfusion on normothermic machine perfusion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8 were significantly lower in H2S treated DBD kidneys during NMP (p = 0.03). The non-DBD kidneys show superiority in renal function (creatinine clearance and FENa) compared to the DBD control group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.004). No differences were seen in perfusion parameters, injury markers and histological appearance. We found an overall trend of better renal function in the non-DBD kidneys compared to the DBD kidneys. The addition of H2S during the flush out and SCS resulted in a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines without affecting renal function or injury markers.

AB  - Ossa cordis, bones located within the heart trigones, are often classified as heterotopic or ectopic bones. Despite their high prevalence in cattle and some other bovids, little is known about their structure or development. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microtomography, gross dissections, and measurements showed the anatomical locations, prevalence, shapes, and measurements of the cardiac bones in both Egyptian Baladi cattle and Holstein-Friesians. All cattle (n = 12) had an Ossa cordis dextrum (average = 50.70 x 20.91 x 5.40 mm). Additionally, 80% Egyptian Baladi and 57% Holstein-Friesian had a smaller Ossa cordis sinistrum (average = 24.94 x 12.75 x 4.12 mm). Egyptian Baladi Ossa cordis were smaller than observed in Holstein-Friesians. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis showed the elemental constitution (carbon, oxygen, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, sodium, and magnesium) of Ossa cordis and Cartilago cordis. These imaging techniques, plus four histological stains (hematoxylin and eosin, Crossman's trichrome, Alcian blue with Van Gieson, and Sirius Red) and microscopy, demonstrated osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, astrocytes, blood vessels, bone marrow, lamellar and woven bone, cortical bone, trabeculations with pores and canaliculi, and fibrous components including collagen in the Ossa cordis dextrum and sinistrum. Hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage (chondrocytes and cartilage matrix) were found within and surrounding the Ossa cordis. These findings were additionally compared against other cattle breeds and species.

AB  - In this study, sea buckthorn oil (SBO) was added to rainbow trout fish diets at 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% rates in order to determine the effects on growth, feed conversion rate, survival rate, fillet quality, and physiological, biochemical and histopathological parameters. The experiment was designed in four groups with three replicates each including 20 fish with 18 +/- 3 g and lasted for 45 days. Fish were fed three times a day and weighed biweekly. At the end of the experiment, significant differences were determined with respect to specific growth rates (SGR), weight gains (WG), and feed conversion ratios (FCR) (P < 0.05), except for survival ratios (SR) (P > 0.05). Sea buckthorn oil improved fish fillet quality and weight gain rates by up to 27% compared to control. The pepsin, amylase, lipase, and trypsin enzyme activities differed significantly (P < 0.05) from those of the control group. Serum lysozyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) and plasma nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) levels differed significantly (P < 0.05) in the 0.5% and 1% groups compared to the control group, except for the 0.25% group. Liver catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly differed in all groups, especially in the 0.5% and 1% groups compared to the control group (P < 0.05). SBO supplementation to feed caused significant changes in the FA profiles, especially 18:00 in & sum;SFA; 16:1 in & sum;MUFA; 20:5n-3 and 20:2n-6 in Sigma PUFA; 20:5n-3 in & sum;n-3; and 20:2n-6 in & sum;n-6 in rainbow trout (P < 0.05). There were no histopathological changes between the control and the experimental groups. The determined data suggested that 1% SBO may be successfully used as a feed additive in rainbow trout.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by cognitive impairments, specifically deficits in social recognition memory (SRM). Abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in these deficits. Due to the pathogenetic heterogeneity of schizophrenia, studying the hippocampal neurogenesis and SRM in two models with prenatal and postnatal defects could enhance our understanding of the developmental aspects of the biological susceptibility to schizophrenia. Here, we examined SRM and hippocampal neurogenesis in two developmental models of schizophrenia: gestational exposure to methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) and postweaning social isolation (SI). Our findings revealed that gestational MAM exposure induced a decay of social memory while postweaning SI led to impaired social memory formation and decay. In both models, we observed a correlation between impaired SRM and reduced number, and abnormal differentiation and less complex morphology of hippocampal neurons. These results indicate that aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to the deficits of SRM in both models, and these abnormalities may be a shared underlying pathogenic factor in developmental models of schizophrenia, regardless of prenatal and postnatal pathogenesis.

AB  - Simple Summary Zearalenone is a fungus that is often found in the ingredients of many animal feeds. Swine, as the animal most sensitive to zearalenone, have more severe symptoms of infection and therefore can cause great economic losses. The intestine is the first line of defence of the organism, so we constructed a model of zearalenone intoxication in swine small intestinal epithelial cell lines and performed various tests. Finally, we found that zearalenone can trigger oxidative stress, induce inflammatory response and apoptosis in porcine small intestinal cells, and finally trigger damage to porcine small intestinal tissues. We believe that the study of the effects of zearalenone on the intestinal tract of swine is of great significance for the prevention of zearalenone infection in swine, as well as for the treatment of infection.Abstract Zearalenone (ZEA) is the most common fungal toxin contaminating livestock and poultry feeding, especially in pigs, causing severe toxic effects and economic losses. However, the mechanism of ZEA damage to the intestine is unknown. We constructed an in vitro model of ZEA toxicity in a porcine small intestinal epithelial cell (IPEC-J2) line. ZEA causes severe oxidative stress in porcine small intestine cells, such as the production of ROS and a significant decrease in the levels of antioxidant enzymes GSH, CAT, SOD, and T-AOC. ZEA also caused apoptosis in porcine small intestine cells, resulting in a significant reduction in protein and/or mRNA expression of apoptosis-related pathway factors such as P53, caspase 3, caspase 9, Bax, and Cyt-c, which in turn caused a significant decrease in protein and/or mRNA expression of inflammatory-related factors such as IL-1 & beta;, IL-2, Cox-2, NF-& kappa;D, NLRP3, IL-6, and IL -18, which in turn caused a significant increase in protein and/or mRNA expression levels. The final results suggest that ZEA can cause a severe toxic response in porcine small intestine cells, with oxidative stress, apoptotic cell death and inflammatory damage.

AB  - To explore the molecular mechanism of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) poisoning death by ingestion of Camellia oleifera nectar, feeding experiments were designed to investigate the poisoning effects. Observed the development process of poisoning symptoms, and collected bees at key experimental nodes for transcriptome sequencing analysis. The results showed that the first poisoning symptom was observed within 0.5 h after ingestion of Camellia oleifera nectar, with death occurring as early as 2 h post-ingestion and all honey bees dying within 4 h. There were four stages in the development of poisoning symptoms: normal flying, crawling (abdominal swelling, inability to fly normally), fluttering (inability to crawl normally), and death. Transcriptome sequencing analyzed the causes of poisoning death indicated that honey bee poisoning occurred with the transduction of dietary restriction signals into cells, resulting in the down-regulated expression gene elements that ensure cell health and inhibit apoptosis, including intracellular NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin 1, insulin-like growth factor 1, and heat shock proteins. At the same time, the expression of cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 7, which protects programmed cell apoptosis, was also downregulated, resulting in the rapid and disorderly deaths of a large number of cells in individuals in a short period of time, and eventually leading to bees fatality.

AB  - The biosynthesis of catechins, a major type of flavonoids accumulated in tea, is mediated by developmental cues and environmental stimuli. Light enhances but shading treatment reduces catechin accumulation in tea leaves. However, the transcription factors involved in light-mediated catechin biosynthesis remain to be identified. Two GOLDEN2 LIKE genes from tea plant (CsGLK1 and CsGLK2) were isolated and characterized in both tomato and tea plants. Transcripts of both CsGLK1 and CsGLK2 were affected by light intensity in tea plants. Overexpression of CsGLK1 and CsGLK2 promoted chloroplast development and carotenoid accumulation in tomato fruits. An integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach revealed that both catechin content and related biosynthetic genes were upregulated in CsGLK-overexpressing tomato leaves. Our further studies in tea plants indicated that CsGLKs directly regulate the transcription of CsMYB5b, a transcription factor involved in catechin biosynthesis. Suppression of CsGLKs in tea leaves led to the reduction of both CsMYB5b expression and catechin accumulation. Taken together, the results show that CsGLKs are involved in light-regulated catechin accumulation in tea plants by regulating expression of CsMYB5b and have great potential for enhancing the accumulation of both carotenoids and flavonoids in fruits of horticultural crops.

AB  - Background Helicoverpa armigera is a major insect pest of several crop plants, including pigeonpea. Resistant gene sources are not available in the cultivated gene pool, but resistance has been observed in its crop wild relative, Cajanus scarabaeoides. Gene regulatory mechanisms governing the systemic immune response of this plant to pod borer infestation have not yet been deciphered. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiles of H. armigera-infested and undamaged adjacent leaves of C. scarabaeoides were compared to gain an insight into the plant-insect interactions and to identify dynamic miRNA molecules potentially acting as mediators of systemic defence responses. Results A total of 211 conserved, temporally dynamic miRNA were identified in the unfed adjacent leaves, out of which 98 were found to be differentially expressed in comparison to control leaves. On further analysis, most of the miRNA detected in the adjacent leaves was found to target genes involved in the defence pathways and plant immune response. An overlap of the differentially expressing miRNAs was observed between insect-fed and adjacent unfed leaves, indicating the transmission of signal from the site of infestation to the undamaged parts of the plant, indicative of induction of a systemic defence response. Conclusion The miRNA response in the unfed leaves had the signatures of induced changes in metabolism and signal transduction for induction of defence pathway genes. This study reveals the participation of miRNAs in imparting pod borer resistance and mounting a systemic defence response against pod borer infestation in C. scarabaeoides.

AB  - There is a paucity of information with respect to group-training for artificial vagina and its influence on semen characteristics and sexual behavior of young untrained rams. A total of 18 healthy Najdi rams (with an initial body weight of 40-45 Kg and 7-8 month-old) were consequently used herein to test the usefulness of group-training for artificial vagina-mediated semen collection during the breeding season. Rams were randomly segregated into three groups (n = 6 rams per protocol), and the whole experiment was lasted for 10 weeks. The 1st group was subjected to a training protocol where one untrained ram was placed for 20 min with a teaser ewe, while the 2nd group were subjected to a protocol where one untrained ram was placed for 20 min with one trained ram and a teaser ewe, whereas the 3rd group were subjected to a protocol where three untrained rams were placed for 20 min with one trained ram and a teaser ewe. The obtained results clearly (P < 0.05) showed that training young rams in group has increased their sperm concentration and sexual stimulation, shortened the period of their training time, and descriptively had a complete training efficiency. The sexual stimulation of young untrained rams was intensified by the competition between rams in the co-presence of a trained ram. Collectively, these data may suggest that group -training of rams at puberty is a better protocol for AV-mediated semen collection compared to individual training. Some shortcomings were noted herein, but research dealing with this subject may very well improve the reproductive performance of young untrained rams.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a key role in the postnatal development of the intestinal epithelium. However, the bacterial members of the primocolonizing microbiota driving these effects are not fully identified and the mechanisms underlying their long -term influence on epithelial homeostasis remain poorly described. Here, we used a model of newborn piglets treated during the first week of life with the antibiotic colistin in order to deplete specific gram-negative bacteria that are transiently dominant in the neonatal gut microbiota. Colistin depleted Proteobacteria and Fusobacteriota from the neonatal colon microbiota, reduced the bacterial predicted capacity to synthetize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and increased the concentration of succinate in the colon. The colistin-induced disruption of the primocolonizing microbiota was associated with altered gene expression in the colon epithelium including a reduction of toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4) and lysozyme (LYZ). Our data obtained in porcine colonic organoid cell monolayers suggested that these effects were not driven by the variation of succinate or LPS levels nor by a direct effect of colistin on epithelial cells. The disruption of the primocolonizing microbiota imprinted colon epithelial stem cells since the expression of TLR4 and LYZ remained lower in organoids derived from colistin-treated piglet colonic crypts after several passages when compared to control piglets. Finally, the stable imprinting of LYZ in colon organoids was independent of the H3K4me3 level in its transcription start site. Altogether, our results show that disruption of the primocolonizing gut microbiota alters epithelial innate immunity in the colon and imprints stem cells, which could have long -term consequences for gut health.

AB  - Compared with cemented implants in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), cementless prostheses can provide better biological fixation for young and active patients by their osseointegration with host bone. However, to date, early loosening occurs in most cementless knee prostheses due to extensive bone ingrowth deficiencies, especially at the tibial bone-prosthesis interfaces. This study aims to improve the osseointegration capability of 3D-printed cementless tibial prostheses by modifying metal surfaces with a three-partition trabecular-like porous structure. Ti6Al4V tibial prostheses were prepared with a novel three-partition trabecular surface design by electron beam melting (EBM) according to the regional structural and mechanical properties of human tibial plateaus. The trabecular prostheses were implanted in the knee joints of sheep in situ to evaluate the osseointegration and stability of the designed tibial implants. X-ray images and anatomical observation showed no detachment or displacement of the trabecular implants at 3 and 6 months postoperation. Micro-CT evaluation and histological analysis showed improved osseointegration and strengthened biological fixation of the trabecular implants. The cellular experiment results indicated that three topological types of porous scaffolds corresponding to the three-partition trabecular prosthesis design were favorable for the proliferation and differentiation of preosteoblasts. In conclusion, a novel three-partition trabecular surface design enhanced the osseointegration capacity of 3D-printed Ti6Al4V tibial implants, which will promote the application of cementless knee prostheses in clinics.

AB  - Hawthorn flavonoid (HF) exhibits potential benefits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, we identified the main components of HF, demonstrating that the administration of HF at a dose of 200 mg per kg per day significantly improved cognitive deficits in mice with AD induced by d-galactose and aluminum chloride. HF also effectively ameliorated beta-amyloid (A beta) accumulation and abnormal activation of hippocampal microglia. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of HF on gut microbiota and serum metabolomics in AD mice by 16S rRNA sequencing and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Our results showed that HF reversed the gut microbiota disturbance and metabolic disorder in AD mice by increasing the proportions of Dubosiella, Alloprevotella, and Bifidobacterium and decreasing the proportions of Acinetobacter, as well as increasing the levels of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), sphingolipid (SM), and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Notably, a positive correlation between DPA and Bifidobacterium was observed for the first time. Therefore, HF may serve as a promising dietary supplement for improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

Automatically extracting Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) from clinical trial studies can alleviate the traditionally time-consuming process of manually scrutinizing systematic reviews. Existing approaches of PICO frame extraction involves supervised approach that relies on the existence of manually annotated data points in the form of BIO label tagging. Recent approaches, such as In-Context Learning (ICL), which has been shown to be effective for a number of downstream NLP tasks, require the use of labeled examples. In this work, we adopt ICL strategy by employing the pretrained knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), gathered during the pretraining phase of an LLM, to automatically extract the PICO-related terminologies from clinical trial documents in unsupervised set up to bypass the availability of large number of annotated data instances. Additionally, to showcase the highest effectiveness of LLM in oracle scenario where large number of annotated samples are available, we adopt the instruction tuning strategy by employing Low Rank Adaptation (LORA) to conduct the training of gigantic model in low resource environment for the PICO frame extraction task. More specifically, both of the proposed frameworks utilize AlpaCare as base LLM which employs both few-shot in-context learning and instruction tuning techniques to extract PICO-related terms from the clinical trial reports. We applied these approaches to the widely used coarse-grained datasets such as EBMNLP, EBM-COMET and fine-grained datasets such as EBM-NLPrev and EBM-NLPh. Our empirical results show that our proposed ICL-based framework produces comparable results on all the version of EBM-NLP datasets and the proposed instruction tuned version of our framework produces state-of-the-art results on all the different EBM-NLP datasets.

AB  - Xinyang Maojian (XYMJ) green tea is one of the top ten teas in China, and the consumers prefer spring tea due to its umami taste and pleasurable aroma. However, the knowledge about temporal variation of the volatile compounds in XYMJ green teas harvested during different seasons is very limited. In the present work, the main non-volatile compounds that endowed the taste and volatile compounds responsible for the aroma in XYMJ green teas harvested during the spring and autumn seasons were determined. The average contents of free amino acids (FAA) were significantly higher and gradually declined in the spring teas, whereas the caffeine was significantly lower and gradually increased in the spring teas. A total of 39 volatile compounds of six chemical classes were detected in XYMJ green teas, and they displayed various change trends during the spring and autumn seasons, among which 15 volatile compounds were identified as the key odorants based on odor activity value (OAV). The highest OAV of 2195.05 was calculated for the violet-like smelling trans-beta-ionone followed by decanal, nonanal, dimethyl sulfide, linalool, geraniol and naphthalene. The OAVs of geraniol, (Z)-3-hexenyl hexanoate, heptanal, benzaldehyde and hexanal in XYMJ spring teas were higher than XYMJ autumn teas. The hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that XYMJ green teas were divided into three clusters and the quality of XYMJ green teas changed greatly within spring season. Harvest season is a crucial factor affecting the flavor quality of XYMJ green teas.

AB  - Accurate species identification is crucial for ecological research and effective wildlife management. Advances in molecular genetic tools enable this, even for cryptic species complexes that are often morphologically confusing or indistinguishable. However, the costs of these methods and sequencing remain prohibitive for many researchers, particularly in less developed regions. The aim of this study was to test whether ISSR-PCR markers can be used to distinguish three similar horseshoe bat species that are often misidentified and occur in sympatry in Serbia. Samples from 64 Rhinolophus euryale, R. blasii, and R. mehelyi bats were identified using this ISSR-PCR approach, and species identifications were additionally confirmed by sequencing D-loop fragment of mitochondrial DNA. ISSR-PCR yielded species-specific band patterns on the agarose gel that allowed the differentiation of three medium-sized horseshoe bat species. This approach does not require sequencing, making it a quick and inexpensive tool for the genetic identification of these species, and complements already existing methods. There is potential to scale up this method to other cryptic species complexes, reducing misidentifications that lead to inaccurate population trend assessments and have knock-on effects on our ability to monitor and conserve wildlife, especially rare and endangered species.

AB  - Tea plants have adapted to grow in tropical acidic soils containing high concentrations of aluminum (Al) and fluoride (F) (as Al/F hyperaccumulators) and use secret organic acids (OAs) to acidify the rhizosphere for acquiring phosphorous and element nutrients. The self-enhanced rhizosphere acidification under Al/F stress and acid rain also render tea plants prone to accumulate more heavy metals and F, which raises significant food safety and health concerns. However, the mechanism behind this is not fully understood. Here, we report that tea plants responded to Al and F stresses by synthesizing and secreting OAs and altering profiles of amino acids, catechins, and caffeine in their roots. These organic compounds could form tea-plant mechanisms to tolerate lower pH and higher Al and F concentrations. Furthermore, high concentrations of Al and F stresses negatively affected the accumulation of tea secondary metabolites in young leaves, and thereby tea nutrient value. The young leaves of tea seedlings under Al and F stresses also tended to increase Al and F accumulation in young leaves but lower essential tea secondary metabolites, which challenged tea quality and safety. Comparisons of transcriptome data combined with metabolite profiling revealed that the corresponding metabolic gene expression supported and explained the metabolism changes in tea roots and young leaves via stresses from high concentrations of Al and F. The study provides new insight into Al- and F-stressed tea plants with regard to responsive metabolism changes and tolerance strategy establishment in tea plants and the impacts of Al/F stresses on metabolite compositions in young leaves used for making teas, which could influence tea nutritional value and food safety.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that is accompanied by pronounced neuroinflammatory responses mainly characterized by marked microgliosis and astrogliosis. However, it remains open as to how different aspects of astrocytic and microglial activation affect disease progression. Previously, we found that microglia expansion in the spinal cord, initiated by IKK2/NF-kappa B activation in astrocytes, exhibits stage-dependent beneficial effects on the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we investigated the impact of NF-kappa B-initiated neuroinflammation on AD pathogenesis using the APP23 mouse model of AD in combination with conditional activation of IKK2/NF-kappa B signaling in astrocytes. We show that NF-kappa B activation in astrocytes triggers a distinct neuroinflammatory response characterized by striking astrogliosis as well as prominent microglial reactivity. Immunohistochemistry and Congo red staining revealed an overall reduction in the size and number of amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, isolated primary astrocytes and microglia cells exhibit specific marker gene profiles which, in the case of microglia, point to an enhanced plaque clearance capacity. In contrast, direct IKK2/NF-kappa B activation in microglia results in a pro-inflammatory polarization program. Our findings suggest that IKK2/NF-kappa B signaling in astrocytes may activate paracrine mechanisms acting on microglia function but also on APP processing in neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUND Many herbivore-induced volatiles have been proven to act as signaling compounds to regulate nearby plant defense responses. However, the precise roles of key volatiles produced by maize roots after Holotrichia parallela larva feeding remain largely unknown. RESULTS We investigated changes in phytohormones and volatiles in maize roots after H. parallela larval infestation. Marked increases in the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) and the volatiles jasmone and tetradecane were induced by herbivores, whereas the salicylic acid content decreased. In addition, pre-exposure to tetradecane markedly increased the levels of the stress hormone JA, its precursors and derivatives, and related gene expression. In addition, pre-exposure altered the production of defensive benzoxazinoid secondary metabolites, resulting in increased plant resistance to H. parallela larvae. Plants pre-exposed to jasmone did not differ from control plants. In addition, bioassays showed that H. parallela larval growth was suppressed by feeding maize roots after pre-exposure to tetradecane. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that tetradecane may function as a potent defense induction signal that prepares neighboring plants for incoming attacks.

AB  - Excessive lung inflammation and airway epithelial damage are hallmarks of human inflammatory lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Enhancement of innate immunity provides protection against pathogens while reducing lung-damaging inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying innate immunity-mediated protection in the lung remain mysterious, in part because of the lack of appropriate animal models for these human diseases. TLR5 (Toll-like receptor 5) stimulation by its specific ligand, the bacterial protein flagellin, has been proposed to enhance protection against several respiratory infectious diseases, although other cellular events, such as calcium signaling, may also control the intensity of the innate immune response. Here, we investigated the molecular events prompted by stimulation with flagellin and its role in regulating innate immunity in the lung of the pig, which is anatomically and genetically more similar to humans than rodent models. We found that flagellin treatment modulated NF-kappa B signaling and intracellular calcium homeostasis in airway epithelial cells. Flagellin pretreatment reduced the NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines to a second flagellin stimulus as well as to Pseudontonas aeruginosa infection. Moreover, in vivo administration of flagellin decreased the severity of P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia. Then we confirmed these beneficial effects of flagellin in a pathological model of CF by using ex vivo precision-cut lung slices from a CF pigz model. These results provide evidence that flagellin treatment contributes to a better regulation of the inflammatory response in inflammatory lung diseases such as CF.

AB  - Using natural waste as a source of minerals and biostimulants can offer many advantages in the production of plants in containers. The research aimed to evaluate the usefulness of cakes obtained from the production of camelina seed oil (Camelina sativa) in the cultivation of ferns. The greenhouse experiment used ornamental ferns rich in health-promoting compounds: Onoclea sensibilis, Polypodium vulgare, and Polystichum polyblepharum. Plants were planted in pots filled with peat substrate mixed with camelina press cake in the form of pellets at a dose of 1 g/L or 5 g/L. Plants grown in 100% peat substrate constituted the control. It was found that the plants grown in the medium enriched with press cake were higher (P. vulgare and P. polyblepharum), wider (O. sensibilis and P. polyblepharum), and had increased dry weight (O. sensibilis and P. polyblepharum) regardless of the dose of the cake. Moreover, in all species, the addition of press cake significantly increased total chlorophyll content by 23.5-32.5% and carotenoids by 17.7-68.7% compared to the control. The effect of cake on the level of total polyphenols and flavonoids as well as antioxidant activity was unequal and depended mainly on the species and the waste dose. Overall, developing sustainable fern cultivation principles and understanding their nutritional properties could contribute to the broader use of ferns in green spaces, medicine, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.

AB  - BackgroundFirst to third instars of Diaphania indica (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) feed on the lower surface of leaves, while fourth and fifth instars gregariously consume leaves of Trichosanthes anguina L. After defoliating, the caterpillar also attacks flowers and fruits of the plant and finally, results in loss of crop yield. Therefore, behavioral responses of D. indica adults were investigated to volatiles from undamaged (UD), insect-damaged (ID, plants after feeding by D. indica larvae) and jasmonic acid (JA) treated T. anguina plants. ResultsFemales showed attraction to volatiles of UD and ID plants of three T. anguina cultivars [MNSR-1 (MNS), Baruipur Long (BAR) and Polo No. 1 (POLO)] in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. Females did not show significant negative responses from volatiles of JA treated plants. Females were more attracted to volatiles of ID plants than UD plants. Females showed attraction to volatiles of UD or ID plants compared to JA treated plants. Females were attracted to certain synthetic blends resembling volatiles of insect-damaged MNS, BAR and POLO plants in olfactometer bioassays. Females could not distinguish among these three certain synthetic blends in olfactometer bioassays. A synthetic blend of 3Z-hexen-1-ol, & alpha;-pinene, hexyl acetate, benzyl alcohol and 6Z-nonenal at mole ratios of 1.47:1.20:1:1.82:1.21 was prepared at 20 mg/mL dichloromethane and 100 & mu;L when used as lure in funnel traps resulted in the capture of the highest number of D. indica adults in field trails. ConclusionThe earlier five-component chemical lure could be used in traps in an integrated pest management program of the insect pest, D. indica. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Background The oligophagous potato tuber moth (PTM), Phthorimaea operculella, and the polyphagous beet armyworm (BAW), Spodoptera exigua, are two destructive pests of potato, and infestations can lead to serious reduction in potato yield. However, potato plant responses to the two herbivories are only poorly understood. Endogenous jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is a signal responsible for the induction of plant anti-herbivore defenses. Elevation of JA-Ile by blocking its catabolism is considered to be an effective and sustainable approach to enhance plant resistance to insect pests. However, it is not clear whether this approach can enhance potato resistance to PTM and BAW. Results We demonstrated that the transcriptional changes induced by simulated PTM and BAW feeding overlap to a large extent, and that 81.5% of the PTM- and 90.5% of the BAW-responsive genes were commonly regulated. We also generated potato transgenic lines, irStCYP94B3s, in which the three JA-Ile hydroxylases were all simultaneously silenced. These lines exhibited enhanced resistance only to BAW, but not to PTM, although levels of JA-Ile and its downstream induced defensive chemicals, including caffeoylputrescine, dicaffeoylspermidine, lyciumoside II, and the nicotianosides I, II, and VII, were all present at higher levels in PTM-infested than in BAW-infested irStCYP94B3s lines. Conclusion Our results provide support for the hypothesis that StCYP94B3 genes are able to act as potential targets for the control of polyphagous insect pests in potato, and reveal that the oligophagous PTM has evolved an effective mechanism to cope with JA-Ile-induced anti-herbivore defenses.

AB  - To evaluate the fluoride concentration and pH of tea derived from Camellia sinensis produced and commercialized in Argentina. Forty-eight varieties of tea (black (n = 16), green (n = 21), red (n = 7), and white (n = 4)) commercialized in the form of leaves or tea bags were acquired. One bag or 2.0 +/- 0.05 g of each product was infused for 5 min in 200 mL of distilled boiled water. The F- concentration was determined using an ion-selective electrode and pH was measured using a pH meter. The found fluoride concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 9.7 mu g/mL and the pH ranged from 2.7 to 5.1. A higher fluoride concentration was observed in the leaves group (2.75 +/- 2.65 mu g/mL) compared to tea bags (1.10 +/- 0.82 mu g/mL) (p < 0.05). Regarding the type of tea, green and black tea were richer in F- than red and white tea. Fluoride and pH appeared not to be correlated (Pearson test). All the studied tea samples presented fluoride concentrations greater than the threshold recommended for drinking water. The pH proved to be low, which could be a risk for erosive tooth wear.

AB  - Increasing interest in studies of prenatal human brain development, particularly using new single-cell genomics and anatomical technologies to create cell atlases, creates a strong need for accurate and detailed anatomical reference atlases. In this study, we present two cellular-resolution digital anatomical atlases for prenatal human brain at postconceptional weeks (PCW) 15 and 21. Both atlases were annotated on sequential Nissl-stained sections covering brain-wide structures on the basis of combined analysis of cytoarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase staining, and an extensive marker gene expression dataset. This high information content dataset allowed reliable and accurate demarcation of developing cortical and subcortical structures and their subdivisions. Furthermore, using the anatomical atlases as a guide, spatial expression of 37 and 5 genes from the brains, respectively, at PCW 15 and 21 was annotated, illustrating reliable marker genes for many developing brain structures. Finally, the present study uncovered several novel developmental features, such as the lack of an outer subventricular zone in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex, and the apparent extension of both cortical (excitatory) and subcortical (inhibitory) progenitors into the prenatal olfactory bulb. These comprehensive atlases provide useful tools for visualization, segmentation, targeting, imaging, and interpretation of brain structures of prenatal human brain, and for guiding and interpreting the next generation of cell census and connectome studies.

AB  - In vitro follicle development from cryopreserved ovarian tissue could become an invaluable assisted reproduction technology for women with early ovarian failure. The challenge lies in producing, from small follicles present in the ovarian cortex, high-quality mature oocytes able to sustain embryo development. In vivo, an optimal combination of hormones and other factors coordinates the development of follicles and their enclosed oocyte. We have investigated the effect of the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine, alone or in combination with FSH, on sheep in vitro follicle development from the preantral stage onwards. LIF did not alter follicle growth or antrum formation, but it modulated the differentiation of granulosa cells, as revealed by decreased production of anti-Mullerian hormone and abolished FSH-induced stimulation of oestradiol secretion. This modulatory role was also reflected in the abundance of mRNA from 35 genes, analysed by reverse-transcription coupled to microfluidic quantitative PCR. LIF stimulated or at least maintained the expression of genes involved in the dialogue between the oocyte and granulosa cells, through gap junctions (GJA4 encoding connexin 37) or paracrine signalling (Bone morphogenetic protein 15, KIT ligand and their receptors). Finally, the presence of both LIF and FSH during follicle growth strongly improved oocyte meiotic competence: most oocytes (56%) underwent subsequent nuclear maturation, a significant increase compared with their counterparts from follicles of similar size (550-900 mu m) cultured with FSH only (28%) or developed in vivo (9%). Their ability to sustain embryo development remains to be evaluated. Combined supplementation with FSH and LIF certainly merits investigation with human follicles.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 1 (AFB1) 1 ) not only causes significant losses in livestock production but also poses a serious threat to human health. It is the most carcinogenic among known chemicals. Pigs are more susceptible to AFB1 1 and experience a higher incidence. However, the molecular mechanism of the toxic effect of AFB1 1 remains unclear. In this study, we used assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq to uncover chromatin accessibility and gene expression dynamics in PK-15 cells during early exposure to AFB1. 1 . We observed that the toxic effects of AFB1 1 involve signaling pathways such as p53, PI3K-AKT, Hippo, MAPK, TLRs, apoptosis, autophagy, and cancer pathways. Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs), including AP- 1, Fos, JunB, and Fra2, play a crucial role in regulating the biological processes involved in AFB1 1 challenge. Several new TFs, such as BORIS, HNF1b, Atf1, and KNRNPH2, represent potential targets for the toxic mechanism of AFB1. 1 . In addition, it is crucial to focus on the concentration of intracellular zinc ions. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying AFB1-induced 1-induced nephrotoxicity and offer new molecular targets.

AB  - Milk production is an important trait that influences the economic value of camels. However, the genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying milk production in camels have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to identify candidate molecular markers that affect camel milk production. We classified Junggar Bactrian camels (9-10-year-old) as low-yield (<1.96 kg/d) or high-yield (>2.75 kg/d) based on milk production performance. Milk fat (5.16 +/- 0.51 g/100 g) and milk protein (3.59 +/- 0.22 g/100 g) concentrations were significantly lower in high-yielding camels than those in low-yielding camels (6.21 +/- 0.59 g/100 g, and 3.93 +/- 0.27 g/100 g, respectively) (p < 0.01). There were no apparent differences in gland tissue morphology between the low- and high-production groups. Whole-genome resequencing of 12 low- and 12 high-yield camels was performed. The results of selection mapping methods, performed using two methods (F-ST and theta pi), showed that 264 single nucleotide polymorphism sites (SNPs) overlapped between the two methods, identifying 181 genes. These genes were mainly associated with the regulation of oxytocin, estrogen, ErbB, Wnt, mTOR, PI3K-Akt, growth hormone synthesis/secretion/action, and MAPK signaling pathways. A total of 123 SNPs were selected, based on significantly associated genomic regions and important pathways for SNP genotyping, for verification in 521 additional Bactrian camels. This analysis showed that 13 SNPs were significantly associated with camel milk production yield and 18 SNPs were significantly associated with camel milk composition percentages. Most of these SNPs were located in coding regions of the genome. However, five and two important mutation sites were found in the introns of CSN2 (beta-casein) and CSN3 (kappa-casein), respectively. Among the candidate genes, NR4A1, ADCY8, PPARG, CSN2, and CSN3 have previously been well studied in dairy livestock. These observations provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying milk production in camels as well as genetic markers for breeding programs aimed at improving milk production.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway plays an essential role in organ size control and tumorigenesis. Loss of Hippo signal and hyperactivation of the downstream oncogenic YAP signaling are commonly observed in various types of cancers. We previously identified STRN3-containing PP2A phosphatase as a negative regulator of MST1/2 kinases (i.e., Hippo) in gastric cancer (GC), opening the possibility of selectively targeting the PP2Aa-STRN3-MST1/2 axis to recover Hippo signaling against cancer. Here, we further discovered 1) disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved drug, which can similarly block the binding of STRN3 to PP2A core enzyme and 2) CX-6258 (CX), a chemical inhibitor, that can disrupt the interaction between STRN3 and MST1/2, both allowing reactivation of Hippo activity to inhibit GC. More importantly, we found these two compounds, via an MST1/2 kinase-dependent manner, inhibit DNA repair to sensitize GC towards chemotherapy. In addition, we identified thiram, a structural analog of DSF, can function similarly to inhibit cancer cell proliferation or enhance chemotherapy sensitivity. Interestingly, inclusion of copper ion enhanced such effects of DSF and thiram on GC treatment. Overall, this work demonstrated that pharmacological targeting of the PP2Aa-STRN3-MST1/2 axis by drug compounds can potently recover Hippo signal for tumor treatment.

AB  - An analog of a bovine-appeasing substance (BAS) was previously demonstrated to have calming effects, and it could be an alternative to alleviate the stress caused by weaning. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of BAS administration at weaning on growth, stress, behavior, and response to vaccination of Nellore calves. Eighty-six Nellore calves (40 females and 46 males) were abruptly weaned and randomly assigned into 1 of 2 treatments: (1) saline solution (0.9% NaCl; n = 43) and (2) BAS (Secure Catte, IRSEA Group, Quartier Salignan, France; n = 43). The solutions were topically applied (5 mL/calf) to the nuchal skin area of each animal. On d 0, before treatment application, calves were vaccinated against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), parainfluenza-3 (PI3) virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 (BVDV-1 and 2). Calves from each treatment were kept in different pastures for 15 d (time of BAS action) and then moved to a single pasture. Body weight (BW), blood samples, and temperament in the chute (entry score, chute score, and exit score) were collected on d 0, 3, 8, 15, 51, and 100, and behavior on pasture on d 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Calves assigned to BAS vs. Saline treatment tended to have greater BW on d 15 (p = 0.10), tended to have lower entry scores on d 8 and 51 (p = 0.10), and chute scores on d 8 (p = 0.07), and had lower exit scores on d 8 (p = 0.02). Calves assigned to BAS vs. Saline treatment also had greater time grazing on d 7 and 9 (p < 0.01), eating concentrate on d 2, 5, and 6 (p = 0.05), walking on d 1, 2, 5, and 9 (p < 0.01), standing and ruminating on d 2, 7 and 9 (p < 0.01), and playing on d 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, they had lower time lying on 1 and 2 (p < 0.01), standing on d 5 and 9 (p < 0.01), and vocalizing on d 1 and 2 (p < 0.01). Calves assigned to BAS vs. Saline treatment had greater serum titter concentrations of PI3 t on d 15 and 51 (p = 0.05) and BVDV-1 on d 51 (p = 0.02). However, they had lower serum concentrations of cortisol on d 3 (p = 0.03). BAS administration did not affect (p >= 0.12) the serum titer concentration of IBR and BVDV-2 titers or the plasma concentration of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin. The BAS administration improved BW, reduced temperament and serum cortisol concentration, and improved behavior and response to vaccination.

AB  - Synaptic transmission is essential for nervous system function and the loss of synapses is a known major contributor to dementia. Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) is characterized by synaptic loss in the mesial temporal lobe and cerebral neocortex, both of which are brain areas associated with memory and cognition. The association of synaptic loss and ADD was established in the late 1980s, and it has been estimated that 30-50% of neocortical synaptic protein is lost in ADD, but there has not yet been a quantitative profiling of different synaptic proteins in different brain regions in ADD from the same individuals. Very recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of synapses is being developed, accelerating the focus on the role of synaptic loss in ADD and other conditions. In this study, we quantified the densities of two synaptic proteins, the presynaptic protein Synaptosome Associated Protein 25 (SNAP25) and the postsynaptic protein postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in the human brain, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Protein was extracted from the cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, frontal, primary visual, and entorhinal cortex from cognitively unimpaired controls, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjects with dementia that have different levels of Alzheimer's pathology. SNAP25 is significantly reduced in ADD when compared to controls in the frontal cortex, visual cortex, and cingulate, while the hippocampus showed a smaller, non-significant reduction, and entorhinal cortex concentrations were not different. In contrast, all brain areas showed lower PSD95 concentrations in ADD when compared to controls without dementia, although in the hippocampus, this failed to reach significance. Interestingly, cognitively unimpaired cases with high levels of AD pathology had higher levels of both synaptic proteins in all brain regions. SNAP25 and PSD95 concentrations significantly correlated with densities of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Our results suggest that synaptic transmission is affected by ADD in multiple brain regions. The differences were less marked in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, most likely due to a ceiling effect imposed by the very early development of neurofibrillary tangles in older people in these brain regions.

AB  - In light of the global health crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous experts have deemed the utilization of hand sanitizers imperative as a precautionary measure against the virus. Consequently, the demand for hand sanitizers has experienced a substantial surge. Since the beginning of 2020, the utilization of alcohol-free hand sanitizers has been increasingly favored due to the potential risks associated with alcohol poisoning, flammability, as well as the adverse effects on skin lipid dissolution, dehydration, and sebum reduction, which can lead to severe cases of eczema and norovirus infections. In this study, we developed an aqueous hand sanitizer that does not contain alcohol. The sanitizer consists of naturally occurring, food-grade organic acids, including lactic, citric, and azelaic acids. Additionally, food-grade ammonium sulfate and a small amount of povidone-iodine (PVPI) were included in the formulation to create a synergistic and potent antibacterial effect. The effectiveness of the hand sanitizer was evaluated against four common foodborne pathogens, namely Clostridium botulinum, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, via in vitro testing. The organic acids exhibited a synergistic inhibitory function, resulting in a 3-log reduction in CFU/mL. Furthermore, the presence of povidone-iodine and ammonium sulfate enhanced their antibacterial effect, leading to a 4-log reduction in CFU/mL. The hand sanitizer solution remained stable even after 60 days of storage. During this period, the detection of additional triiodide (I3-) ions occurred, which have the ability to release broad-spectrum molecular iodine upon penetrating the cell walls. This alcohol-free hand sanitizer may offer extended protection and is anticipated to be gentle on the skin. This is attributed to the presence of citric and lactic acids, which possess cosmetic properties that soften and smoothen the skin, along with antioxidant properties.

AB  - Theta sequences and phase precession shape hippocampal activity and are considered key underpinnings of memory formation. Theta sequences are sweeps of spikes from multiple cells, tracing trajectories from past to future. Phase precession is the correlation between theta firing phase and animal position. Here, we reconsider these temporal processes in CA1 and the computational principles that they are thought to obey. We find stronger heterogeneity than previously described: we identify cells that do not phase precess but reliably express theta sequences. Other cells phase precess only when medium gamma (linked to ento-rhinal inputs) is strongest. The same cells express more sequences, but not precession, when slow gamma (linked to CA3 inputs) dominates. Moreover, sequences occur independently in distinct cell groups. Our results challenge the view that phase precession is the mechanism underlying the emergence of theta sequences, suggesting a role for CA1 cells in multiplexing diverse computational processes.

AB  - Dominant processes in a watershed are those that most strongly control hydrologic function and response. Estimating dominant processes enables hydrologists to design physically realistic streamflow generation models, design management interventions, and understand how climate and landscape features control hydrologic function. A recent approach to estimating dominant processes is through their link to hydrologic signatures, which are metrics that characterize the streamflow timeseries. Previous authors have used results from experimental watersheds to link signature values to underlying processes, but these links have not been tested on large scales. This paper fills that gap by testing signatures in large sample data sets from the U.S., Great Britain, Australia, and Brazil, and in Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) watersheds. We found that most inter-signature correlations are consistent with process interpretations, that is, signatures that are supposed to represent the same process are correlated, and most signature values are consistent with process knowledge in CZO watersheds. Some exceptions occurred, such as infiltration and saturation excess processes that were often misidentified by signatures. Signature distributions vary by country, emphasizing the importance of regional context in understanding signature-process links and in classifying signature values as "high" or "low." Not all signatures were easily transferable from single, small watersheds to large sample studies, showing that visual or process-based assessment of signatures is important before large-scale use. We provide a summary table with information on the reliability of each signature for process identification. Overall, our results provide a reference for future studies that seek to use signatures to identify hydrological processes.

AB  - DNA-based immunization has been previously shown to be an efficient approach to induce robust immunity against infectious diseases in animals and humans. The advantages of DNA vaccines are simplicity of their construction and production, low cost, high stability, and ability to elicit a full spectrum of immune responses to target antigens. The goals of this study were (i) to assess the antibody immune response to rabies virus glycoproteins (rGPs) in rabbits and guinea pigs after intramuscular immunization with pTargeT and pVAC2-mcs mammalian expression vectors encoding either the wild-type (WT) or codon-optimized (cOPT) rGP genes; and (ii) to prepare in-house rabbit anti-rGP polyclonal antibody reagents suitable for in Single Radial Immunodiffusion (SRID) and Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) assays. The maximum antibody responses against rabies virus in rabbits and guinea pigs were observed after immunization series with 500 mu g/dose of pVAC2-mcs vector encoding either the WT or cOPT rGP genes adjuvanted with Emulsigen-D. No significant difference in the antirabies virus neutralizing antibody titers was observed in rabbits immunized with the WT and cOPT rGPs. The inhouse rabbit anti-rGP polyclonal antibody reagents reacted comparable to the current reference reagents in SRID and IFA assays. The results of the study demonstrated that the DNA immunization of animals with the WT or cOPT rGPs is a promising approach to either induction of high anti-rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers in vivo or for production of polyclonal antibody reagents against rabies.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIntegrated pest management (IPM) in European glasshouses has substantially advanced in automated insect pest detection systems lately. However, transforming such an enormous data influx into optimal biological control strategies remains challenging. In addition, most biological control forecast studies relied on the single-best model approach, which is susceptible to overconfidence, and they lack validation over sufficient sampling repetitions where robustness remains questionable. Here we propose employing an unweighted ensemble model, by combining multiple forecasting models ranging from simple models (linear regressions and Lotka-Volterra model) to machine learning models (Gaussian process, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron), to predict 1-week-ahead population of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), a notorious pest in glasshouses, under the influence of its biological control agent Macrolophus pygmaeus in pepper-growing glasshouses.RESULTSModels were trained with only 1 year of data, validated over 3 years of monitoring of multiple compartments to evaluate their robustness. The full ensemble model outperformed the Na & iuml;ve Forecast in 10 out of 14 compartments for validation, with around 0.451 and 26.6% increase in coefficient of determination (R2) and directional accuracy, respectively. It also extended 0.096 in R2 from the best single model, equivalent to a 27% increase in accuracy, while maintaining a 75% directional accuracy.CONCLUSIONOur results demonstrated the benefits of the ensemble model over the traditional 'single-best model' approach, avoiding model structural biases and minimizing the risk of overconfidence. This showcased how an ensemble model with minimal training data can assist growers in fully utilizing the pest monitoring data and support their decision-making on IPM.

AB  - Fish gelatin has been increasingly used as a safe alternative to cattle and pig gelatin due to its similar structure, avoiding the health and socio-cultural issues associated with the use of materials of mammalian origin. Fish gelatin can be produced from processed fish products to achieve a high yield at a low cost. Recent studies show that although fish gelatin comes from a wide range of sources, the protein content and amino acid composition of fish gelatin from different sources are different, and some fish gelatin is soft and unstable transglutaminase (TGase) can catalyze the ?-amide group of glutamine residues and the e-amino group of lysine residues in proteins to form covalent bonds to form a stable protein network structure, improve the strength of the gel so that it can be applied in a more special environment. In this experiment, after screening the raw materials of cold-water fish gelatin M06 and M08, warm-water fish gelatin M03 and M04, a strong fish gelatin was successfully prepared by catalytic modification of cold-water fish gelatin by transglutaminase (TGase), and the excellent performance of TG enzyme-catalyzed modified gelatin was proved through the application effect of chicken salt soluble protein. In this experiment, the protein content of cold-water fish M08 was the highest, which was up to 99.9%, 1.09 times that of warm-water fish. The gelatin content of cold-water fish M08 was the highest of the four kinds of fish gelatin, with a wide proportion of components and rich amino acid composition. Cold-water fish M08 gelatin-derived gel had the highest strength of 253 +/- 1 g/cm at 4 degrees C. It was found that fish gelatin with protein molecular weight distribution and rich amino acid composition had higher gel strength. M08 gelatin is cross-linked by transglutaminase (TGase), which increases the strength of enzyme gels by approximately 200% compared to self-assembled gels. Fish gelatin catalyzed by the TG enzyme improves the gel strength of raw material and makes it more applicable. M08 gelatin also showed good application performance at low temperatures in compound chicken salt-soluble protein gel, with a water retention rate of 95.84% and gel strength of 198.5 g/cm. This study expanded the application range of fish gelatin by TG enzyme and improved the application potential of fish gelatin.

AB  - BACKGROUND The black carabid beetle Calosoma maximoviczi is a successful predator that serves as both a beneficial insect and a severe threat to economic herbivores. Its hunting technique relies heavily on olfaction, but the underlying mechanism has not been studied. Here, we report the electrophysiological, ecological and molecular traits of bioactive components identified from a comprehensive panel of natural odorants in the beetle-prey-plant system. The aim of this work was to investigate olfactory perceptions and their influence on the behaviours of C. maximoviczi. RESULTS Among the 200 identified volatiles, 18 were concentrated in beetle and prey samples, and 14 were concentrated in plants. Insect feeding damage to plants led to a shift in the emission fingerprint. Twelve volatiles were selected using successive electrophysiological tests. Field trials showed that significant sex differences existed when trapping with a single chemical or chemical mixture. Expression profiles indicated that sex-biased catches were related to the expression of 15 annotated CmaxOBPs and 40 CmaxORs across 12 chemosensory organs. In silico evaluations were conducted with 16 CmaxORs using modelling and docking. Better recognition was predicted for the pairs CmaxOR5-(Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, CmaxOR6-beta-caryophyllene, CmaxOR18-(E)-beta-ocimene and CmaxOR18-tetradecane, with higher binding affinity and a suitable binding pocket. Lastly, 168Y in CmaxOR6 and 142Y in CmaxOR18 were predicted as key amino acid residues for binding beta-caryophyllene and tetradecane, respectively. CONCLUSION This work provides an example pipeline for de novo investigation in C. maximoviczi baits and the underlying olfactory perceptions. The results will benefit the future development of trapping-based integrated pest management strategies and the deorphanization of odorant receptors in ground beetles.

AB  - For many catchments, there is insufficient field data to calibrate the hydrological models that are needed to answer water resources management questions. One way to overcome this lack of data is to use remotely sensed data. In this study, we assess whether Landsat-based surface water extent observations can inform the calibration of a lumped bucket-type model for Brazilian catchments. We first performed synthetic experiments with daily, monthly, and limited monthly data (April-October), assuming a perfect monotonic relation between streamflow and stream width. The median relative performance was 0.35 for daily data and 0.17 for monthly data, where values above 0 imply an improvement in model performance compared to the lower benchmark. This indicates that the limited temporal resolution of remotely sensed data is not an impediment for model calibration. In a second step, we used real remotely sensed water extent data for calibration. For only 76 of the 671 sites the remotely sensed water extent was large and variable enough to be used for model calibration. For 30% of these sites, calibration with the actual remotely sensed water extent data led to a model fit that was better than the lower benchmark (i.e., relative performance >0). Model performance increased with river width and variation therein. This indicates that the coarse spatial resolution of the freely-available, long time series of water extent used in this study hampered model calibration. We, therefore, expect that newer higher-resolution imagery will be helpful for model calibration for more sites, especially when time series length increases.

AB  - Shape-adaptive tissue-responsive adhesive patch (STRAP), inspired by the electric-eel's bioelectric capabilities, is proposed to enhance postsurgical recovery in diabetes. STRAP integrates piezoelectric nanogenerators, photothermal materials, and shape-adaptive fibers to address diabetes-related challenges, including impaired wound healing, infection susceptibility, and regeneration deficits. Its biochemical and photothermal properties promote tissue adhesion through covalent bonding and conformational adaptability, ensuring rapid hemostasis and preventing wound adhesions. STRAP replicates the natural microenvironment for effective regeneration and transforms mechanical energy from acoustic stress into beneficial electrical signals, boosting cellular activity, inhibiting bacterial infection, and accelerating wound repair. Preclinical evaluations across multiple animal models demonstrate STRAP's capacity to dynamically adapt to individual conditions and evolving environments, resulting in superior hemostatic performance in a pig liver injury model, postoperative adhesion prevention in the intestine and stomach, and wound healing acceleration in diabetic mouse, rat, and rabbit models. This underscores the promise of nature-inspired designs in tackling medical challenges. In summary, by integrating rapid hemostasis, infection control, tissue regeneration, and antiadhesion properties, STRAP provides a comprehensive solution for postoperative wound management and recovery.

AB  - Strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) of incrementally grown tissues have been widely used to study movement ecology and migration of animals. However, the time scale of Sr-87/Sr-86 incorporation from the environment into tissue and how it may influence data interpretation are still poorly understood. Using the relocation of a zoo elephant (Loxodonta africana) named Misha, we characterise and model the Sr-87/Sr-86 turnover process using high-resolution measurements of its tusk dentine. We seek to develop a framework that can improve quantitative interpretation of Sr-87/Sr-86 data in tissues.The Sr-87/Sr-86 transition associated with the relocation is measured using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) on a prepared tusk slab. We develop a turnover model (BITS), with a rapidly exchanging central pool and a slowly exchanging peripheral pool, in a Bayesian statistical framework. The measured dentine data are first used to calibrate model parameters. The parameters are then used to estimate possible Sr-87/Sr-86 input time series from two datasets via model inversion: a fidelity test using Misha's dentine data and a case study using published dentine measurements from an Alaskan Woolly Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius).The LA-ICP-MS data are consistent with a two-compartment turnover process with equivalent half-lives of 41 days for the central pool and 170 days for the peripheral pool. The model inversion shows good fidelity when estimating the intake Sr-87/Sr-86 time series associated with Misha's relocation. In the case study, the model suggests an abrupt pattern of change in, and a much wider range of, intake Sr-87/Sr-86 values than expressed in the woolly mammoth dentine data themselves.Our framework bridges the gap between environmental Sr-87/Sr-86 variation and data measured in tusk dentine or other incrementally grown tissues. It could be coupled with movement models and additional isotope tracers to study seasonal residency or the spatial and temporal patterns of movement/migration. The generic turnover processes can be adapted to other isotope systems, additional incremental tissues, or other organisms, thus expanding our modelling toolkit to investigate niche partitioning, life history traits and behavioural patterns in conservation biology, archaeology and paleoecology.

AB  - BACKGROUNDHerbivorous mites perceive odorants through olfactory mechanisms, though the molecular basis of olfaction in these species remains poorly understood. Recent studies have identified Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) proteins as odorant carriers in the peripheral olfactory systems of insects. Multiple NPC2 genes have been discovered in spider mite genomes, yet their specific roles in olfactory function have not been fully explored.RESULTSBehavioral assays showed that 8 of the 12 tested plant volatiles elicited either repellent or attractive responses in Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Two NPC2 genes were identified as responsive to odorant stimulation. Recombinant NPC2 proteins were produced, and microscale thermophoresis (MST) assays revealed specific binding: TcinNPC2-2 bound to geranylacetone [dissociation constant (Kd) = 3.32 mu m], and TcinNPC2-3 bound to farnesol (Kd = 9.55 mu m). Knockdown of NPC2 genes via RNA interference abolished mite responses to these odorants in behavioral assays.CONCLUSIONSMite olfactory responses to a number of odorants were widely documented. NPC2-2 and NPC2-3 proteins play critical roles in the olfactory detection of geranylacetone and farnesol, respectively. This study enhances our understanding of the peripheral olfactory processes in herbivorous mites, offering insights for the development of behavior-targeting agents for mite control.

AB  - BACKGROUND Plants have evolved sophisticated defense responses to insect herbivore attack, which often involve elicitors in the insects' oral secretions. The major eliciting compounds in insect oral secretions across different species and their potency in inducing volatile emissions have not yet been fully characterized and compared.
   RESULTS Seven lepidopteran insects with variable duration of association with maize were selected, five species known as pests for a long time (Ostrinia furnacalis, Spodoptera exigua, Spodoptera litura, Mythimna separata, and Helicoverpa armigera) and two newly emerging pests (Athetis lepigone and Athetis dissimilis). Oral secretions of the newly emerging pests have the highest total contents of Fatty Acid-Amino Acid Conjugates (FACs), and their relative composition was well separated from that of the other five species in principal compound analysis. Redundancy analyses suggested that higher quantity of FACs was mainly responsible for the increases in maize volatiles, of which (E)-3,8-dimethyl-1,4,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (E, E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) were the most strongly inducible compounds. Adding FACs to the oral secretion of S. litura larvae significantly increased the emissions of TMTT and DMNT, confirming the key role of FACs in inducing volatile emissions in maize plants. Additional experiments with artificial diet spiked with linolenic acid suggested that variation in FACs is due to differences in internal FAC degradation and fatty acid excretion.
   CONCLUSION Compared with two newly emerging pests A. lepigone and A. dissimilis, the long-term pests could diminish the volatile emission by maize through reducing the FAC content in their oral secretions, which may lower the risk of attracting natural enemies.

AB  - This paper assesses the value of agroecological farm schools by analyzing 4 Senegalese cases. Pedagogical quality is measured by: (1) feedback from former learners, (2) acquisition of fundamental knowledge, and (3) professionalization. Beyond globally positive opinions about training, our results show that farm schools display distinct performances. Developing a systemic perspective is not an easy task, but having trainers with more advanced agroecological expertise is an asset. Effective training builds on active pedagogy. Post-training business establishment is facilitated when farm schools create networks in agroecology and/or offer a consequent starter kit. Farm schools could thus contribute to agroecological transitions.

AB  - Dendritic spines form the postsynaptic compartment of most excitatory synapses in the vertebrate brain. Morphological changes of dendritic spines contribute to major forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). Synaptic plasticity underlies learning and memory, and defects in synaptic plasticity contribute to the pathogeneses of human brain disorders. Hence, deciphering the molecules that drive spine remodeling during synaptic plasticity is critical for understanding the neuronal basis of physiological and pathological brain function. Since actin filaments (F-actin) define dendritic spine morphology, actin-binding proteins (ABP) that accelerate dis-/assembly of F-actin moved into the focus as critical regulators of synaptic plasticity. We recently identified cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) as a novel actin regulator in neurons that cooperates with cofilin1, an ABP relevant for synaptic plasticity. We therefore hypothesized a crucial role for CAP1 in structural synaptic plasticity. By exploiting mouse hippocampal neurons, we tested this hypothesis in the present study. We found that induction of both forms of synaptic plasticity oppositely altered concentration of exogenous, myc-tagged CAP1 in dendritic spines, with chemical LTP (cLTP) decreasing and chemical LTD (cLTD) increasing it. cLTP induced spine enlargement in CAP1-deficient neurons. However, it did not increase the density of large spines, different from control neurons. cLTD induced spine retraction and spine size reduction in control neurons, but not in CAP1-KO neurons. Together, we report that postsynaptic myc-CAP1 concentration oppositely changed during cLTP and cTLD and that CAP1 inactivation modestly affected structural plasticity.

AB  - Although there is growing concern about ingestion of microplastics by marine organisms, little research has been conducted on marine herbivores. This is the first study to document microplastic ingestion within the family Sirenia. Subsamples were collected from five locations in the gastrointestinal tracts (GI) of 26 dead manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) from Tampa Bay, Florida. During gross necropsies, macroplastic pieces were found in seven individuals (26.9%). Careful visual examination of the subsampled portions of the GI contents indicated that 19 individuals (73.1%) contained plastic particles. As five individuals had both macro and microplastic pieces, the overall frequency of occurrence of plastic ingestion was 76.9%. Due to the large volume of cellulose-rich ingested material, it was not feasible to analyze the entire gut contents, nor was it feasible to conduct chemical or enzymatic digestion; therefore, it is very likely that many microplastic pieces were not detected. Despite these technical challenges, it is clear that manatees in Tampa Bay are routinely consuming microplastics in addition to larger plastic pieces. Currently, nothing is known about the physiological effects of microplastic ingestion in sirenians, however environmental plastics could be concentrated by manatees through ingestion and the subsequent production of microplastics-laden feces.

AB  - BACKGROUND Calcium (Ca2+)-binding proteins in the saliva of herbivorous insects function as effectors to attenuate host plant defenses and thus improve insect feeding performance. Silencing these genes via transgenic plant-mediated RNAi is thus a promising pest control strategy. However, their sequences and functions in the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus (SBPH) remain to be investigated.
   RESULTS We identified a putative EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein (LsECP1) in SBPH watery saliva. LsECP1 was expressed extremely high in the salivary glands but at a low level during the egg stage. Transient LsECP1 expression in rice cells indicated its cytoplasm and nucleus localization. The bacterially expressed recombinant LsECP1 protein exhibited Ca2+-binding activity. Rice plants fed by SBPH nymphs with knocked down LsECP1 exhibited higher levels of cytosolic Ca2+, jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consistently, application of heterogeneously expressed LsECP1 protein suppressed wound-induced JA, JA-Ile and H2O2 accumulation in rice. Thus, LsECP1 knockdown by dsRNA injection resulted in reduced feeding, fecundity and survival rates of SBPH reared on rice plants. Transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing LsECP1 dsRNA were produced, and plant-mediated LsECP1 knockdown enhanced rice resistance to SBPH.
   CONCLUSION SBPH LsECP1 acts as an effector to impair host rice defense responses and promotes SBPH performance. This discovery provides a potential gene target for plant-mediated RNAi-based pest management.

AB  - Nanoplastics, an emerging contaminant, pose risks to fetal neural development, transferring from mother to offspring via placenta and breast milk. Assessing these risks, hippocampal CA3 samples from nanopolystyrene-exposed rat offspring were proteomically analyzed. Findings revealed reduced expression of neural developmental proteins (KIF21A, STMN2, DMTN, DLG1) and increased inhibitory proteins (PZP, alpha-2M, FN1, SERPINA1, ALOX15) in the hippocampus. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis highlighted ferroptosis enrichment, validated by significantly expressed ALOX15 and TF proteins. These alterations suggest nanopolystyrene's potential contribution to cognitive deficits and neurodevelopmental disorders, emphasizing its hazardous impact on neural development. This study provides novel insights into nanopolystyrene's risks.

AB  - Melamine (MEL) and cyanuric acid (CA) alone have relatively low toxicity, but together they may cause serious damage to multiple organs, including the central nervous system, however, the underlying mechanism is un-known. This study aimed to determine and compare the neurotoxic effects of MEL (20 mu g/mL), CA (20 mu g/mL) and their combination (10 mu g/mL MEL and 10 mu g/mL CA) on cultured hippocampal neurons. The cell viability, apoptosis, anti-oxidative and energy metabolic indices were detected following 24 h of incubations. The mini-ature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and syn-aptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 neurons were recorded. Moreover, ROS scavenger NAC was co-infused to investigate the potential mechanism. We found the complex of MEL and CA but not their alone caused severe cell death and disturbed energy production through activation caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, the com-bination significantly reduced the amplitude, decay time and frequency of mEPSCs but not mIPSCs, indicating the pre-and post-synaptic inhibitory actions on neuronal activity. Paired-pulsed ratio (PPR) and long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses were critically depressed. However, the co -application of NAC could effectively mitigate the cellular apoptosis, energy metabolism dysfunction and the impairments in neuronal and synaptic function. Our findings provide the first evidence that the combination of MEL and CA can exert more prominently neurotoxic effects than their alone and certify that one of the potential mechanisms for neuronal and synaptic dysfunction is the ROS-mediated signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe irregular acyclic homoterpenes 4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT) are key volatile compounds involved in various chemical ecological interactions, particularly contributing to plant defense against phytophagous insects. However, the genomic basis and evolutionary history of homoterpene biosynthesis in legumes remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their functional diversification and ecological roles.RESULTSUsing a yeast expression system, we identified two novel, tandemly duplicated cytochrome P450 genes, PlCYP82D47-like and PlCYP82D47, involved in DMNT and TMTT biosynthesis in lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus). PlCYP82D47-like catalyzes the conversion of (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-geranyllinalool to DMNT and TMTT, respectively, while PlCYP82D47 specifically converts (E)-nerolidol to DMNT. Evolutionary analysis revealed syntenic tandem duplicates of these genes in lima bean, cotton, and Arabidopsis, suggesting a conserved genomic architecture for DMNT/TMTT biosynthesis among dicotyledonous plants and implying potential gene loss events in this genomic region. Computational modeling identified residues L324 and L505 as critical for substrate recognition by PlCYP82D47. Site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro enzymatic assays confirmed that substitutions at these residues significantly reduced catalytic activity.CONCLUSIONOur findings provide new insights into the enzymatic and evolutionary basis of homoterpene biosynthesis in legumes and offer promising targets for future metabolic engineering applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Oriental tobacco budworm, Helicoverpa assulta, a specialist herbivorous insect that exclusively feeds on plants of the Solanaceae family, causes considerable damage to crops, such as tobacco and hot pepper. The absence of a genome sequence for this species hinders further research on its pest management and ecological adaptation. RESULTS: Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-level genome of a Korean strain of H. assulta (Pyeongchang strain, K18). The total assembly spans 424.4 Mb with an N50 length of 14.54 Mb and 37% GC content. The assembled genome (ASM2961881v1) comprises 31 chromosomes, similar to other congeneric generalist species including H. armigera and H. zea. In terms of genomic assembly quality, the complete BUSCOs and repeat content accounted for 98.3% and 33.01% of the genome, respectively. Based on this assembly, 19 485 protein-coding genes were predicted in the genome annotation. A comparative analysis was conducted using the identified number of protein-coding genes in H. armigera (24154) and H. zea (23696). Out of the 19 485 predicted genes, 137 genes in 15 orthogroups were found to have expanded significantly in H. assulta, while 149 genes in 95 orthogroups contracted rapidly. CONCLUSION: This study revealed specific gene expansions and contractions in H. assulta compared to those in its close relatives, indicating potential adaptations related to its specialized feeding habits. Also, the comparative genome analysis provides valuable insights for the integrated pest management of H. assulta and other globally significant pests in the Heliothinae subfamily.

AB  - More and more evidence shows that the pathological mechanism of vascular dementia (VD) is closely related to oxidative stress injury, cell apoptosis, autophagy, inflammatory response, excitatory amino acid toxicity, synaptic plasticity change, calcium overload, and other processes. Edaravone dexborneol (EDB) is a new type of neuroprotective agent that can improve the neurological damage caused by an ischemic stroke. Previous studies showed that EDB has effects on synergistic antioxidants and induces anti-apoptotic responses. However, it remains unclear whether EDB can affect apoptosis and autophagy by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and its impact on the neuroglial cells. In this study, we established the VD model of rats by bilateral carotid artery occlusion to explore the neuroprotective effect of EDB and its mechanism. Morris Water Maze test was applied to assess the cognitive function of rats. H & E and TUNEL staining were applied to observe the cellular structure of the hippocampus. Immunofluorescence labeling was used to observe the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia. ELISA was applied to examine the levels of TNF-& alpha;, IL-1 & beta; and IL-6, and RT-PCR was applied to examine their mRNA expression levels. Western blotting was applied to examine apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3), autophagy-related proteins (Beclin-1, P62, LC3B), PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway proteins and their phosphorylation levels. The results indicated that EDB ameliorates learning and memory in rats subjected to the VD model, alleviates neuroinflammatory response by reducing the proliferation of the neuroglial cell and inhibits apoptosis and autophagy, which may be mediated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have shown that environmental insults and maternal stress during pregnancy increase the risk of several psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Converging lines of evidence from humans, as well as from rodent models, suggest that prenatal stress (PNS) interferes with fetal development, ultimately determining changes in brain maturation and function that may lead to the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. From a molecular standpoint, transcriptional alterations are thought to play a major role in this context and may contribute to the behavioral phenotype by shifting the expression of genes related to excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) transmission balance. Nevertheless, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the enhanced vulnerability to psychopathology following PNS exposure are not well understood. In the present study, we used a model of maternal stress in rats to investigate the distal effects of PNS on the expression of genes related to glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmissions. We inspected two critical brain regions involved in emotion regulation, namely, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala (AMY), which we show to relate with the mild behavioral effects detected in adult rat offspring. We observed that PNS exposure promotes E/I imbalance in the PFC of adult males only, by dysregulating the expression of glutamatergic-related genes. Moreover, such an effect is accompanied by increased expression of the activity-dependent synaptic modulator gene Npas4 specifically in the PFC parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons, suggesting an altered regulation of synapse formation promoting higher PV-dependent inhibitory transmission and increased overall circuit inhibition in the PFC of males. In the AMY, PNS more evidently affects the transcription of GABAergic-related genes, shifting the balance toward inhibition. Collectively, our findings suggest that the E/I dysregulation of the PFC-to-AMY transmission may be a long-term signature of PNS and may contribute to increase the risk for mood disorder upon further stress.

AB  - Early indicator traits for swine reproduction and longevity support economical selection decision-making. Activity is a key variable impacting a sow's herd life and productivity. Early-life activities could contribute to farrowing traits including gestation length (GL), number born alive (NBA), and number weaned (NW). Beginning at 20 weeks of age, 480 gilts were video recorded for 7 consecutive days and processed using the NUtrack system. Activity traits included angle rotated (radians), average speed (m/s), distance traveled (m), time spent eating (s), lying lateral (s), lying sternal (s), standing (s), and sitting (s). Final daily activity values were averaged across the period under cameras. Parity one data were collected for all gilts considered. Data were analyzed using linear regression models (R version 4.0.2). GL was significantly impacted by angle rotated (p = 0.03), average speed (p = 0.07), distance traveled (p = 0.05), time spent lying lateral (p = 0.003), and lying sternal (0.02). NBA was significantly impacted by time spent lying lateral (p = 0.01), lying sternal (p = 0.07), and time spent sitting (p = 0.08). NW was significantly impacted by time spent eating (p = 0.09), time spent lying lateral (p = 0.04), and time spent sitting (p = 0.007). This analysis suggests early-life gilt activities are associated with sow productivity traits of importance. Further examination of the link between behaviors compiled utilizing NUtrack and reproductive traits is necessitated to further isolate behavioral differences for potential use in selection decisions.

AB  - A substantial body of research suggests that early-life stress (ELS) is associated with neuropathology in adulthood. Maternal deprivation (MD) is a commonly utilised model in mice for the study of specific neurological diseases. The appropriate growth of dendrites is essential for the optimal functioning of the nervous system. However, the impact of ELS on interneuron dendritic morphology remains unclear. To ascertain whether ELS induces alterations in the morphology of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in layers II/III of the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), the somatosensory cortex (SSC), the motor cortex (MC), and the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Hp), 9-day-old male GAD-67-EGFP transgenic mice were subjected to a 24 h MD. At postnatal day 60 (P60), the animals were sacrificed, and their brains were subjected to morphological analyses. The results indicated that MD affected the dendritic morphology of GABAergic interneurons. The mean dendritic length and mean dendritic segments of the examined cortical areas, except for the MC, were significantly decreased, whereas the number of primary dendrites was unaffected. Furthermore, the density of GAD67-EGFP-positive interneurons was decreased in the mEC and Hp, but not in the somatosensory and MC. The induction of ELS through MD in a developmental time window when significant morphological changes occur rendered the developing cells particularly susceptible to stress, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of surviving interneurons at the adult stage.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) has long proven to be a complex neurodegenerative disorder, with cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation being just a few of its pathological features. The complexity of the disease requires a multitargeted treatment covering its many aspects. In the present investigation, an arylhydrazone derivative of 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (5MeO), with in vitro strong antioxidant, neuroprotective and monoamine oxidase B-inhibiting effects, was studied in a scopolamine-induced Alzheimer-type dementia in rats. Using behavioral and biochemical methods, we evaluated the effects of 5MeO on learning and memory, and elucidated the mechanisms of these effects. Our experiments demonstrated that 5MeO had a beneficial effect on different types of memory as assessed by the step-through and the Barnes maze tasks. It efficiently restored the decreased by scopolamine brain-derived neurotrophic factor and acetylcholine levels and normalized the increased by scopolamine acetylcholine esterase activity in hippocampus. Most effective 5MeO was in counteracting the induced by scopolamine oxidative stress by decreasing the increased by scopolamine levels of lipid peroxidation and by increasing the reduced by scopolamine catalase activity. Blood biochemical analyses demonstrated a favorable safety profile of 5MeO, prompting further pharmacological studies suggesting 5MeO as a safe and efficient candidate in a multitargeted treatment of AD.

AB  - Eornithoica grimaldii gen. et sp. nov., the currently earliest Pupipara, is described from the lower Eocene of the Green River Formation. The previously oldest representative of this clade was from the Oligocene. The new fossil has some plesiomorphic character states, suggesting a 'basal' position in the clade. Its age, around 52 Ma, suggests that these epizooic ectoparasitic flies originated during the Paleocene or even the latest Cretaceous, prior to the first bats, if the latter. As is the case for several early diverging hippoboscids that feed on birds, E. grimaldii possibly victimized birds or terrestrial mammals. This study is a further example of the quantity of new information that can be obtained by the examination of fossil insects under UV light.

AB  - Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a mycotoxin that poses a great threat to agricultural production and the health of humans and animals. Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural plant polyphenolic compound with good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cell regeneration effects, yet its effectiveness in treating FB1-induced cytotoxicity remains to be explored. In this study, we used porcine alveolar macrophages (3D4/21) as a model to characterize the cytotoxicity induced by FB1, and to investigate the potential alleviating effect of PTE on FB1-induced cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that FB1 induces cytotoxicity, apoptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and mitochondrial damage, which can be largely recovered by PTE treatment, suggesting the promising application of PTE to treat FB1-induced damage. Mechanistically, FB1 activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, while PTE attenuates FB1-induced cytotoxicity through the inhibition of key JAK/STAT genes such as JAK2 and STAT3. Overall, our study characterized the molecular mechanism for FB1-induced cytotoxicity and found PTE to be a promising component which can alleviate FB1-induced cytotoxicity by interfering in the activation of JAK/STAT pathway.

AB  - Synaptic vesicle (SV) docking is a dynamic multi-stage process that is required for efficient neurotransmitter release in response to nerve impulses. Although the steady-state SV docking likely involves the cooperation of Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), where and how the docking process initiates remains unknown. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) can interact with Syt1 and SNAREs to contribute to vesicle exocytosis. In the present study, using the CRISPRi-mediated multiplex gene knockdown and 3D electron tomography approaches, we show that in mouse hippocampal synapses, SV docking initiates at similar to 12 nm to the active zone (AZ) by Syt1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 is the membrane partner of Syt1 to initiate SV docking, and disrupting their interaction could abolish the docking initiation. In contrast, the SNARE complex contributes only to the tight SV docking within 0-2 nm. Therefore, Syt1 interacts with PI(4,5)P2 to loosely dock SVs within 2-12 nm to the AZ in hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Intestinal inflammation in piglets leads to diarrhea, decreased immune function, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Probiotics are widely recognized and used in the prevention and control of enteritis in piglets. Parabacteroides goldsteinii (PG) is a probiotic, and there are few reports on the anti-inflammatory properties of this in piglets. Therefore, this study selected 10 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) piglets aged 50 days and randomly divided them into a control group (CT group) and an experimental group (PG group) for a 14-day experiment. During days 1-7, the PG group established an inflammation model by gavage with 4% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The results showed that DSS increased the content of IL-6 and IL-8 (p < 0.05), while it decreased the content of IL-10 in the serum (p < 0.05), For days 8-14, the DSS-treated piglets were administered a 7.9 x 10(8) CFU/mL PG suspension via gavage. The content of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in the piglets did not differ between the CT and PG groups (p > 0.05). Some beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillales and Butyricimonas, were significantly enriched in the PG group (p < 0.05). The PG group showed lower alpha diversity (p < 0.05), and the metabolic pathways exhibited the highest abundance in the KEGG functional prediction analysis. The above studies confirm that PG alleviates intestinal inflammation and changes the gut microbial composition.

AB  - The typical pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain and reactivity of glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia. Clinically, the development of AD and obesity are known to be correlated. In this study, we analyzed the changes in AD pathological characteristics in 5XFAD mice after obesity induction through a high-fat diet (HFD). Surprisingly, high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein AI (APOA-I) serum levels were increased without low-density lipoprotein alteration in both HFD groups. The reactivity of astrocytes and microglia in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and fornix of the hypothalamus in 5XFAD mice was decreased in the transgenic (TG)-HFD high group. Finally, the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus was also significantly decreased in the TG-HFD high group. These results suggest that increased high-density lipoprotein level, especially with increased APOA-I serum level, alleviates the pathological features of AD and could be a new potential therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the amount of fat content in milk extender and comparison with other semen extender and evaluate their effect on ram sperm motility and kinematic parameters during the liquid storage of 5 degrees C for an evaluation period of 72 hours. The semen samples were collected from three & Scaron;umava sheep rams (4 years old) using an artificial vagina and were diluted by physiological solution, 0.5% fat milk, 1.5% fat milk and AndroMed (R) extenders with a dilution 1:100. Motility and kinematic parameters were evaluated using the CASA (Computer-assisted sperm analysis) at regular time intervals of 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after sperm collection. The effect of extenders on motility and kinematic parameters varied significantly among each other. The temporal decrease rate in sperm quality differed between extenders. Physiological solution can be used on the farm for insemination within 24 hours of collection when the sperm quality is still very good. Milk diluent with 0.5% fat has better sperm motility parameters than milk diluent with 1.5% fat, but of all the extenders tested, the milk extenders had the worst quality. The best diluent tested was AndroMed (R), which showed good values of motility parameters even after 72 hours of storage at 5 degrees C.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) describes a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by deficits in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Aripiprazole (APZ) is an atypical antipsychotic that can safeguard mice against autism-like behavior induced by valproic acid (VPA). In the present study, we examined the effects of maternal treatment with APZ (10mg/kg) in juvenile mice prenatally exposed to VPA on neurodevelopmental behaviors, social interactions, communication, and working memory, as well as synaptophysin (SYP), synaptosomal-associated protein, 25kDa (SNAP-25) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and cell viability in the hippocampus. In addition, to evaluate possible APZ interference with the anticonvulsant properties of VPA on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures were evaluated. Maternal treatment with APZ significantly prevented body weight loss, self-righting, eye-opening, social interactions, social communication, and working memory deficits in mice prenatally exposed to VPA. Additionally, the decrease in the SYP, SNAP-25, and MAP-2 expressions in the mPFC and cell death in the hippocampus was prevented by APZ. Furthermore, APZ (10mg/kg) did not interfere with the anticonvulsant effect of VPA (15mg/kg) in animals with PTZ-induced seizures. These findings indicate that maternal treatment with APZ in pregnant mice exposed to VPA protects animals against the ASD-like behavioral phenotype, and this effect may be related, at least in part, to synaptic plasticity and neuronal protection in the PFC and hippocampus. APZ may serve as an effective pharmacological therapeutic target against autistic behaviors in the VPA animal model of ASD, which should be further investigated to verify its clinical relevance.

AB  - Scabies and hair lice are parasitic diseases that affect human skin and hair, respectively. The incidence and resistances of these infections are increasing. Tenutex (R) (disulfiram and benzyl benzoate emulsion) is an alternative to standard insecticides to avoid resistances. The aim of the work is to evaluate the transdermal absorption and the in vitro efficacy against scabies and hair lice after different exposition times. Dermatomed human skin was used to assess the dermal absorption using a validated High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. HEK001 keratinocytes were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of benzyl benzoate. Only benzyl benzoate was able to cross the skin, but it did not show cytotoxicity at any of the tested concentrations. The product efficacy was tested on Psoroptes ovis after direct contact and after administration on sheep skin explants at different contact times. Permethrin/malathion-resistant strains of Pediculus humanis capitis adults and eggs were directly exposed to Tenutex, and the vitality and hatchability, respectively, were evaluated. The anti-scabies study demonstrated that exposure for 6 or 24 h completely eradicated the parasite. The pediculicidal activity of Tenutex exhibited superior efficacy than standard treatment on resistant lice. The positive results obtained suggest that Tenutex (R) is a good treatment option, especially in drug resistance situations.

The pollen beetle (Brassicogethes aeneus) is a major pest of oilseed rape for which no resistant cultivar is available to date, but previous studies have highlighted the potential of white mustard as a source of resistance and introgression of this resistance appears to be a promising strategy. Here we present a phenotyping protocol allowing mid-throughput (i.e., increased throughput compared to current methods) acquisition of resistance data, which could then be used for genetic mapping of QTLs. RESULTS Contrasted white mustard genotypes were selected from an initial field screening and then evaluated for their resistance under controlled conditions using a standard phenotyping method on entire plants. We then upgraded this protocol for mid-throughput phenotyping, by testing two alternative methods. We found that phenotyping on detached buds did not provide the same resistance contrasts as observed with the standard protocol, in contrast to the phenotyping protocol with miniaturized plants. This protocol was then tested on a large panel composed of hundreds of plants. A significant variation in resistance among genotypes was observed, which validates the large-scale application of this new phenotyping protocol. CONCLUSION The combination of this mid-throughput phenotyping protocol and white mustard as a source of resistance against the pollen beetle offers a promising avenue for breeding programs aiming to improve oilseed rape resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND Although parasitoids can precisely locate hidden gall-inducing insects, the host location mechanism is unknown. In this study, our aim was to clarify the olfactory responses of the parasitoid Quadrastichus mendeli to eucalyptus volatiles induced by the gall wasp Leptocybe invasa. RESULTS Q. mendeli preferred volatiles from gall-damaged plants compared with those produced by mechanically damaged and undamaged plants. Coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection results demonstrated that 3-carene, decanal, d-limonene, ethanone,1-(4-ethylphenyl)-, p-cymene and benzene,1-methyl-4-(1-methylpropyl)- from DH 201-2 (Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus tereticornis) elicited significant antennal responses in Q. mendeli in all treatments. Q. mendeli was repelled by decanal and d-limonene and was attracted to 3-carene, benzene,1-methyl-4-(1-methylpropyl)-, ethanone,1-(4-ethylphenyl) and p-cymene. Quaternary blends containing 3-carene, p-cymene, benzene,1-methyl-4-(1-methylpropyl)- and ethanone,1-(4-ethylphenyl)- at a ratio of 1:1:1:1 were attractive to Q. mendeli. However, quaternary blends with added decanal and d-limonene alone or both together induced significant repellence in Q. mendeli. CONCLUSION Our report is the first to demonstrate that volatiles produced by galls induced by L. invasa are attractive to Q. mendeli, which suggests that this parasitoid could utilize herbivore-induced plant volatiles to locate its host. The results are beneficial for understanding the function of plant volatiles in host searching by parasitoids of gall-forming insect pests.

AB  - Simple Summary Cheeses obtained from grazing animals are considered by attentive consumers to be qualitatively better for various reasons linked to ethical, environmental and health aspects. It is known that these cheeses have a chemical composition, especially in terms of fatty acid profile, which makes them more beneficial for human health, preventing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. On the other hand, the quantitative and qualitative productivity of the pastures is inconstant during the different seasons of the year; therefore, in extensive livestock farms there is the need to integrate the diet of lactating cows with feed integrations in some periods. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the quality of an artisanal cheese produced in extensive farms (11) in the different seasons of the year (summer, autumn-winter, and spring), with particular reference to those fatty acids that have relevance in determining positive effects on human health. The aim of this work was to evaluate, in the different production seasons of the year, the physico-chemical quality of an artisanal cheese traditionally obtained from autochthonous grazing cows, with particular reference to fatty acids (FA) of nutritional interest that play an important role in the risk or prevention of some human pathologies. For this purpose, cheeses were sampled in 11 farms, repeating the samplings in 3 different periods of the year (summer, autumn-winter, and spring) when the productive conditions of the pastures varied. The cheeses produced in the spring period, when cows ingest a greater amount of grazed forage, resulted in a more adequate composition of the main FA, which are recognized as having a health effect, such as alpha-linolenic, trans-vaccenic, rumenic, docosapentaenoic (DPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Branched-chain FA were found in greater quantities in spring cheeses, as well as in summer ones. The FA composition of cheeses produced in the different seasons was reflected in some nutritional indexes that also resulted as more suitable in cheeses obtained in the spring period. The positive effects induced on the FA profile of cheeses are presumably linked to the diet of autochthonous cows, which is mainly based on forage from natural pastures. Therefore, the results obtained confirm the benefits of grazing, which is able to guarantee the production of healthier cheeses for consumers.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are critical symptoms of Lewy Body dementias (LBD). Specifically, alpha-synuclein (alpha Syn) accumulation in the hippocampus leading to synaptic dysfunction is linked to cognitive deficits in LBD. Here, we investigated the pathological impact of alpha Syn on hippocampal neurons. We report that either alpha Syn overexpression or alpha Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) treatment triggers the formation of cofilin-actin rods, synapse disruptors, in cultured hippocampal neurons and in the hippocampus of synucleinopathy mouse models and of LBD patients. In vivo, cofilin pathology is present concomitantly with synaptic impairment and cognitive dysfunction. Rods generation prompted by alpha Syn involves the co-action of the cellular prion protein (PrP (c)) and the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). Importantly, we show that CCR5 inhibition, with a clinically relevant peptide antagonist, reverts dendritic spine impairment promoted by alpha Syn. Collectively, we detail the cellular and molecular mechanism through which alpha Syn disrupts hippocampal synaptic structure and we identify CCR5 as a novel therapeutic target to prevent synaptic impairment and cognitive dysfunction in LBD.

AB  - Objective: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy caused by autoimmune limbic encephalitis (AI-TLE) clinically resemble patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with non-autoimmune etiologies (NAI-TLE) but have a different prognosis and require specific adjusted therapies. The objective of this study was to investigate whether patients with these forms of TLE can be discerned by means of neuropsychological assessment. Methods: Data from 103 patients with TLE (n = 39 with AI-TLE and n = 64 with NAI-TLE, including n = 39 with hippocampal sclerosis [HS] and n = 25 with low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors [LEAT]) and 25 healthy controls who underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were analyzed retrospectively. The neuropsychological characteristics (mean z-scores) were compared between groups using one-way ANOVA, independent-samples t-tests, and discriminant function analysis (DFA). Results: The groups of patients with TLE showed significantly lower performance in attentional, visuospatial, verbal memory, and nonverbal memory functions compared to the healthy controls. Solely in the domain of executive functions, patients with AI-TLE showed significantly lower performance compared to patients with NAI-TLE regarding cognitive flexibility (p = 0.002) and verbal fluency (p = 0.018). Moreover, the DFA identified cognitive flexibility to be most appropriate to differentiate between patients with AI-TLE and patients with HS. Group membership was correctly predicted through neuropsychological assessment alone in 66.7% of the patients using cross-validation. Significance: We were able to identify specific neuropsychological features in our sample of patients with AI-TLE. While all groups of patients with TLE showed the expected TLE-typical memory impairments, significant differences between patients with AI-TLE and NAI-TLE were present only in the cognitive domain of executive functions. This finding facilitates the choice of suitable psychometric tests in clinical routine and, thus, the clinical differential diagnosis between these entities. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aluminum and steel represent the two most dominant metals in light-duty vehicles, yet the flows of these materials into the American automotive industry have not been well characterized. This study proposes and implements a method for analyzing the flow of these metals into the automotive industry. We create a framework for performing regionally linked, sector-specific material flow analyses and use this framework to trace flows of aluminum and steel entering the American automotive industry, focusing on flows downstream from raw material production. We show that automotive aluminum sheet and extrusions are sourced primarily from the NPCC (23%), SERC (20%), MRO (18%), and RFC (13%) North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) regions, and a spatially unresolved local region within the United States and Canada (18%). We determine that primary aluminum is largely from Canada (70%), nearly all from Quebec (69%). Further upstream, alumina and bauxite originate mostly from Brazil, Australia, and Jamaica. We also show that finished automotive steel is sourced primarily from the RFC (63%) and SERC (20%) regions. The crude steel supply similarly originates mainly from the RFC (69%) and SERC (7%) regions. Upstream raw materials including coke, coking coal, iron ore, lime, and steel scrap are primarily sourced from the United States with only direct reduced iron and pig iron used in electric arc furnace steel production coming mostly from outside the United States. The framework developed here allows for increased spatial resolution of material flows, which can be used to develop more specific life cycle impact factors for life cycle assessments.

AB  - Ruminant conceptuses that elongate and attach to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) to establish pregnancy require a large amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The creatine (Cr)-creatine kinase (CK)-phosphocreatine (PCr) system re-generates ATP in dividing and migrating cells such as the conceptus trophectoderm cells. However, little is known about metabolism of Cr within uterine and conceptus tissues in livestock species during early gestation. In this study, Suffolk ewes were ovariohysterectomized on Days 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, or 21 of pregnancy (n = 2-5 animals/per day) to investigate metabolites, mRNAs, and proteins of the Cr-CK-PCr system at uterine-conceptus interface. Amounts of Cr and guanidinoacetate (GA) in uterine flushings increased between Days 12 and 17 of pregnancy. Endometrial expression of mRNAs for GA formation (AGAT), Cr synthesis (GAMT), and Cr/PCr utilization (CKB) was greater on Days 17 and 21 than on Days 9 and 12 of pregnancy. Immunoreactive AGAT was detected in uteri only on Day 21 but not in uteri or conceptuses at earlier days of pregnancy. GAMT, SLC6A8, and CKs were expressed in uterine luminal and glandular epithelia. Immunoreactive CKs (CKB, CKM, and CKMT1) appeared greater on Day 9 than Day 17 of pregnancy. Immunoreactive GAMT and CKs appeared greater in trophectoderm of conceptuses on Day 20 than on Day 15 of pregnancy, whereas the opposite was observed for that of SLC6A8. This study provides insights into cell-, tissue-, and time-specific metabolism of Cr at the uterine-conceptus interface suggesting a role for the Cr-CK-PCr system in ovine conceptus development and implantation.

AB  - This study addresses the multifaceted challenges stemming from the excessive application of manure or digestate, with the aim of mitigating problems of storage, emissions, contamination and transportation. It presents a unique-protocol for efficiently recovering nutrients in the form of struvite, a pure, easy-to-use magnesium ammonium phosphate compound. The objective is to explore struvite production via mono-digestion of poultry manure and co-digestion of various organic wastes, including poultry, dairy, pig manures, and wasted corn silage. Crystals are synthesized under optimized conditions: magnesium/phosphorus ratio of 1.5, pH 9, and mixing at 240 rpm. The process achieves >= 95 % TAN-recovery in moisture-free form for various digestates, with a significant 61.5 % reduction in volatile-fatty-acids. Approximately 0.33-1 g struvite is produced per 10 mL digestate. The study suggests using disodium or monopotassium phosphate for practical implementation, demonstrating the versatility of digestates. Integrating this method into anaerobic digestion promotes the circular-economy and sustainable management of waste nutrients.

AB  - Maintaining glutamate homeostasis after hypoxic ischemia is important for synaptic function and neural cell activity, and regulation of glutamate transport between astrocyte and neuron is one of the important modalities for reducing glutamate accumulation. However, further research is needed to investigate the dynamic changes in and molecular mechanisms of glutamate transport and the effects of glutamate transport on synapses. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying Notch pathway mediation of glutamate transport and synaptic plasticity. In this study, Yorkshire neonatal pigs (male, age 3 days, weight 1.0-1.5 kg, n = 48) were randomly divided into control (sham surgery group) and five hypoxic ischemia subgroups, according to different recovery time, which were then further subdivided into subgroups treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or a Notch pathway inhibitor (N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester). Once the model was established, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot analyses of Notch pathway-related proteins, synaptophysin, and glutamate transporter were performed. Moreover, synapse microstructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. At the early stage (6-12 hours after hypoxic ischemia) of hypoxic ischemic injury, expression of glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter-2 and synaptophysin was downregulated, the number of synaptic vesicles was reduced, and synaptic swelling was observed; at 12-24 hours after hypoxic ischemia, the Notch pathway was activated, excitatory amino acid transporter-2 and synaptophysin expression was increased, and the number of synaptic vesicles was slightly increased. Excitatory amino acid transporter-2 and synaptophysin expression decreased after treatment with the Notch pathway inhibitor. This suggests that glutamate transport in astrocytes-neurons after hypoxic ischemic injury is regulated by the Notch pathway and affects vesicle release and synaptic plasticity through the expression of synaptophysin.

AB  - This study investigated whether organic acid (OA)-preserved grain could mitigate the negative effects of low crude protein (CP) diets on growth performance, intestinal health, and the coefficient of total tract digestibility (CATTD) of nutrients in weaned piglets. The grain was either conventionally dried or preserved post-harvest with 4 kg of OA per tonne. Ninety-six piglets (28 days old) were assigned to one of four diets in a 2 x 2 factorial design: (1) dried standard CP diet, (2) OA-preserved standard CP diet, (3) dried low CP diet, and (4) OA-preserved low CP diet. Standard and low CP diets contained 20% and 19% CP during the first 15 days, reduced to 19% and 17% CP from days 15-35 post-weaning. Faecal scores (FS) were assessed twice a day while microbial composition, inflammatory markers, colonic volatile fatty acid concentrations, and intestinal morphology were measured on the 8th day post-weaning. Performance metrics were measured over the 35-day experimental period. Low CP diets consistently reduced FS (p < 0.05) and increased colonic molar butyrate proportions (p < 0.01) but increased duodenal IL1B expression compared to standard CP diets (p < 0.05). The OA-preserved grain enhanced beneficial microbial populations (Lactobacillus, Roseburia) while lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A, IL17) (p < 0.05). While dried grain with low CP diets reduced average daily gain (ADG), colonic short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations, and nitrogen digestibility, OA-preserved grain with low CP maintained these parameters and improved final body weight (p < 0.05). Overall, OA-preserved grain mitigated the performance decline associated with low CP diets by enhancing gut health and nutrient digestibility and reducing inflammation, thus presenting a promising alternative nutritional strategy for post-weaned piglets.

AB  - The brain continuously monitors the environment, comparing predictions based on memories of past regularities and action plans with current sensory information. The subiculum and the anteroventral thalamus have been proposed to play critical roles in this Generator of Predictions System (GPS). This study evaluated the hypothesis that cytochrome C oxidase (COX) expression changes in the subiculum and anterior thalamic nuclei of subjects exposed to training and testing in an extrapolation of serial stimulus pattern task that stimulates the generation of predictions. Shortly, male Wistar rats were trained to run through a straight alleyway to receive variable amounts of sunflower seeds. In each session (one session per day), the animals ran 4 successive trials, receiving different amounts of sunflower seeds in each trial. Subjects exposed to the monotonic pattern (M) received 14, 7, 3, and 1 sunflower seeds. Subjects exposed to the non-monotonic pattern (NM) received 14, 3, 7, and 1 sunflower seeds. The animals were trained for 20 sessions. In the 21st session, a fifth trial, never experienced before by the subjects, was added immediately after the fourth trial. An additional control group was not exposed to training in the task, allowing evaluation of COX expression in untrained subjects. Data revealed increased COX activity in the anteroventral thalamus, and in the ventral subiculum, all related to training in the NM, but not M, schedule of reward. Data also revealed reduced COX activity in the dorsal portion of the subiculum, restricted to subjects trained with the NM serial pattern. These figures suggest that the anteroventral thalamus and the ventral and dorsal subiculum are engaged in the acquisition of extrapolation of serial stimulus pattern tasks, thus opening novel avenues to studying neural brain circuits involved in generating predictions. One possibility, for instance, would be to evaluate the time course of these COX activations in association with training in the M and NM serial patterns.

AB  - When biomedical research investigates the human surgical situation in the need of a chronic course, it is more often possible to do so using large animal models. The use of farm animals always poses special challenges for the institution conducting the research in terms of infection prevention and occupational safety. Especially for the zoonotic disease coxiellosis it is important to be aware of the constant risk of pathogen introduction by small ruminants and to take appropriate precautions. In this way, personal injury should be avoided or at least be kept to a minimum in the event of infection since then sustainable zoonosis control can be immediately initiated. Using the example of a Q fever outbreak at a research facility, we want to share with this extended case report the importance of central emergency structures, provisions and the inclusion of relevant experts and disciplines in a crisis team. Its primary purpose is to support the affected facility and coordinate the implementation of necessary cleaning, disinfection and decontamination measures in close contact with the responsible local authorities. The aim is to inactivate the pathogen in a systematic and controlled manner in few steps of action only and to keep the interruption of the facility's operations as short as possible.

Nur so k & ouml;nnen Personensch & auml;den im Falle einer Infektion vermieden oder zumindest so gering wie m & ouml;glich gehalten werden, da dann sofort eine nachhaltige Zoonosenbek & auml;mpfung eingeleitet werden kann. Am Beispiel eines Q-Fieber-Ausbruchs in einer Forschungseinrichtung wollen wir mit diesem eingehenden Fallbericht die Bedeutung zentraler Notfallstrukturen, Vorkehrungen und die Einbeziehung einschl & auml;giger Experten und Disziplinen in einen Krisenstab aufzeigen.

AB  - Prosantorhinus is a genus of small extinct teleoceratine rhinoceroses with shortened limb bones, widely distributed in Europe. However, the Asian evolution of the teleoceratine Prosantorhinus has remained unclear because of a scarcity of fossil records of the genus. Here, we report the first record of Prosantorhinus in East Asia from the Middle Miocene of Tongxin, Ningxia. The new specimen is characterized by a concave dorsal skull profile and elevated nasals; short and stout nasal bones with drooping margins on both sides; the thickened, enlarged, and roughened nasal extremity supporting a small horn; the semi-molarized upper premolars with a lingual bridge between the protocone and hypocone; the metaloph constriction present on P2-4; the protocone equal to the hypocone on P2; the crista present on P3; and the cement on the cheek teeth developed. With all the morphological evidence considered, we establish a new species, Prosantorhinus yei sp. nov.. A phylogenetic analysis based on 282 morphological characters scored for 36 taxa reveals that Prosantorhinus yei sp. nov. is a relatively derived taxon in the genus. We hypothesize that Prosantorhinus yei sp. nov. lived in relatively moist environments.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) has a serious impact on the patients' quality of life. Icariin (Ica) possesses neuroprotective potential for treating VaD, yet its oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability remain challenges. This research introduced a PEG-PLGA-loaded chitosan hydrogel-based binary formulation tailored for intranasal delivery, enhancing the intracerebral delivery efficacy of neuroprotective agents. The formulation underwent optimization to facilitate BBB crossing, with examinations conducted on its particle size, morphology, drug-loading capacity, in vitro release, and biodistribution. Using the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) rat model, the therapeutic efficacy of this binary formulation was assessed against chitosan hydrogel and PEG-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with Ica. Post-intranasal administration, enhanced cognitive function was evident in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rats. Further mechanistic evaluations, utilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC), RT-PCR, and ELISA, revealed augmented transcription of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins like SYP and PSD-95, and a marked reduction in hippocampal inflammatory markers such as IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, highlighting the formulation's promise in alleviating cognitive impairment. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB) pathway was activated significantly in the binary formulation compared with the other two. Our study demonstrates that the intranasal application of chitosan hydrogel loaded with Ica-encapsulated PEG-PLGA could effectively deliver Ica into the brain and enhance its neuroprotective effect.

AB  - Cold storage is a preferred method for short-term preservation of ram spermatozoa due to its superior fertility rates compared to cryopreservation. This study aimed to optimise the conditions for ram sperm preservation by evaluating the effects of osmolarity and egg yolk (EY) concentration in a syringe-filtered extender. In part A, semen samples were extended with solutions of varying osmolarities (330, 360, 390 and 420 mOsm/kg water). The 390 mOsm/kg solution demonstrated the best preservation of sperm viability, functional integrity and motility over 96 h of storage. In part B, different EY concentrations (10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30%) were assessed at the optimal osmolarity (390 mOsm/kg). A 20% EY concentration provided the most effective protection of sperm DNA, acrosome integrity and membrane functionality. Excessive EY levels (> 20%) negatively impacted sperm viability and induced higher lipid peroxidation. These findings emphasise the importance of balancing osmolarity and EY concentration for efficient cold storage of ram spermatozoa, enhancing the potential success of artificial insemination programs in sheep breeding.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Lambs that are born to ewe lambs are not commonly selected as replacement ewes for sheep flocks in New Zealand, as they are born smaller and later than lambs born to mature ewes, hindering their chances of being heavy enough to breed as ewe lambs themselves. By selecting lambs born to ewe lambs, farmers can utilize animals that are available, and potentially increase genetic gain and ewe production efficiency. This experiment found that lambs born to ewe lambs are lighter than those born to mature ewes until two years of age, but have similar body condition scores, and rates of lamb production, if they are heavy enough to be bred as ewe lambs themselves. Therefore, farmers could select lambs born to ewe lambs that are heavy enough to achieve breeding targets.
   Currently, 30-43% of New Zealand sheep farmers breed their ewe lambs, but few retain the offspring as replacements for their flock. No difference in lamb production as a yearling among singletons and twins born to ewe lambs and twins born to mature ewes has been reported, provided the ewe lambs had reached the 60-65% of their likely mature weight prior to breeding at seven to eight months of age. The aim of this experiment was to determine the lamb production from singletons and twins born to ewe lambs and twins born to mature ewes during their first two years of lambing. The experiment included 8-month-old ewes born as twins to mature ewes (M2, n = 135), singletons born to ewe lambs (L1, n = 135), and twins born to ewe lambs (L2, n = 88), bred during the same period to the same rams, over two years. The efficiency of lamb production (total litter weight at weaning divided by the pre-breeding weight of the ewe, for all ewes presented for breeding) after two years of production was not significantly different (p > 0.05) among the groups (0.40 +/- 0.02, 0.39 +/- 0.02, and 0.39 +/- 0.03, for M2, L1, and L2, respectively).

AB  - This study explored the impacts of sire and dam breed on carcass quality and composition in a pasture-based system and the use of DXA to rapidly rank carcasses for leanness. Southdown (SD) and Suffolk (SF) ewes were mated to Texel (TX) or SD rams to produce seventy-nine lambs. Lambs were raised on pasture-based systems with limited grain supplementation. Lamb birth weight was greater (p < 0.01) for TX, regardless of dam breed. Lambing rate was lower (p < 0.01) for SD than SF ewes. Circulating myostatin concentrations were greater (p < 0.05) on d 42 than d 75 or d 110 but did not differ by sire breed. Texel-sired lambs had greater (p < 0.01) carcass weight, ribeye area and quality grade compared to SD-sired. Total and primal fat mass as predicted from DXA was higher (p < 0.05) in carcasses from SD than TX sires. Muscles from TX lambs had greater (p < 0.05) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition than SD-sired. Shear force values were influenced (p < 0.01) by dam breed, muscle cut and postmortem age but not by sire breed. The use of TX sires in pasture-based systems improved carcass leanness and muscle PUFA concentrations without altering tenderness.

AB  - Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is the predominant pathophysiological disturbance in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by neuronal cell death and neurocognitive impairment. We focus on the accumulated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol, which acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, a known trigger for immune responses and neuronal death in degenerative diseases. However, the specific role and mechanism of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING axis in IH-induced neural damage remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the involvement of PANoptosis, a novel type of programmed cell death linked to cytosolic mtDNA accumulation and the cGAS-STING pathway activation, in neuronal cell death induced by IH. Our study found that PANoptosis occurred in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and HT22 cell lines exposed to IH. In addition, we discovered that during IH, mtDNA released into the cytoplasm via the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activates the cGAS-STING pathway, exacerbating PANoptosis-associated neuronal death. Pharmacologically inhibiting mPTP opening or depleting mtDNA significantly reduced cGAS-STING pathway activation and PANoptosis in HT22 cells under IH. Moreover, our findings indicated that the cGAS-STING pathway primarily promotes PANoptosis by modulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Inhibiting or silencing the cGAS-STING pathway substantially reduced ER stress-mediated neuronal death and PANoptosis, while lentivirus-mediated STING overexpression exacerbated these effects. In summary, our study elucidates that cytosolic escape of mtDNA triggers cGAS-STING pathway-dependent neuronal PANoptosis in response to IH, mainly through regulating ER stress. The discovery of the novel mechanism provides theoretical support for the prevention and treatment of neuronal damage and cognitive impairment in patients with OSA.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a common synthetic endocrine disruptor that can be utilized in the fabrication of materials such as polycarbonates and epoxy resins. Numerous studies have linked BPA to learning and memory problems, although the precise mechanism remains unknown. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, and it is intimately related to learning and memory. This study aims to evaluate whether altered cognitive behavior involves the GABA signaling pathway in male offspring of rats exposed to BPA during the prenatal and early postnatal periods. Pregnant rats were orally given BPA (0, 0.04, 0.4, and 4 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day) from the first day of pregnancy to the 21st day of breastfeeding. Three-week-old male rat offspring were selected for an open-field experiment and a new object recognition experiment to evaluate the effect of BPA exposure on cognitive behavior. Furthermore, the role of GABA signaling markers in the cognition affected by BPA was investigated at the molecular level using western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The research demonstrated that BPA exposure impacted the behavior and memory of male rat offspring and elevated the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), GABA type A receptors subunit (GABAAR alpha 1), and GABA vesicle transporter (VGAT) in the hippocampus while decreasing the expression levels of GABA transaminase (GABA-T) and GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1). These findings indicate that the alteration in the expression of GABA signaling molecules may be one of the molecular mechanisms by which perinatal exposure to BPA leads to decreased learning and memory in male rat offspring.

AB  - ETEC (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli) infection is the leading cause of profuse watery diarrhea in mammals, especially among pre-weaning and post-weaning piglets in swine industry. Maternal immunization is a current rational strategy for providing protection to susceptive piglets and reducing the incidence of ETEC-associated diarrhea. Here we evaluated the protective efficiency of a recombinant antigen (MBP-SLS) fused by major enterotoxin subunits (STa-LTB-STb) via a maternal immunization model, and the impacts of maternal antibodies to neonatal oral vaccination were also investigated in the neonates. The high titers of specific IgG and sIgA in pups shown that the maternal antibodies could be transferred passively. Furthermore, the increases of IL-6 and IL-10 cytokines in breast milk and pup serum indicated that immunization on mother could effectively boost the immune system of neonates. Newborn rats from immunized mothers showed a 70% survival rate after ETEC infection. However, the mucosal immune responses of neonates were inhibited by the high level of maternal specific antibodies. Among the oral-vaccinated neonates, born from mock-immunized rats reached the highest survival after ETEC challenge. Collectively, the fusion MBP-SLS antigen could effectively induce strong immune responses in rats during pregnancy and the pups could receive passive protection through specific antibodies transferred via milk and placenta. However, the specific maternal antibodies exhibited an inhibition effect on the mucosal immune responses in offspring.

AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is herbicide that has been widely used for different crops. This extensive use has resulted in severe deleterious effects in different species. In this work, we investigated the potentially harmful effect of atrazine herbicide on the brain and submandibular salivary gland. Our investigation was carried out on 20 adult male albino rats that were equally divided into two groups. The first group received distilled water as control, while the second group received ATZ at 200 mg/kg body weight/ day via stomach gavage for 30 successive days of the experiment; the oral LD50 for ATZ is 3090 mg/kg. Our findings revealed the ability of ATZ to cause damage to the cerebrum, hippocampus, and submandibular salivary gland. This damage resulted from the induced oxidative stress, which was indicated by a significant elevation in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, DNA fragmentation, tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression, with a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) level and reduction of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (Creb1) genes expression after ATZ exposure. Moreover, degeneration of cells, cytoplasmic vacuolation, congestion of blood vessels, a strong immune reaction to caspase 3, and negligible immune expression of a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were also noticed in the ATZ-treated group. We concluded that ATZ induces oxidative stress and has a toxic and apoptotic effects on the cerebrum, hippocampus, and salivary gland of adult male albino rats.

AB  - leading to excessive regulation of astrocytes, resulting in glutamate reuptake dysfunction in astrocytes and leading to perturbed cognition and synaptic plasticity.Lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn) are common neurotoxins. However, individuals are subject to co-exposures in real life, and it is therefore important to study these metals in combination. Weaning Sprague-Dawley rats were given ad libitum access to drinking water solutions containing Pb (100 mg/L), Mn (2.5 mg/mL) or a mixture, and each treatment had its own minocycline (50 mg/(kg center dot day)) supplement group. The results showed a significant difference in spatial memory and induction levels of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in all exposure groups when compared with controls. The combined-exposure group exhibited the most pronounced effect when compared with each of the single-metal exposure groups. Microglia displayed activation at day 3 after exposure alone or in combination, while astrocytes showed activation at day 5, accompanied by decreased expression levels of GLAST, GLT-1, and GS. Furthermore, the levels of glutamate in the synaptic cleft increased significantly. When microglial activation was inhibited by minocycline, the activation of astrocytes and the expression of GLAST, GLT-1, and GS were both reversed. In addition, upon minocycline treatment, hippocampal LTP impairment and cognitive injury were significantly alleviated in each of the exposure groups.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Marine ecosystems are a huge source of unexplored "blue" materials for different applications. The edible part of sea urchin is limited, and the vast majority of the product ends up as waste. Our studies intend to fully recycle wastes from the food industry and reconvert them in high added-value products, as innovative biocompatible skin substitutes for tissue regeneration. The aim of the present work is to apply the pioneering skin substitute in in vivo experimental wounds to test its regenerative potential and compare it, in a future study, to the available commercial membranes produced with collagen of bovine, porcine, and equine origin. Results are encouraging since the skin substitute made with marine collagen reduced inflammation, promoted the deposition of granulation tissue, and enhanced a proper re-epithelialization with the adequate development of skin appendages. In summary, our findings might be of great interest for processing industries and biotech companies which transform waste materials in high-valuable and innovative products for Veterinary advanced applications.
   Skin wound healing is a complex and dynamic process that aims to restore lesioned tissues. Collagen-based skin substitutes are a promising treatment to promote wound healing by mimicking the native skin structure. Recently, collagen from marine organisms has gained interest as a source for producing biomaterials for skin regenerative strategies. This preliminary study aimed to describe the application of a collagen-based skin-like scaffold (CBSS), manufactured with collagen extracted from sea urchin food waste, to treat experimental skin wounds in a large animal. The wound-healing process was assessed over different time points by the means of clinical, histopathological, and molecular analysis. The CBSS treatment improved wound re-epithelialization along with cell proliferation, gene expression of growth factors (VEGF-A), and development of skin adnexa throughout the healing process. Furthermore, it regulated the gene expression of collagen type I and III, thus enhancing the maturation of the granulation tissue into a mature dermis without any signs of scarring as observed in untreated wounds. The observed results (reduced inflammation, better re-epithelialization, proper development of mature dermis and skin adnexa) suggest that sea urchin-derived CBSS is a promising biomaterial for skin wound healing in a "blue biotechnologies" perspective for animals of Veterinary interest.

AB  - Simple Summary: Alpacas (Vicugna pacos) and llamas (Lama glama) constitute the most significant livestock wealth of the Andean populations of South America. Infectious diseases, particularly respiratory and enteric infections, cause high morbidity and mortality in offspring and adult animals. In this study, we demonstrated that multiple variants of the coronavirus co-circulated among Peruvian alpacas. We also demonstrated that some of these variants bear similarities to coronavirus strains detected in bats. For a better understanding of the infections that afflict these animals, continuous surveillance is needed to identify the emergence of new genotypes and viral variants that are potentially pathogenic to alpacas and humans. Future studies should include the sequencing of genes encoding CoV spike proteins and host receptors to confirm interspecies transmission. Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of hosts, including humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, typically causing mild-to-severe respiratory or enteric disease. The main objective of this study was to identify CoV genera and subgenera detected in Peruvian alpacas. Lung lavage specimens were collected from 32 animals aged 1 to 6 weeks. CoVs were identified by using RT-PCR to amplify a pan-CoV conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding gene. A nested PCR was performed to identify beta-CoVs. Then, beta-CoV-positive samples were subjected to RT-PCR using specific primers to identify the Embecovirus subgenus. Out of 32 analyzed samples, 30 (93.8%) tested positive for at least one CoV genus. beta-, alpha-, or unclassified CoVs were identified in 24 (80%), 1 (3.3%), and 1 (3.3%) of the positive samples, respectively. A CoV genus could not be identified in two (6.7%) samples. A mixture of different CoV genera was detected in two (6.7%) samples: one was co-infected with beta- and alpha-CoVs, and the other contained a beta- and an unclassified CoV. A sequence analysis of the amplicons generated by the PCR identified 17 beta-CoV strains belonging to the subgenus Embecovirus and two alpha-CoV strains belonging to Decacovirus. A phylogenetic analysis of two strains revealed a relationship with an unclassified Megaderma BatCoV strain. A subgenus could not be identified in nine beta-CoV samples. Our data show a high prevalence and a high genetic diversity of CoV genera and subgenera that infect alpacas, in which the beta-CoV subgenus Embecovirus predominated. Our data also suggest a new role for bats in the dissemination and transmission of uncommon CoVs to alpacas raised in rural Peru.

AB  - Cell replacement therapies using medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived GABAergic precursors reduce seizures by restoring inhibition in animal models of epilepsy. However, how MGE-derived cells affect abnormal neuronal networks and consequently brain oscillations to reduce ictogenesis is still under investigation. We performed quantitative analysis of pre-ictal local field potentials (LFP) of cortical and hippocampal CA1 areas recorded in vivo in the pilocarpine rat model of epilepsy, with or without intrahippocampal MGE-precursor grafts (PILO and PILO+MGE groups, respectively). The PILO+MGE animals had a significant reduction in the number of seizures. The quantitative analysis of pre-ictal LFP showed decreased power of cortical and hippocampal delta, theta and beta oscillations from the 5 min. interictal baseline to the 20 s. pre-ictal period in both groups. However, PILO+MGE animals had higher power of slow and fast oscillations in the cortex and lower power of slow and fast oscillations in the hippocampus compared to the PILO group. Additionally, PILO+MGE animals exhibited decreased cortico-hippocampal synchrony for theta and gamma oscillations at seizure onset and lower hippocampal CA1 synchrony between delta and theta with slow gamma oscillations compared to PILO animals. These findings suggest that MGE-derived cell integration into the abnormally rewired network may help control ictogenesis.

AB  - Depression is a common mental disorder affecting more than 264 million people worldwide. The first-line treatment for most cases of depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline, reboxetine and fluoxetine. Recently, it has been found that one-quarter of depressed patients have excessive activation of the immune system. This potentially warrants sub-categorisation of depressed patients into inflammatory and non-inflammatory subtypes. Such a sub-category of depression already exists for those not responding to various traditional antidepressants and is known as treatment-resistant depression. Those with treatment-resistant depression are far more likely to have raised inflammatory markers relative to those whose depression is treatment-responsive. Chronic, low-level inflammation seems to trigger depression via a multitude of mechanisms. These include kynurenine pathway and microglial cell activation, resulting in a reduction in hippocampal volume. Raised inflammatory cytokines also cause perturbations in monoaminergic signalling, which perhaps explains the preponderance of treatment resistance in those patients with inflammatory depression. Therefore, if treatment-resistant depression and inflammatory depression are semi-synonymous then it should follow that anti-inflammatory drugs will display high efficacy in both sub-types. Ketamine is a drug recently approved for use in depression in the USA and displays a particularly good response rate in those patients with treatment resistance. It has been suggested that the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine results from its anti-inflammatory effects. Ketamine seems to produce anti-inflammatory effects via polarisation of monocytes to M2 macrophages. Furthermore, another anti-inflammatory drug with potential use in treatment-resistant depression is Celecoxib. Celecoxib is a long-acting, selective COX-2 inhibitor. Early clinical trials show that Celecoxib has an adjuvant effect with traditional antidepressants in treatment-resistant patients. This paper highlights the importance of classifying depressed patients into inflammatory and non-inflammatory subtypes; and how this may lead to the development of more targeted treatments for treatment-resistant depression.

AB  - Vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a tubular pheromone sensing organ in which the lumen is covered with sensory and non-sensory epithelia. This study used immunohistochemistry and lectin histochemistry techniques to evaluate developmental changes, specifically of the glycoconjugate profile, in the horse VNO epithelium. Immunostaining analysis revealed PGP9.5 expression in some vomeronasal non-sensory epithelium (VNSE) cells and in the vomeronasal receptor cells of the vomeronasal sensory epithelium (VSE) in fetuses, young foals, and adult horses. OMP expression was exclusively localized in receptor cells of the VSE in fetuses, young foals, and adult horses and absent in VNSE. To identify the glycoconjugate type, lectin histochemistry was performed using 21 lectins. Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that the intensities of glycoconjugates labeled with WGA, DSL, LEL, and RCA120 were significantly higher in adult horse VSE than those in foal VSE, whereas the intensities of glycoconjugates labeled with LCA and PSA were significantly lower in adult horse VSE. The intensities of glycoconjugates labeled with s-WGA, WGA, BSL-II, DSL, LEL, STL, ConA, LCA, PSA, DBA, SBA, SJA, RCA120, jacalin, and ECL were significantly higher in adult horse VNSE than those in foal VNSE, whereas the intensity of glycoconjugates labeled with UEA-I was lower in adult horse VNSE. Histochemical analysis of each lectin revealed that various glycoconjugates in the VSE were present in the receptor, supporting, and basal cells of foal and adult horses. A similar pattern of lectin histochemistry was also observed in the VNSE of foal and adult horses. In conclusion, these results suggest that there are increase in the level of N-acetylglucosamine (labeled by WGA, DSL, LEL) and galactose (labeled by RCA120) in horse VSE during postnatal development, implying that they may influence the function of VNO in adult horses.

AB  - The development of osteopenia is one of the most noticeable manifestations of the adverse effects of space factors on crew members. The Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to play a central role in regulating the functional activity of cells through their response to mechanical stimuli. In the present study, the components of the Hippo pathway and the protective properties of osteodifferentiation inducers were investigated under simulated microgravity (smg) using a heterotypic bone marrow cell culture model, which allows for the maintenance of the close interaction between the stromal and hematopoietic compartments, present in vivo and of great importance for both the fate of osteoprogenitors and hematopoiesis. After 14 days of smg, the osteopotential and osteodifferentiation of bone marrow stromal progenitor cells, the expression of Hippo cascade genes and the immunocytochemical status of the adherent fraction of bone marrow cells, as well as the paracrine profile in the conditioned medium and the localization of Yap1 and Runx2 in mechanosensitive cells of the bone marrow were obtained. Simulated microgravity negatively affects stromal and hematopoietic cells when interacting in a heterotypic murine bone marrow cell culture. This is evidenced by the decrease in cell proliferation and osteopotential. Changes in the production of pleiotropic cytokines IL-6, GRO beta and MCP-1 were revealed. Fourteen days of simulated microgravity induced a decrease in the nuclear translocation of Yap1 and the transcription factor Runx2 in the stromal cells of the intact group. Exposure to osteogenic induction conditions partially compensated for the negative effect of simulated microgravity. The data obtained will be crucial for understanding the effects of spaceflight on osteoprogenitor cell growth and differentiation via Hippo-Yap signaling.

Although the exact connection between hyperandrogenism and inflammation in PCOS remains unclear, the Hippo pathway, also seems to be involved in the inflammatory response through YAP.MethodAn in-vivo PCOS model of mice was constructed with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and YAP inhibitor Verteporfin (VP). YAP, inflammation and pyroptosis levels of ovarian tissues were detected in mice models. An in-vitro PCOS model of KGN cells was constructed with testosterone, and YAP was knocked down by lentivirus.ResultsIncreased levels of YAP in the ovarian tissues of the DHEA-treated mice were observed, alongside elevations in inflammation and pyroptosis levels, whereas Verteporfin reversed these alterations. The findings in KGN cells demonstrated that testosterone treatment results in elevation of YAP, inflammation and pyroptosis levels in granulosa cells. However, knocking down YAP in KGN cells curtailed testosterone-induced inflammation and pyroptosis.ConclusionsHyperandrogenism in PCOS promotes ovarian inflammation by upregulating nuclear YAP, disrupting the inflammatory microenvironment, leading to abnormal ovarian pyroptosis, and ultimately impairing follicular function.

AB  - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has emerged as a popular choice of material for many microfluidic and flexible sensing devices despite its inherent hydrophobic nature. Here, we report on the use of atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (APDBD) oxygen (O-2) plasma in the development of hydrophilic and protein repulsive PDMS microchannels for plasmonic sensing application. The effect of plasma treatment on the wettability, surface energy and hydrophilicity retention capacity of PDMS was determined using contact angle measurements. The PDMS sample exposed to low-power DBD O-2 plasma for 6 min demonstrated lowest contact angle of 35.15 & ring;, surface energy of 62.83 mN/m and hydrophilicity retention capacity of more than 50 days in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). The treatment of PDMS with plasma induces surface hydrophilicity due to the introduction of polar functional groups as evinced by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis without compromising the bulk structure and optical properties of PDMS which were confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopic measurements. The plasma treated PDMS was used in the construction of a microfluidic Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensor which demonstrated very low detection limits of 7.13 ng/ml, 5.91 ng/ml and 1.47 ng/ml and high sensitivities of 16.8 & ring;/(mu g/ml), 13.5 & ring;/(mu g/ml) and 16.65 & ring;/(mu g/ml) against anti-Human Immunoglobulin-G protein raised in mouse, goat and rabbit respectively. The obtained results infer that APDBD O-2 plasma is a promising technique to render PDMS hydrophilic suited for reliable microfluidic based plasmonic biosensing applications.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Dietary cation anion balance (DCAB) influences urine pH in several species, e.g., cats, dogs, pigs and cattle suggesting a species-specific impact. In the present study, we aimed to explore the impact of three diets with different DACB on wildtype laboratory mice. During a two-month feeding trial urine pH and body weight were measured in C57Bl/6J and CD1 male mice. Remarkable, we observed strong impact of the genetic background and diet on urine pH levels. A plausible explanation is that differences in renal phosphorus excretion and, in turn, phosphate buffering capacity account for these differences. It is tempting to speculate that standard laboratory mouse models show DCAB dependent variations in urine pH.
   Acid base homeostasis and urine pH is influenced by the dietary cation anion balance (DCAB) in many species. Here, a negative DCAB acidifies the urine, while higher DCABs alkalize the urine. The dimension of the DCAB effect can be species-specific, because of differences in urine buffer systems. The aim of the present study was to describe the response of laboratory mice to diets with different DCAB. We used 8-week-old wildtype male mice of the C57Bl/6J inbred strain and CD1 outbred stock. Three groups (n = 15 animals/group) were formed and fed standard diet A for adaptation. For the 7-week feeding trial, mice were either kept on diet A (DCAB -7 mmol/kg dry matter (DM) or switched to diet B (246 mmol/kg DM) or C (-257 mmol/kg DM). Urine pH was measured weekly from a pooled sample per cage. There was a significant difference in the basal urine pH on diet A between C57Bl6/J and CD1 mice. The shift in urine pH was also significantly different between the two groups investigated.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to obtain activated biocarbons from the natural biomass of horse chestnut seeds (Aesculus hippocastanum) by physical activation with two different activating agents, carbon dioxide and water vapor, and to evaluate their structural and adsorption properties. The effect of the pyrolysis atmosphere on the surface development and porosity as well as the structure and adsorption properties of the materials in relation to the selected organic adsorbates (tetracycline (TC), naproxen (NPX), and methyl orange (MO)), which may constitute a potential contamination of the aquatic environment, was evaluated. Activated biocarbons were characterized using N-2 low-temperature adsorption/desorption, Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The nature of the surface (pH(pzc) and Boehm titration) was also studied. Micro/mesoporous biocarbons were obtained with an S-BET area in the range of similar to 534 to 646 m(2)/g, in which micropores constituted similar to 70%. It was proved that the obtained materials are characterized by high adsorption values (similar to 120 mg/g, similar to 150 mg/g, and similar to 252 mg/g) and removal rates %R (similar to 80%, similar to 95%, and similar to 75%) for TC, NPX, and MO, respectively. The results indicate that chestnut-derived activated biocarbons are a promising, cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative for removing organic contaminants from aqueous solutions. Future research should focus on optimizing activation parameters and assessing the long-term performance of adsorbents.

AB  - Paracetamol, or acetaminophen (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol, APAP), is an analgesic and antipyretic drug that is commonly used worldwide, implicated in numerous intoxications due to overdose, and causes serious liver damage. APAP can cross the blood-brain barrier and affects brain function in numerous ways, including pain signals, temperature regulation, neuroimmune response, and emotional behavior; however, its effect on adult neurogenesis has not been thoroughly investigated. We analyze, in a mouse model of hepatotoxicity, the effect of APAP overdose (750 mg/kg/day) for 3 and 4 consecutive days and after the cessation of APAP administration for 6 and 15 days on cell proliferation and survival in two relevant neurogenic zones: the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the hypothalamus. The involvement of liver damage (plasma transaminases), neuronal activity (c-Fos), and astroglia (glial fibrillar acidic protein, GFAP) were also evaluated. Our results indicated that repeated APAP overdoses are associated with the inhibition of adult neurogenesis in the context of elevated liver transaminase levels, neuronal hyperactivity, and astrogliosis. These effects were partially reversed after the cessation of APAP administration for 6 and 15 days. In conclusion, these results suggest that APAP overdose impairs adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, a fact that may contribute to the effects of APAP on brain function.

AB  - Adequate management of replacement ewe lambs (F0) in dairy sheep farms during postnatal life may modify the germline cells, thus promoting transmission of intergenerational effects to the offspring (F1). To test this hypothesis, 18 newborn male lambs (F1), either born from methionine-supplemented ewe lambs (F0 ewe lambs being fed ad libitum with a milk replacer supplemented with 1 g methionine/kg DM) or not supplemented (F0 ewe lambs being fed ad libitum with the same milk replacer with no methionine added), were included in the present study. All the male F1 lambs were managed exactly in the same way along the whole lifespan in order to bring out the differences caused by methionine supplementation of F0 dams. Our data show that the methionine supplementation of dams (F0) during the suckling period did not promote significant (p > 0.05) changes on feed intake, growth rate, or feed efficiency of F1 male lambs during the fattening period. Moreover, the meat chemical composition (proximal, fatty acid profile, and volatile compounds) was similar for both groups (p > 0.05), but the meat of F1-MET lambs presented higher redness and hardness (p < 0.05) when compared to F1-CTRL lambs. The biochemical profile also highlighted significant (p < 0.05) differences in the serum creatinine and calcium content that may be at least partially related to the meat quality traits observed. Overall, all these results suggest that methionine supplementation of lambs (F0) during early postnatal life causes permanent changes in the offspring. This has positive effects, such as achieving a more attractive color of lamb meat (F1) for consumers, and negative effects, such as reduced meat tenderness.

AB  - Acute neuronopathic (type II) Gaucher disease (GD) is a devastating, untreatable neurological disorder resulting from mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), with subsequent accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Patients experience progressive decline in neurological function, with onset typically within the first three-to-six months of life and premature death before two years. Mice and drosophila with GD have been described, however little is known about the brain pathology observed in the naturally occurring ovine model of GD. We have characterised pathological changes in GD lamb brain and compared the histological findings to those in GD patient post-mortem tissue, to determine the validity of the sheep as a model of this disease. Five GD and five age-matched unaffected lamb brains were examined. We observed significant expansion of the endo/lysosomal system in GD lamb cingulate gyrus however TPP1 and cathepsin D levels were unchanged or reduced. H&E staining revealed neurons with shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic or pyknotic nuclei (red neurons) that were also shrunken and deeply Nissl stain positive. Amoeboid microglia were noted throughout GD brain. Spheroidal inclusions reactive for TOMM20, ubiquitin and most strikingly, p-Tau were observed in many brain regions in GD lamb brain, potentially indicating disturbed axonal trafficking. Our findings suggest that the ovine model of GD exhibits similar pathological changes to human, mouse, and drosophila type II GD brain, and represents a model suitable for evaluating therapeutic intervention, particularly in utero-targeted approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe authors previously prepared a microencapsulated complex of thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde (MEEO). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of MEEO on the intestinal mucosal barrier and homeostasis in weaning piglets. A comparison of the effect of MEEO versus chlortetracycline (CTC) was performed in this study. RESULTSPiglets were divided into three groups - control (Con), MEEO, and CTC groups - and raised for 28 days. The results showed that MEEO significantly elevated the ratio of the villus height and the crypt depth in the jejunum and decreased the crypt depth in the ileum compared with the other groups (P < 0.05); it also upregulated the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of tight junction protein in the small intestine. Compared with the Con group, MEEO increased the concentration of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides (CAMP), and interleukin 10 (IL-10), while decreasing the interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) concentration in both jejunal and ileal mucosa (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of jejunal mucosal MUC1 and ileal mucosal MUC2 was increased in the MEEO group compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). Intestinal microbial analysis showed that dietary treatment had little impact on the ileal microbial structure. A significant rise in the genus Lactobacillus was, however, found in the MEEO group. There is a positive correlation between the Lactobacillus and sIgA, and between the Lactobacillus and CAMP, indicating that an improvement in the mucosal barrier function by the addition of MEEO may be associated with the proliferation of Lactobacillus. CONCLUSIONDietary supplementation with MEEO improves intestinal barrier function in weaning piglets, the effect of which was superior to CTC. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterised by cognitive dysfunction, memory loss and mood changes. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been suggested to play a role in learning and memory. Neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) has been shown to be prevalent in the hippocampus region. The aim of the project was to investigate the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in the promnestic effects of NK3R agonist administration in an amyloid beta-induced AD rat model. Wistar albino rats were divided into control, Alzheimer, NK3R agonist and Alzheimer + NK3R agonist groups. The open field (OF) test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were performed for locomotor activity and memory analysis. Peptide gene expression levels (Nestin, DCX, Neuritin, MASH1, Neun, BDNF) were analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the OF test, the group-time relationship was found to be statistically different in the parameters of distance travelled and percentage of movement (p < 0.05). In MWM, the time to reach the platform and the time spent in the target quadrant were statistically significant between the groups (p < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were observed in gene expression levels (Nestin, DCX, Neuritin, MASH1) in the hippocampal tissue of rats between the groups (p < 0.05). NK3 receptor agonism favourably affected hippocampal neurogenesis in AD model rats. It was concluded that NK3 receptor agonism in the hippocampus, which is the first affected region in the physiopathology of AD, may be effective in both the formation of neural precursor cells and the reduction of neuronal degeneration. The positive effect of NK3R on cognitive functions may be mediated by hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Roughly a third of all horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophidae: Rhinolophus) are found in Africa, where a recent continent-wide genetic survey suggested the presence of both undescribed and apparently invalid species. Here, we focus on the R. landeri species complex and the recent elevation of R. lobatus Peters, 1852, to species rank. That action created ambiguity in the taxonomy of East African members of the group-are both R. landeri Martin, 1838, and R. lobatus sympatric in East Africa or is another, unnamed species present there? Here, we refine genetic, morphological, and behavioral characterizations of R. landeri and its erstwhile synonyms with samples from the vicinity of their type localities. The distribution of R. landeri appears to be limited to Central and West Africa; existing genetic records attributed to this species from Mali clearly represent another taxon. We marshal genetic evidence for the species-level distinction of R. dobsoni Thomas, 1904, from Sudan, which was previously considered a synonym of R. landeri. We reject R. axillaris J. A. Allen, 1917, as a synonym of the R. landeri complex, provisionally regarding it as a valid member of the landeri species group. Finally, we demonstrate that East Africa is home to a fourth species of the landeri complex that is named herein. Final resolution of the systematics of this species complex awaits expanded characterizations (especially of genetics, vocalizations, and noseleaves) and studies of variation in regions of contact.
   Integrative analyses of genetic, morphological, and bioacoustic data for African horseshoe bats in the Rhinolophus landeri group demonstrate that it is a complex of species. Two purported synonyms of R. landeri appear to constitute separate species, while a third (shown here; see ) is surely differentiated and is described as new. Additional genetic and vocal sampling is needed to understand their distributions and relationships more fully.

AB  - Melanoma has the highest propensity among solid tumors to metastasize to the brain. Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are a leading cause of death in melanoma and affect 40-60% of patients with late-stage disease. Therefore, uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind MBM is necessary to enhance therapeutic interventions. Vascular mimicry (VM) is a form of neovascularization linked to invasion, increased risk of metastasis, and poor prognosis in many tumor types, but its significance in MBM remains poorly understood. We found that VM density is elevated in MBM compared to paired extracranial specimens and is associated with tumor volume and CNS edema. In addition, our studies indicate a relevant role of YAP and TAZ, two transcriptional co-factors scarcely studied in melanoma, in tumor cell-vasculogenesis and in brain metastasis. We recently demonstrated activation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway and increased degradation of its downstream targets YAP and TAZ in a metastasis impaired cell line model. In the current study we establish the utility of anti-YAP/TAZ therapy in mouse models of metastatic melanoma whereby treatment effectively inhibits VM and prolongs survival of mice with MBM. The data presented herein suggest that VM may be an important and targetable mechanism in melanoma and that VM inhibition might be useful for treating MBM, an area of high unmet clinical need, thus having important implications for future treatment regimens for these patients.

AB  - We study the effect of hypothermia (HT) following hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) brain injury in postnatal day 7 (P7) rats. In 2015, new European Union animal transport regulations prompted a change in practice at the breeding facility, which henceforth crossfostered P3 litters to P8 older lactating dams prior to transportation. It is generally assumed that crossfostering does not significantly affect the experimental results. The aim of this study was to examine whether crossfostering affects our model consistency by modifying injury susceptibility and hypothermic neuroprotection. We analysed 219 pups from 11 experiments conducted between 2013 and 2015: 73 non-crossfostered and 146 crossfostered pups. At P7, all pups underwent unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by 50 min of hypoxia (8% O-2, 36 degrees C). Immediately after this mild insult, the pups were randomized to post-insult normothermia or HT treatment. Pups were culled at P14. Injury was assessed by area loss of the ipsilateral hemisphere and histopathology scoring of the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Crossfostered pups had double the injury compared to non-crossfostered pups irrespective of the treatment group. Hypothermic neuroprotection was statistically significant, but with a smaller and less consistent effect in crossfostered pups (relative neuroprotection 16% vs. 31% in non-crossfostered). These results demonstrate hypothermic neuroprotection following a mild HI insult. A representative subset of 41 animals was also assessed for evidence of microglial reactivity; however, no detectable difference in microglial reactivity was observed between any of the groups. In conclusion, crossfostering alters outcomes in our established model through reduced insult tolerance and variable neuroprotection. Crossfostering as a common breeding practice is a largely unexplored variable in animal research that may result in invalid research conclusions if inadequately adjusted for by larger group sizes. As a result, crossfostering is likely to be inconsistent with the principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement.

AB  - The type specimens of 42 cheilostome bryozoan species introduced by Lars Silen between 1938 and 1954 and housed at three different Swedish institutions (the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, the Biological Museum in Lund and the Museum of Evolution in Uppsala) are here revised using scanning electron microscopy, with two exceptions, for the first time. As a result of this revision, new morphological observations were made for some species, such as ooecia in Antropora erecta, a costal pseudopore in Jullienula hippocrepis, intracolonial variation in the number of intracostal windows in Costaticella gisleni, and oral spines in Triphyllozoon mauritzoni. Some other observations confirmed the presence of structures/polymorphs in type material that had previously only been noted in non-type specimens, such as spinose interzooidal kenozooids in Retevirgula triangulata and putative brooding zooids in Bugulina kiuschiuensis. Structures originally interpreted as hydroid tube openings on the dorsal side of Triphyllozoon microstigmatum were confirmed to be avicularia, while the supposed kenozooidal attachment rootlet of Fedora nodosa might be the polypide tube of a coronate scyphozoan. In addition, the original combination Heliodoma goesi is here reinstated after Lagaaij assigned the species to Setosellina in 1963. The following new combinations are also proposed: Labioporella aviculifera for Siphonoporella aviculifera; Mangana canui and Mangana incrustata for Callopora canui and Tegella incrustata, respectively; Sphaerulobryozoon ovum for Fedora ovum. Lectotypes were selected when appropriate. This work clarifies the exact identity of some species that have never been recorded after their first description, such as Stylopoma magnovicellata and three species of Triphyllozoon, and contributes to the current increasing effort to digitize historical key specimens in natural history museum collections.

AB  - Exposure to early-life stress has been found to lead to enduring psychiatric symptoms, including cognitive impairments that persist into adulthood and even old age. In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects and molecular changes of a well-established animal model of early-life stress, the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model, in aged male mice. After 16 months, stressed mice showed a marked impairment in novel and spatial object recognition tasks, but not in temporal order memory or spatial working memory in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation task. These cognitive deficits were accompanied by a reduction in VGluT1 expression and a lower VGluT1/VGAT ratio in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, as well as reduced nectin3 expression in the mouse hippocampus. No significant molecular alterations were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex. These data support the notion that early-life stress leads to cognitive impairments in aged male mice, and these effects may be associated with a dysregulated excitatory/inhibitory balance and reduced nectin3 levels in the hippocampus.

AB  - Heterogeneous integration technology makes possible the integration of multiple separately manufactured components into a single higher level assembly with enhanced functionality and improved operating characteristics. Various types of advanced heterogeneous packages are available, including 2.5-D integrated circuit (IC), fan-out chip on substrate (FOCoS) chip-first, and FOCoS chip-last. This study constructs a nonlinear simulation technique (3-D simulation model) to explore the warpage, extreme low-k (ELK) interconnect stress, redistribution layer (RDL) trace stress, and board-level solder joint reliability of all three packages. The validity of the simulation model is confirmed by comparing the numerical results for the in-plane dimensional change of an FOCoS chip-last package with the experimental observations over the temperature range of 30 degrees C-260 degrees C. The thermal performance (i.e., junction-to-ambient thermal resistance) of the three packages is then examined and compared. Finally, 2(5) factorial designs with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) are conducted to examine the effects of the main structural design parameters of the FOCoS chip-last package on its thermomechanical reliability under typical thermal loading conditions. It is shown that a thinner polyimide (PI) layer is beneficial in improving the package reliability by minimizing the coefficient of temperature expansion (CTE) mismatch between the PI layer and the RDL trace, respectively.

AB  - A novel monopolar electroporation system and methodologies were developed for in vivo electroporation intended for potential clinical applications such as gene therapy. We hypothesized that an asymmetric anode/cathode electrode applicator geometry could produce favorable electric fields for electroporation, without the typical drawback associated with traditional needle and parallel plate geometries. Three monopolar electrode applicator prototypes were built and tested for gene delivery of reporter genes to the skin in a guinea pig model. Gene expression was evaluated in terms of kinetics over time and expression distribution within the treatment site. Different pulsing parameters, including pulse amplitude, pulse duration, and pulse number were evaluated. Monopolar gene electrotransfer significantly enhanced gene expression compared to controls over the course of 21 days. Gene expression distribution was observed throughout the full thickness of the epidermis, as well as notable expression in the deeper layers of the skin, including the dermis, and the underlying striated muscle without any damage at the treatment site, which is a substantial improvement over previously reported expression confined to the epidermis only. Expression distribution observed is consistent with the electric field distribution model, indicating that our novel electrode geometry results in targeted electroporation and gene transfer. This is important, as it may facilitate translation of many electroporation-based clinical therapies including gene therapies, IRE, and ECT.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The rumen epithelium of dairy cattle undergoes a transformation in response to dietary and physiological changes. Rumen papillae development and adaptation from a typical dry cow diet to a lactating diet can require a substantial amount of time, subsequently limiting the amount of volatile fatty acids (VFA) absorbed from the rumen during early lactation. Infusions of butyrate into the rumen of sheep stimulates cellular proliferation of rumen epithelial tissue, which may prove beneficial for ruminal papillae development in dairy cows during the dry period. However, no studies have investigated mechanisms associated with rumen epithelial adaptation in periparturient dairy cattle. Our hypothesis was that supplementation with cane molasses containing 34% sucrose during the prepartum period would stimulate ruminal butyrate production and ultimately promote ruminal papillae development and absorption rate, thus increasing dry matter intake (DMI) and milk production during the postpartum period. Results from these experiments indicate that diets containing cane molasses during a 60 day dry period can positively influence transition cow performance.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the addition of cane molasses during a 60 day dry period on performance and metabolism of Holstein cows during prepartum and postpartum periods. For experiment 1, 26 primiparous and 28 multiparous cows were used. Upon freshening, all cows were offered a common lactation diet. For experiment 2, six multiparous cows fitted with rumen cannulas were used to measure performance and metabolism, following the same protocol as experiment 1. Ruminal propionate increased by 10% during both prepartum and postpartum periods; however, papillae area was greater for cows not fed molasses, and volatile fatty acids (VFA) absorption from the rumen was not increased, resulting in similar glucagon-like-peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) density. The improved dry matter intake, when molasses was added into prepartum diets, translated into increased milk yield and energy-corrected milk (ECM) in Experiment 1 only for multiparous cows. For experiment 2, the improvement on milk performance was also observed, where cows fed molasses had 18.5% greater ECM production. Feeding molasses during a 60 day dry period positively influenced transition cow performance, and it was not accompanied by changes in rumen morphometrics; however, this indicates enhanced adaptation by the rumen epithelium based on similar capabilities for VFA absorption.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donors make opioids more effective in inhibiting nociception during inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We examined whether the analgesic, anxiolytic and/or antidepressant actions of the cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) agonist, JWH-133, might be improved by pretreatment with H2S donors, DADS and GYY4137 in mice with sciatic nerve injury-provoked neuropathy (CCI). The reversion of the antinociceptive effects of these treatments with the CB2R antagonist, AM630, and the regulatory actions of H2S in the phosphorylation of NF-& kappa;B inhibitor alpha (IKB & alpha;) and in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), CB2R, Nrf2 and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) levels in prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), were examined. Data showed that the analgesic effects of JWH-133, systemically and locally administered, were improved by the DADS or GYY4137 pretreatment. The co-treatment of GYY4137 with JWH-133 also stopped anxiodepressive-like activities that concur with neuropathy. Our data likewise showed that both H2S donors normalized the inflammatory (p-IKB & alpha;), neurotrophic (BDNF) variations caused by CCI, increased the expression of CB2R and activated the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway in PFC, v-HIP and/or PAG of animals with neuropathic pain. In addition, the blockade of the analgesia produced by high doses of DADS and GYY4137 with AM630 indicated the contribution of the endocannabinoid system in the effects of H2S during neuropathic pain, thus supporting the positive interaction between H2S and CB2R. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential use of CB2R agonists combined with H2S donors as a possible treatment for peripheral nerve injury-caused neuropathic pain and the associated emotional disturbances.

AB  - Dynamic interactions within and across brain areas underlie behavioral and cognitive functions. To understand the basis of these processes, the activities of distributed local circuits inside the brain of a behaving animal must be synchronously recorded while the inputs to these circuits are precisely manipulated. Even though recent technological advances have enabled such large-scale recording capabilities, the development of the high-spatiotemporal-resolution and large-scale modulation techniques to accompany those recordings has lagged. A novel neural probe is presented in this work that enables simultaneous electrical monitoring and optogenetic manipulation of deep neuronal circuits at large scales with a high spatiotemporal resolution. The "hectoSTAR" micro-light-emitting-diode (mu LED) optoelectrode features 256 recording electrodes and 128 stimulation mu LEDs monolithically integrated on the surface of its four 30-mu m thick silicon micro-needle shanks, covering a large volume with 1.3-mm x 0.9-mm cross-sectional area located as deep as 6 mm inside the brain. The use of this device in behaving mice for dissecting long-distance network interactions across cortical layers and hippocampal regions is demonstrated. The recording-and-stimulation capabilities hectoSTAR mu LED optoelectrodes enables will open up new possibilities for the cellular and circuit-based investigation of brain functions in behaving animals.

AB  - Trichomes are specialised epidermal cells developed in the aerial surface of almost every terrestrial plant. These structures form physical barriers, which combined with their capability of synthesis of complex molecules, prevent plagues from spreading and confer trichomes a key role in the defence against herbivores. In this work, the tomato gene HAIRPLUS (HAP) that controls glandular trichome density in tomato plants was characterised. HAP belongs to a group of proteins involved in histone tail modifications although some also bind methylated DNA. HAP loss of function promotes epigenomic modifications in the tomato genome reflected in numerous differentially methylated cytosines and causes transcriptomic changes in hap mutant plants. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that HAP links epigenome remodelling with multicellular glandular trichome development and reveal that HAP is a valuable genomic tool for pest resistance in tomato breeding.

AB  - Simple Summary Genetic selection increased sow productivity over the last decades, but also increased sow mortality. The impact of mortality includes financial losses, affects labor morale, and raises ethical and animal-welfare concerns. Despite the impact of mortality, the literature is still scarce regarding risk factors for post-mortem findings and bacterial agents involved. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the cause and risk factors related to post-mortem findings in sow death by performing post-mortem examinations, bacteriological investigations, and evaluations of individual sow records. Spontaneous death occurred mainly in the peripartum period. Deaths in the peripartum period were associated with heart failures, genitourinary disorders, and prolapses. Euthanized sows had more locomotor disorders. Sow mortality had a multifactorial etiology including infectious and non-infectious agents; in 75% of the deaths, lesions affecting more than one system were observed. Infections were polymicrobial. The high index of secondary lesions such as gastric ulcers, cystitis, locomotor disorders, and lung pleurisy raise concerns about sow welfare. This study can be used to identify females with a higher risk of injuries and to guide management practices to reduce sow death and increase sow welfare in breeding herds. The present study was conducted to investigate the risk factors for post-mortem findings and causes of sow mortality. A post-mortem examination and microbiological investigation were conducted on 123 sows from a breeding herd with 15,000 dams. The mortality of spontaneous death in sows occurred mostly in the peripartum period (53%; p < 0.05). The spontaneous deaths were associated with heart failures, hemorrhagic and perforating gastric ulcers, and liver torsion, while in the euthanized sows, the post-mortem findings were associated with locomotor disorders. A higher body condition score (BCS >= 3.5) increased (p < 0.05) heart failure on the post-mortem examination. The excessive use of manual obstetric interventions increased sow deaths resulting from cervix/uterus ruptures and increased the odds of death (p < 0.05) due to metritis. Sow mortality had a multifactorial etiology. Infections were polymicrobial. The main microbial agents identified from a septic lesion in locomotor, genitourinary, and respiratory systems were Trueperella pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, respectively. In conclusion, sow mortality involved multiple risk factors and several bacterial agents. These results indicate that better management practices can reduce sow mortality in swine production and increase sow welfare.

AB  - Background: Anacyclus pyrethrum (l.) DC has potential value in treating Parkinson's disease (PD)-mild cognitive impairment (MCI), manifesting as impaired memory, attention, executive function, and language. However, the specific targets and modes of action of A. pyrethrum remain unclear. Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the active components of A. pyrethrum and examine their effectiveness in treating a mouse model of PD-MCI. Methods: We generated ethanol extracts of A. pyrethrum root (EEAP) and identified its active components and related targets using UHPLC-MS/MS and network pharmacology.The PD-MCI model was induced via intraperitoneal administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP). After following continuous administration of EEAP,Altered learning or memory, as well as anxiety, were tested using the morris water maze, eight-arm radial arm maze (RAM), and open-field test,elevated plus-maze. Brain histopathology and ultrastructural changes were examined using brightfield microscopy, and electron microscopy, respectively. Furthermore, protein expression was assessed using western blotting.Stool samples were used for metabolomics analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS and for 16S rDNA sequencing to determine the compositional changes of the gut microbiota.We conducted a short-chain fatty acid targeted metabolomics experiment to study their role in the gut-brain axis in PD-MCI. Results: Using UPLC-MS-MS, 126 compounds were identified from A. pyrethrum samples.After searching the databases and literature reports, 31 active components and 544 drug-disease targets were screened. Biological processes and molecular functions, such as energy channels, cell signaling, and metabolism, were discovered through GO analysis. The water maze experiment showed that the average swimming distance and escape latency of mice in EEAP groups decreased. The eight-arm maze experiment showed that model had a much higher number of errors related to working memory than the control mice. In the open field experiment, compared with the control group, the mice in the EEAP group exhibited an increase in the average movement speed and total movement distance, along with a decrease in the residence time.In the elevated plus maze, the control had less anxiety than the Model. Donepezil/Levodopa(D/l) mitigated anxiety-like behavior, and EEAP (100-400 mg/kg) showed a dose-dependent increase in open-arm metrics, suggesting it may ease anxiety in mice.Hippocampal tissue of mice treated with different doses of EEAP showed intact cellular layers and the hematoxylin-eosin-stained cones were slightly better;cells were arranged neatly; their morphology was normal, and were distributed uniformly. Electron microscopy revealed that the nuclear membrane, chromatin, and nucleoli were clearly demarcated in the hippocampus of mice treated with different doses of EEAP, contrary to that in the model group. In brain extracts of the EEAP group, lighter thinner bands for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and A beta were observed compared to those in the model group. In model mice, APP and A beta protein expression was higher than in the blank group, as shown by stronger bands. In EEAP-treated mice, the bands were weaker, indicating reduced expression. In the model group had lower Bcl-2 and higher Bax levels. EEAP treatment increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax expression.Compared to the control group, the model showed substantially low glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px),superoxide dismutase(SOD),catalase (CAT)activity (p < 0.05),much higher (p < 0.
   05) in the EEAP-H group than that in the model. EEAP intervention significantly modulated the fecal metabolic profile of PD-MCI mice. The abundance of steroid and lipid metabolites, including linoleylethanolamine, was markedly altered in the model group compared to the control group, with EEAP treatment reversing several of these abnormalities. PLS-DA and OPLS-DA revealed significant separation between groups (Q2= 0.542, p < 0.01), confirming a dose-dependent effect. Random forest analysis identified 15 key metabolic markers, such as dose-dependent changes in d-glutamine and hydrocodone. Metabolic pathway analysis demonstrated significant enrichment in phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis pathways (p < 0.05). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved an AUC approaching 1, indicating substantial differences in metabolite profiles. EEAP intervention significantly influenced the composition and functional profile of the intestinal microbiota. The Venn diagram illustrates that each group shared 342 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with the EEAP 400 group exhibiting a distinct Bacteroidetes proportion. LEfSe analysis identified g_Prevotella as the characteristic bacterium in the control group, c_Epsilonproteobacteria in the model group, and g_Adlercreutzia in the EEAP 100 group. The Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) index was highest in the EEAP 100 group, and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)/Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) revealed significant differences in microbial community structure. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis indicated that acetic acid was the predominant metabolite, while EEAP dose-dependently regulated propionic acid and isovaleric acid levels (VIP > 1, p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that EEAP exerts its regulatory effects by reshaping the structure and metabolic functions of the gut microbiota. Conclusion: EEAP holds great promise as a potential therapeutic agent for PD-MCI, exerting its effects through multiple mechanisms, including regulating protein expression, modulating the fecal metabolic profile, and reshaping the gut microbiota and its metabolites.

AB  - Simple Summary: The tau protein normally functions to maintain the stability of microtubules, the cellular cytoskeleton that provides structure and shape to eukaryotic cells. Tau protein malfunction is a core feature of a group of neurodegenerative diseases labeled 'tauopathies' that include, among others, Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). In these disorders, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau is accumulated in intraneuronal tangles, disturbing normal cellular function and acting as the basis of neurofibrillary degeneration and dementia. FTDP-17 is indeed a form of frontotemporal dementia or frontotemporal degeneration characterized by a loss of nerve cells in areas of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes. Over time, this cell loss affects personality, behavior, language, and movement. Valid animal models are vital to enhance our understanding of molecular disease mechanisms and as preclinical tools to identify novel treatment targets and to screen the efficacy of novel drug candidates or other therapeutic approaches. We report the validity of two genetically modified mouse models that express a mutated form of human tau protein associated with FTDP-17. With aging, both lines developed progressively worsening tau-related pathology, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes reminiscent of the symptom profile of FTDP-17 patients. Background: The Tau58/2 and Tau58/4 mouse lines expressing 0N4R tau with a P301S mutation mimic aspects of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). In a side-by-side comparison, we report the age-dependent development of cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits in comparison with the spatial-temporal evolution of cellular tau pathology in both models. Methods: We applied the SHIRPA primary screen and specific neuromotor, behavioral, and cognitive paradigms. The spatiotemporal development of tau pathology was investigated immunohistochemically. Levels of sarkosyl-insoluble paired helical filaments were determined via a MesoScale Discovery biomarker assay. Results: Neuromotor impairments developed from age 3 months in both models. On electron microscopy, spinal cord neurofibrillary pathology was visible in mice aged 3 months; however, AT8 immunoreactivity was not yet observed in Tau58/4 mice. Behavioral abnormalities and memory deficits occurred at a later stage (>9 months) when tau pathology was fully disseminated throughout the brain. Spatiotemporally, tau pathology spread from the spinal cord via the midbrain to the frontal cortex, while the hippocampus was relatively spared, thus explaining the late onset of cognitive deficits. Conclusions: Our findings indicate the face and construct validity of both Tau58 models, which may provide new, valuable insights into the pathologic effects of tau species in vivo and may consequently facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets to delay or halt neurodegenerative processes occurring in tauopathies.

AB  - Brain glucose hypometabolism and neuroinflammation are early pathogenic manifestations in neurological disorders. Neuroinflammation may also disrupt leptin signaling, an adipokine that centrally regulates appetite and energy balance by acting on the hypothalamus and exerting neuroprotection in the hippocampus. The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is a non-obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) animal model used to investigate diabetes-associated molecular mechanisms without obesity jeopardizing effects. Wistar and GK rats received the maintenance adult rodent diet. Also, an additional control group of Wistar rats received a high-fat and high-sugar diet (HFHS) provided by free consumption of condensed milk. All diets and water were provided ad libitum for eight weeks. Brain glucose uptake was evaluated by 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-D-glucose under basal (saline administration) or stimulated (CL316,243, a selective 83-AR agonist) conditions. The animals were fasted for 10- 12 h, anesthetized, and euthanized. The brain was quickly dissected, and the hippocampal area was sectioned and stored at -80 & DEG;C in different tubes for protein and RNA analyses on the same animal. GK rats exhibited attenuated brain glucose uptake compared to Wistar animals and the HFHS group under basal conditions. Also, the hippocampus of GK rats displayed upregulated leptin receptor, IL-18, and IL-6 gene expression and IL-18 and the subunit of the transcription factor NF-kB (p-p65) protein expression. No significant alterations were detected in the hippocampus of HFHS rats. Our data indicated that a genetic predisposition to T2DM has significant brain deteriorating features, including brain glucose hypometabolism, neuroinflamma-tion, and leptin signaling disruption in the hippocampal area.

AB  - The high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD) is a common diet in westernized societies, which worsens disturbances in gut microbiota and bile acid (BA) metabolism. Herein, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of the water extract of Lycium barbarum fruits (LBE) on gut microbiota and BA metabolism in mice with HFFD-induced neuroinflammation. The results showed that supplementation of LBE for 14 weeks remarkably ameliorated weight gain and insulin resistance and suppressed microglial activation and neural neuroinflammation induced by HFFD. The results of Morris water maze and Y-maze tests demonstrated that LBE attenuated HFFD-induced cognitive impairment. Moreover, LBE elevated hepatic BA biosynthesis and excretion of BAs and increased elimination of BAs via the feces. Notably, LBE supplementation resulted in the enrichment of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in the cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, the 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that LBE could modulate the structure of gut microbiota, and in the meantime decrease the relative abundance of Clostridium_XlVa, which is associated with BA homeostasis. Additionally, LBE exerted neuroprotective effects involving the increment of Lactococcus, known as a potentially beneficial bacterium. These results demonstrated that LBE could ameliorate neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in HFFD-induced mice through the gut-liver-brain axis, which might be due to the regulation of BA homeostasis and gut microbiota in mice.
   Water extract of Goji berries ameliorated neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in HFFD-induced mice, which might be due to the regulation of bile acids (BAs) homeostasis and gut microbiota.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a common endocrine-disrupting chemical, is found in a wide range of home plastics. Early-life BPA exposure has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the link between neuroinflammation, pyroptosis, and the development of psychiatric disorders is rarely studied. The current study attempted to investigate the toxic effect of BPA on inflammatory and microglial activation markers, as well as behavioral responses, in the brains of male rats in a dose- and age-dependent manner. Early BPA exposure began on postnatal day (PND) 18 at dosages of 50 and 125 mg/kg/day. We started with a battery of behavioral activities, including open field, elevated plus- and Y-maze tests, performed on young PND 60 rats and adult PND 95 rats. BPA causes anxiogenic-related behaviors, as well as cognitive and memory deficits. The in vivo and in silico analyses revealed for the first time that BPA is a substantial activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, -2, -12, cyclooxygenase-2, and the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, with higher beclin-1 and LC3B levels in BPA rats' PFC and hippocampus. Furthermore, BPA increased the co-localization of caspase-1 immunoreactive neurons, as well as unique neurodegenerative histopathological hallmarks. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and microglial activation are involved with changes in the brain after postnatal BPA exposure and that these alterations may be linked to the development of psychiatric conditions later in life. Collectively, our findings indicate that BPA triggers anxiety-like behaviors and pyroptotic death of nerve cells via the NF-kappa B/IL-1 beta/NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway.

AB  - Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and muscle development. Previous research identified miR-22-3p as being differentially regulated during muscle hypertrophy, and in vitro experiments found that antagomir-22-3p enhanced satellite cell proliferation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo vascular injection of antagomir-22-3p into the lateral saphenous vein and its effect on miRNA and histone deacetylase (HDAC) family mRNA expression in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) lambs. Methods: Pregnant ewes (n = 18) carrying twins were fed either 100% of NRC (CON) or were nutrient-restricted to 60% NRC (NR) from gestational d 86 until parturition. On d 12 of age, NR lambs (n = 8) were randomly selected and given a systemic injection of antagomir-22-3p (440 mu g/lamb) into the lateral saphenous vein of the right leg (NR-ANT22) for three consecutive days. CON lambs (n = 8) were also randomly selected and received a sham injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into the lateral saphenous vein of the right leg (CON-SHAM). Blood samples were collected from each lamb weekly to monitor circulating miR-22-3p expression. Muscle samples were collected 24 days post-injection to assess miR-22-3p levels and mRNA expression of potential miRNA targets. Results and discussion: Cell-free circulating miR-22-3p expression was more downregulated (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22 lambs compared to that in CON-SHAM on d 14 after injection. On d 21 after injection, miR-22-3p expression in plasma tended to be more downregulated (P = 0.08) in NR-ANT22 compared to CON-SHAM. Lamb body weight and muscle weights at harvest were similar between the NR-ANT and CON- SHAM treatment groups. In the semitendinosus (ST) muscle, miR-22-3p expression was more downregulated (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22_R ST (treated) lambs compared to that in NR-ANT22_L ST (non-treated) and CON-SHAM ST. In the heart and semimembranosus (SM) muscles, the expression of miR-22-3p was more downregulated (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22 compared to that in CON-SHAM. In the gastrocnemius muscle, miR-22-3p expression remained unchanged (P > 0.05). The number of types I, IIa, and IIax muscle fibers were greater (P < 0.05) in NR-ANT22 lambs than those in CON-SHAM, whereas the number of type IIx fibers was greater (P < 0.05) in CON-SHAM lambs. NR-ANT22 treatment appears to promote a shift toward more oxidative muscle fiber metabolism. The systemic injection of antagomir-22-3p downregulated miR-22-3p expression in circulation and muscle tissues, which, in turn, altered the expression of HDAC/SIRT genes involved in muscle fiber type conversion and hypertrophy.

AB  - Construction materials and techniques have witnessed major advancements due to the application of digital tools in the design and fabrication processes, leading to a wide array of possibilities, especially in additive digital manufacturing tools and 3D printing techniques, scales, and materials. However, possibilities carry responsibilities with them and raise the question of the sustainability of 3D printing applications in the built environment in terms of material consumption and construction processes: how should one use digital design and 3D printing to achieve minimum material use, minimum production processes, and optimized application in the built environment? In this work, we propose an optimized formal design of "Biodigital Barcelona Clay Bricks" to achieve sustainability in the use of materials. These were achieved by using a bottom-up methodology of biolearning to extract the formal grammar of the bricks that is suitable for their various applications in the built environment as building units, thereby realizing the concept of formal physiology, as well as employing the concept of fractality or pixilation by using 3D printing to create the bricks as building units on an architectural scale. This enables the adoption of this method as an alternative construction procedure instead of conventional clay brick and full-scale 3D printing of architecture on a wider and more democratic scale, avoiding the high costs of 3D printing machines and lengthy processes of the one-step, 3D-printed, full-scale architecture, while also guaranteeing minimum material consumption and maximum forma-function coherency. The "Biodigital Barcelona Clay Bricks" were developed using Rhinoceros 3D and Grasshopper 3D + Plugins (Anemone and Kangaroo) and were 3D printed in clay.

AB  - Background: Adult-born neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus play a role in specific forms of learning, and disturbed neurogenesis seems to contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depression. Neuroinflammation inhibits adult neurogenesis, but the effect of peripheral inflammation on this form of neuroplasticity is ambiguous. Objective: Our aim was to investigate the influence of acute and chronic experimental arthritis on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and to elucidate putative regulatory mechanisms. Methods: Arthritis was triggered by subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paws of adult male mice. The animals were killed either seven days (acute inflammation) or 21 days (chronic inflammation) after the CFA injection. Behavioral tests were used to demonstrate arthritis-related hypersensitivity to painful stimuli. We used in vivo bioluminescence imaging to verify local inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response was assessed by complete blood cell counts and by measurement of the cytokine/chemokine concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, KC and MIP-2 in the inflamed hind limbs, peripheral blood and hippocampus to characterize the inflammatory responses in the periphery and in the brain. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, the total number of newborn neurons was determined with quantitative immunohistochemistry visualizing BrdU- and doublecortin-positive cells. Microglial activation in the dentate gyrus was determined by quantifying the density of Iba1- and CD68-positive cells. Results: Both acute and chronic arthritis resulted in paw edema, mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. We found phagocytic infiltration and increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-6, KC and MIP-2 in the inflamed hind paws. Circulating neutrophil granulocytes and IL-6 levels increased in the blood solely during the acute phase. In the dentate gyrus, chronic arthritis reduced the number of doublecortin-positive cells, and we found increased density of CD68-positive macrophages/microglia in both the acute and chronic phases. Cytokine levels, however, were not altered in the hippocampus. Conclusions: Our data suggest that acute peripheral inflammation initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular changes that eventually leads to reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which was detectable only in the chronic inflammatory phase.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced post-traumatic headache (PTH) is a pressing public health concern and leading cause of disability worldwide. Although PTH is often accompanied by neurological disorders, the exact underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Identifying potential biomarkers may prompt the diagnosis and development of effective treatments for mTBI-induced PTH. In this study, a mouse model of mTBI-induced PTH was established to investigate its effects on cerebral structure and function during short-term recovery. Results indicated that mice with mTBI-induced PTH exhibited balance deficits during the early post-injury stage. Metabolic kinetics revealed that variations in neurotransmitters were most prominent in the cerebellum, temporal lobe/cortex, and hippocampal regions during the early stages of PTH. Additionally, variations in brain functional activities and connectivity were further detected in the early stage of PTH, particularly in the cerebellum and temporal cortex, suggesting that these regions play central roles in the mechanism underlying PTH. Moreover, our results suggested that GABA and glutamate may serve as potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for PTH. Future studies should explore the specific neural circuits involved in the regulation of PTH by the cerebellum and temporal cortex, with these two regions potentially utilized as targets for non-invasive stimulation in future clinical treatment.

AB  - Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy frequently report memory impairment, which significantly impacts their quality of life. Several studies have demonstrated an association between temporal lobe epilepsy and memory dysfunction, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates whether a penicillininduced temporal lobe seizure model in non-human primates (NHPs) replicates the recognition deficits observed in epileptic patients. We recorded hippocampal activity in three NHPs during a visual paired comparison (VPC) task before and during seizures. The penicillin model induced multiple spontaneous, selfterminating temporal lobe seizures over 4-6 h. Seizures were induced after VPC training, and tasks were performed using an eye-tracking system while the animals were seated with head restraint. During the familiarization phase, novel objects were presented and later paired with a new object after a randomized delay (10 or 60 s). While task success rates did not differ between baseline and seizure conditions, we observed prolonged encoding durations. Further studies are needed to elucidate these findings, but this NHP model of temporal lobe epilepsy may provide critical insights into the relationship between epileptic activity and cognitive impairment.

AB  - Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) has a long history as a classical T-cell dependent (TD) antigen. Due to its cost-effectiveness, easy accessibility, and ability to elicit a robust antibody immune response, SRBC continues to be widely used in studies related with humoral immunity modulation, vaccine development, and immunoactivity/immunotoxicity testing of bioactive agents. However, detecting the relative affinity levels of SRBC-specific antibodies in SRBC-immunized animal models remains challenging. Using flow cytometry, we established a detection system capable of quickly and accurately assessing the SRBC-specific antibody relative affinity levels in humoral samples (e.g., serum, tissue fluid) of SRBC-immunized mouse models. We further validated this method using affinity maturation-deficient mice, demonstrating that this method can distinguish affinity levels of the antibodies from different samples. This approach is simple and efficient, providing an accurate and effective technological solution for research on mechanisms of humoral immunity, antibody affinity maturation, vaccine response, and immunoactivity/immunotoxicity testing.

AB  - Activation of NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway can promote downstream cytokine and proinflammatory cytokines release, and inflammation induced by excess nutrients leads to renal metabolic injury. How the NLRs influence metabolic progress and then lead to the renal injury remains poorly investigated. Compared with rodents, minipigs are more similar to humans and are more ideal animal models for human disease research. In this study, we established a diabetic minipig model through a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Blood biological markers and renal pathological markers, expression of NLRP subfamily members (NLRP1 and NLRP3) and their downstream cytokines (precursors of IL-1 beta and IL-18 and mature forms of IL-1 beta and IL-18), expression of NLRC subfamily members (NLRC1, NLRC2, and NLRC5) and their downstream nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway molecules (IKK beta, I kappa B alpha, and NF-kappa B p65), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) were systematically evaluated. The expression of NLRP3 and its downstream cytokine signaling molecules, the precursors of IL-1 beta and IL-18, and the mature forms of IL-1 beta and IL-18 was significantly upregulated. The expression levels of NLRC1, NLRC2, and NLRC5 and activation of the downstream NF-kappa B pathway molecules phospho-IKK beta, phospho-I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa B p65, and phospho-NF-kappa B p65 were significantly increased. The TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in diabetic pig kidneys. The TGF-beta/Smad signaling molecules, TGF-beta and P-SMAD2/3, were also increased. These results suggested that the metabolic inflammation activated by NLRs might play an important role in diabetic renal injuries.

AB  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique which is increasingly used for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer?s Disease (AD). Although rTMS has been shown to modify Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and oxidative stress levels in many neurological and psychiatric diseases, there is still no study evaluating the relationship between memory performance, BDNF, oxidative stress, and resting brain connectivity following rTMS in Alzheimer?s patients. Furthermore, there are increasing clinical data showing that the stimulation of strategic brain regions may lead to more robust improvements in memory functions compared to conventional rTMS. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the possible disease-modifying effects of rTMS on the lateral parietal cortex in AD patients who have the highest connectivity with the hippocampus. To fill the mentioned research gaps, we have evaluated the relationships between resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), cognitive scores, blood BDNF levels, and total oxidative/antioxidant status to explain the therapeutic and potential disease-modifying effects of rTMS which has been applied at 20 Hz frequencies for two weeks. Our results showed significantly increased visual recognition memory functions and clock drawing test scores which were associated with elevated peripheral BDNF levels, and decreased oxidant status after two weeks of left lateral parietal TMS stimulation. Clinically our findings suggest that the left parietal region targeted rTMS application leads to significant improvement in familiarity-based cognition associated with the network connections between the left parietal region and the hippocampus.

AB  - Bats are often associated with several zoonotic diseases, including helminth infections. Despite their potential detrimental effects on both human and bat populations, information on helminth parasites of Philippine bats remains scarce. Here, we identify gastrointestinal helminths parasitizing bats collected from a cave complex in Cavinti, Laguna Province, Philippines, determine their prevalence (P) and mean intensity (MI), and investigate relationship of helminth prevalence and intensity with bat host characteristics including sex, diet, age, and roosting habit. We isolated 581 individuals of helminths representing six taxa (three trematodes, two nematodes, one cestode) from the gastrointestinal tract of sampled bats. Helminths were observed in 82 out of 172 bats captured (P = 47.67%), with Miniopteruspaululus having the highest infection rate (P = 91.3%) and highest MI (18 +/- 4.5/infected bat). Helminths parasitizing endemic bat species from the Philippines, such as Rhinolophus rufus, Rhinolophus inops, Hipposideros pygmaeus, and Ptenochirus jagori were reported here for the first time. We provide new host records for other helminth species and report the presence of two parasites, Plagiorchis sp. and Toxocara sp., known for their zoonotic potential. These data will contribute to efforts in identifying parasites and diseases harbored by bats in the country and develop additional conservation measures for bats.

AB  - The maintenance of epithelial homeostasis is essential for preserving tissue architecture and function, and the transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ are central to this regulatory network. Although the Hippo-YAP/ TAZ-TEAD axis is known to govern epithelial integrity, it remains unclear to what extent Hippo-controlled YAP/ TAZ activity overlaps with, or diverges from, YAP/TAZ-TEAD-dependent transcriptional programs in maintaining epithelial homeostasis. Here, we address this question by employing two complementary mouse models: "SuperHippo," which suppresses YAP/TAZ activity through enhanced Hippo pathway engagement, and "TEADi," which selectively disrupts YAP/TAZ-TEAD interactions. Our results revealed that while both models led to increased epithelial thickness in skin epithelial, SuperHippo mice exhibited pronounced epithelial impairment in oral mucosa, and markedly delayed wound healing. In contrast, TEADi mice displayed tissue-specific phenotypes with minimal disruption to oral epithelium integrity or wound repair. These findings indicate that Hippomediated YAP/TAZ regulation may extend beyond TEAD-dependent transcription. Our work clarifies the distinct contributions of Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling and YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction to epithelial maintenance and provides a basis for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting YAP/TAZ in epithelial disorders.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex condition that affects an individual's well-being and quality of life. While there are current treatment options like medication and surgery, an increasing number of patients experience difficult-to-treat rhinosinusitis (DTRS). To address this challenge, a highly efficient intelligent nanoplatform (ALCe6 NPs) has been developed, which is formed by loading chlorin e6 (Ce6) onto nanoliposomes composed of cholesterol modified with l-arginine and soybean phospholipids. Under near-infrared (NIR) light stimulation, Ce6 is efficiently activated to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the controlled release of nitric oxide (NO). This synergistic effect of ROS generated from photodynamic therapy (PDT) and NO release enables the dispersion of bacterial biofilms and the effective eradication of drug-resistant bacteria. Genome analysis of the combined antibacterial action of ALCe6 NPs reveals changes in genes related to cellular metabolism, transcription processes, and bacterial resistance. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ALCe6 NPs in treating DTRS caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, a rat model is constructed to monitor the treatment process and assess the outcomes. With its significant advantages, ALCe6 NPs show promising potential as a biomedical tool to combat drug-resistant bacterial infections in vivo, offering hope for managing DTRS and improving patient outcomes.

AB  - The ectopic expression of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 21 (USP21) is common in different types of cancer. However, its relationship with radio-sensitivity in cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to uncover the effect of USP21 on CC radio-resistance and its underlying mechanism. Our results showed that the expression of USP21 was markedly increased in CC tissues of radio-resistant patients and CC cells treated with radiation. Besides, knockdown of USP21 restrained the survival fractions, and facilitated apoptosis of CC cells in the absence or presence of radiation. Additionally, USP21 in combination with FOXM1 regulated the stability and ubiquitination of FOXM1. However, FOXM1 reversed the effects of USP21 knockdown on the radio-resistance of CC cells. Furthermore, FOXM1 knockdown activated the Hippo pathway by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), and FOXM1 knockdown attenuated the radio-resistance of CC cells via inhibiting the Hippo-YAP1 pathway. USP21 activated the Hippo pathway by mediating FOXM1. Knockdown of USP21 enhanced the radio-sensitivity of CC cells in vivo. In summary, USP21 contributed to the radio-resistance of CC cells via FOXM1/Hippo signaling, and may serve as a promising target for radio-sensitizers in the radiotherapy of CC.

AB  - Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (Streptococcus zooepidemicus, SEZ) is one of the most common pathogens causing streptococcal disease in pigs in China and has been identified as a zoonotic pathogen, and thus poses great threat to the health of humans and pigs. The M-like protein (SzM) is the primary virulence factor of SEZ. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting SzM have been demonstrated to provide effective protection against SEZ infection, but their preparation is cumbersome. Here, we designed mini-binders targeting SzM from scratch based on the RFdiffusion approach. Four potential binders were obtained in a short period of time, among which binder 3 showed the highest binding affinity to SzM protein. In vitro adhesion inhibition analysis demonstrated that binder 3 significantly suppressed the adhesion of SEZ to fibrinogen and HEp-2 cells. In vivo experiments showed that binder 3 treatment improved the survival rate (80 %) of mice infected with a 100-fold lethal dose of SEZ and significantly reduced the organ bacterial load. Our study provides new insights into the rapid development of stable anti-SEZ agents, which are expected to be ideal alternatives to mAbs.

AB  - Simple Summary: In the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, Kangaroo Island, South Australia, experienced catastrophic bushfires that burnt approximately half the island, with an estimated 80% of the koala population lost. During and after the fires, koalas presented to a designated triage facility over a span of 10 weeks, with 50.2% during the first 14 days of the bushfire response (304 records available). Burns were observed in 67.4% of koalas, with the majority (60.9%) classified as superficial burns, primarily affecting the limbs and face. Poor body condition was recorded in 74.6% of burnt koalas and dehydration in 77.1%. Negative final outcomes (death or euthanasia, either at triage or at a later date) occurred in 45.6% of koalas and were significantly associated with higher mean burn score, maximum burn severity, number of body regions burnt, poor body condition score, and dehydration severity. The findings of this retrospective study may assist clinicians in the field with decision making when triaging koalas in future fire rescue efforts.In the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, Kangaroo Island, South Australia, experienced catastrophic bushfires that burnt approximately half the island, with an estimated 80% of the koala population lost.

AB  - Oil tea (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is a high-quality woody oil crop unique to China and has extremely high economic value and ecological benefits. One problem in oil tea production and research is the worldwide confusion regarding oil tea cultivar nomenclature. The purpose of this study was to automatic recognize some oil tea cultivars using bilinear attention network. For this purpose, we explored this possibility utilizing the bilinear attention network for five common China cultivars Ganshi 83-4, Changlin 53, Changlin 3, Ganshi 84-8, and Gan 447. We adopted the bilinear EfficientNet-B0 network and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to build BA-EfficientNet model being able to automatically and accurately recognize oil tea cultivars. In addition, the InceptionV3, VGG16, and ResNet50 algorithms were compared with the proposed BA-EfficientNet. The comparative test results show that BA-EfficientNet can accurately recognize oil tea cultivars in the test set, with overall accuracy and kappa coefficients reaching 91.59% and 0.89, respectively. Compared with algorithms such as InceptionV3, VGG16, and ResNet50, the BA-EfficientNet algorithm has obvious advantages in most evaluation indicators used in the experiment. In addition, the ablation experiments were designed to quantitatively evaluate the specific effects of bilinear networks and CBAM modules on oil tea cultivar recognition results. The results demonstrate that BA-EfficientNet is useful for solving the problem of recognizing oil tea cultivars under natural conditions. This paper attempts to explore new thinking for the application of deep learning methods in the field of oil tea cultivar recognition under natural conditions.

TI  - Salivary proteins potentially derived from horizontal gene transfer are critical for salivary sheath formation and other feeding processes

AB  - Herbivorous insects employ an array of salivary proteins to aid feeding. However, the mechanisms behind the recruitment and evolution of these genes to mediate plant-insect interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we report a potential horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event from bacteria to an ancestral bug of Eutrichophora. The acquired genes subsequently underwent duplications and evolved through co-option. We annotated them as horizontal-transferred, Eutrichophora-specific salivary protein (HESPs) according to their origin and function. In Riptortus pedestris (Coreoidea), all nine HESPs are secreted into plants during feeding. The RpHESP4 to RpHESP8 are recently duplicated and found to be indispensable for salivary sheath formation. Silencing of RpHESP4-8 increases the difficulty of R. pedestris in probing the soybean, and the treated insects display a decreased survivability. Although silencing the other RpHESPs does not affect the salivary sheath formation, negative effects are also observed. In Pyrrhocoris apterus (Pyrrhocoroidea), five out of six PaHESPs are secretory salivary proteins, with PaHESP3 being critical for insect survival. The PaHESP5, while important for insects, no longer functions as a salivary protein. Our results provide insight into the potential origin of insect saliva and shed light on the evolution of salivary proteins.
   An evolutional and functional study on bug saliva suggests that horizontally transferred genes provide a selective advantage to recipient insects by enhancing their feeding abilities.

AB  - The volatile-mediated interplay between stressed and non-stressed plants has been described in many studies involving both biotic and abiotic stresses as a one-way channel. However, very little is known about the molecular basis and mechanisms by which volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediate plant communication between drought-stressed 'emitter' plants and non-stressed 'receiver' neighbours for the defence against impending stress challenges. Aiming to address this in grapevine, this study investigated the effect of two-way VOC exchange between stressed and non-stressed Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz during drought and recovery using four treatments: isolated well-watered (WW) vines, isolated drought-stressed (DS) vines, and co-located DS 'emitter' and WW 'receiver' vines in a growth room. The results obtained from solid-phase microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed a synchronised decline in a-pinene concentration in the co-located treatment vines and higher isoprene levels in the DS emitters compared to the isolated DS vines. Targeted gene expression analysis further identified the over-expression of a key gene, allene oxide synthase (AOS), in the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis pathway during peak drought in the DS emitter. Transcript expression of chorismate synthase (CHORS) and a-pinene synthase (VvPNaPin1) showed similar trends in the DS emitter. The results suggest that isoprene and a-pinene may be interplant signalling molecules used by grapevine during drought. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a bi-directional interaction in grapevine between the emitters and receivers under drought stress mediated by the JA and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways.

AB  - Sleep deprivation has profound influence on several aspects of health and disease. Mitochondria dysfunction has been implicated to play an essential role in the neuronal cellular damage induced by sleep deprivation, but little is known about how neuronal mitochondrial ultrastructure is affected under sleep deprivation. In this report, we utilized electron cryo-tomography to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3-D) mitochondrial structure and extracted morphometric parameters to quantitatively characterize its reorganizations. Isolated mitochondria from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats after 72 h of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) were reconstructed and analyzed. Statistical analysis of six morphometric parameters specific to the mitochondrial inner membrane topology revealed identical pattern of changes in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex but with higher significance levels in the hippocampus. The structural differences were indistinguishable by conventional phenotypic methods based on two-dimensional electron microscopy images or 3-D electron tomography reconstructions. Furthermore, to correlate structure alterations with mitochondrial functions, high-resolution respirometry was employed to investigate the effects of PSD on mitochondrial respiration, which showed that PSD significantly suppressed the mitochondrial respiratory capacity of the hippocampus, whereas the isolated mitochondria from the cerebral cortex were less affected. These results demonstrate the capability of the morphometric parameters for quantifying complex structural reorganizations and suggest a correlation between PSD and inner membrane architecture/respiratory functions of the brain mitochondria with variable effects in different brain regions.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) can negatively impact health, increasing the risk of stress-related disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Importantly, PTSD disproportionately affects women, emphasizing the critical need to explore how sex differences influence the genetic and metabolic neurobiological pathways underlying trauma-related behaviors. This study uses the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm to model ELS and investigate its sex-specific effects on fear memory formation. Employing innovative unsupervised behavioral classification, the current study reveals distinct behavioral patterns associated with fear acquisition and retrieval in male and female mice following ELS. Females exposed to LBN display heightened active fear responses, contrasting with males. Furthermore, the study examined the crucial link between behavioral regulation and cellular metabolism in key brain regions involved in fear and stress processing. Sex-specific and stress-dependent alterations were observed in purine, pyrimidine, and glutamate metabolism within the basolateral amygdala, the dorsal hippocampus, and the ventral hippocampus. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex interplay between metabolic pathways, the neurobiological underpinnings of fear memory, and stress responses. Importantly, they emphasize the significance of considering sex-specific metabolic alterations when investigating stress-related disorders, opening potential avenues for the development of targeted interventions.

AB  - Susceptibility to pathogen infections and efficacy of vaccination highly depend on the immune status of the piglet. Here, we measured immunocytes in piglets from birth to weaning to elucidate how immunocyte populations change during development and are affected by weaning. Crossbred piglets were used. Suckling piglets were euthanized at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 or 35 days old (3 similar to 4 piglets at each time point). In addition, seven piglets were weaned at 21 days old, with four being euthanized at 28 days old and the remaining at 35 days old. Piglet carcasses were dissected, and blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleen were sampled. In total, seven antibodies were used to stain the immunocyte population. Dynamics of myeloid (CD3(-)SWC3(+)CD16(+)), natural killer (NK; CD3(-)SWC3(-)CD16(+)), killer T (CD3(+)CD8(+)), helper T (CD3(+)CD4(+)) and B (CD3(-)CD21(+)) cells were analyzed. Percentage of innate immunity cells such as myeloid cells declined (p < 0.05) from the first day after birth. In contrast, percentage of NK cells increased in piglets while they were still suckling. Killer T, helper T, and B cell populations increased around 2 similar to 3 weeks after birth. No significant differences in the populations of the evaluated cell types were observed between suckling and weaned piglets at least for 14 days post weaning.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the protective effects of N-(3-methoxybenzyl)-(9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatrienamide (M 18:3) on corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity. A neurotoxic model was established by subcutaneous injection of corticosterone (40 mg per kg bw) for 21 days. Depressive behaviors (the percentage of sucrose consumption, the immobility time in the forced swimming test, and the total distance in the open field test) were observed. The levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, the contents of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, and the numbers of positive cells of doublecortin and bromodeoxyuridine in the hippocampus were measured. The density of hippocampal neurons was calculated. The morphological changes of hippocampal neurons (the density of dendritic spines, the dendritic length, and the area and volume of dendritic cell bodies) were observed. The expression levels of synaptophysin, synapsin I, and postsynaptic density protein 95 were measured. Behavioral experiments showed that M 18:3 (5 and 25 mg per kg bw) could remarkably improve the depressive behaviors. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that M 18:3 could considerably reduce hippocampal neuroinflammation and increase hippocampal neurotrophy. Nissl staining showed that M 18:3 could remarkably improve the corticosterone-induced decrease in the hippocampal neuron density. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that M 18:3 could considerably promote hippocampal neurogenesis. Golgi staining showed that M 18:3 could remarkably improve the corticosterone-induced changes in the hippocampal dendritic structure. Western blotting showed that M 18:3 could considerably increase the expression levels of synaptic-structure-related proteins in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the protective effects of M 18:3 may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory, neurotrophic, and synaptic protection properties.

AB  - Water and its management have played a pivotal role in the evolution of organisms and civilizations, fulfilling essential roles in personal use, industry, irrigation, and drinking from ancient times to the present. This study seeks to evaluate groundwater quality for irrigation and drinking in the Northern Peloponnese region, specifically the wells of Loutraki and Schinos areas and the springs of the Gerania Mountains (Mts.), using geo-environmental indices and ionic ratios. For the first time, geo-environmental indices have been applied to a region where groundwater serves multiple purposes, addressing the challenge of understanding their dynamics to optimize their application in environmental science and groundwater pollution research. To achieve this, 68 groundwater samples from the study area were utilized, and a total of 25 geo-environmental indices were calculated to assess water quality. These indices examined: (i) drinking suitability (NPI, RI, PIG, WQI, and WPI), (ii) irrigation suitability (SAR, KR, %Na, PS, MAR, RSC, SSP, TH, PI, IWQI, and TDS), (iii) potentially toxic element (PTE) loadings (Cd, HEI, and HPI), and (iv) major hydrogeochemical processes, expressed as ionic ratios (Ca/Mg, Ca/SO4, Ca/Na, Cl/NO3, Cl/HCO3, and Si/NO3). Data processing involved descriptive statistics, hydrogeochemical bivariate plots, Spearman correlation coefficients, and multivariate statistical analyses, including factor analysis (FA) and R-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Results revealed that all groundwater samples (100%) from the Loutraki area and the Gerania Mts. were of good quality for both drinking and irrigation purposes. In contrast, groundwater from the Schinos area exhibited lower quality, with most samples (93.9%) considered suitable only for irrigation. The deterioration in the coastal aquifer of the Schinos area is attributed to elevated concentrations of Cl-, Na+, NO3-, As, and Cr resulting from salinization and relatively limited anthropogenic influences. The study highlights that relying on individual geo-environmental indices can yield misleading results due to their dependence on factors such as researcher expertise, methodological choices, and the indices' inherent limitations. Consequently, this research emphasizes the necessity of combining indices to enhance the reliability, accuracy, and robustness of groundwater quality assessments and hydrogeochemical evaluations. Last but not least, the findings demonstrate that calculating all available geo-environmental indices is unnecessary. Instead, selecting a subset of indices that either reflect the impact of specific elemental concentrations or can be effectively integrated with others is sufficient. This streamlined approach addresses challenges in optimizing geo-environmental index applications and contributes to improved groundwater resource management.

AB  - Transgenic CD47 overexpression is an encouraging approach to ameliorating xenograft rejection and alloresponses to pluripotent stem cells, and the efficacy correlates with the level of CD47 expression. However, CD47, upon ligation, also transmits signals leading to cell dysfunction or death, raising a concern that overexpressing CD47 could be harmful. Here, we unveiled an alternative source of cell surface CD47. We showed that extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, released from normal or tumor cells overexpressing CD47 (transgenic or native) can induce efficient CD47 cross-dressing on pig or human cells. Like the autogenous CD47, CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces is capable of interacting with SIRP alpha to inhibit phagocytosis. However, ligation of the autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 induced cell death. Thus, CD47 cross-dressing provides an alternative source of cell surface CD47 that may elicit its anti-phagocytic function without transmitting harmful signals to the cells. CD47 cross-dressing also suggests a previously unidentified mechanism for tumor-induced immunosuppression. Our findings should help to further optimize the CD47 transgenic approach that may improve outcomes by minimizing the harmful effects of CD47 overexpression.

AB  - Viral respiratory infections are an important public health concern due to their prevalence, transmissibility, and potential to cause serious disease. Disease severity is the product of several factors beyond the presence of the infectious agent, including specific host immune responses, host genetic makeup, and bacterial coinfections. To understand these interactions within natural infections, we designed a longitudinal cohort study actively surveilling respiratory viruses over the course of 19 months (2016 to 2018) in a diverse cohort in New York City. We integrated the molecular characterization of 800+ nasopharyngeal samples with clinical data from 104 participants. Transcriptomic data enabled the identification of respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal samples, the characterization of markers of immune response, the identification of signatures associated with symptom severity, individual viruses, and bacterial coinfections. Specific results include a rapid restoration of baseline conditions after infection, significant transcriptomic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, and qualitatively similar responses across different viruses. We created an interactive computational resource (Virome Data Explorer) to facilitate access to the data and visualization of analytical results.
   Viral respiratory infections are an important public health concern, due to their prevalence, transmissibility, and potential to cause serious disease. This study describes a rich dataset of host/pathogen data collected in New York City during 2 years of active sampling for endemic respiratory viruses, and uses it to characterize the transcriptomic effect of infections presenting with different symptomatology and etiology.

AB  - The alpaca population mostly consists of the Huacaya phenotype and is widely distributed in Southern Peru. This study aimed to estimate the genetic diversity and population structure of two Huacaya alpaca populations (Ajoyani and Quimsachata) using fourteen and twelve microsatellite markers for each population, respectively. A total of 168 alpaca biological samples were outsourced to Peruvian laboratories for DNA extraction and genotyping. For genetic diversity, observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He), polymorphism information content (PIC), and fixation indices values were estimated. An admixture analysis was performed for the population structure analysis. Different programs were used for these estimations. In total, 133 (Ajoyani) and 129 (Quimsachata) alleles were found, with a range of 4 to 17 by locus. The mean H-O, H-E, and PIC per marker for Ajoyani were 0.764 +/- 0.112, 0.771 +/- 0.1, and 0.736; for Quimsachata, they were 0.783 +/- 0.087, 0.773 +/- 0.095, and 0.738, respectively. The population structure showed no structure with K = 2. This study provides useful indicators for the creation of appropriate alpaca conservation programs.

AB  - Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) substantially influences the prognosis of liver transplant recipients. Although kynurenic acid (KYNA) has been associated with protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in various organs, the precise mechanisms underlying its protective role in HIRI are not well elucidated. In this study, a 70% mouse HIRI model and an in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation model were employed to examine the protective effects of KYNA on HIRI. In this study, we illustrate that KYNA influences the methylation status of the Hippo signalling pathway by enhancing the expression of the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO). Within this pathway, large tumour suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) is identified as a direct target of FTO. Moreover, the stability of LATS1 mRNA exhibits an inverse correlation with FTO levels and is modulated through its interaction with YTH N6-Methyladenosine RNA Binding Protein F2 (YTHDF2). The reduction in LATS1 expression facilitated Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear translocation, decreased hepatocyte apoptosis, and mitigated HIRI. Clinically, elevated levels of serum KYNA correlate with a diminished severity of liver injury post-transplantation. our work revealed that KYNA possesses significant clinical translational potential for the prevention of HIRI, and further exploration of its underlying mechanisms was conducted.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy affects millions of people worldwide, yet we still lack a successful treatment for all epileptic patients. Most of the available drugs modulate neuronal activity. Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the brain, may constitute alternative drug targets. A robust expansion of astrocytic cell bodies and processes occurs after seizures. Highly expressed in astrocytes, CD44 adhesion protein is upregulated during injury and is suggested to be one of the most important proteins associated with epilepsy. It connects the astrocytic cytoskeleton to hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix, influencing both structural and functional aspects of brain plasticity. Methods: Herein, we used transgenic mice with an astrocyte CD44 knockout to evaluate the impact of the hippocampal CD44 absence on the development of epileptogenesis and ultrastructural changes at the tripartite synapse. Results: We demonstrated that local, virally-induced CD44 deficiency in hippocampal astrocytes reduces reactive astrogliosis and decreases the progression of kainic acid-induced epileptogenesis. We also observed that CD44 deficiency resulted in structural changes evident in a higher dendritic spine number along with a lower percentage of astrocyte-synapse contacts, and decreased post-synaptic density size in the hippocampal molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Conclusions: Overall, our study indicates that CD44 signaling may be important for astrocytic coverage of synapses in the hippocampus and that alterations of astrocytes translate to functional changes in the pathology of epilepsy.

AB  - Cognitive decline and Alzheimer-like neuropathology are common manifestations of cadmium toxicity. Thanks to its antioxidant/anti-apoptotic features, dapagliflozin has demonstrated promising neuroprotective actions. However, its effect on cadmium-induced neurotoxicity is lacking. The present work aimed to examine whether dapagliflozin could protect rats from cadmium-evoked cognitive decline. In this study, the behavioral disturbances and hippocampal biomolecular alterations were studied after receiving dapagliflozin. Herein, cadmium-induced memory/learning decline was rescued in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition task, and Y-shaped maze by dapagliflozin. Meanwhile, the hippocampal histopathological abnormalities were mitigated. The molecular mechanisms revealed that dapagliflozin lowered hippocampal expression of p-tau and A beta 42 neurotoxic proteins while augmenting acetylcholine. The cognitive enhancement was triggered by hippocampal autophagy stimulation, as indicated by decreased SQSTM-1/p62 and Beclin 1 upregulation. Meanwhile, a decrease in p-mTOR/total mTOR and an increase in p-AMPK/total AMPK ratio were observed in response to dapagliflozin, reflecting AMPK/mTOR cascade stimulation. Dapagliflozin, on the other hand, dampened the pro-apoptotic processes in the hippocampus by downregulating Bax, upregulating Bcl-2, and inactivating GSK-3 beta. The hippocampal oxidative insult was mitigated by dapagliflozin as seen by lipid peroxide lowering, antioxidants augmentation, and SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. In conclusion, dapagliflozin's promising neuroprotection was triggered by its pro-autophagic, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties.

AB  - Thousands of coprolites have been collected from the Upper Miocene (Tortonian/Pannonian) sands of the Pecs-Danitzpuszta sand pit, one of the most important mixed Neogene vertebrate localities in Hungary. Although, the locality has been known for centuries, the coprolites have not been investigated in detail. We describe these fossils and explore their palaeoecological significance. Coprolites were examined with thin sections, X-ray powder diffraction and computed tomography. Their surface is mostly smooth, desiccation cracks were not observed. All coprolites mainly consist of apatite, indicating most probably a carnivorous diet. No evidence of herbivory has been found so far. The coprolites contain remains belonging to several groups: ostracod carapaces, bivalve shells, vertebrae from bony fishes, fish scales, as well as teeth. The CT scans show inhomogeneities in the matrix; however, in most cases they do not reliably indicate inclusions. The taphonomical features suggest rapid burial and most likely an aquatic origin. The spiral morphotype could be attributed to fishes with spiral intestinal valves. Teeth of reef-associated fish taxa indicate Badenian age for some specimens, though the coprolite assemblage might include older and younger specimens as well.

AB  - Background: In experimental and clinical studies of pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency spectrum approach has demonstrated its efficacy in determining the characteristics of pathological changes in the functioning of different cerebral structures, interconnections between them, and disturbances in the brain neurotransmitter systems. The main results have been obtained in frames of traditionally used so-called "classical" EEG frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Objective: This unified approach simplifies comparing data from different studies but loses the dynamic peculiarities of the effects because of their time-dependent transition through the borders of the "classical" bands. Methods: In this study on non-narcotized freely moving 5xFAD transgenic mice, a model of AD, chronically pretreated with a non-selective dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO), we analyze the transitory EEG effects of acute APO injection in different brain areas by use of our "time-frequency" clustering program. The acute injection of APO was used to compare DA receptor sensitivity in 5xFAD mice pretreated with either APO or saline vs. wild-type (WT) mice pretreated with saline. Results: After acute APO injection, the clusters of enhanced EEG activity centered in the theta-alpha frequency range observed in WT mice disappeared in 5xFAD mice pretreated with saline and practically recovered in 5xFAD mice pretreated with APO. Conclusions: In 5xFAD mice pretreated with saline, the sensitivity of DA receptors was disturbed; chronic APO pretreatment mainly recovered this characteristic in 5xFAD mice. The "clustering" of pharmacological EEG effects and their time-dependent transition between classical frequency bands is a new effective approach for analyzing cerebral neurotransmission in neurodegenerative pathologies.

AB  - Identification of a conserved G-quadruplex in E165R of ASFVAfrican swine fever virus (ASFV) is a double-stranded DNA arbovirus with high transmissibility and mortality rates. It has caused immense economic losses to the global pig industry. Currently, no effective vaccines or medications are to combat ASFV infection. G-quadruplex (G4) structures have attracted increasing interest because of their regulatory role in vital biological processes. In this study, we identified a conserved G-rich sequence within the E165R gene of ASFV. Subsequently, using various methods, we verified that this sequence could fold into a parallel G4. In addition, the G4-stabilizers pyridostatin and can bind and stabilize this G4 structure, thereby inhibiting E165R gene expression, and the inhibitory effect is associated ising and novel antiviral target against ASFV.

AB  - Endometrial organoids (EOs) are three-dimensional models that emulate the endometrium, serving as an invaluable in vitro tool for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial physiology and pathology during the estrous cycle and pregnancy. While significant progress has been made in the establishment and optimization of EOs for both humans and mice, research on such models in other species remains limited. This study aimed to develop porcine endometrial epithelial organoids (EEOs) to explore the regulatory mechanisms of uterine function and maternal-fetal interactions during porcine pregnancy, which are critical for enhancing reproductive efficiency and improving embryo transfer techniques. Utilizing a defined protocol involving Matrigel and a simplified culture medium, we successfully established EEOs from porcine endometrial epithelial cells, which demonstrated epithelial characteristics, proliferative capacity, glycogen secretion, and hormonal responsiveness. Co-culturing with porcine endometrial stromal cells not only enhanced EEO formation but also mitigated the negative effect of progesterone on glycogen secretion. This cost-effective and efficient method provides a valuable reference for EO generation in other large animal species.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) models have shown exceptional accuracy in plant disease identification, yet their practical utility for farmers remains limited due to a lack of professional and actionable guidance. To bridge this gap, we developed CDIP-ChatGLM3, an innovative framework that synergizes a state-of-the-art DL-based computer vision model with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), designed specifically for Crop Disease Identification and Prescription (CDIP). EfficientNet-B2, evaluated among 10 DL models across 48 diseases and 13 crops, achieved top performance with 97.97 % +/- 0.16 % accuracy at a 95 % confidence level. Building on this, we fine-tuned the widely used ChatGLM3-6B LLM using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Freeze-tuning, optimizing its ability to deliver precise disease management prescriptions. We compared two training strategies-multi-task learning (MTL) and Dual-stage Mixed Fine-Tuning (DMT)-using a different combination of domain-specific and general datasets. Freeze-tuning with DMT led to substantial performance gains, achieving a 33.16 % improvement in BLEU-4 and a 27.04 % increase in the Average ROUGE F-score, surpassing the original model and state-of-the-art competitors such as Qwen-max, Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct, and GPT-4o. The dual-model architecture of CDIPChatGLM3 leverages the complementary strengths of computer vision for image-based disease detection and LLMs for contextualized, domain-specific text generation, offering unmatched specialization, interpretability, and scalability. Unlike resource-intensive multimodal models that blend modalities, our dual-model approach maintains efficiency while achieving superior performance in both disease identification and actionable prescription generation.

AB  - Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) play a regulatory role in adipogenesis and energy balance. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of BCAA supplements, especially leucine (Leu) and valine (Val) supplementation, on lipid metabolism and related disorders in a finishing pig model. The results demonstrated that Leu (1%) and Val decreased serum as well as hepatic lipid accumulation. Moreover, metabolomics and lipidomics analyses revealed that Leu and Val markedly downregulated the level of various lipid species in the liver. This outcome may be explained by Leu and Val promoting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)/hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase (HSL) signaling pathways. Leu and Val altered the fatty acid composition in distinct adipose tissues and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors. Additionally, they significantly decreased back fat thickness, and the results of the fatty acid profiles demonstrated that Leu and Val significantly increased the levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) while decreasing those of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), especially in back fat and abdominal fat. Besides, Leu and Val restored glucose homeostasis by suppressing gluconeogenesis through the serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT)/transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) signaling pathway in the liver and back fat. In summary, these results suggest that Leu and Val may serve as key regulators for modulating lipid metabolism and steatosis.
   Leucine and valine regulate lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis as well as inflammation in a finishing pig model.

AB  - Iodine is anessential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in male reproduction (sexual behavior and semen production performance) by modulating thyroid function and the antioxidant status of the animal. Nonetheless, in Bos indicus bulls, a thorough evaluation of the effects of dietary iodine supplementation on antioxidant status, seminal quality parameters, and its interaction with other minerals is not documented. Twelve Bos indicus (Sahiwal) bulls were distributed into three groups (n = 4 in each group) viz. T-1 (control), T-2, and T-3 and fed diets containing 0.250, 0.375, and 0.500 ppm iodine/ kg dry matter intake, corresponding to 0%, 50%, and 100% higher than ICAR (2013) recommendations, respectively. The experimental feeding was carried out for 60 days and the effects on nutrient utilization, hormonal and antioxidant status, and sperm function tests were investigated. Results revealed that body weight, dry matter intake, and nutrient digestibility remained unaffected by dietary supplementation of iodine. Testosterone and thyroxine hormone concentrations were improved (p<0.05) in T-2 and T-3 groups. Blood and seminal iodine content were also higher (p<0.05) in both the supplemented groups (T-2 and T-3). Sperm functions viz. viability, physical membrane integrity, acrosomal integrity, motility, and mitochondrial membrane potential were improved (p<0.05) due to iodine supplementation. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation and membrane scrambling in spermatozoa were reduced (p<0.05) in T-2 and T-3 groups. Blood antioxidant status (total antioxidant activity and GPx levels) was improved (p<0.05) in T-2 and T-3. Sexual behavior was also improved (p<0.05) in iodine-supplemented groups. Hence, it can be concluded that iodine supplementation at the dose rate of 0.500 ppm in the Bos indicus bull diet is beneficial in improving hormonal status, antioxidant status, and semen quality.

AB  - Historical negative control data (HCD) have played an increasingly important role in interpreting the results of genotoxicity tests. In particular, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) genetic toxicology test guidelines recommend comparing responses produced by exposure to test substances with the distribution of HCD as one of three criteria for evaluating and interpreting study results (referred to herein as "Criterion C"). Because of the potential for inconsistency in how HCD are acquired, maintained, described, and used to interpret genotoxicity testing results, a workgroup of the International Workshops for Genotoxicity Testing was convened to provide recommendations on this crucial topic. The workgroup used example data sets from four in vivo tests, the Pig-a gene mutation assay, the erythrocyte-based micronucleus test, the transgenic rodent gene mutation assay, and the in vivo alkaline comet assay to illustrate how the quality of HCD can be evaluated. In addition, recommendations are offered on appropriate methods for evaluating HCD distributions. Recommendations of the workgroup are:When concurrent negative control data fulfill study acceptability criteria, they represent the most important comparator for judging whether a particular test substance induced a genotoxic effect.HCD can provide useful context for interpreting study results, but this requires supporting evidence that (i) HCD were generated appropriately, and (ii) their quality has been assessed and deemed sufficiently high for this purpose.HCD should be visualized before any study comparisons take place; graph(s) that show the degree to which HCD are stable over time are particularly useful.Qualitative and semi-quantitative assessments of HCD should also be supplemented with quantitative evaluations. Key factors in the assessment of HCD include: (i) the stability of HCD over time, and (ii) the degree to which inter-study variation explains the total variability observed.When animal-to-animal variation is the predominant source of variability, the relationship between responses in the study and an HCD-derived interval or upper bounds value (i.e., OECD Criterion C) can be used with a strong degree of confidence in contextualizing a particular study's results.When inter-study variation is the major source of variability, comparisons between study data and the HCD bounds are less useful, and consequentially, less emphasis should be placed on using HCD to contextualize a particular study's results.The workgroup findings add additional support for the use of HCD for data interpretation; but relative to most current OECD test guidelines, we recommend a more flexible application that takes into consideration HCD quality. The workgroup considered only commonly used in vivo tests, but it anticipates that the same principles will apply to other genotoxicity tests, including many in vitro tests.

AB  - Simple Summary Changes in cortisol fluctuations are used for stress monitoring. Methodologically, this is straight forward, because sample collection is simple and analytical methods advanced, but since cortisol is primarily a hormone that facilitates energy allocation, the interpretation of these measures is often complex. Acute elevations in cortisol levels are not per se bad, but may constitute an adaptive coping mechanism. Likewise, low cortisol levels do not always indicate the absence of a stressor. To distinguish between stress response qualities, a more fine-grained analyses of cortisol fluctuations is warranted. Cortisol excretion follows a diurnal pattern with high levels in the morning, decreasing throughout the day. Two regression coefficients describe this curve: the intercept (the constant with which levels change throughout the day) and the slope (curve steepness and direction). We assessed salivary cortisol intercepts and slopes in zoo-housed apes on routine days, enrichment days, and in the new ape house. While cortisol excretion increased on enrichment days, the daily decline of cortisol levels was not affected. The move to the new house seemingly was a major stressor as cortisol levels increased slightly and the circadian cortisol decrease was impaired. The combination of intercept and slope measures can differentiate between stress responses, thereby constituting a useful tool for stress monitoring. Monitoring changes in cortisol levels is a widespread tool for measuring individuals' stress responses. However, an acute increase in cortisol levels does not necessarily denote an individual in distress, as increases in cortisol can be elicited by all factors that signal the need to mobilize energy. Nor are low levels of cortisol indicative for a relaxed, healthy individual. Therefore, a more fine-grained description of cortisol patterns is warranted in order to distinguish between cortisol fluctuations associated with different stress response qualities. In most species, cortisol shows a distinct diurnal pattern. Using a reaction norm approach, cortisol levels across the day can be described by the two regression coefficients: the intercept and the slope of the curve. We measured immunoreactive salivary cortisol in three zoo-housed ape species under three conditions (routine days, enrichment days, and after the move to a new house). We examined salivary cortisol intercepts (SCI) and salivary cortisol slopes (SCS) of the diurnal curves. SCI and SCS were independent from each other. SCI was highest on enrichment days and lowest on routine days. SCS was steep on routine days and blunted after the move. Only SCI was species-specific. Our study provides evidence that combining SCI and SCS measures allows us to differentiate between types of stress responses, thereby constituting a useful tool for welfare assessment.

AB  - Astrocytes are ubiquitous in the brain and spinal cord and display a complex morphology important for the local interactions with neighboring cells, resulting in the modulation of circuit function. Thus, studies focusing on astrocyte physiology in the healthy and diseased brain generally present analyses of astrocytic structure. The labeling method used to visualize the astrocytic structure defines the morphological level to observe and may vary depending on the anatomical sub-regions. The method choice may significantly affect our understanding of their structural diversity. The main goal of this work was to identify a straightforward and efficient protocol for labeling and reconstructing a detailed astrocytic structure to apply and validate in different brain tissue preparations across laboratories. For that, we explored different tissue processing protocols before GFAP labeling to determine the most effective method for reconstructing astrocytic backbones in the mouse hippocampus. Our results show that the reconstruction of astrocytic structure in vibratome sections labeled by free-floating immunofluorescence protocol provides a more practical method to achieve a higher level of detail and arbor complexity in astrocyte backbone reconstruction. Free-floating immunofluorescence labeling is the most reliable method for obtaining better antibody penetration and more detailed astrocyte structure. Finally, we also show that introducing an antigen retrieval step appears useful for visualizing more complete structural details.

AB  - Behavioral flexibility, one of the core executive functions of the brain, has been shown to be an essential skill for survival across species. Corticostriatal circuits play a critical role in mediating behavioral flexibility. The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are still unclear. Here, we measured how synaptic glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) expression dynamically changed during specific stages of learning and reversal. Following training to well -established stages of discrimination and reversal learning on a touchscreen visual task, lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal striatum (dS) as well as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and piriform cortex (Pir) were micro dissected from male mouse brain and the expression of glutamatergic receptor subunits in the synaptic fraction were measured via immunoblotting. We found that the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR in the OFC remained stable during initial discrimination learning but significantly increased in the synaptic fraction during midreversal stages, the period during which the OFC has been shown to play a critical role in updating outcome expectancies. In contrast, both GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of the AMPAR significantly increased in the dS synaptic fraction as new associations were learned late in reversal. Expression of NMDAR and AMPAR subunits did not significantly differ across learning stages in any other brain region. Together, these findings further support the involvement of OFC-dS circuits in moderating well -learned associations and flexible behavior and suggest that dynamic synaptic expression of NMDAR and AMPAR in these circuits may play a role in mediating efficient learning during discrimination and the ability to update previously learned associations as environmental contingencies change.

AB  - In recent years, honey bees have been stressed by multiple factors, with malnutrition posing a significant threat to the healthy development of honey bee colonies. To keep a colony healthy and productive, beekeepers supply their colonies with supplementary pollen or commercial pollen substitutes during periods of pollen dearth or insufficient pollen quantity or quality. In this study, we evaluated the effects of four natural pollen types (oilseed rape pollen, camellia pollen, lotus pollen and buckwheat pollen) and two commercial pollen substitutes (Diet 1 and Diet 2) against a control group (sucrose solution) on Apis cerana through cage experiments. The food consumption, live body weight, longevity, hypopharyngeal gland development and midgut proteolytic enzyme activity of caged workers were measured. The food consumption rates of oilseed rape pollen and buckwheat pollen were greater than the other diets. Oilseed rape pollen and camellia pollen were recognized as excellent-quality diets for hypopharyngeal gland development and midgut proteolytic enzyme activity. Over the entire experimental period, the caged workers fed with lotus pollen had a similar diet consumption and body weight to those fed with pollen substitutes, and these bees had a significantly higher survival rate than those fed with other diets. The results indicated that the commercial pollen substitutes appeared to be less beneficial to caged A. cerana workers than the natural pollen resources.

AB  - BackgroundStress is one of the prevalent factors influencing cognition. Several studies examined the effect of mild or chronic stress on cognition. However, most of these studies are limited to a few behavioral tests or the expression of selected RNA/proteins markers in a selected brain region.MethodsThis study examined the effect of restraint stress on learning, memory, cognition, and expression of transcripts in key learning centers. Male mice were divided into three groups (n = 6/group)-control group, stress group (adult stressed group; S), and F1 group (parental stressed group). Stress group mice were subjected to physical restraint stress for 2 h before light offset for 2 weeks. The F1 group comprised adult male mice born of stressed parents. All animals were subjected to different tests and were sacrificed at the end. Transcription levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Bdnf), Tyrosine kinase (TrkB), Growth Associated Protein 43 (Gap-43), Neurogranin (Ng), cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein (Creb), Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (Gsk3 beta), Interleukine-1 (IL-1) and Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) were studied.ResultsResults show that both adult and parental stress negatively affect learning, memory and cognition, as reflected by taking longer time to achieve the task or showing reduced exploratory behavior. Expression of Bdnf, TrkB, Gsk3 beta and Ng was downregulated, while IL-1 and Tnf-alpha were upregulated in the brain's cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus region of stressed mice. These effects seem to be relatively less severe in the offspring of stressed parents.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that physical restraint stress can alter learning, memory, cognition, and expression of transcripts in key learning centers of brain.

AB  - Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), an oocyte-secreted factor, plays a vital role in porcine oocyte development. However, its function during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) remains unclear. In this study, we achieved GDF9 editing in approximately 59 % of cultured oocytes by cytoplasmic injection of a pre-assembled crRNAtracrRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex into porcine oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. GDF9 editing caused significant damage to porcine oocytes during IVM. Additionally, GDF9 editing impaired mitochondrial function, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels. The impaired IVM of GDF9-edited porcine oocytes was primarily driven by active cAMP-PKA signaling, which inhibited MOS expression, leading to the activation of the WEE1B/MYT1 kinase and inactivation of CDC25B phosphatase. This cascade resulted in the inactivation of CDK1, thereby preventing the activation of maturation- promoting factor (MPF) and inhibiting first polar body (PB1) extrusion. Our findings enhance the understanding of GDF9's regulatory role in porcine oocyte IVM and provide a theoretical foundation for improving porcine reproductive performance.

AB  - Hypoxemia from exposure to intermittent and/or acute environmental hypoxia (lower oxygen concentration) is a severe stressor for many animal species. The response to hypoxia of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), which culminates in the release of glucocorticoids, has been well-studied in hypoxia-intolerant surface-dwelling mammals. Several group-living (social) subterranean species, including most African mole -rats, are hypoxia-tolerant, likely due to regular exposure to intermittent hypoxia in their underground bur-rows. Conversely, solitary mole-rat species, lack many adaptive mechanisms, making them less hypoxia-tolerant than the social genera. To date, the release of glucocorticoids in response to hypoxia has not been measured in hypoxia-tolerant mammalian species. Consequently, this study exposed three social African mole-rat species and two solitary mole-rat species to normoxia, or acute hypoxia and then measured their respective plasma gluco-corticoid (cortisol) concentrations. Social mole-rats had lower plasma cortisol concentrations under normoxia than the solitary genera. Furthermore, individuals of all three of the social mole-rat species exhibited signifi-cantly increased plasma cortisol concentrations after hypoxia, similar to those of hypoxia-intolerant surface -dwelling species. By contrast, individuals of the two solitary species had a reduced plasma cortisol response to acute hypoxia, possibly due to increased plasma cortisol under normoxia. If placed in perspective with other closely related surface-dwelling species, the regular exposure of the social African mole-rats to hypoxia may have reduced the basal levels of the components for the adaptive mechanisms associated with hypoxia exposure, including circulating cortisol levels. Similarly, the influence of body mass on plasma cortisol levels cannot be ignored. This study demonstrates that both hypoxia-tolerant rodents and hypoxia-intolerant terrestrial laboratory-bred rodents may possess similar HPA-axis responses from exposure to hypoxia. Further research is required to confirm the results from this pilot study and to further confirm how the cortisol concentrations may influence responses to hypoxia in African mole-rats.

AB  - With the exponential growth of multi-omics data, its integration and utilization have brought unprecedented opportunities for the interpretation of gene regulation mechanisms and the comprehensive analyses of biological systems. IAnimal (https://ianirnal. pro/), a cross-species, multi-omics knowledgebase, was developed to improve the utilization of massive public data and simplify the integration of multi-omics information to mine the genetic mechanisms of objective traits. Currently, !Animal provides 61 191 individual omits data of genome (WGS), transcriptome (RNA-Seq), epigenome (ChIP-Seq, ATACSeq) and genome annotation information for 21 species, such as mice, pigs, cattle, chickens, and macaques. The scale of its total clean data has reached 846.46 TB. To better understand the biological significance of omics information, a deep learning model for !Animal was built based on BioBERT and AutoNER to mine 'gene' and 'trait' entities from 2 794 237 abstracts, which has practical significance for comprehending how each omics layer regulates genes to affect traits. By means of user-friendly web interfaces, flexible data application programming interfaces, and abundant functional modules, IAnimal enables users to easily query, mine, and visualize characteristics in various omics, and to infer how genes play biological roles under the influence of various omics layers.

AB  - Multiplex immunostaining (mIHC) allows the simultaneous detection of multiple antigenic targets within the same tissue section, providing a deeper understanding of spatial variation in cellular distribution. The aim of the present study is to apply this technique to examine the spatial variation of lymphocyte populations in swine lymph nodes during PCV2-SD and PRRSV lymphadenopathy compared with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. A triple immunohistochemical stain with CD3, CD20 and IBA1 antibodies for the concurrent detection of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages, respectively, was performed. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) revealed that, compared to reactive hyperplasia, the most significant changes in lymph node cell populations occurred in the follicles for both PCV2 and PRRSV infections. Additionally, in PCV2 cases, notable alterations were also observed in the interfollicular areas. In PCV2-affected lymph nodes, follicles not only significantly decreased in number but also showed a marked significant reduction in CD20+ and CD3+ cells. The interfollicular region in these cases also exhibited a significant reduction in CD3+ cells. In contrast, PRRSV-associated lymphadenopathy showed significantly increased CD20+ cells in the follicles, with a similar trend noted in the interfollicular region. mIHC provides more informative results on a single tissue section, thus preserving the topographical information of the tissue and allowing a comprehensive study of cellular composition, cellular functionality and cell-cell interactions, proving to be a valuable tool for studying and understanding disease dynamics.

AB  - In this work, gamma irradiation was used to create bimetallic silver-copper oxide nanoparticles (Ag-CuO NPs) in an ecologically acceptable way using gum Arabic (GA) polymer as a capping and reducing agent. Bimetallic AgCuO NPs were investigated through UV-Vis. spectroscopy, HR-TEM, SEM, DLS, and XRD examinations. The potency of antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against a few bacterial isolates and Candida sp. had been investigated. Clinical investigations of 30 cows and 20 buffaloes from different sites in Egypt's Sharkia governorate found ulcerative lesions on the mouth and interdigital region. The cytotoxic assay of the generated NPs on BHK-21 was examined. The bimetallic Ag-CuO NPs had an average diameter of 25.58 nm, and the HR-TEM results showed that they were spherical. According to our results, Ag-CuO NPs exhibited the highest antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus (26.5 mm ZOI), K. pneumoniae (26.0 mm ZOI), and C. albicans (28.5 mm ZOI). The growth of biofilms was also successfully inhibited through the application of Ag-CuO NPs by 88.12 % against S. aureus, 87.08 % against C. albicans, and 74.0 % against B. subtilis. The ulcers on the mouth and foot of diseased animals healed in 4-5 days and 1 week, respectively, following topical application of bimetallic Ag-CuO NPs. The results examined the potential protective effects of a dosage of 3.57 mu g/mL on cells before viral infection (cell control). According to our research, bimetallic Ag-CuO NPs limit the development of the virus that causes footand-mouth disease (FMD). The reduction of a specific FMD virus's cytopathic impact (CPE) on cell development represented the inhibitory effect when compared to identical circumstances without pretreatment with bimetallic Ag-CuO NPs. Their remarkable antibacterial properties at low concentration and continued-phase stability suggest that they may find widespread use in a variety of pharmacological and biological applications, especially in the wound-healing process.

AB  - Cancer and heart diseases are the two leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Many cancer patients undergo heart-related complications resulting in high incidences of mortality. It is generally hypothesized that cardiac dysfunction in cancer patients occurs due to cardiotoxicity induced by therapeutic agents, used to treat cancers and/or cancer-induced cachexia. However, it is not known if localized tumors or unregulated cell growth systemically affect heart function before treatment, and/or prior to the onset of cachexia, hence, making the heart vulnerable to structural or functional abnormalities in later stages of the disease. We incorporated complementary mouse and Drosophila models to establish if tumor induction indeed causes cardiac defects even before intervention with chemotherapy or onset of cachexia. We focused on one of the key pathways involved in irregular cell growth, the Hippo-Yorkie (Yki), pathway. We used overexpression of the transcriptional co-activator of the Yki signaling pathway to induce cellular overgrowth, and show that Yki overexpression in the eye tissue of Drosophila results in compromised cardiac function. We rescue these cardiac phenotypes using antioxidant treatment, with which we conclude that the Yki induced tumorigenesis causes a systemic increase in ROS affecting cardiac function. Our results show that systemic cardiac dysfunction occurs due to abnormal cellular overgrowth or cancer elsewhere in the body; identification of specific cardiac defects associated with oncogenic pathways can facilitate the possible early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction.

AB  - Background: Pyrethroid insecticides use for indoor residual spraying (IRS) in malaria-endemic areas results in high levels of exposure to local populations. Pyrethroids may cause asthma and respiratory allergies but no prior study has investigated this question in an IRS area. Methods: We measured maternal urinary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites (cis-DBCA, cis-DCCA, transDCCA, 3-PBA) in samples collected at delivery from 751 mothers participating in the Venda Health Examination of Mothers, Babies, and their Environment (VHEMBE), a birth cohort study based in Limpopo, South Africa. At 3.5-year and 5-year follow-up visits, caregivers of 647 and 620 children, respectively, were queried about children's respiratory allergy symptoms based on validated instruments. We applied marginal structural models for repeated outcomes to estimate associations between biomarker concentrations and asthma diagnosis as well as respiratory allergy symptoms at ages 3.5 and 5 years. Results: We found that a10-fold increase in maternal urinary cis-DCCA, trans-DCCA and 3-PBA concentrations were associated with more than a doubling in the risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma (cis-DCCA: RR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3, 3.3; trans-DCCA: RR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.1, 3.9; 3-PBA: RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.0, 5.8) and an about 80% increase in the risk of wheezing or whistling in the chest (cis-DCCA: RR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1, 3.0; trans-DCCA: RR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.6; 3-PBA: RR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.0, 3.3) and suspected asthma (cis-DCCA: RR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1, 3.1; trans-DCCA: RR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.8). We also observed that higher concentrations of cis-DBCA and 3-PBA were related to increases in the risks of dry cough at night (RR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.3, 9.5) and seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis (RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1, 3.9), respectively. Conclusion: Maternal exposure to pyrethroids may increase the risk of asthma and other respiratory allergy symptoms among preschool children from an IRS area.

AB  - Green tea (Camellia sinensis L.), one of the most popular beverages worldwide, contains caffeine, a natural stimulant. However, some green tea extracts have been known to possess both hypnotic and arousal effects. This study aimed to identify the components influencing these dual effects using a green tea ethanol extract (GE). Response surface methodology revealed that only some extraction conditions significantly induced arousal effects in ICR mice during the pentobarbital-induced sleep test. Among these, extraction with 95% ethanol for 195 minutes achieved the maximum arousal effect, corresponding to a caffeine content of 58.9 mg g-1, comparable to the effects observed with the reference, 25 mg kg-1 of caffeine. In addition, administration of this GE sample significantly increased wakefulness for 3 hours following treatment in C57BL/6N mice, as confirmed through sleep architecture analysis. A correlation analysis of the total phenolic content (TPC) to caffeine ratio in GE found that the intensity of the arousal-inducing effects varied with TPC (R2 = 0.9428). It was also confirmed that the ratio of EGCG to caffeine, major components of GE, was more closely associated with sleep duration (R2 = 0.9034). l-Theanine, known for its sleep-promoting effects, did not independently affect the arousal effects of GE. However, when combined with EGCG, their total content showed a slightly stronger correlation with sleep duration in relation to the caffeine ratio, compared with that of EGCG/caffeine ratio (R2 = 0.9464). Therefore, the balance between TPC and caffeine appears to modulate the stimulant properties of GE, highlighting its potential as both a stimulant and a mild hypnotic agent. Collectively, these findings provide insights into optimizing GE for tailored functional foods based on its polyphenol/caffeine ratio.

AB  - The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated gene (Cas) system is continually optimized to achieve the most efficient gene editing effect. The Cas12i(Max), a Cas12i variant, exhibits powerful DNA editing activity and enriches the gene editing toolbox. However, the application of Cas12i(Max) in large domestic animals has not yet been reported. To verify the efficiency and feasibility of multiple gene editing in large animals, we generated porcine fibroblasts with simultaneous knockouts of IGF2, ANPEP, CD163, and MSTN via Cas12i(Max) in one step. Phenotypically stable pigs were created through somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. They exhibited improved growth performance and muscle quality. Furthermore, we simultaneously edited three genes in bovine fibroblasts. A knockout of MSTN and PRNP was created and the amino acid Q-G in CD18 was precisely substituted. Meanwhile, no off-target phenomenon was observed by sum-type analysis or off-target detection. These results verified the effectiveness of Cas12i(Max) for gene editing in livestock animals and demonstrated the potential application of Cas12i(Max) in the field of animal trait improvement for agricultural production.

AB  - Low-enriched-uranium (LEU) reactor systems utilize moderators to improve neutron economy. Solid yttrium hydride is one of the primary moderator candidates for high-temperature (> 700 & DEG;C) nuclear reactor applications. This is due to its ability to retain hydrogen at elevated temperatures compared to other metal hydrides. For reactor modeling purposes, both neutronic and thermos-mechanical modeling, several high-temperature properties for sub-stoichiometric yttrium hydride (YH2-x) are needed. In this paper, we present an atomistics and a neutron diffraction study of the high-temperature properties of Y and YH2-x. Specifically, we focus on the thermal lattice expansion effects in yttrium metal and yttrium hydride, which also govern bulk thermal expansion. Previously reported physical and mechanical properties for sub-stoichiometric yttrium hydride at ambient conditions are expanded using lattice dynamics to take into account high-temperature effects. Accordingly, an array of newly generated properties is presented that enables high-fidelity neutronics, and thermomechanical modeling. These properties include various elastic moduli, thermal expansion parameters for yttrium and yttrium hydride, and single-phase (YH2-x) and two-phase (Y + YH2-x) density as a function of stoichiometry and density.

AB  - Cell growth and patterning are critical for tissue development. Here we discuss the evolutionarily conserved cadherins, Fat and Dachsous, and the roles they play during mammalian tissue development and disease. In Drosophila, Fat and Dachsous regulate tissue growth via the Hippo pathway and planar cell polarity (PCP). The Drosophila wing has been an ideal tissue to observe how mutations in these cadherins affect tissue development. In mammals, there are multiple Fat and Dachsous cadherins, which are expressed in many tissues, but mutations in these cadherins that affect growth and tissue organization are context dependent. Here we examine how mutations in the Fat and Dachsous mammalian genes affect development in mammals and contribute to human disease.

AB  - Background: Air pollution is linked to neurodevelopmental delays, but its association with longitudinal changes in brain network development has yet to be investigated. We aimed to characterize the effect of PM2.5, O3, and NO2 exposure at ages 9-10 years on changes in functional connectivity (FC) over a 2-year follow-up period, with a focus on the salience (SN), frontoparietal (FPN), and default-mode (DMN) brain networks as well as the amygdala and hippocampus given their importance in emotional and cognitive functioning.Methods: A sample of children (N = 9,497; with 1-2 scans each for a total of 13,824 scans; 45.6% with two brain scans) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study & REG; were included. Annual averages of pollutant concentrations were assigned to the child's primary residential address using an ensemble-based exposure modeling approach. Resting-state functional MRI was collected on 3T MRI scanners. First, developmental linear mixed-effect models were performed to characterize typical FC development within our sample. Next, single- and multi-pollutant linear mixed-effect models were constructed to examine the association between exposure and intra-network, inter-network, and subcortical-to-network FC change over time, adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, income, parental education, handedness, scanner type, and motion.Results: Developmental profiles of FC over the 2-year follow-up included intra-network integration within the DMN and FPN as well as inter-network integration between the SN-FPN; along with intra-network segregation in the SN as well as subcortical-to-network segregation more broadly. Higher PM2.5 exposure resulted in greater inter-network and subcortical-to-network FC over time. In contrast, higher O3 concentrations resulted in greater intra-network, but less subcortical-to-network FC over time. Lastly, higher NO2 exposure led to less inter-network and subcortical-to-network FC over the 2-year follow-up period.Conclusion: Taken together, PM2.5, O3, and NO2 exposure in childhood relate to distinct changes in patterns of network maturation over time. This is the first study to show outdoor ambient air pollution during childhood is linked to longitudinal changes in brain network connectivity development.

AB  - Increased use of renewable energy is a major part of Ireland's plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, lessen reliance on fossil fuels, and enable sustainable economic growth. Two forms of renewable energy interesting Irish policymakers are bioenergy and solar PV. To scale up these technologies, land will be required to grow bioenergy feedstocks and erect ground mount solar PV arrays. A micro, farm-based approach is utilised to generate private returns from renewable energy production, and agriculture, adjusted for the cost of GHGs.This considers both the cost to society of increasing GHG emissions and the benefit of reducing emissions. This paper compares income that could be derived from renewable energy production with average agricultural income from the main farm systems in Ireland. The private (market and subsidy) and social (GHG) return from substituting renewable energy sources for the existing agricultural land use on 1 ha is considered. We also use input-output modelling to generate output multipliers for renewable energy technologies: biogas, biomethane, short rotation coppice (SRC) willow, and solar PV.The results show that the market return from growing 1 ha of grass silage and SRC willow is less than for all the main farming systems. When the social value of the feedstock is considered by putting a monetary value on displaced GHG emissions, producing grass silage and willow biomass can provide a better return to farmers than cattle and sheep farming. Due to the high land rental amounts available to farmers from solar companies, the market and social return is higher for using land to erect solar PV than any of the main agricultural activities. Results from the output multiplier analysis show that biomethane production has the highest multiplier while solar PV has the lowest.

AB  - Aiming at the development of alternative and low-impact synthetic pathways, we herein report the exploitation and the simultaneous employment of different tools to improve the overall sustainability of the Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) cross-coupling process with a circular economy approach. For the first time, in this study, we have combined the use of our biowaste-derived heterogeneous catalyst Pd/PiNe with the biomass-derived reaction medium gamma-valerolactone (GVL) proving that an optimised protocol can be obtained for the SM process with a significant substrate scope. The microwave irradiation technology highly enhanced the energy efficiency, allowing the synthesis of different biphenyls and reducing the reaction time. In addition, the good efficiency and selectivity of the SM reaction led to further optimisation of the work-up procedure, minimising the waste generation and the E-factor values associated with the process (3.2-9.4). The optimised conditions tolerated the free carboxylic acid group well, realizing the step-economical preparation of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic Fenbufen in quantitative yield. Finally, the scale-up of the MW-assisted process was performed in synergy with the optimisation of the continuous flow protocol and the waste minimised synthesis of Fenbufen was achieved.

AB  - Dendritic morphology is typically highly branched, and the branching and synaptic abundance of dendrites can enhance the receptive range of neurons and the diversity of information received, thus providing the basis for information processing in the nervous system. Once dendritic development is aberrantly compromised or damaged, it may lead to abnormal connectivity of the neural network, affecting the function and stability of the nervous system and ultimately triggering a series of neurological disorders. Research on the regulation of dendritic developmental processes has flourished, and much progress is now being made in its regulatory mechanisms. Noteworthily, dendrites are characterized by an extremely complex dendritic arborization that cannot be attributed to individual protein functions alone, requiring a systematic analysis of the intrinsic and extrinsic signals and the coordinated roles among them. Actin cytoskeleton organization and membrane vesicle trafficking are required during dendrite development, with actin providing tracks for vesicles and vesicle trafficking in turn providing material for actin assembly. In this review, we focus on these two basic biological processes and discuss the molecular mechanisms and their synergistic effects underlying the morphogenesis of neuronal dendrites. We also offer insights and discuss strategies for the potential preventive and therapeutic treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Notch signaling is a highly conserved pathway between mammals and Drosophila and plays a key role in various biological processes. Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model for studying hematopoiesis and leukemia. In exception to crystal cells, the strength of Notch signaling in Drosophila lymph gland cortical zone (CZ)/intermediate zone (IZ) cells is weak. However, the influence of Notch activation in the lymph gland CZ/IZ cells and circulating hemocytes on hematopoietic homeostasis maintenance is unclear. Here, we showed that Notch activation in lymph gland CZ/IZ cells induced overdifferentiation of progenitors. Moreover, Notch activation promoted lamellocyte generation via NF kappa B/Toll signaling activation and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we found that Notch activation in lymph gland CZ/IZ cells and circulating hemocytes caused caspase-independent and nonautophagic cell death. However, crystal cell autophagy was activated by upregulation of the expression of the target gene of the Hippo/Yki pathway Diap1. Moreover, we showed that Notch activation could alleviate cytokine storms and improve the survival of Rasv12 leukemia model flies. Our study revealed the various mechanisms of hematopoietic dysregulation induced by Notch activation in healthy flies and the therapeutic effect of Notch activation on leukemia model flies.

AB  - Epilepsy is a widespread neurological disorder affecting more than 65 million people, but the mechanisms of epilepsy remains unknown. Abnormal synaptic transmission has a crucial role in the occurrence and development of epilepsy. Here, we found that syntabulin, a neuronal transporter, was mainly localized in neurons, and its expression was increased in epileptic tissues. Knockdown of syntabulin increased susceptibility and severity of epilepsy, whereas overexpression of syntabulin had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, in the epileptic brain tissue, syntabulin mainly translocated syntaxin 1B (STX1B) rather than syntaxin 1A (STX1A) to the presynaptic membrane, which resulted in increased presynaptic transmitter release. Further studies showed that syntabulin had a more significant effect on presynaptic functionality of GABAergic activity over that of excitatory synapses and resulted in an excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance, thereby regulating the epileptic phenotype. In addition, we found that the increased expression of syntabulin in epileptic brain tissue was mainly regulated by transcription factor TFAP2A. In summary, syntabulin plays a protective role in epilepsy by maintaining a proper E/I balance in the hippocampus.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the serum level of fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E in clinically healthy lactating female camel (Camelus dromedarius) and suckling calf > one-year-old during winter and summer seasons in five main regions of Saudi Arabia. 60 sera samples were collected and tested for vitamins A, D and E levels and the results were statistically analyzed. The statistical mean value of vitamin A was within the reported range but for D and E, there were minor variations. The effect of season was insignificant (p > 0.05) for vitamins A and E in the combined results of the dam and newborn together. This seasonal effect was highly significant in dam serum (p < 0.05). Region effect was significant for vitamin A in the northern area (p < 0.05) and for vitamin E in the southern region (p < 0.05). Correlations analysis revealed significant results in the season vs vitamin A and E p < 0.05. Mean values of vitamins A, D and E in dam and newborn did not observe significant variations however, in the season and regions there were significant variations which can be attributed to the climate difference, availabil-ity of balanced rations and camel management in each location of the five main regions of Saudi Arabia. There is a great need for further studies and the consequent development of supplementation programs and camel feed manufacturers awareness of such results is highly recommended.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produces hallucinations, which are perceptions uncoupled from the external environment. How LSD alters neuronal activities in vivo that underlie abnormal perceptions is unknown. Here, we show that when rats run along a familiar track, hippocampal place cells under LSD reduce their firing rates, their directionality, and their interaction with visual cortical neurons. However, both hippocampal and visual cortical neurons temporarily increase firing rates during head-twitching, a behavioral signature of a hallucination-like state in rodents. When rats are immobile on the track, LSD enhances cortical firing synchrony in a state similar to the wakefulness- to-sleep transition, during which the hippocampalcortical interaction remains dampened while hippocampal awake reactivation is maintained. Our results suggest that LSD suppresses hippocampal-cortical interactions during active behavior and during immobility, leading to internal hippocampal representations that are degraded and isolated from external sensory input. These effects may contribute to LSD-produced abnormal perceptions.

AB  - Over half of global livestock-related water consumption is for ruminants. Securing the increasing demand for ruminant products and their nutritional supply worldwide, especially in developing countries with limited and scarce water resources, poses new challenges. However, the evaluations of water appropriation (i.e., water footprints) and efficiencies of ruminant animals and products in time and space within large developing and populous countries remain unclear. Taking three ruminant animals (beef cattle, cows, and mutton sheep) and their meat and milk products produced within the most populous developing country, China, over the period 2008-2017 as the study case, we estimate and analyse provincial water footprints (WFs) by colours as well as their efficiencies from both perspectives of water and nutrients. The results show that the national average unit WFs decreased across species of ruminant. The northern provinces had higher unit WFs of three ruminants than the southern provinces. The WFs of beef were higher than those of the other ruminant animal products. Feed crops contributed 99% of the consumptive WFs of ruminant production in China. The water use efficiency for growing feed crops of the three ruminants increased in most provinces during the study period, which led to decreased proportion of inefficient WF of three animal products. The nutrition conversion efficiency of some animal products is found to overcome the well-known gaps between the WFs for a unit nutrient from animal products versus crops. For example, although the WF of fat per kilogram of mutton was triple of its ingested feed crops, the fat content can increase by six times when the feed crops were converted to mutton. This study reveals the necessity of evaluating the environmental impact of ruminant products from the dual perspectives of resource utilization efficiency and nutrient conversion efficiency, with a feasible evaluation method.

AB  - One of the experimental programs for fertility protection in women includes protective cryopreservation. Vitroficasion of ovarian tissue is one of the protective cryopreservation methods that use high concentrations of antifreeze and faster cooling. To reduce its complications, LIF (Leukemia inhibitory factor) was used as a pretreatment in this study. In this study, the ovaries were randomly divided into 8 groups. In NCN (without pretreatment and LIF in culture media), NCP (without pretreatment and with LIF in culture media), PCP (with pretreatment and LIF in culture media), and PCN (with pretreatment and without LIF in culture media) groups, vitrification and reversal were not performed. In the groups NVN (without pretreatment and LIF in culture media), NVP (without pretreatment and with LIF in culture media) PV, PVP (with pretreatment and LIF in culture media), and PVN (with pretreatment and without LIF in culture medium) groups, vitrification and tissue reversal were performed. All groups were cultured and histological, cellular, and molecular evaluations were performed. The results of the present study showed that LIF in the culture medium reduced the number of abnormal, primordial, primary, and secondary follicles, and DNA breakage compared to the group without LIF (P < 0.05) and increases the growth of follicles and expression of GDF9, BMP, AMH, KITLG genes (P < 0.05). The use of LIF pretreatment before vitrification and melting of sheep ovary tissue in its culture medium reduces the damage caused by it and increases the growth and development of ovarian follicles while maintaining their function.

AB  - Background: Various technologies exist to remove surgical smoke. Despite high significance in surgical practice, comparative in-vivo performance data are missing.Study design: The performance of five smoke management technologies (venting, passive filtering, active filtering, circular filtration, electrostatic precipitation) was analysed in-vivo by three different laparoscopic interventions (cholecystectomy, atypic liver resection, colon surgery) with high-energy surgical instruments. Surgical smoke formation/evacuation was characterised by various aerosol-analytical instruments. In addition, operational parameters like CO2 consumption and capnoperitoneal pressure were determined.Results: The half-life of particle concentration was found to be a suitable parameter to describe smoke elimination efficacy and varied between (10 -45) s. It is shown that the efficacy of smoke elimination technologies based on particle removal by evacuation can also be predicted by simple equations. Furthermore, it was found that the combination of surgical cutter and tissue defines charge and polarity of surgical smoke that influences especially the efficacy of electrostatic precipitation. Depending on the smoke elimination technology, the CO2 consumption varied between (0.5 -16) L/min, the capnoperitoneal stability between (2 -17) %.Conclusions: Each smoke elimination technology showed advantages and disadvantages. Simple charcoal filters rapidly degrade and should be exchanged regularly during surgery. Active filtering is efficient for smoke management, but the unstable capnoperitoneum interferes with surgery. Circular filtration forms a stable capnoperitoneum, but the valveless trocar promotes relevant levels of smoke release into the environment. Electrostatic precipitation was found to be most efficient for smoke management with minimal CO2 consumption and highly-stable capnoperitoneum.

AB  - Epsilon toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens type D is the third most potent clostridial toxin. It causes enterotoxemia in sheep and lambs. The clostridial vaccine has been used against clostridial disease, and its efficacy is evaluated using the serum neutralization (SN) assay as a gold standard. Researchers are concerned about replacing in vivo tests with in vitro tests. Our study aimed to evaluate the cell culture assay to measure the neutralizing antibodies against Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin as an alternative SN assay. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines were used to monitor the cell line response after treatment with purified epsilon toxin through microscopic examination and 3-[4,5-imethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. Antibodies were calculated in cell culture assays, and SN results were analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Based on our results, only MDCK was sensitive to the epsilon toxin. The cytopathic effect in this cell culture was rounded. The relationship between toxin concentration and cell viability showed that increasing toxin concentrations significantly decreased cell viability. Good correlation coefficients were obtained between SN and the in vitro assay (r = 0.987) (p < 0.01). The antibody titers obtained by SN were within the range of the cytotoxicity assay and had high reproducibility. Therefore, cell culture may be a suitable alternative for SN assays. Cell culture is one of the tools used in toxicity testing, resulting in consistent and reproducible results.

AB  - The effects of fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) cycles in reducing many aging and disease risk factors indicate it could affect Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that FMD cycles reduce cognitive decline and AD pa-thology in E4FAD and 3xTg AD mouse models, with effects superior to those caused by protein restriction cycles. In 3xTg mice, long-term FMD cycles reduce hippocampal Ab load and hyperphosphorylated tau, enhance genesis of neural stem cells, decrease microglia number, and reduce expression of neuroinflamma-tory genes, including superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase (Nox2). 3xTg mice lacking Nox2 or mice treated with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin also display improved cognition and reduced microglia activation compared with controls. Clinical data indicate that FMD cycles are feasible and generally safe in a small group of AD patients. These results indicate that FMD cycles delay cognitive decline in AD models in part by reducing neuroinflammation and/or superoxide production in the brain.

AB  - Although blue light has been known to negatively affect skin cells, its detailed signaling mechanisms and anti-blue light agents have not been clearly elucidated. We investigated the involvement of Yes-associated protein (YAP)-mediated Hippo signaling in blue light-induced apoptosis, depending on the degree of blue light exposure. Additionally, we elucidated the effects of melatonin on blue light-irradiated keratinocytes and examined their action mechanisms. After blue light irradiation, its effects and antagonizing effects of melatonin on cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)/YAP-mediated signaling were examined in HaCaT cells using western blots, image analysis, flow cytometric analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry. We found that melatonin treatment attenuated the reduced cell viability and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to blue light irradiation. In the experiments to investigate the mechanism of action of blue light and melatonin, we found that YAP changed its binding protein, either p73 or TEAD, depending on the degree of blue light exposure. Melatonin treatment reduced blue light-induced phosphorylation of TRPV1 and MST1/2. Upon treatment with capsazepine, an antagonist of TRPV1, MST1/2 activation also reduced. Furthermore, we found that prolonged blue light irradiation induced DNA damage, which in turn induced YAP-p73 nuclear translocation. These effects were also notably attenuated by melatonin. These findings indicate that depending on the duration of blue light irradiation, two different YAP-mediated Hippo signaling pathways are activated. Additionally, these findings suggest that melatonin could be a potential therapeutic agent for blue light-induced skin damage.

AB  - Neurotropic viruses target the brain and contribute to neurologic diseases. Caspase recruitment domain containing family member 9 (CARD9) controls protective immunity in a variety of infectious disorders. To investigate the effect of CARD9 in neurotropic virus infection, CARD9(-/-) and corresponding C57BL/6 wild-type control mice were infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). Brain tissue was analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses, and spleens by flow cytometry. To determine the impact of CARD9 deficiency on T cell responses in vitro, antigen presentation assays were utilized. Genetic ablation of CARD9 enhanced early pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and accelerated infiltration of T and B cells in the brain, together with a transient increase in TMEV-infected cells in the hippocampus. CARD9(-/-) mice showed an increased loss of neuronal nuclear protein(+) mature neurons and doublecortin(+) neuronal precursor cells and an increase in beta-amyloid precursor protein(+) damaged axons in the hippocampus. No effect of CARD9 deficiency was found on the initiation of CD8(+) T cell responses by flow cytometry and co-culture experiments using virus-exposed dendritic cells or microglia-enriched glial cell mixtures, respectively. The present study indicates that CARD9 is dispensable for the initiation of early antiviral responses and TMEV elimination but may contribute to the modulation of neuroinflammation, thereby reducing hippocampal injury following neurotropic virus infection.

AB  - Recent studies are identified the mitochondria as critical targets of 2, 2 ' , 4, 4 ' -tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE47) induced neurotoxicity. This study aimed at examining the impact of PBDE-47 exposure on mitochondrial translation, and its subsequent effect on PBDE-47 neurotoxicity. The Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model and neuroendocrine pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were adopted for the measurements of mitochondrial ATP levels, mitochondrial translation products, and expressions of important mitochondrial regulators, such as required meiotic nuclear division 1 (RMND1), estrogen -related receptor alpha (ERR alpha), and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). To delve into the role of PGC-1 alpha/ERR alpha axis in mitochondrial translation, 2-(4-tert-butylphenyl) benzimidazole (ZLN005) was employed. Both cellular and animal model results shown that PBDE-47 impeded PGC-1 alpha/ERR alpha axis and mitochondrial translation. PBDE-47 suppressed mitochondrial function in rat hippocampus and PC12 cells by decreasing relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, mitochondrial translation products, and mitochondrial ATP levels. Particularly, ZLN005 reversed PBDE-47 neurotoxicity by enhancing mitochondrial translation through activation of PGC-1 alpha/ERR alpha axis, yet suppressing PGC-1 alpha with siRNA attenuates its neuroprotective effect in vitro. In conclusion, this work highlights the importance of mitochondrial translation in PBDE-47 neurotoxicity by presenting results from cellular and animal models and suggests a potential therapeutic approach through activation of PGC-1 alpha/ERR alpha axis. Environmental implication: PBDEs have attracted extensive attention because of their high lipophilicity, persistence, and detection levels in various environmental media. Increasing evidence has shown that neurodevelopmental disorders in children are associated with PBDE exposure. Several studies have also found that perinatal PBDE exposure can cause long-lasting neurobehavioral abnormalities in experimental animals. Our recent studies have also demonstrated the impact of PBDE-47 exposure on mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, leading to memory and neurobehavioral deficits. Therefore, we explore whether the pathological mechanism of PBDE-47-induced neurotoxicity involves the regulation of mitochondrial translation through the PGC-1 alpha/ERR alpha axis.

AB  - Distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a coproduct from the ethanol production industry, is successfully used as an ingredient in feeding cattle and pigs due to its relatively high protein and nutrient content and low price compared to cereals. The aim of this study was to establish the optimal DDGS concentration that can be included in the diet of common carp. A seven-week experiment was performed on common carp with an initial weight of 86 g feed with three experimental diets D0 (DDGS 0%), D1 (DDGS 25%) and D2 (DDGS 35%). The chemical composition of DDGS analyzed by Fourier Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy showed a protein content of 27.56% and oil at 6.75%. Diets with DDGS did not produce significant changes in growth parameters, flesh quality, and blood biochemical profile. Regarding the oxidative status in the muscle tissue, D1 and D2 significantly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the specific activity of SOD and GSH, while CAT and GPX were left unaffected. In the liver tissue, CAT, GSH, MDA and carbonylated proteins were reduced in the DDGS diets. The microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents revealed a variation in microbial density depending on the diet used. The total number of aerobic germs was between 224.2 x 10(4) and 69.84 x 10(6) (D2 > D1 > D0) and the total number of anaerobic germs was between 15.2 x 10(2) and 28.2 x 10(2) (D2 > D0 > D1).

AB  - Background Plant protoplasts constitute unique single-cell systems that can be subjected to genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis. An effective and sustainable method for preparing protoplasts from tea plants has yet to be established. The protoplasts were osmotically isolated, and the isolation and purification procedures were optimized. Various potential factors affecting protoplast preparation, including enzymatic composition and type, enzymatic hydrolysis duration, mannitol concentration in the enzyme solution, and iodixanol concentration, were evaluated. Results The optimal conditions were 1.5% (w/v) cellulase and 0.4-0.6% (w/v) macerozyme in a solution containing 0.4 M mannitol, enzymatic hydrolysis over 10 h, and an iodixanol concentration of 65%. The highest protoplast yield was 3.27 x 10(6) protoplasts g(-1) fresh weight. As determined through fluorescein diacetate staining, maximal cell viability was 92.94%. The isolated protoplasts were round and regularly shaped without agglomeration, and they were less than 20 mu m in diameter. Differences in preparation, with regard to yield and viability in the tissues (roots, branches, and leaves), cultivars, and cultivation method, were also observed. Conclusions In summary, we reported on a simple, efficient method for preparing protoplasts of whole-organ tissue from tea plant. The findings are expected to contribute to the rapid development of tea plant biology.

AB  - Background: Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological disorder characterized by a prolonged epileptic activity followed by subsequent epileptogenic processes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the early effects of topiramate (TPM) and lacosamide (LCM) treatment on oxidative stress and inflammatory damage in a model of pilocarpine-induced SE. Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups and the two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), TPM (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) and LCM (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.), were injected three times repeatedly after pilocarpine administration. Rats were sacrificed 24 h post-SE and several parameters of oxidative stress and inflammatory response have been explored in the hippocampus. Results: The two drugs TPM and LCM, in both doses used, succeeded in attenuating the number of motor seizures compared to the SE-veh group 30 min after administration. Pilocarpine-induced SE decreased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels while increasing the catalase (CAT) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), and IL-1 beta levels compared to the control group. Groups with SE did not affect the TNF-alpha levels. The treatment with a higher dose of 30 mg/kg LCM restored to control level the SOD activity in the SE group. The two AEDs, in both doses applied, also normalized the CAT activity and MDA levels to control values. In conclusion, we suggest that the antioxidant effect of TPM and LCM might contribute to their anticonvulsant effect against pilocarpine-induced SE, whereas their weak anti-inflammatory effect in the hippocampus is a consequence of reduced SE severity.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) occurs after surgery and severely impairs patients' quality of life. Finding POCD-associated variables can aid in its diagnosis and prognostication. POCD is associated with noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), involved in metabolic function, immune response alteration, and cognitive ability impairment; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate hub miRNAs (i.e., miRNAs that have an important regulatory role in diseases) regulating postoperative cognitive function and the associated mechanisms. Hub miRNAs were identified by bioinformatics, and their expression in mouse hippocampus tissues was determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Hub miRNAs were overexpressed or knocked down in cell and animal models to test their effects on neuroinflammation and postoperative cognitive function. Six differentially expressed hub miRNAs were identified. miR-206-3p was the only broadly conserved miRNA, and it was used in follow-up studies and animal experiments. Its inhibitors reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 microglia by regulating its target gene, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the downstream signaling pathways. miR-206-3p inhibition suppressed microglial activation in the hippocampi of mice and improved learning and cognitive decline. Therefore, miR-206-3p significantly affects POCD, implying its potential as a therapeutic target.

AB  - Background: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid, is widely used for maintenance immunosuppression in transplantation. The gastrointestinal toxicity of MMF has been widely uncovered. However, the comprehensive metabolic analysis of MMF-induced toxicity is lacking. This study is aimed to ascertain the metabolic changes after MMF administration in mice.Methods: A total of 700 mg MMF was dissolved in 7 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and then 0.5 mL of mixture was diluted with 4.5 mL of saline (100 mg/kg). Mice in the treatment group (n = 9) were given MMF (0.1 mL/10 g) each day via intraperitoneal injection lasting for 2 weeks, while those in the control group (n = 9) received the same amount of blank solvent (DMSO: saline = 1:9). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was utilized to identify the metabolic profiling in serum samples and multiple organ tissues of mice. The potential metabolites were identified using orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis. Meanwhile, we used the MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (http://www.kegg.jp) to depict the metabolic pathways. The percentages of lymphocytes in spleens were assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry analysis.Results: Compared to the control group, we observed that MMF treatment induced differential expression of metabolites in the intestine, hippocampus, lung, liver, kidney, heart, serum, and cortex tissues. Subsequently, we demonstrated that multiple amino acids metabolism and fatty acids biosynthesis were disrupted following MMF treatment. Additionally, MMF challenge dramatically increased CD4+ T cell percentages but had no significant influences on other types of lymphocytes.Conclusion: MMF can affect the metabolism in various organs and serum in mice. These data may provide preliminary judgement for MMF-induced toxicity and understand the metabolic mechanism of MMF more comprehensively.

AB  - Due to the lack of specific antibody anti-chicken tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), it is difficult to further explore the role of TRAF2 in pulmonary artery remodeling in pulmonary hypertension(PH) in broilers. In this experiment, we prepared a polyclonal antibody to TRAF2 by constructing a TRAF2 recombinant protein prokaryotic expression vector and analyzed the expression of TRAF2 in in vivo and in vitro models of pulmonary hypertension in broiler chickens and the effect of TRAF2 on the activity and apoptosis of PASMCs. The results showed that after immunization with TRAF2 recombinant protein we obtained high titers of poly- clonal antibodies, and astragalus polysaccharide as an immune adjuvant could enhance the effect of immunization. Antibody specificity showed that the TRAF2 polyclonal antibody specifically bound to TRAF2 protein in chickens and ducks but weakly to TRAF2 protein in rabbits, mice and goats.TRAF2 was significantly upregulated in an in vivo and in vitro model of PH in broilers. Knockdown of TRAF2 inhibited the activity of PASMCs and induced apoptosis in PASMCs. Our study lays the foundation for further research on the pathomechanism of PH in broiler chickens and provides new targets for its prevention and drug development.

AB  - Considering the resistance development-potential of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) against control tactics with limited action mechanisms, the present study investigated the accumulation of two different silicon (Si) sources (SiO2 and K2SiO3) in cotton plants. The tested dose rates (0, 200, and 400 mg/L) of both Si sources were applied directly to the soil or through foliar application on cotton leaves. Moreover, a laboratory bioassay was also conducted to evaluate the performance of applied Si sources against the oviposition preference and biology of B. tabaci. A significantly higher Si accumulation, reduction in oviposition preference, and prolonged developmental period of all nymphs and total life cycle of B. tabaci was observed in the case of foliar-applied silicon. Similarly, among Si sources, a significant decline in the number of oviposited eggs and delay in the developmental period of B. tabaci was observed in the case of SiO2, followed by K2SiO3. Moreover, cotton plants subjected to SiO2 treatments possessed higher Si contents in their leaves than K2SiO3 treated plants. The results further revealed that both Si sources showed promising results at their higher concentrations regarding the tested parameters of Si accumulation, fecundity, and developmental period of B. tabaci. Our results strongly suggest that among emerging pest control strategies in cotton plants lies the use of foliar application of Si, which can also be incorporated in different integrated pest management programs due to its safety for humans and beneficial insect fauna.

AB  - Stressful situations induce an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can lead to molecular damage and alteration of cell function. The introduction of new potential predators induces physiological stress in na-tive fauna. However, behavioral responses have been reported in preys, demonstrating an induction of the defenses against alien species. Behavioral and antioxidant enzyme responses in the moorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, against the invasive predator horseshoe whip snake (Hemorrhois hippocrepis) were assessed. Behavior was recorded and a tissue sample from the tail was collected after placing the gecko in a terrarium with previous absence or presence of the snake in 'Control' and 'H. hippocrepis' groups, respectively. Fifteen behavioral variables were examined, includ-ing tongue flick (TF) and locomotion patterns. Antioxidant enzyme activities-catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR)-, and the levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized glu-tathione (GSSG), glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio (GSH/GSSG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were measured in the tissue sampled. Geckos exposed to the snake's odor showed a higher number of TF, longer amounts of time remaining motionless or moving in slow motion and they spent less time on the ground in comparison to the 'Control' group. The presence of the snake produced a significant increase in the activities of CAT, SOD and GR and a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio in T. mauritanica individuals exposed to the snake's scent. Thus, both behavioral responses and oxidative stress biomarkers clearly showed that T. mauritanica is able to recognize H. hippocrepis as a po-tential predator, despite being a recently introduced snake at the Balearic Islands.

AB  - The induction of natural defense mechanisms in plants is considered to be one of the most important strategies used in integrated pest management (IPM). Plant immune inducers could reduce the use of chemicals for plant protection and their harmful impacts on the environment. Planticine((R)) is a natural plant defense biostimulant based on oligomers of a(1?4)-linked D-galacturonic acids, which are biodegradable and nontoxic. The aim of this study was to define the molecular basis of Planticine's biological activity and the efficacy of its use as a natural plant resistance inducer in greenhouse conditions. Three independent experiments with foliar application of Planticine((R)) were carried out. The first experiment in a climatic chamber (control environment, no pest pressure) subjected the leaves to RNA-seq analysis, and the second and third experiments in greenhouse conditions focused on efficacy after a pest infestation. The result was the RNA sequencing of six transcriptome libraries of tomatoes treated with Planticine((R)) and untreated plants; a total of 3089 genes were found to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs); among them, 1760 and 1329 were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. DEG analysis indicated its involvement in such metabolic pathways and processes as plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, MAPK signaling pathway, photosynthesis, and regulation of transcription. We detected up-regulated gene-encoded elicitor and effector recognition receptors (ELRR and ERR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) genes, and transcription factors (TFs), i.e., WRKY, ERF, MYB, NAC, bZIP, pathogenesis-related proteins (PRPs), and resistance-related metabolite (RRMs) genes. In the greenhouse trials, foliar application of Planticine((R)) proved to be effective in reducing the infestation of tomato leaves by the biotrophic pathogen powdery mildew and in reducing feeding by thrips, which are insect herbivores. Prophylactic and intervention use of Planticine((R)) at low infestation levels allows the activation of plant defense mechanisms.

AB  - Despite a global phase out of some point sources, mercury (Hg) remains elevated in aquatic food webs, posing health risks for fish-eating consumers. Many tropical regions have fast growing organisms, potentially short food chains, and few industrial point sources, suggesting low Hg baselines and low rates of trophic magnification with limited risk to people. Nevertheless, insufficient work on food-web Hg has been undertaken in the tropics and fish consumption is high in some regions. We studied Hg concentrations in fishes from floodplain lakes of the Jurua River, Amazonas, Brazil with three objectives: 1) determine rates of Hg trophic magnification, 2) assess whether Hg concentrations are high enough to impact humans eating fish, and 3) determine whether there are seasonal differences in fish Hg con-centrations. A total of 377 fish-muscle samples were collected from 12 floodplain lakes during the low-water (Septem-ber 2018) and falling-water (June 2019) seasons and analysed for total Hg and stable nitrogen (N) isotopes. The average trophic magnification factor (increase per trophic level) was 10.1 in the low-water season and 5.4 in the falling-water season, both well above the global average for freshwaters. This high rate of trophic magnification, coupled with higher-than-expected Hg concentrations in herbivorous species, led to high concentrations (up to 17.6 ng/g dry weight) in predatory pirarucu and piranha. Nearly 70% of all samples had Hg concentrations above the rec-ommended human-consumption guidelines. Average concentrations were 42% higher in the low-water season than the falling-water season, but differences varied by species. Since Hg concentrations are higher than expected and fish consumption in this region is high, future research should focus on Hg exposure for human populations here and in other tropical-rainforest regions, even in the absence of local point sources of Hg.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to assess alterations in, echogenic appearance, size and blood flow in the corpus luteum, the placentomes and the blood flow in umbilical and uterine arteries that heat stress can cause in cooled pregnant dairy cows. Pregnant cows were allocated in two groups and the gravid uteri, along with the ipsilateral corpora lutea were examined during the winter (group W, n = 9) or the summer (group S, n = 10). The grey-scale ultrasound and colour flow imaging of the corpus luteum and placentome were performed. In addition, the umbilical and uterine artery diameters and haemodynamic parameters in the vessels were calculated. At the time of ultrasonographic examination, cortisol concentrations were higher, and progesterone levels tended to be lower in group S compared to group W. The grey-scale ultrasound evaluation of corpora lutea and placentomes was lower in group S compared to group W. The diameter of umbilical artery and the blood volume in the vessel were less in group S than in group W. We infer that heat stress affects foetal blood supply and possibly the structure of placentomes and corpora lutea, but it differently affects the blood flow characteristics in the umbilical and uterine arteries.

This paper quantitatively analyzed the nutritional value of 12 common forage compositae plants in Guizhou, the most typical karst area in China, and evaluated and classified their nutrition value by membership function method, grey correlation analysis method and cluster analysis, the results showed that the crude protein content of 12 forage compositae plants was 13.10 % 18.67%, crude fiber content was 12.1 % 37.83 %, crude fat content was 1.24 % 4.57 %, crude ash content was 5.40 % 15.02 %, calcium content was 1.01% 3.26 %, phosphorus content was 0.19% 1.85%. The results of nutritional value evaluation for 12 forage compositae plants by using membership function method, grey correlation analysis method and cluster analysis were basically the same, which can be classified into three categories: Ixeridium sonchifolium, Xanthium sibiricum, Sonchus oleraceits, Taraxacum mongolicum and Anaphalis jlavescens was Class I, it was belonged to excellent fodder; Senecio scandens, Youngia japonica, Siegesbeckiapubescens, Artemisia sieversiana and Erigeron annuus was Class II, it was belonged to good fodder; Galinsoga parvora and Kalimeris indica was Class III, it was belonged to poor fodder. Finally, it was pointed out that the evaluation of forage plants in the future should not only consider their nutritional content, but also consider the factors of grass yield, palatability, digestibility and ecological benefit.

AB  - Microwave radiation is extremely sensitive to the brain and has been shown in animal models to affect memory and learning. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for neural function and brain development, with many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in gene. Several neuropathological disorders have been linked to the BDNF Val66Met variation. Using CRISPR, we created BDNF Val76Met mutations in rats in this study. The rats were then subjected to X-band and S-band microwave radiation, respectively, at an average power density of 50 mW/cm(2) for 15 min every day for five days. We assessed cognitive capacity and investigated the neural structure and BDNF mRNA levels in the brain of rats. We discovered that BDNF Val76Met rats had impaired learning capacity and altered brain structure, with a decrease in BDNF mRNA. Meanwhile, we found that BDNF Val76Met rats exhibited aggravated structural and functional brain damage under 50mW/cm2 microwave radiation, and showed higher sensitivity to S-band microwave due to the stronger penetration compared to X-band microwaves. Considering the genetic differences between animals and humans, more research is needed to determine the exact mechanism by which this SNP location affects cognitive changes caused by microwave radiation.

AB  - Turnover of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins is vital for the maintenance of healthy and functional synapses. SV protein turnover is driven by neuronal activity in an endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent manner. Here, we characterize a critical step in this process: axonal transport of ESCRT-0 component Hrs, necessary for sorting proteins into the ESCRT pathway and recruiting downstream ESCRT machinery to catalyze multivesicular body (MVB) formation. We find that neuronal activity stimulates the formation of presynaptic endosomes and MVBs, as well as the motility of Hrs+ vesicles in axons and their delivery to SV pools. Hrs+ vesicles co-transport ESCRT-0 component STAM1 and comprise a subset of Rab5+ vesicles, likely representing pro-degradative early endosomes. Furthermore, we identify kinesin motor protein KIF13A as essential for the activity-dependent transport of Hrs to SV pools and the degradation of SV membrane proteins. Together, these data demonstrate a novel activity- and KIF13A-dependent mechanism for mobilizing axonal transport of ESCRT machinery to facilitate the degradation of SV membrane proteins.

AB  - The use of acellular fish skin grafts (FSG) for the treatment of burn wounds is becoming more common due to its beneficial wound healing properties. In our previous study we demonstarted that FSG is a scaffold biomaterial that is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) conjugated to phosphatidylcholines. Here we investigated whether EPA and DHA derived lipid mediators are influenced during the healing of burn wounds treated with FSG. Deep partial and full thickness burn wounds (DPT and FT, respectively) were created on Yorkshire pigs (n = 4). DPT were treated with either FSG or fetal bovine dermis while FT were treated either with FSG or cadaver skin initially and followed by a split thickness skin graft. Punch biopsies were collected on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 and analyzed in respect of changes to approximately 45 derivatives of EPA, DHA, arachidonic acid (AA), and linoleic acid (LA) employing UPLC-MS/MS methodology. Nine EPA and DHA lipid mediators, principally mono-hydroxylated derivatives such as 18-HEPE and 17-HDHA, were significantly higher on day 7 in the DPT when treated with FSG. A similar but non-significant trend was observed for the FT. The results suggest that the use of FSG in burn wound treatment can alter the formation of EPA and DHA mono hydroxylated lipid mediators in comparison to other grafts of mammalian origin. The differences observed during the first seven days after treatment indicates that FSG affects the early stages of wound healing.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and anoikis resistance are crucial characteristics for tumor cell metastasis. High-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) has been identified as a serine protease with chaperone functions, but its role in the regulation of EMT, anoikis resistance, and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified that HTRA1 was downregulated in CRC tissues, and its low expression was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis. Loss of HTRA1 facilitated EMT and anoikis resistance in CRC cells, thereby potentiating metastatic potential both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, HTRA1 overexpression produced opposite effects. Furthermore, we carried out RNA-seq and found that HTRA1 was probably involved in the regulation of Hippo/YAP1 pathway. HTRA1 overexpression led to increased phosphorylation of YAP1 and decreased nuclear translocation, which could be largely reversed by XMU-MP-1, an inhibitor of the Hippo pathway. Mechanistically, HTRA1 directly bound to and stabilized large tumor suppressor gene 2 (LATS2), a key kinase of the Hippo pathway, which contributed to the inactivation of YAP1. Restoring LATS2 expression in HTRA1-deficient CRC cells decreased EMT and anoikis resistance. Altogether, our findings unveiled the negative regulatory function of HTRA1 in CRC progression through the regulation of the Hippo/YAP1 pathway, and supported HTRA1 as a potential therapeutic target in CRC.

AB  - Increasing human population growth worldwide continues to put pressure on waterway quality. Timely diagnosis of human faecal contamination of water remains a major challenge in protecting water quality across the globe. Currently, methods of pathogen-detection in environmental waters - including culturing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - are relatively time-consuming, expensive, and complicated, often requiring technical expertise in a centralised laboratory. The risks to human health and the high economic impact of human faecal pollution drive the need for rapid and reliable detection methods: a field-deployable method to detect the presence of human faecal matter has the potential to dramatically streamline on-site spill-management processes. To meet this need, we optimised an in-field loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) based on the detection of the human-associated Bacteroides 16s rRNA marker, HF183, to specifically identify human faecal pollution in environmental waters. To purify water samples in the field, a rapid filtration protocol and lysis buffer were combined with our Bacteroides LAMP assay (Bac-LAMP). The Bac-LAMP assay can reliably detect less than 2 CFU mu L-1 in a time to positive (TP) of under 10 minutes with no off-target reaction with animal faeces (dog, cat, sheep, cow, quail and horse) commonly found in waterways. A sensitivity and specificity of 100% were seen when compared to the approved United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) TaqMan HF183 qPCR assay. For the first time, this study demonstrates a simplified sampling protocol combined with a LAMP-based assay for the field detection of human faecal contamination in waterways in and around Melbourne, Australia.

AB  - The potential of catalytic hydropyrolysis for the production of value-added chemicals from abundant residual biomass generated during the seasonal pruning of Camellia sinensis tea crops is evaluated. Nickel nanoparticles (similar to 7.2 nm) encapsulated inside the cavity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are prepared using an impregnation method and applied as microreactors in the catalytic hydropyrolysis of both fractionated and unfractionated biomass at atmospheric pressure. Over 86% of nanoparticles are selectively located inside the CNT channel with a Ni content of 13.4 wt % and a surface area of 129.3 m(2). g(-1). The influence of the catalyst/biomass ratio on the product yield and selectivity is examined, and the reaction pathways are discussed. Results reveal that the majority of oxygenated compounds are reformed into long-chain alkanes (50.5%) and aromatic hydrocarbons (33.0%) with a total oxygen content of 3.90% and a low heating value of 41.8 MJ.kg(-1), comparable to commercial fuels.

AB  - The ecological risks and health hazards of heavy metals pollution in Taihu Lake have received widespread concern. This study has developed a species-pollution dataset which includes a large amount of data on heavy metal pollution in Taihu fish. The heavy metal contamination poses a significant threat to human consumption, but no studies have been conducted to assess the risk of exposure to consumption of these fish and to make recommendations for their consumption. In this study, we systematically integrated the relevant data in the dataset, analyzed its contamination level using PI (single pollution index) and MPI (metal pollution index) models, and assessed health hazards of fish consumption using THQ (target hazard quotient) and ILCR (incremental lifetime cancer risk) models. Results showed that the contamination levels of heavy metals in fish varied in a feeding habit and living habit dependent manner. The risk of non-cancer health is the highest from consuming omnivorous fish, then from carnivorous and herbivorous fish. The ILCR model predicted that the long-term Taihu consumption of omnivorous fish may pose a potential carcinogenic risk, especially for children. In all, our study provided a comprehensive understanding on the risk of heavy metals in Taihu. Accordingly, it is recommended that children should try to choose herbivorous fish when consuming fish from Taihu Lake while avoiding long-term consumption of omnivorous fish.

AB  - The paranasal sinuses are a group of hollow spaces within the human skull, surrounding the nose. They are lined with an epithelium that contains mucus-producing cells and tiny hairlike active appendages called cilia. The cilia beat constantly to sweep mucus out of the sinus into the nasal cavity, thus maintaining a clean mucus layer within the sinuses. This process, called mucociliary clearance, is essential for a healthy nasal environment and disruption in mucus clearance leads to diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, specifically in the maxillary sinuses, which are the largest of the paranasal sinuses. We present here a continuum mathematical model of mucociliary clearance inside the human maxillary sinus. Using a combination of analysis and computations, we study the flow of a thin fluid film inside a fluid-producing cavity lined with an active surface: fluid is continuously produced by a wall-normal flux in the cavity and then is swept out, against gravity, due to an effective tangential flow induced by the cilia. We show that a steady layer of mucus develops over the cavity surface only when the rate of ciliary clearance exceeds a threshold, which itself depends on the rate of mucus production. We then use a scaling analysis, which highlights the competition between gravitational retention and cilia-driven drainage of mucus, to rationalise our computational results. We discuss the biological relevance of our findings, noting that measurements of mucus production and clearance rates in healthy sinuses fall within our predicted regime of steady-state mucus layer development.

AB  - When measuring real-time in vivo muscle fatigue with electromyography (EMG), data collection can be compromised by premature sensor removal or environmental noise; therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a postmortem in vivo methodology to induce muscle fatigue and measure it using EMG. Barrows (N = 20) were stratified by weight and randomly allocated into one of two treatments. The treatments consisted of barrows being subjected to a hog electric stunner super-contraction cycle (ES) or not (CON) postmortem. The right hind limb bicep femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) were selected for ambulatory movement simulation using electronic muscle stimulation (EMS). Muscle workload during EMS was measured with EMG using median power frequency (MdPF) and root mean square (RMS) as indicators of action potential velocity and muscle fiber recruitment. Ambulatory movement was induced and recorded for 20 min with a 4:4 duty cycle at 70 Hz. Muscle biopsies were collected pre- and post-EMS for metabolite analyses to corroborate muscle fatigue onset. There was a TRT x Muscle interaction for normalized RMS percentage (p < 0.01), where BF from CON barrows had greater values (p < 0.01). There were no interactions or TRT main effects for the MdPF normalized value (p >= 0.25), but there were Period and muscle effects on MdPF (p < 0.01). Bicep femoris had smaller (p < 0.01) MdPF than ST. The percentage of MdPF decreased (p < 0.01) by Period 5 compared to the other Periods, which did not differ from each other (p >= 0.38). There were TRT x Muscle and Muscle x Period interactions for ATP muscle concentration (p <= 0.03). The concentration of CON BF ATP was greater (p < 0.01) than that of ES BF and CON and ES ST, which did not differ from each other (p >= 0.11), but the APT concentration tended to differ between ES BF and ES ST (p = 0.06). Semitendinosus ATP concentration decreased (p < 0.01) post-EMS compared to ST pre- and BF pre- and post-EMS (p >= 0.29), but BF and ST concentration tended to differ pre-EMS (p = 0.07). The data indicated that EMS is a valuable tool for replicating ambulatory movement or physical activity, but super-contraction is not a means to accelerate postmortem muscle fatigue onset. Therefore, further refinement, such as longer EMS stimulation time, should be considered.

AB  - Modern agriculture prioritizes eco-friendly and sustainable strategies to enhance crop growth and productivity. The utilization of protein hydrolysate extracted from chicken feather waste as a plant biostimulant paves the path to waste recycling. A greenhouse experiment was performed to evaluate the implications of different doses (0, 1, 2, and 3 g L-1) of chicken feather protein hydrolysate (CFPH), application method (soil and foliar), and fertilizer rate (50% and 100%) on the growth performance of tea nursery plants. The highest dose of CFPH (3 g L-1) increased the shoot and root dry weights by 43% and 70%, respectively over control. However, no significant differences were observed between 2 and 3 g L-1 doses in plant dry weight, biometric, and root morphological parameters. Foliar application of CFPH significantly increased all the growth parameters compared to soil drenching except N, P, and K concentrations in leaves and roots. Plants grown under 100% fertilizer rate showed better growth performance than 50% fertilizer rate. Tea nursery plants treated with foliar 2 g L-1 dose and grown under full fertilizer rate recorded the highest plant dry weight, root length, and root surface area. However, tea plants under 50% fertilizer rate and treated with foliar 2 and 3 g L-1 doses sustained the growth similar to untreated plants under 100% fertilizer rate. The significantly higher N, P, and K concentrations in leaves were observed in plants treated with soil drenching of 2 and 3 g L-1 CFPH doses under 100% fertilizer rate. Our results indicate that the application of CFPH as a foliar spray is highly effective in producing vigorous tea nursery plants suitable for field planting, eventually capable of withstanding stress and higher yield.

AB  - The aerial surfaces of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) and common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) are covered with a layer of epidermal bladder cells (EBCs), which are modified non-glandular trichomes previously considered to be key to the extreme salt and drought tolerance of these plants. Here, however, we find that EBCs of these plants play only minor roles, if any, in abiotic stress tolerance and in fact are detrimental under conditions of water deficit. We report that EBCs instead function as deterrents to a broad range of generalist arthropod herbivores, through their combined function of forming both a chemical and a physical barrier, and they also serve a protective function against a phytopathogen. Our study overturns current models that link EBCs to salt and drought tolerance and assigns new functions to these structures that might provide novel possibilities for protecting crops from arthropod pests.

AB  - The hippocampus occupies a central role in mammalian navigation and memory. Yet an understanding of the rules that govern the statistics and granularity of the spatial code, as well as its interactions with perceptual stimuli, is lacking. We analyzed CA1 place cell activity recorded while rats foraged in different large-scale environments. We found that place cell activity was subject to an unexpected but precise homeostasis-the distribution of activity in the population as a whole being constant at all locations within and between environments. Using a virtual reconstruction of the largest environment, we showed that the rate of transition through this statistically stable population matches the rate of change in the animals' visual scene. Thus, place fields near boundaries were small but numerous, while in the environment's interior, they were larger but more dispersed. These results indicate that hippocampal spatial activity is governed by a small number of simple laws and, in particular, suggest the presence of an information-theoretic bound imposed by perception on the fidelity of the spatial memory system.

AB  - Accumulation of potentially toxic elements in soil and tea leaves is a particular concern for tea consumers worldwide. However, the contents of potentially toxic elements and their potential health and ecological risks in Chinese tea gardens have rarely been investigated on the national scale. In this study, we collected 225 paired soil and tea plant samples from 45 tea gardens in 15 provinces of China to survey the current risk of potentially toxic element accumulation in Chinese tea gardens. The results suggest that the average contents of most trace metals in rhizosphere soils meet the risk control standard for agricultural land in China. However, the mean contents of As, Cr, Cd, Zn, Cu, and Ni in rhizosphere soils were 1.94, 2.14, 1.23, 1.15, 1.18, and 1.19 times their corresponding background soil values in China. Cd had the highest geo-accumulation index, followed by As, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, and Mn in rhizosphere soils. Nearly 2.22% and 4.44% of soils were moderately to heavily contaminated with As and Cd, respectively. The risk index ranged from 18.0 to 292, with an average value of 90.0, indicating low to moderate ecological risk in Chinese tea gardens. This is the first national-scale reconnaissance of trace metals in tea across China. Our findings provide a useful reference for ensuring the quality and safety of tea production and mitigating the risk of toxic element accumulation in tea. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In adult cornu ammonis hippocampi, erythropoietin (EPO) expression drives the differentiation of new neurons, independent of DNA synthesis, and increases dendritic spine density. This substantial brain hardware upgrade is part of a regulatory circle: during motor-cognitive challenge, neurons experience "functional" hypoxia, triggering neuronal EPO production, which in turn promotes improved performance. Here, we show an unexpected involvement of resident microglia. During EPO upregulation and stimulated neurodifferentiation, either by functional or inspiratory hypoxia, microglia numbers decrease. Treating mice with recombinant human (rh)EPO or exposure to hypoxia recapitulates these changes and reveals the involvement of neuronally expressed IL-34 and microglial CSF1R. Surprisingly, EPO affects microglia in phases, initially by inducing apoptosis, later by reducing proliferation, and overall dampens microglia activity and metabolism, as verified by selective genetic targeting of either the microglial or pyramidal neuronal EPO receptor. We suggest that during accelerating neuronal differentiation, EPO acts as regulator of the CSF1R-dependent microglia.

AB  - The G-protein coupled receptor 39 (GPR39) is gaining increasing attention as a target for future drugs, yet there are gaps in the understanding of its pharmacology. Zinc is an endogenous agonist or an allosteric modulator, while TC-G 1008 is a synthetic, small molecule agonist. Zinc is also a positive allosteric modulator for the activity of TC-G 1008 at GPR39. Activation of GPR39 by TC-G 1008 facilitated the development of epileptogenesis in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling model of epilepsy. Congruently, TC-G 1008 decreased the seizure threshold in the maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) test. Here, we investigated the effects of TC-G 1008 under the condition of zinc deficiency. Mice were fed a zinc-adequate diet (ZnA, 50 mg Zn/kg) or a zinc-deficient diet (ZnD, 3 mg Zn/kg) for 4 weeks. Following 4 weeks of dietary zinc restriction, TC-G 1008 was administered as a single dose and the MEST test was performed. Additional groups of mice began the PTZ-kindling model during which TC-G 1008 was administered repeatedly and the diet was continued. TC-G 1008 administered acutely decreased the seizure threshold in the MEST test in mice fed the ZnD diet but not in mice fed the ZnA diet. TC-G 1008 administered chronically increased the maximal seizure severity and the percentage of fully kindled mice in those fed the ZnA diet, but not in mice fed the ZnD diet.

AB  - High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.

AB  - Most cancer deaths are caused by secondary metastasized tumors. The cells that spread these tumors are known as circulating tumor cells (CTCs). They exist in a dynamic environment, including exposure to fluid shear stress (FSS) that makes them susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. There are questions about the similarities of CTCs to cancer stem cells (CSCs) and whether the stem cell-like characteristics of CTCs allow them to proliferate and spread despite the biophysical obstacles during the metastatic process. One of those qualities is the ability to undergo the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were modeled as CTCs by prolonged exposure to FSS using a spinner flask. They were tested for ROS generation, CSC, EMT, and Hippo pathway gene and protein markers using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231 did not show significant changes in CSC markers, but did show significant changes in ROS, EMT, and Hippo markers (p < 0.05). Similarly, MCF7 showed significant changes in ROS and EMT markers (p < 0.05). Furthermore, both cell lines demonstrated the reverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition signature when allowed to recover after FSS. These results suggest that the degree of their stemness or aggressiveness affects their responses to externally applied biophysical forces and demonstrates a potential link between mechanotransduction, the Hippo pathway, and the induction of EMT in breast cancer cells.

AB  - Cryopreservation of articular cartilage will increase tissue availability for osteochondral allografting and improve clinical outcomes. However, successful cryopreservation of articular cartilage requires the precise determination of cryoprotectant permeation kinetics to develop effective vitrification protocols. To date, permeation kinetics of the cryoprotectant formamide in articular cartilage have not been sufficiently explored. The objective of this study was to determine the permeation kinetics of formamide into porcine articular cartilage for application in vitrification. The permeation of dimethyl sulfoxide was first measured to validate existing methods from our previously published literature. Osteochondral dowels from dissected porcine femoral condyles were incubated in 6.5 M dimethyl sulfoxide for a designated treatment time (1 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 180 min, 24 h) at 22 degrees C (N = 3). Methods were then repeated with 6.5 M formamide at one of three temperatures: 4 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 37 degrees C (N = 3). Following incubation, cryoprotectant efflux into a wash solution occurred, and osmolality was measured from each equilibrated wash solution. Concentrations of effluxed cryoprotectant were calculated and diffusion coefficients were determined using an analytical solution to Fick's law for axial and radial diffusion in combination with a least squares approach. The activation energy of formamide was determined from the Arrhenius equation. The diffusion coefficient (2.7-3.3 x 10-10 m2/s depending on temperature) and activation energy (0.9 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol) for formamide permeation in porcine articular cartilage were established. The determined permeation kinetics of formamide will facilitate its precise use in future articular cartilage vitrification protocols.

AB  - Dientamoeba fragilis is a flagellated protozoan with amoeba-like morphology that inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract. It is endemic in a vast geography around the world, including developed countries. There are limited studies on non-human hosts of the parasite, and suitable hosts have not been clarified. The parasite has been detected in non-human primates, pigs, cats, dogs and rats. There is no study in the literature investigating and detecting the presence of this parasite in cattle. In this study, stool samples taken from 163 different cattle and calves from 11 different farms between March 2017 and May 2022 were examined for the detection of D. fragilis via PCR. Trichrome staining was performed on all PCR-positive samples. The isolates with the expected amplicon size were sequenced using the 18S ribosomal RNA region, and their genotypes were determined by BLAST analysis. Sequences were analysed with the most similar and reference sequences in the literature, forming a phylogenetic tree. We detected D. fragilis in 31 (19.01%) of the 163 stool samples. D. fragilis cysts/trophozoites were detected by trichrome staining method in six of 31 samples. All PCR products selected for molecular analysis from positive samples had the same nucleotide sequence. As a result of BLAST analysis, all sequences were determined to belong to D. fragilis genotype 1. This study determined for the first time that cattle are suitable hosts for D. fragilis. Furthermore, the parasite subtype we detected belongs to genotype 1, which is the most common type in humans, suggesting that the parasite may have a zoonotic character. Our result is important in terms of the epidemiology of the parasite, as the mode of transmission is controversial, and available data on its suitable hosts are limited.

AB  - The inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays a role in both acute and chronic organ allotransplant rejection. Data suggest that IL-6 inhibition may help prevent or reverse rejection, with large multi-center trials now underway. However, the evidence for the benefit of IL-6 inhibitors in xenotransplantation is limited. IL-6 inhibition has been explored in nonhuman-primate models of xenotransplantation, but no clear consensus exists on its efficacy or the best mode of IL-6 inhibition (anti-IL-6 antibodies, or through IL-6 receptor [IL-6R] blockade). Extra considerations for IL-6 blockade exist in xenotransplantation, as both recipient (human) and xenograftderived (porcine) IL-6 may play roles. The systemic inflammation seen in xenograft recipients (SIXR) contributes to significant morbidity and mortality for the recipient through coagulation dysfunction and augmentation of the immune response. Anti-IL-6 antibodies (e.g., siltuximab) bind to human IL-6 and prevent IL-6R activation, but do not bind to porcine IL-6, and so have no effect in preventing graft-driven inflammatory processes. In contrast, IL6R inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) inhibit IL-6 activity by blocking binding of human and porcine IL-6 to human IL6R. Although IL-6R blockade cannot prevent the effect of IL-6 on porcine cells, it probably prevents graft-derived IL-6 from contributing to an inflammatory response in the host. This review outlines the role of IL-6 in xenotransplantation and discusses mechanisms for inhibiting IL-6 to improve recipient survival.

AB  - Our previous studies have established that intrathecal oxytocin (OT) and angiotensin IV (Ang IV) injections induce antihyperalgesia and antiallodynia in rodents. Ang IV, a renin-angiotensin system hexapeptide, acts as an endogenous inhibitor that inhibits the oxytocin-degrading enzyme insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). The pain inhibitory effects by Ang IV were found to be through its inhibition on IRAP to potentiate the effect of OT. However, these effects were found to be with a significant sex difference, which could be partially due to the higher expression of IRAP at the spinal cords of female. Therefore, we synthesized Ang IV and OT conjugates connected with a peptide bond and tested for their effects on hyperalgesia and allodynia. Carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia and partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) were performed using rat models. Conjugates Ang IV-OT (Ang IV at the N-terminal) and OT-Ang IV (OT at the N-terminal) were synthesized and intrathecally injected into male and female rats. Our results showed that Ang IV-OT exhibited prominent antihyperalgesia in male rats, particularly during hyperalgesia recovery, whereas OT-Ang IV was more effective during development stage. Ang IV-OT showed clear antihyperalgesia in female rats, but OT-Ang IV had no significant effect. Notably, both conjugates alleviated neuropathic allodynia in male rats; however, OT-Ang IV had no effect in female rats, whereas Ang IV-OT induced significant antiallodynia. In conclusion, Ang IV-OT has greater therapeutic potential for treating hyperalgesia and allodynia than OT-Ang IV. Its effects were not affected by sex, unlike those of OT and OT-Ang IV, extending its possible clinical applications.

AB  - The vermicomposting process using sugarcane bagasse as substrate with cow dung and elephant dung were evaluated by using earthworm Eudrilus eugeniae. The significant of the current study to create a biological alternative and humification process for open-air decomposed debris of sugarcane crop residue and animal dungs by using earthworm. FT-IR and GC-MS analysis was performed to determine the maturity and stability stage of vermicompost in the initial and 90th day substrates. The zero day raw material had found 25 organic compounds which was increased to 30 compounds after 90th day of vermicomposting. FT-IR spectroscopy demonstrated that distinct biochemical functional groups included in wastes, underwent variable chemical changes and turnover during vermicomposting. GC-MS profile revealed that existence of numerous humic acids in the predominant level of metabolites and disintegrating compounds viz., Hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (14.89%), Benzenepropanoic acid 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-methylester (108.53%), Octadecanoic acid (8.98%), Dodecanoic acid methyl ester (1.99%), Methyl tetradecanoate (1.36%) and interestingly absence of toxic compounds, its clearly demonstrating as an indicator of substrate maturity. All the biochemical compounds are considered biologically and pharmacologically important and this was supported by a fall in the humification index, which focuses on the joint action of earthworms and bacteria in the decomposition of organic substrates. The technique FT-IR verified the mineralization process and formation of a significant amount of carboxylic and aliphatic group degradation and GC-MS profile found the turnover of different organic components in chemical footprints and it were proved to be more promising fast, reliable and conventional method. Therefore, the current study can be regarded as a comprehensive eco-biochemical method that will open a new vista on the significance of sugarcane bagasse for solid waste management. Finally, it was found that the amount of solid waste dumped in landfills could be greatly reduced and that industrial waste could be transformed into high-quality vermicompost.

AB  - BackgroundInsects rely on chemosensory perception, mainly olfaction, for the location of mates, food sources, and oviposition sites. Plant-released volatile compounds guide herbivorous insects to search for and locate their host plants, further helping them to identify suitable positions for oviposition. The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (S. frugiperda) was found to invade China in 2019 and has since seriously threatened multiple crops, particularly maize and rice. However, the chemical and molecular mechanisms underlying oviposition preference in this pest are not fully understood. Here, the oviposition preference of S. frugiperda on maize and rice plants was investigated.ResultsGC-EAD and GC-MS/MS techniques were used to identify the antennally active volatiles from maize and rice plants. The attraction and oviposition stimulation of identified components to female adults were tested in both laboratory and field settings. The odorant receptors (ORs) on female antennae were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their functions evaluated by RNAi. Ten and eleven compounds of maize and rice plants, respectively, were identified to possess electrophysiological activity from headspace volatiles. Among these compounds, (Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate specifically presented in maize volatiles was found to play a critical role in attracting females and stimulating oviposition compared to rice volatiles. Among the cloned ORs on the antennae of both sexes, SfruOR23 with highly female-biased expression mediated the responses of females to (Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate. Knockdown of SfruOR23 using RNAi markedly reduced the electrophysiological response of female antennae and oviposition preference to the compound.Conclusions(Z)-3-Hexenyl-acetate is a key volatile mediating the host and oviposition preference of S. frugiperda on maize. The olfactory receptor of (Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate was identified to be SfruOR23, which is mainly expressed in the antennae of S. frugiperda.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) are among the most important mycotoxins with common presence in bread and bakery products. Biological detoxification of mould food spoilage and mycotoxin contamination by lactic acid bacteria (LABs) exhibits high potential on a cost-effective and large scale. In this work, the effect of Lactobacillus strains isolated from goat milk whey on reducing AFB1 and OTA during bread making was evaluated by the determination of mycotoxin reduction potential of 12 LAB strains after 72 h incubation in De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth (37 & DEG;C). The most effective LABs were lyophilized and added as ingredient in bread formulation, analysing mycotoxins by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry after bread fermentation and baking. RESULTSAFB1 was reduced in MRS broth by seven LABs (11-35%), highlighting Lactobacillus plantarum B3 activity; while all LABs reduced OTA (12-40%) with L. plantarum B3 and Lactobacillus paracasei B10 as the most active strains. Both LABs were lyophilized and added in contaminated bread with and without yeast, reaching AFB1 and OTA reductions up to 27% and 32% respectively in dough and up to 55% and 34% respectively in bread. CONCLUSIONThe selected strains significantly reduced AFB1 and OTA during bread fermentation, pointing to a potential biocontrol strategy for mycotoxins detoxification in bread and bakery products. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Simple Summary Researching and developing an automated and intelligent method to monitor the pangolin breeding process can effectively help human observation, analysis, breeding and daily behavior studies of pangolins, and has significant implications for the protection and breeding research of pangolin populations. In this paper, a pangolin breeding attention and temporal relative network (PBATn) was used to monitor and identify the breeding and daily behaviors of pangolins. This study demonstrates that the deep learning system can accurately observe pangolin breeding behavior, rendering it useful for analyzing the behavior of these animals.Abstract With declining populations in the wild, captive rescue and breeding have become one of the most important ways to protect pangolins from extinction. At present, the success rate of artificial breeding is low, due to the insufficient understanding of the breeding behavior characteristics of pangolins. The automatic recognition method based on machine vision not only monitors for 24 h but also reduces the stress response of pangolins. This paper aimed to establish a temporal relation and attention mechanism network (Pangolin breeding attention and transfer network, PBATn) to monitor and recognize pangolin behaviors, including breeding and daily behavior. There were 11,476 videos including breeding behavior and daily behavior that were divided into training, validation, and test sets. For the training set and validation set, the PBATn network model had an accuracy of 98.95% and 96.11%, and a loss function value of 0.1531 and 0.1852. The model is suitable for a 2.40 m x 2.20 m (length x width) pangolin cage area, with a nest box measuring 40 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm (length x width x height) positioned either on the left or right side inside the cage. A spherical night-vision monitoring camera was installed on the cage wall at a height of 2.50 m above the ground. For the test set, the mean Average Precision (mAP), average accuracy, average recall, average specificity, and average F1 score were found to be higher than SlowFast, X3D, TANet, TSN, etc., with values of 97.50%, 99.17%, 97.55%, 99.53%, and 97.48%, respectively. The recognition accuracies of PBATn were 94.00% and 98.50% for the chasing and mounting breeding behaviors, respectively. The results showed that PBATn outperformed the baseline methods in all aspects. This study shows that the deep learning system can accurately observe pangolin breeding behavior and it will be useful for analyzing the behavior of these animals.

AB  - Tea is the most popular non-alcoholic beverage with immense medicinal and therapeutic value. The tea leaves harvested at various seasons from two tea gardens were assessed for their biochemical concentrations and potential antibacterial activities against various bacteria. The total polyphenol content, total flavonoid content and tannin content for lower altitude tea leaves ranged from 315.02 to 452.78 mg g-1, 124.77 to 197.46 mg g-1and 14.97 to 21.97 mg g-1, respectively, whereas, it ranged from 298.10 to 403.72 mg g-1, 111.78 to 184.89 mg g-1and 13.82 to 19.69 mg g-1, respectively, for higher altitude tea leaves. Except for tannin content in lower altitude tea leaves, all biochemicals exhibited higher concentrations in spring tea as compared to other seasons. The tea leaves extract also showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria. The spring and winter tea exhibited the highest and the least antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria, respectively. Between tea gardens, the lower altitude tea leaves extract had higher biochemical concentrations and exhibited greater antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens in most seasons. A strong direct correlation was established between the inhibition zone and tea leaves biochemicals whereas, minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration had an inverse correlation with tea leaves biochemicals. The study further elucidates the dependence of tea extracts antimicrobial potency on bacterial species where gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive as compared to gram-negative. This research sheds light on tea leaves as a promising source of natural antimicrobials and discloses the importance of its harvesting season as well as the location for their biochemicals and antimicrobial activities.

AB  - Simple Summary As global warming continues, the increased frequency and intensity of high ambient temperatures imposes heat stress (HS) on farm animals and human beings. Pigs are susceptible to heat exposure; decreased performance and increased morbidity due to HS give rise to economic losses for the swine industry. HS induces oxidative stress and apoptosis, both of which are associated with compromised intestinal barrier integrity. Trehalose (Tre) is a natural disaccharide that is considered a health-promoting food owing to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and its molecular chaperone ability to inhibit protein denaturation. The present study aimed to determine the optimum trehalose level for alleviating HS-induced intestinal porcine epithelial cell (IPEC-J2) insults and to uncover the molecular mechanism of the protective effects of Tre. This study demonstrated that 10 mM trehalose can significantly attenuate HS-induced IPEC-J2 cell impairment and that the mechanism is related to trehalose alleviating oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of trehalose (Tre) on antioxidant capacity, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) response and apoptosis of heat-stressed intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). IPEC-J2 cells were cultured at 37 degrees C until the end of the experiment (control, CON); exposed to heat stress for 2 h (43 degrees C, HS); or pretreated with 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and 15 mM trehalose at 37 degrees C for 4 h prior to heat stress exposure for 2 h. The optimum level of trehalose for protecting against HS-induced cell injuries was determined to be 10 mM, as evidenced by the highest cellular viability and lowest malondialdehyde (MDA) content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Based on these, IPEC-J2 cells were divided into three groups: the first group was cultured at 37 degrees C until the end of the experiment (control, CON); the second group was exposed to heat stress for 2 h (43 degrees C, HS); the third group was pretreated with 10 mM trehalose for 4 h at 37 degrees C prior to heat stress exposure for 2 h (Tre + HS). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) changes, and expressions of the manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), ERS and apoptosis-related proteins were determined. Compared to the CON group, HS significantly increased ROS generation (p < 0.01), decreased SOD activity (p < 0.05), and downregulated protein expression of SOD2 (p < 0.01). Compared to the HS group, Tre supplementation reduced ROS levels and increased SOD activity and SOD2 expression to the levels that were comparable to the control (p < 0.05). The HS-induced ERS response was evidenced by the increased protein expressions of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) (p < 0.01), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (p-eif2 alpha) (p < 0.01), transcription activator 4 (ATF4) (p < 0.01), and the protein expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (p < 0.01), which were the four hallmarks of ERS. The Tre + HS group showed lower expressions of GRP78 (p < 0.01), p-eif2 alpha (p < 0.01), ATF4 (p < 0.01), and CHOP (p < 0.01) than that of the HS group. Tre pretreatment attenuated HS-induced mitochondrial apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells, demonstrated by the increased MMP and decreased proapoptotic proteins active caspase 3, Bax, and cytochrome c (Cyt c).
   Taken together, trehalose can protect against HS-induced oxidative damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells.
   These data may provide a nutritional strategy for alleviating heat stress in pig production.

AB  - Coronaviruses caused an outbreak pandemic disease characterized by a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to the infection of more than 200 million patients and the death of more than 4 million individuals. The primary treatment is either supportive or symptomatic. Natural products have an important role in the development of various drugs. Thus, screening of natural compounds with reported antiviral activities can lead to the discovery of potential inhibitory entities against coronaviruses. In the current study, an in-silico molecular docking experiment was conducted on the effects of some of these natural antiviral phytoconstituents, (e.g., procyanidin B2, theaflavin, quercetin, ellagic acid, caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, berginin, eudesm-1 beta, 6 alpha, 11-triol and arbutin), on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB ID: 6w63) using AutoDock-Vina software. Many of the docked compounds revealed good binding affinity, with procyanidin B2 (-8.6 Kcal/mol) and theaflavin (-8.5 Kcal/mol) showing a better or similar binding score as the ligand (-8.5 Kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out at 100 ns and revealed that procyanidin B2 forms a more stable complex with SARS-CoV-2 main protease than theaflavin. Procyanidin B2, theaflavin, and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were evaluated for toxicity by ProTox-II webserver and were non-toxic according to the predicted LD50 values and safe on different organs and pathways. Additionally, these phytoconstituents showed good ADME properties and acceptable lipophilicity, as evaluated using WLOGP. Amongst the tested compounds, procyanidin B2 showed the highest lipophilic value. It is worth mentioning that these natural inhibitiors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease are components of green and black tea that can be used as a supporting supplement for COVID patients or as potential nuclei for further drug design and development campaigns.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Di Dang Tang is a classic formula from Shang Han Lun, originally used to treat conditions such as blood stasis and heat accumulation. It is widely applied in the treatment of diabetes and its complications, but its effects on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus-related Cognitive Dysfunction (T2DM-CD) remain unclear. Aim of the study: The study aimed to investigate the metabolic characteristics of patients with T2DM-CD. Additionally, it sought to evaluate the effects of Di Dang Tang on cognitive function in T2DM-CD model rats by targeting the metabolic pathways identified in the clinical analysis, exploring the underlying mechanisms through animal experiments. Methods: Fasting venous serum was collected from patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) to detect metabolism-related products, and KEGG annotation analysis was performed. Separately, thirty rats were randomly divided using a random number table method, with six rats selected as the blank control group. Twenty-four successfully modeled rats were then randomly divided into the model group and three Di Dang Tang groups (low, medium, and high doses). After administering the medication, the relevant indicators in the rats were assessed. Results: Clinical metabolomics detected 32 key differential metabolites between the T2DM-CD and the blank control groups. Between the T2DM-CD and T2DM groups, 29 key differential metabolites were identified. In animal experiments, blood glucose levels in the model group were significantly higher compared to the blank control group at the same time points, whereas the high dose groups of Di Dang Tang exhibited reduced blood glucose levels at weeks 6 and 8 relative to the model group. In the Morris water maze test, the model group had longer escape latencies than the blank control group. The medium and high dose groups of Di Dang Tang showed shorter latencies. Additionally, compared to the model group, the Di Dang Tang groups spent more time and covered more distance in the target quadrant but had reduced average proximity and fewer platform entries. HE staining observation of the hippocampal CA1 area showed no apparent pathological changes in the blank group, obvious pathological damage in the model group, and no significant pathological changes in the medium and high dose groups of Di Dang Tang. Compared to the blank control group, the model group showed significant increases in the levels of Arachidonic Acid (AA), Ceramide (Cer), Glutamate (Glu), TNF- alpha, IL-1 beta, TG, and LDL-C, and a significant decrease in HDL-C levels. Compared to the model group, the groups of Di Dang Tang significantly modulated the levels of the above indicators. In Western Blot (WB) assays, compared to the blank control group, the model group rats exhibited significantly higher levels of cPLA2, PKC, ERK, and JNK , and significantly lower levels of claudin-5, NMDA, CaMKII, CREB, and BDNF. The Di Dang Tang groups significantly altered the levels of the above indicators compared to the model group. Conclusion: Amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid signaling pathways, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and various signaling pathways play significant roles in the pathogenesis of T2DM-CD. Di Dang Tang can improve learning and memory abilities in T2DM model rats and ameliorate cognitive impairments, potentially by regulating metabolic levels and inflammatory responses.

To overcome the deleterious effect of herbivory, pesticides are used but long-term usage of pesticides can be harmful to the environment and human health. Understanding the plants' inherent defense mechanism by interpreting the interaction pattern of defense-related proteins and signalling components and manipulating them to strengthen defense status, is one of the alternative approaches of green biotechnology. During insect attack, host plants initiate innumerable signalling pathways to activate defense response; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Pathway is a crucial component of signalling pathway that regulate the expression of downstream defense-related genes. MAPK pathway has three components: MAPKKK, MAPKK and MAPK. Earlier studies have shown participation of SIPK and WIPK (MAPKs) as well as MEK2 (MAPKK) during insect infestation and its association with plant defense. However, information on the third component and elucidation of the complete MAPK pathway are still elusive. Therefore, this study aims to identify the unknown component and decipher MAPK pathway in Nicotiana attenuata involved in plant defense against herbivory by identifying herbivory-inducible MAPKKKs and and their interaction with known partners of the MAPK pathway by docking and MD simulation. The possible pathway was predicted to be MAPKKK Na12134/Na04522-MEK2-SIPK/WIPK. Further, validation of the above interaction by in vitro and in vivo methods is highly recommended.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - Introduction: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) include decreased volume, increased signal intensity, and hippocampal gray-white matter boundary blurring (HGWBB). Given that the layered structure is obscure in HS, there have been no reports on the quantita-tive evaluation of HGWBB and its relationship with the clinical outcome. Thus, this study aims to corre-late the extent of HGWBB to its clinical manifestation of HS.Methods: Fifty-four patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent hippocampal resection were enrolled. To evaluate HGWBB quantitatively, we defined an index by calculating the standard deviation of the intrahippocampal signal on short tau inversion recovery. In addition, we created a prognostic scor-ing system using four criteria, including hippocampal signal intensity, size of hippocampal cross-sectional area, presence of temporal lobe lesions, and the HGWBB index.Results: The HGWBB index was significantly lower on the affected side than on the unaffected side (p < 0.001). This trend was more prominent in the poor prognosis group than that in the good prognosis group. The prognostic scoring system revealed that when three or more criteria were positive, the prog-nostic accuracy reached 87.5% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity.Conclusion: The HGWBB index is useful for the diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy with HS and for pre-dicting seizure outcomes when used with another index of hippocampal volume loss and increased signal intensity.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by extrapyramidal motor disturbances and nonmotor cognitive impairments which impact activities of daily living. Although the etiology of PD is still obscure, autopsy reports suggest that oxidative stress (OS) is one of the important factors in the pathophysiology of PD. In the current study, we have investigated the impact of OS in PD by measuring the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) levels from the substantia nigra (SN), left hippocampus (LH) and neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) levels from SN region. Concomitant quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) from SN and LH was also acquired from thirty-eight PD patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Glutathione levels in the SN region decreased significantly and susceptibility increased significantly in PD compared to HC. Nonsignificant depletion of GABA was observed in the SN region. GSH levels in the LH region were depleted significantly, but LH susceptibility did not alter in the PD cohort compared to HC. Neuropsychological and physical assessment demonstrated significant impairment of cognitive functioning in PD patients compared to HC. GSH depletion was negatively correlated to motor function performance. Multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on the combined effect of GSH, GABA, and susceptibility in the SN region yielded an improved diagnostic accuracy of 86.1% compared to individual diagnostic accuracy based on GSH (65.8%), GABA (57.5%), and susceptibility (69.6%). This is the first comprehensive report in PD demonstrating significant GSH depletion as well as concomitant iron enhancement in the SN region.

AB  - Human adaptation to the extreme environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has drawn widespread attention as a case study on how to successfully deal with environmental changes. However, little is known about the human subsistence strategy on the QTP during the Younger Dryas (YD) cold event due to limited findings on bioarcheological remains. In this study, animal exploitation during the YD on the northeastern QTP (NEQTP) was explored through hearth sediment analysis at the Bronze Wire site. The results support the food preparation function of these hearths and indicate the preservation of fuel plant lipids as well as terrestrial non-ruminant animal fat. The absence of ruminant herbivorous fats and freshwater resources implies a hostile surrounding environment during the YD, where small-sized animals with higher tolerance may have dominated and could have thus been the main source of non-ruminant animal fat in the hearths. Although the shift to a broadspectrum pattern was not thought to be the direct result of environmental change, it could have greatly influenced such a process in certain areas. Lipid residue analysis has been applied for the first time for hearth study on the NEQTP, showing great potential in understanding human behaviour regarding subsistence strategies in the Paleolithic Age.

AB  - Hemorrhagic shock (HS) leads to systemic hypoperfusion, impaired tissue oxygenation, and multi-organ dysfunction, including central nervous system (CNS) injury. Guanosine and inosine, purine nucleosides with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, have demonstrated beneficial effects in models of neurotoxicity, ischemia, and septic shock. This study evaluated the acute effects of guanosine and inosine in fluid resuscitation, focusing on brain energy metabolism, neuroinflammatory mechanisms, and hemodynamic responses in a porcine model of HS. Thirty pigs (25-30 kg) underwent controlled hemorrhage to achieve a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 - 45 mmHg, maintained for 60 min. Animals were randomized into three resuscitation groups: Lactated Ringer's solution (LR), LR + guanosine (1 mmol/L), and LR + inosine (1 mmol/L), administered over 15 - 20 min. Hemodynamic, metabolic, and neuronal parameters were monitored for 440 min post-HS, with serial blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling to assess glutamate, lactate, glucose, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and inflammatory cytokines. HS induced metabolic acidosis, increased CSF glutamate levels, and elevated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-8). Guanosine and inosine reduced glutamate levels more rapidly than LR alone and attenuated IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha elevations. Inosine resuscitation improved MAP, systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), suggesting enhanced hemodynamic stabilization. Guanosine and inosine modulated neuroinflammatory and metabolic responses in HS, reducing excitotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine release. Inosine also demonstrated hemodynamic benefits. These findings support further investigation into their therapeutic potential in shock resuscitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND In recent decades, grain amaranths have attracted attention due to their valuable combination of nutritional traits, with higher protein and oil content than conventional cereals. Before they can be proposed as an unconventional ingredient in animal feed, many aspects still need to be investigated from field production to nutritive value. The present research aimed to study the agronomic traits, proximate composition, and digestibility/degradability, fatty acid profile, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic content of two grain amaranth species, Amaranthus cruentus and Amaranthus hypochondriacus (for a total of six accessions), grown in a Mediterranean environment. RESULTS Both species showed seed yields comparable to or higher than the traditional cereal crops in the same environment. On the whole, A. cruentus resulted in a higher seed production than A. hypochondriacus. Mexico and Montana accessions, both belonging to A. cruentus, showed the highest yield (3.73 t ha(-1), on average). Few differences emerged in nutritive value between species and accessions: the Illinois accession of A. cruentus showed the best performance in terms of in vitro degradability and gas production, but not for volatile fatty acid production; the fermentation kinetics was slowest in the Illinois accession and fastest in the Montana accession of A. cruentus and the India accession of A. hypochondriacus. CONCLUSION From a health perspective, the Nebraska accession of A. hypochondriacus represents the best accession, with the lowest saturated fatty acid content and the highest polyunsaturated fatty acid content.

AB  - Drilling for implant site preparation generates heat, which can cause bone necrosis if temperatures exceed 47 degrees C for over a minute. Factors influencing heat include drill size, speed, pressure, irrigation, and tool wear. Frequent drill replacement is essential, as wear from repeated use and sterilization affects performance. This study compared three pilot drills with similar designs from different manufacturers, testing each on pig ribs for 15 perforations after 15 sterilization cycles. Researchers measured temperature increase, drilling time, and surface wear. Results showed that drill no. 1 generated more heat than drills no. 2 and no. 3, though none reached critical temperatures. Drill no. 2 took the longest to reach the desired depth and displayed the most deformation. Findings highlight the importance of adhering to the recommended operational limits, suggesting that drills should be replaced after 15 cycles to ensure efficacy and patient safety.

AB  - The C2H2-zinc finger protein (C2H2-ZFP) is essential for the regulation of plant development and widely responsive to diverse stresses including drought, cold and salt stress, further affecting the late flavonoid accumulation in higher plants. Tea is known as a popular beverage worldwide and its quality is greatly dependent on the physiological status and growing environment of the tea plant. To date, the understanding of C2H2-ZFP gene family in Camellia sinensis [L.] O. Kuntze is not yet available. In the present study, 134 CsC2H2-ZFP genes were identified and randomly distributed on 15 chromosomes. The CsC2H2-ZFP gene family was classified into four clades and gene structures and motif compositions of CsC2H2-ZFPs were similar within the same clade. Segmental duplication and negative selection were the main forces driving the expansion of the CsC2H2-ZFP gene family. Expression patterns suggested that CsC2H2-ZFPs were responsive to different stresses including drought, salt, cold and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Specially, several C2H2-ZFPs showed a significant correlation with the catechins content and responded to the MeJA treatment, which might contribute to the tea quality and specialized astringent taste. This study will lay the foundations for further research of C2H2-type zinc finger proteins on the stress responses and quality-related metabolites accumulation in C. sinensis.

KW  - PACEMAKERS
AB  - In this study, a piezoelectric energy harvesting concept is developed for leadless pacemakers, effectively converting the ultralow frequency kinetic energy of the heart into sufficient electricity for pacing. This energy harvesting concept relies on low amplitude contact excitation in piezoelectric enclosure structures and will make perpetually self-powered intracardiac leadless pacemakers possible. This approach is a paradigm shift from conventional inertia-based power generation and extracts the optimal power by natural-frequency free-vibration excitation of the piezoelectric structure. This framework was assessed based on laboratory and in vivo tests on a living pig to demonstrate the performance of this energy generation concept. In vivo test on a living pig showed that the implanted piezoelectric energy harvester produced an 11.27 mW pulsed peak power and 238.2 nJ with 125 min(-1) heart rate and a root-mean-square (RMS) power of 6.95 mu W from each heartbeat, sufficient pacing energy for intracardiac leadless pacemakers.

AB  - Background: Huanglian ointment exhibits clinical efficacy for repairing skin barriers and inhibiting skin inflammation, and has been used to ameliorate eczema for many years. However, the active components and mechanism of Huanglian ointment have not yet been elucidated.
   Purpose: This study aimed to demonstrate the main active components and molecular mechanisms of Huanglian ointment for the treatment of eczema.
   Methods: The main active components of Huanglian ointment were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Network pharmacology approach and molecular docking techniques to predict the potential molecular mechanisms of Huanglian ointment alleviating eczema. Furthermore, Biostir-AD (R)-induced guinea pigs and tumor necrosis a (TNF-alpha)/interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced HaCaT cells were employed to investigate the effectiveness and mechanisms of Huanglian ointment using histopathological staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, MTT assay, and western blot analysis.
   Results: Fourteen chemistry components were identified in Huanglian ointment. In total, 78 intersecting gene targets were identified between Huanglian ointment and eczema, including Jun, inflammatory regulators, and chemokine factors. Intersecting gene targets were enriched for cytokine and chemokine receptor binding, and inflammatory related signaling pathways. The molecular docking results showed that the identified components had a stable binding conformation with core targets. In vivo experiments showed that Huanglian ointment markedly ameliorated eczema-like skin lesions, restored histopathological morphology, and decreased levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and interleukin 6. Moreover, Huanglian ointment effectively protected HaCaT cells against TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-induced cell death and overproduction of thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine, macrophage-derived chemokine, and regulated upon activation normal T cell-expressed and secreted factor. Subsequently, we found that Huanglian ointment repaired skin barriers by affecting c-Jun, JunB, and filaggrin expression, and suppressed inflammatory response by inhibiting AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, both in vivo and in vitro.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that Huanglian ointment repaired skin barriers and inhibited inflammation by maintaining the balance of c-Jun and JunB, and suppressing AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, thereby relieving eczema. These findings providing a molecular basis for treatment of eczema by Huanglian ointment.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sea buckthorn ( Hippophae rhamnoides L.) has been designated a "medicine food homology" fruit by the National Health Commission of China due to its nutritional value. In traditional Chinese ethnomedicine, Hippophae rhamnoides L. is commonly used to treat nonhealing wounds such as burns, sores, and gastric ulcers. The aim of this study was to explore the healing effects of the ethyl acetate extract of sea buckthorn seeds (SBS-EF) on burn wounds. Aim of the study: The primary objectives of this research were to determine the most effective medicinal site of action for treating burns with sea buckthorn seeds (SBS) and to investigate the underlying material basis and mechanisms of their therapeutic effects. Materials and methods: The effects of different components of SBS-EF on the proliferation and migration of human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) were evaluated via MTT assays, scratch assays, transwell assays, and hydroxyproline secretion analysis. SBS-EF displayed the greatest activity amongst the extracts. Subsequent analyses included network pharmacology methodology, molecular docking studies, ultraperformance liquid chromatography UPLC-Orbitrap-Exploris-120-MS and a severe second-degree burn rat model to investigate the chemical constituents and potential therapeutic mechanisms of the SBS-EF. Results: In vitro studies demonstrated the efficacy of SBS-EF in promoting HSF growth and migration. UPLCOrbitrap-Exploris-120-MS analysis revealed that SBS-EF had ten major constituents, with flavonoids being the predominant compounds, especially catechin, quercetin, and kaempferol derivatives. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses indicated that SBS-EF may exert its healing effects by modulating the Wnt/ (3-catenin signalling pathway. Subsequent in vivo experiments demonstrated that SBS-EF accelerated burn wound healing in rats, increased hydroxyproline expression in skin tissue, facilitated skin structure repair, and enhanced collagen production and organisation over a 21 d period. Additionally, exposure to SBS-EF upregulated WNT3a and (3-catenin while downregulating GSK-3(3 levels in rat skin tissue. Conclusions: The wound healing properties of SBS-EF were attributed to its ability to enhance HSF growth and migration, increase hydroxyproline levels in the skin, promote collagen accumulation, reduce scarring, and decrease the skin water content. SBS-EF may also provide therapeutic benefits for burns by modulating the Wnt/ (3-catenin signalling pathway, as evidenced by its effective site and likely mechanism of action in the treatment of burned rats.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the molluscicidal and antiparasitic activities of the ether extract of the lichen Cladonia substellata against embryos and adults from Biomphalaria glabrata and cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni (infective phase for the man). Toxicity parameters were evaluated at sublethal doses of the ether extract of Cladonia substellata (EClas) on the fertility/fecundity of adult snails, as well as genotoxic damage and morphological changes in hemocytes. The bioindicator Artemia salina was used for the environmental toxicity test. Chromatographic analysis of the EClas revealed the presence of stictic (4.12%), norstictic (2.14%) and usnic (92.58%) acids. EClas showed toxicity against all embryonic stages with LC50 of 1.59, 2.47, 2.69, 2.36 and 0.92 mu g/mL for blastula, gastrula, trocophore, veliger and hippo stage, respectively. LC50 for B. glabrata adults was 2.11 mu g/mL and the extract altered the fecundity pattern, reducing the number of embryos. EClas increased the number of cells with morphology indicative of apoptosis and the frequency and rate of DNA damage in hemocytes. Reduction in motility of cercariae exposed to the EClas was observed from 2.5 mu g/mL after 15 min and 100% mortality is reached at 5.0 mu g/mL after 120 min. On A. salina, the EClas was non-toxic at the concentrations evaluated (1.0- 5.0 mu g/mL). The EClas is a promising molluscicide for population control of embryos and adults of B. glabrata, the intermediate host of S. mansoni. EClas caused hemocytic and genotoxic damage in adult snails, showed action against cercariae and was not toxic to the environmental bioindicator. (c) 2025 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To achieve the rapid recognition and accurate picking of Camellia oleifera fruits, a binocular vision system composed of two industrial cameras was used to collect images of Camellia oleifera fruits in natural environments. The YOLOv7 convolutional neural network model was used for iterative training, and the optimal weight model was selected to recognize the images and obtain the anchor frame region of the Camellia oleifera fruits. The local binary pattern (LBP) maps of the anchor frame region were extracted and matched by using the normalized correlation coefficient template matching algorithm to obtain the positions of the center point in the left and right images. The recognition experimental results showed that the accuracy rate, recall rate, mAP and F1 of the model were 97.3%, 97.6%, 97.7% and 97.4%. The recognition rate of the Camellia oleifera fruit with slight shading was 93.13%, and the recognition rate with severe shading was 75.21%. The recognition rate of the Camellia oleifera fruit was 90.64% under sunlight condition, and the recognition rate was 91.34% under shading condition. The orchard experiment results showed that, in the depth range of 400-600 mm, the maximum error value of the binocular stereo vision system in the depth direction was 4.279 mm, and the standard deviation was 1.142 mm. The detection and three-dimensional positioning accuracy of the binocular stereo vision system for Camellia oleifera fruits could basically meet the working requirements of the Camellia oleifera fruit-picking robot.

AB  - Objective Deep brain stimulation (DBS) utilizes sustained high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of electrical pulses to modulate neuronal activity. The therapy is expected to be used to treat more brain disorders. To deeply understand the mechanisms of the HFS to advance the DBS development, the present study investigates the effect of axonal HFS on neuronal somata during HFS-induced axonal block. Methods Antidromic high-frequency stimulation (A-HFS) with a 100-Hz pulse frequency and a 1-min duration was applied at the axons of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of anesthetized rats. To investigate the responses of somata, a multi-channel microelectrode array with a vertical linear configuration was implanted to record the evoked potentials in the lamellas around the somata of CA1 pyramidal neurons at the upstream area of stimulation site, including the antidromic population spikes (APS) evoked by the pulses of A-HFS as well as the orthodromic population spikes (OPS) evoked by orthodromic test pulses applied during the A-HFS. Current-source densities (CSD) of the evoked potentials were calculated to evaluate the generation and propagation of action potentials around the somata of pyramidal neurons during A-HFS. Results A-HFS on the axons of pyramidal neurons slowed down the propagation speed of both antidromic and orthodromic excitations around somata. In addition, the occurrence and recovery of the changes of somata were slower than the A-HFS-induced axonal block. Conclusion Axonal HFS can induce soma alterations that might be caused by changes in membrane potentials nearby somata. The finding is helpful for deeply revealing the mechanisms of electrical stimulations of brain nervous system.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Baihe Zhimu decoction (BZD) is a classical traditional Chinese medicinal herbal formula. It consists of two herbal medicines, Rhizoma Anemarrhenae (Zhimu), the rhizomes of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge. (Liliaceae), and Bulbus Lilii (Baihe), the bulbs of Lilium brownii var. Viridulum Baker (Liliaceae). BZD has been widely used in China to treat depression and verified to be effective without evident side effects. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to elucidate the active components, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of Baihe Zhimu decoction for treating depression. Materials and methods: In this research, a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice was first established to evaluate the pharmacological effects of BZD for treating depression. A component database was then constructed for BZD. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS) technique was used to identify the components in BZD and blood-absorbed components. Further screening and validation of protein targets were performed by molecule docking. The component-target binding affinity was validated by surface plasmon resonance analysis (SPR) assay. The related pathways were predicted by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Relative proteins in the predicted pathways were finally assessed by Western blot. Results: The pharmacology evaluation experiment demonstrated that BZD could improve depressive-like behavior, inhibit the hippocampal secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce neuronal apoptosis in CUMS mice model. A component database containing 163 components and a target database covering 1286 proteins were constructed. HPLC-QTOF-MS assay identified twenty-six components from BZD and ten components absorbed into rat plasma after an intragastric treatment with BZD. Next, 56 underlying targets were screened out by a virtual high-throughput screening approach. Twenty-seven of them were further screened out and confirmed by molecular docking. Afterward, a component-target network was established, and the component-protein binding affinities were validated by SPR assays. By KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, two signaling pathways PI3K/Akt and MAPK were predicted as the potential signaling cascades. Finally, Western blot showed that BZD dramatically reversed the suppression of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway and the activation of MAPK pathway in CUMS mice model. Conclusions: BZD demonstrated a substantial pharmacological effect on CUMS mice model. Network pharmacology-based analysis predicted that ten blood-absorbed components can act on 27 target proteins. KEGG and Western blotting analysis suggested that BZD could exert antidepressant effects by regulating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways.

AB  - A beta is believed to play a significant role in synaptic degeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease and is primarily investigated as a secreted peptide. However, the contribution of intracellular A beta or other cleavage products of its precursor protein (APP) to synaptic loss remains uncertain. In this study, we conducted a systematic examination of their cell-autonomous impact using a sparse expression system in rat hippocampal slice culture. Here, these proteins/peptides were overexpressed in a single neuron, surrounded by thousands of untransfected neurons. Surprisingly, we found that APP induced dendritic spine loss only when co-expressed with BACE1. This effect was mediated by beta-CTF, a beta-cleavage product of APP, through an endosome-related pathway independent of A beta. Neuronal expression of beta-CTF in mouse brains resulted in defective synaptic transmission and cognitive impairments, even in the absence of amyloid plaques. These findings unveil a beta-CTF-initiated mechanism driving synaptic toxicity irrespective of amyloid plaque formation and suggest a potential intervention by inhibiting the endosomal GTPase Rab5.

AB  - A naturally occurring polyphenol called trans-resveratrol has received a lot of attention due to its possible health advantages for humans. The low solubility of trans-resveratrol and its isomerization upon UV exposure strongly limit its application as a skin-whitening agent. In the present study, to increase trans-resveratrol solubility, a new nanoformula was created by combining hydrophilic surfactants and oils. Trans-Resveratrol nanoformula has been prepared, characterized, and applied as a skin-whitening agent on the dorsal skin of Guinea pigs. The optimized trans-resveratrol nanoformula with a particle size of 63.49 nm displayed a single peak and a polydispersity index [0.36 +/- 0.02]. In addition, the zeta potential of the optimized formula was -30.4 mV, confirming the high stability of this nanoformula. The melanin contents in the trans-resveratrol nanoformula-treated group were substantially lower than those of the control and the blank nanoformula-treated groups after staining of the dorsal skins [black areas] of guinea pigs with Fontana Mountain dye. The pigmentation index in the control, blank nanoformula, and optimized trans-resveratrol nanoformula were 329.4 +/- 36.9, 335.8 +/- 71.4, and 124.8 +/- 19.6 respectively. Confirming this finding, immunohistochemistry analysis of skin tissues revealed that the expressions of melanogenesis-regulating proteins such as tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor were down-regulated. The safety of topical application of trans-resveratrol nanoformula was validated by no changes in free radical levels and oxidative stress markers proteins in the livers and kidneys of guinea pigs at the end of the experiment. Conclusions: A novel trans-resveratrol nanoformula as well as the mechanism whereby it promotes skin whitening effects were presented. Furthermore, the study illustrated that transresveratrol nanoformula is safe, non-toxic, and can be applied for skin whitening, although more research on human skin is needed.

AB  - We aimed to explore the protective effects and potential treatment mechanism of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in an animal model of chronic exposure in a natural high-altitude hypoxia (HAH) environment. Behavioral alterations were assessed with the Morris water maze test. Iron accumulation in the hippocampus was detected by using DAB enhanced Perls' staining, MRI, qPCR and colorimetry, respectively. Oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, MDA), apoptosis (Caspase-3), and neural regeneration (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) were detected by using ELISA and western blotting. Neural ultrastructural changes were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that learning and memory performance of rats decreased when exposure to HAH environment. It was followed by iron accumulation, dysfunctional iron metabolism, reduced BDNF and the upregulation of MDA and Caspase-3. TEM confirmed the ultrastructural changes in neurons and mitochondria. EGCG reduced HAH-induced cognitive impairment, iron deposition, oxidative stress, and apoptosis and promoted neuronal regeneration against chronic HAH-mediated neural injury.

AB  - It has already been shown that both consolidation and reconsolidation of long-term memories require protein synthesis and de novo gene transcription immediately after training or mnemonic trace reactivation sessions. A few studies have also shown that consolidation of long-term memories also requires a late second wave of de novo gene transcription. Does such a requirement also occur for reconsolidation? By using two different mRNA synthesis inhibitors, we show that blockade of hippocampal late gene expression during a restricted post-training or postretrieval time window hinders the retention of long-term spatial memory for the Morris water maze task without affecting the functionality of the hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory consolidation induces the activation of the late hippocampal genes transcriptional machinery and suggests a late gene expression-dependent reconsolidation process that operates in the dorsal hippocampus to stabilize the reac-tivated mnemonic trace.

AB  - Coinfections of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) are widely existing in the swine industry worldwide. However, the mechanisms for this coinfection remain unclear. The aim of this study is to assess whether the coinfection PCV2 and G. parasuis would affect the inflammatory response and related mechanisms. In this study, BALB/c mice and RAW264.7 cells were used to study the inflammation and related mechanism caused by the coinfection of PCV2 and G. parasuis. Coinfection with PCV2 and G. parasuis significantly increased the mortality of mice and led to the development of more severe lung and spleen lesions compared with single agent infection. Especially, coinfection significantly increased the bacterial loads in the lungs. Coinfection with PCV2 and G. parasuis can enhance RAW264.7 cell phagocytosis and elimination to G. parasuis. Cell death rate of cells increased in coinfection was measured with Flow cytometry. Moreover, coinfection led to the downregulation of the expression of TNF alpha and IL-8 in comparison with G. parasuis infection, but the maturation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) was significantly upregulated. Our study firstly revealed that coinfection of PCV2 and G. parasuis can increase the phagocytosis of cells to G. parasuis, and LPS in the cytoplasm will induce the maturation of caspase-11 and lead to the cleavage of Gasdermin D (GSDMD) to cause pyroptosis by noncanonical pathway. The revealing of mechanisms associated with coinfection with PCV2 and G. parasuis will provide a scientific basis for investigating the synergistic infection mechanisms between viruses and bacteria.

AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular paradigm for modeling animal behavior, analyzing neuronal representations, and studying their emergence during learning. This development has been fueled by advances in understanding the role of RL in both the brain and artificial intelligence. However, while in machine learning a set of tools and standardized benchmarks facilitate the development of new methods and their comparison to existing ones, in neuroscience, the software infrastructure is much more fragmented. Even if sharing theoretical principles, computational studies rarely share software frameworks, thereby impeding the integration or comparison of different results. Machine learning tools are also difficult to port to computational neuroscience since the experimental requirements are usually not well aligned. To address these challenges we introduce CoBeL-RL, a closed-loop simulator of complex behavior and learning based on RL and deep neural networks. It provides a neuroscience-oriented framework for efficiently setting up and running simulations. CoBeL-RL offers a set of virtual environments, e.g., T-maze and Morris water maze, which can be simulated at different levels of abstraction, e.g., a simple gridworld or a 3D environment with complex visual stimuli, and set up using intuitive GUI tools. A range of RL algorithms, e.g., Dyna-Q and deep Q-network algorithms, is provided and can be easily extended. CoBeL-RL provides tools for monitoring and analyzing behavior and unit activity, and allows for fine-grained control of the simulation via interfaces to relevant points in its closed-loop. In summary, CoBeL-RL fills an important gap in the software toolbox of computational neuroscience.

AB  - Background Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus, a zoonotic disease that resurfaces as a potential hazard beyond geographic boundaries. Fever that can proceed to encephalitis, retinitis, hemorrhagic fever, and death is the main manifestation observed in human infections. RVFV has no authorized medication. The RNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing pathway is extremely well conserved. By targeting specific genes, small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be used to suppress viral replication. The aim of this study was to design specific siRNAs against RVFV and evaluate their prophylactic and antiviral effects on the Vero cells.
   Methods and results Various siRNAs were designed using different bioinformatics tools. Three unique candidates were tested against an Egyptian sheep cell culture-adapted strain BSL-2 that suppressed RVFV N mRNA expression. SiRNAs were transfected a day before RVFV infection (pre-transfection), and 1 h after the viral infection (post-transfection), and were evaluated to detect the silencing activity and gene expression decrease using real-time PCR and a TCID50 endpoint test. The degree of N protein expression was determined by western blot 48 h after viral infection. D2 which targets the (488-506 nucleotides), the middle region of RVFV N mRNA was the most effective siRNA at 30 nM concentration, it almost eliminates N mRNA expression when utilized as antiviral or preventive therapy. siRNAs had a stronger antiviral silencing impact when they were post-transfected into Vero cells.
   Conclusion Pre and post-transfection of siRNAs significantly reduced RVFV titer in cell lines, offering novel and potentially effective anti-RVFV epidemics and epizootics therapy.

AB  - A genetic improvement programme is a sustainable, cumulative and permanent approach to achieving year-on-year performance gains. Its success is predicated not only on an efficient and effective breeding programme but also on a vision of the traits of importance in the future. A single, industry-owned, centralised database for cattle and sheep has been the foundation for genetic improvement programmes in Ireland. While DNA information has been heralded as a breakthrough for accelerating genetic gain, the basic principles of a successful animal breeding programme still remain the same: (1) a pertinent breeding goal, (2) the appropriate breeding objective to deliver on the breeding goal, (3) an accurate genetic evaluation system, (4) an efficient and effective breeding scheme, and (5) a system to disseminate the elite germplasm to the end user; also of importance is a system for validating the underlying procedures and principles. The constituent traits and their relative emphasis within breeding objectives will continue to be contentious. Traits that will need to be considered more in future ruminant breeding objectives include environmental impact, product quality and animal well-being, including health; while not always explicitly included in Irish breeding objectives for cattle and sheep, indirect improvements for many are expected via the genetic improvement in traits like reproductive performance and survival as well as macro measures of quality such as milk fat and protein concentration and carcass merit. Crucial for the future sustainability of ruminant production systems is the co-evolution of management systems and breeding programmes so that the animal of the future is suited to the most sustainably efficient production system.

AB  - Although numerous studies have shown that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a vital role in the response to environmental stress by mediating the production of a series of hormones, the mechanism underlying these effects has not been elucidated. This study used proteomics techniques to investigate the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the pituitary glands of pigs and to elucidate the potential changes in the immune-neuroendocrine system under heat stress (HS). In total, 2517 peptides corresponding to 205 proteins were detected. A comparison of the expression patterns between HSs and healthy controls revealed 56 DEPs, of which 31 were upregulated and 25 were downregulated. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to reveal the subcellular characteristics, functional pathways, regulatory networks, and upstream regulators of the identified proteins. The results showed that these differentially expressed proteins were involved in intercellular communication, interactions, apoptosis, nervous system development, functions, abnormalities and other functions, and in the regulatory network. Moreover, the upstream regulators of the differentially expressed proteins were mainly transcriptional regulators, hormones, and cytokines. Thus, the functional network and pathway analyses could provide insights into the complexity and dynamics of HS-host interactions and may accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying HS.

AB  - Aminoglycoside antibiotics remain indispensable despite their ototoxicity. Like other sensorineural forms, aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss (AGIHL) has no effective pharmacotherapy. Oxidative stress, apoptosis, excitotoxicity and inflammation are key pathological factors of the disease. We hypothesised that selegiline, an irreversible monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease, could be repurposed as an otoprotective agent against AGIHL and its effect on dopamine (DA) release from lateral olivocochlear (LOC) fibres, the efferent division of a protective feedback loop plays a major role in the protection against excitotoxicity. Selegiline mitigated AGIHL in BALB/c mice in a dose-dependent manner at different auditory brainstem response frequencies, including 16 kHz, the hearing sensitivity optimum of the animals. It also enhanced the action potential-evoked DA release from LOC efferents in mouse cochlear preparation dose-dependently. Inhibition of DA reuptake contributed to its basic effect of saving DA from metabolism. Among four selegiline analogues tested, the one that increased LOC DA release also provided otoprotection. In contrast, neither safinamide (a reversible MAO-B inhibitor) nor LJP-1207 (a selective semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase/vascular-adhesion protein 1 (SSAO/VAP1) inhibitor) prevented AGIHL, despite their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The reversibility or lack of MAO-B inhibition in safinamide and LJP-1207, respectively, as well as the absence of the propargylamine moiety with known intrinsic neuroprotective activity in both molecules, may explain their ineffectiveness. Selegiline, or certain propargylamine analogues of it, offer a promising therapy against AGIHL by addressing its multifactorial pathology through antioxidant, antiapoptotic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory actions, while enhancing endogenous DAergic protective mechanisms.

AB  - Aluminum, a widely prevalent environmental pollutant, has been established to exert toxic effects on multiple organs in the human body. To gain a comprehensive understanding of these toxic effects and the mechanisms involved, this study aimed to assess potential correlations between metabolites and ion data through metabolomic and ionomic analyses. We sought to explore the intricate impact of aluminum on various organs in mice. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were employed to conduct metabolomic and ionomic analyses on the hippocampus, cortex, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, bone, intestine, stomach, and serum of both control and aluminum-exposed mice. Besides, histological examinations and behavioral experiments were conducted. Multivariate analysis revealed 91 differential metabolites across various organs, primarily encompassing amino acids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates. The implicated abnormal metabolic pathways included amino acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. Additionally, alterations in the homeostasis of ions such as manganese, zinc, selenium, iron, copper, phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium were observed in various organs, potentially influencing the activity of critical enzymes. The changes in these potential biomarkers and ions suggest toxic mechanisms of aluminum exposure involving oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, cellular signal dysregulation, disruption of key enzyme activities, and impaired energy metabolism. This study provides a novel perspective on understanding the toxic mechanisms of aluminum exposure, potentially contributing to the prevention and treatment of aluminum toxicity.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of voluntary and involuntary/regular exercise on neurotrophic factors in the brain, cognitive functions, and anxiety in socially isolated adolescent male rats. In this study, 42 adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: control (C), socially isolated (SI), voluntary exercise (VE), regular exercise (RE), socially isolated + voluntary exercise (SI-VE), and socially isolated + regular exercise (SI-RE). Socially isolated groups were kept in separate cages for 4 weeks. Treadmill and wheel running were used in the exercise groups. The following behavioral tests-elevated plus maze (EPM), open field, ultrasonic vocalization (USV), and Morris water maze (MWM)-rats were euthanized, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Statistically, the differences between the groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA and post hoc LSD tests using IBM SPSS software. In the EPM, locomotor activity was higher in the voluntary exercise groups. In the MWM, both regular exercise groups found the platform faster. In the USV, the SI-RE group produced more 50-kHz sounds. BDNF and NGF levels in the hippocampus were higher in the SI-RE and SI-VE groups; VEGF levels were higher in the SI-RE group. Neuron density in the PFC increased in the SI-RE and VE groups, while neuron density in the hippocampus increased in the SI-RE, SI-VE, and VE groups. According to the findings, we showed that voluntary exercise reduces social isolation-induced anxiety, and involuntary/regular exercise both reduces anxiety and has potential benefits on cognitive functions.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ziziphi Spinosae Semen and Polygalae Radix (ZSS-PR) constitute a traditional Chinese herbal combination with notable applications in clinical and experimental settings due to their evident sedative and calming effects. Aligned with traditional Chinese medicine principles, Ziziphi Spinosae Semen supports cardiovascular health, nourishes the liver, and induces mental tranquillity. Simultaneously, Polygalae Radix elicits calming effects, fosters clear thinking, and reinstates proper coordination between the heart and kidneys. ZSS-PR is commonly employed as a therapeutic intervention for various insomnia types, demonstrating distinct clinical efficacy. Our previous study findings provide evidence that ZSS-PR administration significantly reduces sleep onset latency, increases overall sleep duration, and improves abnormal neurotransmitter levels in a murine insomnia model. Aim of study: This investigation aimed to scrutinize the intrinsic regulatory mechanism of ZSS-PR in managing insomnia using gut microbiota and serum metabolomics techniques. Materials and methods: Mice were given DL-4-Chlorophenylalanine to induce insomnia and then treated with ZSSPR. The open-field test assessed the animals' spontaneous activity. Concentrations of neurotransmitters, endocrine hormones, and cytokines in the duodenum were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and brain histopathology was evaluated with H&E staining. The impact of ZSS-PR on the metabolic profile was examined by liquid chromatography couped to high resolution mass spectrometry, and 16S rDNA sequencing was used to study the influence of ZSS-PR on the gut microbiota. Additionally, the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was analyzed by GC-MS. Finally, correlation analysis investigated relationships between biochemical markers, metabolites, SCFAs, and gut microbiota. Results: ZSS-PR treatment significantly increased movement time and distance in mice with insomnia and improved pathological impairments in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. It also restored abnormal levels of biochemical markers in the gut of insomnia-afflicted mice, including 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, gastrin, melatonin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. Metabolomics findings showed that ZSS-PR had a significant restorative effect on 15 endogenous metabolites in mice with insomnia. Furthermore, ZSS-PR primarily influenced five metabolic pathways, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, glutamine, and glutamate metabolism. Additionally, gut microbiota analysis revealed notable alterations in both diversity and microbial composition after ZSS-PR treatment. These changes were primarily attributed to the relative abundances of microbiota, including Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Fusobacteriota, Muribaculaceae_unclassified, and Ligilactobacillus. The results of SCFAs analysis demonstrated that ZSS-PR effectively restored abnormal levels of acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid in insomniac mice. Subsequent correlation analysis revealed that microbiota show obvious correlations with both biochemical markers and metabolites.

AB  - Determination of digestibility represents the first step for the evaluation of the net energy content of feed for livestock animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo digestibility and in vitro degradability of five diets characterized by different forage/concentrate ratios (F:C) in horses. The in vitro degradability was determined by the Gas Production Technique (GPT), using as an inoculum source the feces of the same subjects used for the in vivo test. Five diets consisting of poliphyte hay, straw and grains of barley and oats with a different F:C ratio [90/10 (Diet 1); 78/22 (Diet 2); 68/32 (Diet 3); 60/40 (Diet 4); 50/50 (Diet 5) were formulated and administered in succession, starting with Diet 1. In the in vivo results, no significant differences emerged, despite the different F:C content. In in vitro fermentation, four diets out of the five (2, 3, 4, 5) presented a similar trend of the curve of gas production, showing good activity of the fecal micro population during the first hours of incubation. An important correlation between gas and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) were found, suggesting that the processes linked to the micro population deriving from the horse's caecum follow metabolic pathways whose products can be modeled in the same way as for the rumen. The GPT could represent the correct method for studying the nutritional characteristics of feed for horses, using feces as the source of inoculum, even if further investigations must be performed to improve the technique.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of active dry yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on growth performance, circulating ghrelin, fatty acid concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract, and trace mineral elements utilisation of finishing bulls. Twenty Yanbian cattle (bulls) [body weight (BW) 485 +/- 38 kg] were randomly divided into two groups (control and treatment groups) and participated in a 100-day finishing trial. The control group (CON) was fed a basal diet (total mixed ration, TMR). The treatment group (active dry yeast, ADY) was fed a basal diet supplemented with ADY (Levucell SC, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077, viable count >= 8.0 x 10(9) CFU/g, 1.0 g/bull/day). ADY supplementation significantly increased the dry matter intake (DMI) of bulls (p < .05); significantly increased the concentration of ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT) (p < .05), significantly decreased the concentration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (p < .05), tended to increase the concentration of acyl ghrelin (AG) (p = .053) in serum; significantly increased the content of C12:0 in duodenal digesta, the apparent digestibility of Zn, the concentrations Zn and Cu in serum and the deposition of Cu in the liver (p < .05), significantly decreased the deposition of Fe in muscle in finishing bulls (p < .05). In conclusion, ADY supplementation improved DMI of finishing bulls may be related to the change of AG, and a potential mechanism for the change of AG by ADY supplementation is via its effects on the metabolism of C12:0, Zn, and Cu in finishing bulls.

AB  - Simple Summary Current methods to control the reproductive cycle in the bitch are associated with problematic side effects. Melatonin plays a role in the regulation of reproduction in several species. It has been used to control the reproductive cycle in species with seasonal reproduction. The ancestor of the dog, the grey wolf, has strict seasonal reproduction with breeding in early spring. In contrast to the wolf, the domestic dog is a non-seasonal breeder. It is still not known whether melatonin is involved in control of cyclicity in either the wolf or the domestic dog. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate whether a long-acting melatonin implant would be a safe alternative for short-term postponement of heat in the bitch. Five beagle bitches were treated with melatonin implants while another four bitches were untreated controls. There was no effect of treatment with melatonin implants on the cyclicity in this study. Implants with 18 mg are, therefore, not likely to be a useful method to control cyclicity in the bitch, in contrast to some other species. It is still not known whether melatonin is involved in regulation of the oestrus cycle in the domestic dog. In short-day breeders such as the sheep, melatonin stimulates oestrus activity; in contrast, a high serum concentration of melatonin inhibits oestrus in long-day breeders such as the cat. Therefore, implants with melatonin have been used to suppress or induce oestrus depending on the species. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate if melatonin could be an alternative to control the reproductive cycle in the bitch. Nine beagle bitches were observed for three oestrus cycles. Five beagle bitches were treated with 18 mg melatonin implants on average 27 days before the next expected oestrus based on the previous interoestrus interval. Four bitches served as untreated controls. Blood samples for evaluation of serum melatonin were collected at the time of assignment to treatment or control group and 1-4 weeks thereafter. Clinical signs and vaginal smears were used to follow the cycle. Melatonin varied significantly with bitch (p < 0.05) but not with treatment. Treatment did not affect the interoestrus interval (p > 0.05). In conclusion, treatment with 18 mg melatonin implants approximately one month before expected oestrus is not likely to be a useful method to control cyclicity in the bitch. It is still not known if melatonin is involved in regulation of the oestrus cycle in the domestic dog.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alpha herpesvirus, induces significant economic losses to the swine industry and infects multiple kinds of animals. Therefore, it is of great importance to explore anti-PRV compounds. In this study, to explore the anti-PRV compounds, a library of natural compounds was screened through a cell-based ELISA assay, and it was discovered that bufalin, a Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, had a robust inhibitory effect on PRV replication. A time-of-addition experiment and temperature-shift assay showed that bufalin significantly inhibited the entry stage of PRV. NaCl- or KCl-treatment showed that NaCl could enhance the inhibitory effect of bufalin on PRV replication, whereas there was no significant effect under the treatment of KCl. Meanwhile, it was also found that bufalin possessed antiviral activity against other alpha herpesviruses, including human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and chicken Marek's disease virus (MDV). Finally, it was found that bufalin could decrease the viral load in multiple tissues, and reduce the morbidity and mortality in PRV-challenged BALB/c mice. Overall, our findings demonstrated that bufalin has the potential to be developed as an anti-PRV compound.

AB  - In reproductive biology, understanding the effects of novel techniques on early embryo development is of paramount importance. To date, the effects of electrical activation on oocytes prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oocyte electroporation prior to IVF on embryo development and to differentiate between true embryos and parthenotes by using a TPCN2 knock -out (KO) male to evaluate the presence of the KO allele in the resulting blastocysts. The study consisted of three experiments. The first one examined oocyte electroporation with and without subsequent IVF and found that electroporated oocytes had higher activation rates, increased occurrence of a single pronucleus, and no effect on sperm penetration. Cleavage rates improved in electroporated oocytes, but blastocyst rates remained constant. Genotype analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of parthenotes in the electroporated groups compared to the IVF control (30.2 % vs. 6.8 %). The second experiment compared two electroporation media, Opti-MEM and Nuclease -Free Duplex Buffer (DB). DB induced higher oocyte degeneration rates, and lower cleavage and blastocyst rates than Opti-MEM, while parthenogenetic formation remained consistent (60.0 and 48.5 %). In the third experiment, the timing of electroporation relative to IVF was evaluated (1 h before IVF, immediately before IVF and 7 h after IVF). Electroporation immediately before IVF resulted in higher activation rates and different pronuclear proportions compared to the other timing groups. The penetration rate was higher in the immediate electroporation group, and cleavage rate improved in all electroporated groups compared to the control. Blastocyst rates remained constant. Genotyping revealed no significant differences in parthenote proportions among the timing groups, but these were higher than the control (56.25 %, 63.89 %, 51.61 %, 2.44 %, respectively), and showed higher mutation rates when electroporation was performed 7 h after IVF. Overall, this comprehensive study sheds light on the potential of electroporation for creating genetically modified embryos and the importance of media selection and timing in the process, the best media being the Opti-MEM and the more efficient timing regarding mutation rate, 7 h post-IVF, even when the parthenote formation did not differ among electroporated groups. Further studies are needed to reduce the parthenogenetic activation while maintaining high mutation rates to optimize the use of this procedure for the generation of gene -edited pig embryos by oocyte/zygote electroporation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The traditional medicinal formulation, Qifu-yin (QFY), has been widely prescribed for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment in China, yet the comprehensive mechanisms through which QFY mitigates AD pathology remain to be fully delineated. Aim of the study: This study aimed to explore the therapeutic implications of QFY on the synaptic injury and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, with a concerted effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms related to synaptic preservation and memory improvement. Materials and methods: The components of QFY were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The neuroprotective effects of QFY was evaluated using six-month-old male APP/PS1 mice. Subsequent to a 15 days of QFY regimen, spatial memory was assessed utilizing the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation was detected via immunostaining, while the quantification of A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-42 was achieved through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the synaptic structure and mitochondrial morphology. Golgi staining was applied to examine dendritic spine density. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), 3nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE) assays were employed to assess oxidative stress. The expression profiles of A beta metabolism-associated enzymes and the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway were determined by Western blot. Results: A total of 20 principal compounds in QFY were identified. QFY mitigated memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice, including reducing escape latency and search distance and increasing the time and distance spent in the target quadrant. In addition, QFY increased platform crossings of APP/PS1 mice in the probe trial of MWM tests. TEM analysis showed that QFY increased synapse number in the CA1 region of APP/PS1 mice. Further studies indicated that QFY elevated the expression levels of Post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin, and mitigated the loss of dendritic spine density in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. QFY has been shown to ameliorated the structural abnormalities of mitochondria, including mitochondrial dissolution and degradation, up-regulate ATP synthesis and membrane potential in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, QFY activated the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which might contribute to the neuroprotective effects of QFY. Conclusion: QFY activates the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling, and protects against synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice, proposing a potential alternative therapeutic strategy for AD management.

AB  - Background Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation (OTCTP) is currently the main option available to preserve fertility in prepubertal patients undergoing aggressive cancer therapy treatments. However, a major limitation of OTCTP is follicle loss after transplantation. The mouse is a model of choice for studying ovarian function and follicle development after ovarian tissue grafting in vivo. In these mouse models, ovarian tissue or ovaries can be transplanted to different sites. Our aim was to evaluate a new alternative to heterotopic transplantation models that could be useful to test pharmaceutical improvement for ovarian grafts after OTCTP. Methods Slow frozen murine whole ovaries were transplanted into the mouse ears (between the external ear skin layer and the cartilage). Ovarian transplants were recovered after 3, 14 or 21 days. Grafts were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and follicle density analyses were performed. Results An increase of ovarian vascularization (CD31 and Dextran-FITC positive staining), as well as cellular proliferation (Ki67 staining) were observed 3 weeks after transplantation in comparison to 3 days. Fibrosis density, evaluated after Van Gieson staining, decreased 3 weeks after transplantation. Furthermore, transplantation of cryopreserved ovaries into ovariectomized mice favored follicle activation compared to transplantation into non-ovariectomized mice. Conclusion The present study indicates that surgical tissue insertion in the highly vascularized murine ear is an effective model for ovarian grafting. This model could be helpful in research to test pharmaceutical strategies to improve the function and survival of cryopreserved and transplanted ovarian tissue.

AB  - Olfactory and declarative memory performances are associated, as both functions are processed by overlapping medial-temporal and prefrontal structures and decline in older adults. While a decline in olfactory identification may be related to a decline in declarative memory, the relationship between olfactory detection threshold and declarative memory remains unclear. In this meta-analysis, we assessed (i) the relationship between olfactory identification/detection threshold and verbal declarative memory in cognitively normal older adults, and (ii) the effect of age on these relationships. We included articles from PsychNet, PubMed, and Academic Search Complete according to the following criteria: (i) inclusion of cognitively normal older adults; (ii) assessment of episodic or semantic memory; and (iii) assessment of olfactory identification or detection threshold. Seventeen studies and 22 effect sizes were eligible and included in this meta-analysis. Olfactory identification was associated with episodic (small effect size: r = 0.19; k = 22) and semantic memory (small effect size: r = 0.16; k = 23). Similarly, the olfactory detection threshold was associated with both episodic (small to medium effect size: r = 0.25; k = 5) and semantic memory (small effect size: r = 0.17; k = 7). Age was found to moderate the relationship between olfactory detection threshold and memory performance. Both olfactory identification and detection threshold performances are associated with declarative memory in older adults, and age only moderates the relationship between olfactory detection threshold and declarative memory performances.

AB  - Chronic alcohol consumption disrupts the balance of the gut microbiome, resulting in alcohol-induced cognitive and social dysfunction (AICSD), and serves as a primary etiological factor for early-onset dementia. Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenolic compound belonging to the ellagitannin family, showing potential as a dietary intervention for alleviating cognitive impairments. Nonetheless, the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of EA on AICSD remain unclear. In our study, we employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the microbiome-mediated mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of EA on AICSD. Firstly, our findings demonstrate that EA significantly ameliorated cognitive and social behavioral deficits as well as neuroinflammation induced by alcohol. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi indicates that EA regulated the KEGG pathway of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling by downregulating the CCL21-CCR7 axis. Furthermore, we observed that EA effectively restored the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and their derived metabolites induced by chronic alcohol consumption. Strong connections were observed between EA-regulated genes, microbiota and metabolites. Finally, the causal relationship between the microbiome and behavioral changes was further confirmed through antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments. Overall, our study provides innovative evidence supporting the role of EA in improving AICSD via regulation of the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway through the microbiota-mediated CCl21-CCR7 axis. These findings offer valuable insights into both EA-based interventions as well as microbial interventions against AICSD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is an important, prevalent and neglected tropical disease for which new treatments are urgently required. In the DR Congo and other sub-and tropical countries, traditional medicines are widely used for the control of schistosomiasis.Aim of study: To evaluate 43 Congolese plant species used traditionally for the treatment of urogenital schisto-somiasis against Schistosoma mansoni.Materials and methods: Methanolic extracts were screened against S. mansoni newly transformed schistosomula (NTS). Three of the most active extracts were evaluated for acute oral toxicity in guinea pigs and activity guided fractionation of the least toxic was carried out using S. mansoni NTS and adult stages. An isolated compound was identified by means of spectroscopic techniques.Results: Thirty-nine of 62 extracts killed S. mansoni NTS at 100 mu g/mL and 7 extracts were active at >= 90% at 25 mu g/ mL; 3 extracts were selected for acute oral toxicity evaluation; the least toxic of these, Pseudolachnostylis maprou-neifolia leaf was then subjected to activity-guided fractionation. 173-ethoxyphaeophorbide a (1) was isolated as an active compound with 56% activity against NTS at 50 mu g/mL and 22.5% activity against adult S. mansoni at 100 mu g/mL but these activities are significantly less than those of the parent fractions suggesting that other active compounds are also present and/or that synergistic interactions are taking place.Conclusion: This study has identified 39 plant extracts with activity against S. mansoni NTS lending support to their traditional use in the treatment of schistosomiasis for which new treatments are urgently needed. P. maprouneifolia leaf extract was found to have potent anti-schistosomal activity and low in vivo oral toxicity in guinea pigs; activity-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of an active compound, 173-ethox-yphaeophorbide a. Phaeophorbides may merit exploration as potential anti-schistosomal agents and further work on plant species shown to have potent activity against S. mansoni NTS in this study would be worthwhile.

AB  - The effects of aversive events on memory are complex and go beyond the simple enhancement of threatening information. Negative experiences can also rescue related but otherwise forgettable details encoded close in time. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy young adults to examine the brain mechanisms that support this retrograde memory effect. In a two-phase incidental encoding paradigm, participants viewed different pictures of tools and animals before and during Pavlovian fear conditioning. During Phase 1, these images were intermixed with neutral scenes, which provided a unique 'context tag' for this specific phase of encoding. A few minutes later, during Phase 2, new pictures from one category were paired with a mild shock (threat-conditioned stimulus; CS+), while pictures from the other category were not shocked. FMRI analyses revealed that, across-participants, individuals who showed aversive learning-related retroactive memory benefits for Phase 1 CS+ items were also more likely to exhibit three brain effects: first, greater spontaneous reinstatement of the Phase 1 context when participants viewed conceptually-related CS+ items in Phase 2; second, greater successful encoding-related VTA/SN and LC activation for Phase 2 CS+ items; and third, learning-dependent increases in post-encoding hippocampal functional coupling with CS+ category-selective cortex. These biases in hippocampal-cortical connectivity also mediated the relationship between VTA/SN aversive encoding effects and across-participant variability in the retroactive memory benefit. Collectively, our findings suggest that both online and offline brain mechanisms may enable threatening events to preserve memories that acquire new significance in the future.

AB  - Background Plant growth and morphogenesis is a mechanical process controlled by genetic and molecular networks. Measuring mechanical properties at various scales is necessary to understand how these processes interact. However, obtaining a device to perform the measurements on plant samples of choice poses technical challenges and is often limited by high cost and availability of specialized components, the adequacy of which needs to be verified. Developing software to control and integrate the different pieces of equipment can be a complex task.ResultsTo overcome these challenges, we have developed a computer automated micro-extensometer combined with low-cost optical tracking (Camelot) that facilitates measurements of elasticity, creep, and yield stress. It consists of three primary components: a force sensor with a sample attachment point, an actuator with a second attachment point, and a camera. To monitor force, we use a parallel beam sensor, commonly used in digital weighing scales. To stretch the sample, we use a stepper motor with a screw mechanism moving a stage along linear rail. To monitor sample deformation, a compact digital microscope or a microscope camera is used. The system is controlled by MorphoRobotX, an integrated open-source software environment for mechanical experimentation. We first tested the basic Camelot setup, equipped with a digital microscope to track landmarks on the sample surface. We demonstrate that the system has sufficient accuracy to measure the stiffness in delicate plant samples, the etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis, and were able to measure stiffness differences between wild type and a xyloglucan-deficient mutant. Next, we placed Camelot on an inverted microscope and used a C-mount microscope camera to track displacement of cell junctions. We stretched onion epidermal peels in longitudinal and transverse directions and obtained results similar to those previously published. Finally, we used the setup coupled with an upright confocal microscope and measured anisotropic deformation of individual epidermal cells during stretching of an Arabidopsis leaf.ConclusionsThe portability and suitability of Camelot for high-resolution optical tracking under a microscope make it an ideal tool for researchers in resource-limited settings or those pursuing exploratory biomechanics work.

AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that sleep deprivation (SD) can lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathological changes and cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In the present study, we identified the existence of a microbiota-gut-brain axis in cognitive deficits resulting from chronic SD and revealed a potential pathway by which gut microbiota affects cognitive functioning in chronic SD. Our findings demonstrated that chronic SD in mice not only led to cognitive decline but also induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, elevated NLRP3 inflammasome expression, GSK-3[3 activation, autophagy dysfunction, and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus. Colonization with the "SD microbiota" replicated the pathological and behavioral abnormalities observed in chronic sleep-deprived mice. Remarkably, both the deletion of NLRP3 in NLRP3-/- mice and specific knockdown of NLRP3 in the hippocampus restored autophagic flux, suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation, and ameliorated cognitive deficits induced by chronic SD, while GSK-3[3 activity was not regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome in chronic SD. Notably, deletion of NLRP3 reversed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, autophagy deficits, and tau hyperphosphorylation induced by GSK-3[3 activation in primary hippocampal neurons, suggesting that GSK-3[3, as a regulator of NLRP3-mediated autophagy dysfunction, plays a significant role in promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. Thus, gut microbiota dysbiosis was identified as a contributor to chronic SD-induced tau pathology via NLRP3-mediated autophagy dysfunction, ultimately leading to cognitive deficits. Overall, these findings highlight GSK-3[3 as a regulator of NLRP3mediated autophagy dysfunction, playing a critical role in promoting tau hyperphosphorylation.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that is the etiological agent of Aujeszky's disease in pigs. Vaccination is currently available to prevent PRV infection, but there is still an urgent need for new strategies to control this infectious disease. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are epigenetic regulators that regulate the histone tail, chromatin conformation, protein-DNA interaction and even transcription. Viral transcription and protein activities are intimately linked to regulation by histone acetyltransferases and HDACs that remodel chromatin and regulate gene expression. We reported here that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HDAC1 significantly influenced PRV replication. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibition of HDAC1 induced a DNA damage response and antiviral innate immunity. Mechanistically, the HDAC1 inhibition-induced DNA damage response resulted in the release of double-strand DNA into the cytosol to activate cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and the downstream STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate immune signaling pathway. Our results demonstrate that an HDAC1 inhibitor may be used as a new strategy to prevent Aujeszky's disease in pigs.

AB  - BackgroundThe musk glands of adult male Chinese forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii Flerov, 1929) (FMD), which are considered as special skin glands, secrete a mixture of sebum, lipids, and proteins into the musk pod. Together, these components form musk, which plays an important role in attracting females during the breeding season. However, the relationship between the musk glands and skin of Chinese FMD remains undiscovered. Here, the musk gland and skin of Chinese FMD were examined using histological analysis and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and the expression of key regulatory genes was evaluated to determine whether the musk gland is derived from the skin.MethodsA comparative analysis of musk gland anatomy between juvenile and adult Chinese FMD was conducted. Then, based on the anatomical structure of the musk gland, skin tissues from the abdomen and back as well as musk gland tissues were obtained from three juvenile FMD. These tissues were used for RNA-seq, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot (WB), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments.ResultsAnatomical analysis showed that only adult male FMD had a complete glandular organ and musk pod, while juvenile FMD did not have any well-developed musk pods. Transcriptomic data revealed that 88.24% of genes were co-expressed in the skin and musk gland tissues. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway analysis found that the genes co-expressed in the abdomen skin, back skin, and musk gland were enriched in biological development, endocrine system, lipid metabolism, and other pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the genes expressed in these tissues were enriched in biological processes such as multicellular development and cell division. Moreover, the Metascape predictive analysis tool demonstrated that genes expressed in musk glands were skin tissue-specific. qRT-PCR and WB revealed that sex-determining region Y-box protein 9 (Sox9), Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), and androgen receptor (AR) were expressed in all three tissues, although the expression levels differed among the tissues. According to the IHC results, Sox9 and AR were expressed in the nuclei of sebaceous gland, hair follicle, and musk gland cells, whereas Cav-1 was expressed in the cell membrane.ConclusionsThe musk gland of Chinese FMD may be a derivative of skin tissue, and Sox9, Cav-1, and AR may play significant roles in musk gland development.

AB  - Aims To investigate curcumin's protective effect on nerve damage caused by ketamine anesthesia via the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Rats and PC12 cells were used in this experiment to investigate the mechanism of nerve injury caused by ketamine anesthesia. Furthermore, our findings suggest that curcumin may affect oxidative stress and apoptosis by targeting the Nrf2 pathway, thereby alleviating the nerve injury caused by ketamine. Methods The rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus were stained with Nissl and immunohistochemistry to determine the number of neurons and the expression of Caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax. CCK-8 assay was used to determine the optimal concentration of ketamine, curcumin, and H2O2 in PC12 cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect changes in reactive oxygen species and the rate of apoptosis in each group. To determine whether Nrf2 entered the nucleus, immunofluorescence was used. Both tissues and cells were subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting detection at the same time. The levels of oxidative stress were determined using a malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay kit. Results Ketamine reduced the number of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of rats. The proteins Bax and Caspase-3 were upregulated, while Bcl-2 was down-regulated in the cortex and hippocampus. The viability of PC12 cells has decreased. MDA content increased while SOD activity decreased in cortex, hippocampus, and PC12 cells. Ketamine had an effect on the expression of some genes in the Nrf2 signaling pathway as well as apoptosis. Curcumin pretreatment may be able to prevent ketamine-induced damage. Conclusions The oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by ketamine during growth of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and PC12 cells may be decreased by curcumin's activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our research provides a potential strategy for the secure administration of anesthetics in medical settings.

AB  - Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells play a fundamental role in maintaining and inducing immune tolerance. Our preliminary study demonstrated that an interleukin- (IL-) 10-mediated pathway is a possible regulatory mechanism underlying the xenoantigen-specific human Treg enhanced suppressive capacity. Here, we developed a feasible protocol for expanding IL-10-induced xenoantigen-specific human Tr1 cells in vitro which would be more efficient in transplantation immunotherapy efficiency. In this study, xenoantigen-specific Tr1 cells are generated from human naive CD4(+) T cells expanded for two subsequent xenoantigen-stimulation cycles with recombinant human IL-10. The phenotype and suppressive capacity of xenoantigen-stimulated Tr1 cells are assessed, and the mechanism of their suppression is studied. Tr1 cells can be induced by porcine xenoantigen stimulation combined with IL-10, IL-2, and IL-15, displaying an increased expression of CD49b, CTLA-4, and LAG-3 without expressing Foxp3 which also showed an effector memory Treg phenotype and expressed high levels of CD39. After xenoantigen stimulation, the IL-10 and IL-5 gene expression in Tr1 cells increased, secreting more IL-10, and xenoantigen-stimulated Tr1 cells changed their T cell receptor (TCR) V beta repertoire, increasing the expression of TCR V beta 2, TCR V beta 9, and TCR V beta 13. In a pig to human mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), xenoantigen-stimulated Tr1 cells displayed enhanced suppressive capacity via CD39 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-5 could affect the proliferation of xenoantigen-specific Tr1 cells, but not their phenotypes' expression. This study provides a theory and feasible method for immune tolerance induction in clinical xenotransplantation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Chinese formula Guben-Jiannao Ye (GBJNY) formula has a long history of usage in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of learning and memory disorders as well as senile insomnia. This formulation is derived from Sun Simiao's five tonic pills. Furthermore, modern pharmacological investigations have revealed its ability to improve cognitive impairment and ameliorate sleep-wake circadian rhythm disorders. However, the precise mechanism underlying its efficacy remains elusive. Aim of the study: The current research explored the modulatory effects and possible mechanisms of GBJNY in circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease using transcriptome sequencing and experimental validation. Materials and methods: The LC-MS/MS tandem technology was utilized to qualitatively discern the active components present in GBJNY. The APP/PS1 mice received continuous treatment with GBJNY or Melatonin for 3 months. The learning and memory abilities of mice were assessed utilizing the Morris water maze (MWM) test, while sleep changes were studied utilizing the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG). Concurrently, mice's hippocampus clock gene rhythmicity was investigated. Subsequently, we employed HE staining, Golgi staining, and immunofluorescence to observe GBJNY's impact on synaptic damage and neuronal loss. We performed high-throughput sequencing to analyze the mRNA expression profiles of mice, aiming to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, we conducted GO and KEGG enrichment analyses to explore associated signaling pathways. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression levels of proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and A beta beta deposition in the hippocampus of mice. Through this comprehensive approach, we sought to elucidate and validate the potential mechanisms of action of GBJNY in APP/PS1 mice. Results: Results showed 216 DEGs. Following this, we conducted GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses to delve deeper into the distinctions and fundamental functions of the mRNA target genes. The enrichment analysis underscored the prominence of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as the most pivotal among them. Through in vivo experiments, it was further demonstrated that the administration of GBJNY enhanced memory and learning capacities in APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, GBJNY treatment resulted in alterations in the sleep- wake circadian rhythm, characterized by reduced wakefulness and an increase in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Moreover, alterations in the peak expression of Per1, , Per2, Clock, , Cry1, , Cry2, , and Bmal1 mRNA were noted in the hippocampus of treated mice. Particularly noteworthy were the observed reductions in amyloid-beta (A beta) beta ) deposition within the hippocampus, improvements in neuronal synaptic integrity, and upregulation of mTOR, Akt, and PI3K protein expression in the hippocampal region. These findings underscore the critical involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in mitigating disturbances in sleep-wake circadian rhythms. Conclusions: GBJNY enhanced the cognitive performance of APP/PS1 mice and altered clock gene expression patterns, alleviating sleep-wake circadian rhythm disruptions. The fundamental mechanism appears to be linked to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway regulation, offering a foundation for potential clinical applications.

AB  - Background Stress is a recognized risk factor for cognitive decline, which triggers neuroinflammation involving microglial activation. However, the specific mechanism for microglial activation under stress and affects learning and memory remains unclear.Methods The chronic stress mouse model was utilized to explore the relationship between microglial activation and spatial memory impairment. The effect of hippocampal hyperglycemia on microglial activation was evaluated through hippocampal glucose-infusion and the incubation of BV2 cells with high glucose. The gain-and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to investigate the role of GLUT1 in microglial proinflammatory activation. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) was employed to specifically knockdown of GLUT1 in hippocampal microglia to assess its impact on stressed-mice.Results Herein, we found that chronic stress induced remarkable hippocampal microglial proinflammatory activation and neuroinflammation, which were involved in the development of stress-related spatial learning and memory impairment. Mechanistically, elevated hippocampal glucose level post-stress was revealed to be a key regulator of proinflammatory microglial activation via specifically increasing the expression of microglial GLUT1. GLUT1 overexpression promoted microglial proinflammatory phenotype while inhibiting GLUT1 function mitigated this effect under high glucose. Furthermore, specific downregulation of hippocampal microglial GLUT1 in stressed-mice relieved microglial proinflammatory activation, neuroinflammation, and spatial learning and memory injury. Finally, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway was demonstrated to be involved in the regulatory effect of GLUT1 on microglia.Conclusions We demonstrate that elevated glucose and GLUT1 expression induce microglia proinflammatory activation, contributing to stress-associated spatial memory dysfunction. These findings highlight significant interplay between metabolism and inflammation, presenting a possible therapeutic target for stress-related cognitive disorders.

AB  - Background Metal hyperaccumulators are plant species that can uptake and store high concentrations of heavy metals in their aboveground tissues, while maintaining high vigor. Hyperaccumulation of metals was suggested to provide defense against natural enemies such as herbivores. However, heavy-metal uptake can incur physiological and ecological costs, suggesting that, like other anti-herbivore defenses, it might be induced by herbivore attack. Nevertheless, this idea has been scarcely studied. Methods We tested the hypothesis that herbivory could induce enhanced metal uptake in Helianthus annuus, which can accumulate high amounts of heavy metals in its aboveground tissues and is commonly used for phytoremediation of heavy-metal contaminated soils. In a greenhouse experiment, H. annuus plants were grown in low or high soil cadmium (Cd) concentration and subjected to control or herbivory treatments. Herbivory was simulated using both leaf damage and exogenous application of jasmonic acid, which activates anti-herbivore defenses in plants. Results Simulated herbivory increased Cd concentration in the leaves of H. annuus by 24 and 39% under low and high soil Cd availability, respectively. Moreover, while simulated herbivory decreased shoot biomass of H. annuus it resulted in increased total Cd uptake. These results demonstrate that hyperaccumulation of heavy metals might be a facultative trait, whose extent can be enhanced in response to herbivore damage. Conclusions This study provides first evidence that simulated herbivory can enhance total heavy metal uptake in plants that are used for remediation of contaminated soils, which can have important implications on the optimization of phytoremediation practices.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The attenuation of the Warburg effect is an important pathological feature of cognitive dysfunction, and enhancing the Warburg effect is conducive to improving cognitive function. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction remain incompletely elucidated. ZiBuPiYin Recipe (ZBPYR) is a traditional Chinese herbal compound used clinically for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction with significant efficacy. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanism underlying its beneficial effects remains elusive. Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to investigate whether the attenuation of the Warburg effect exists in a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction induced by knockout of the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha (PDHA1) gene in the hippocampus, as well as the interventional effect of ZBPYR. Materials and methods: Using mice with PDHA1 gene knockout in the hippocampus and their littermate control mice as study subjects, behavioral experiments were conducted to assess the impact of PDHA1 gene knockout on cognitive function and the interventional effect of ZBPYR. We detected the expression of the Warburg effectassociated rate-limiting enzymes and PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins. Subsequently, in PC12 cells, we explored the effect of the Warburg effect on cell apoptosis as well as the role of PDHA1 in the regulation of the PI3K/AKT-Warburg effect and the potential mechanism of ZBPYR in improving cognitive function. Results: Mice with knockout of the PDHA1 gene in the hippocampus exhibited cognitive dysfunction, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, reduction of the Warburg effect, and neuronal damage. In vitro experiments indicated that silencing of PDHA1 in the hippocampus inhibited the PI3K/AKT-Warburg effect, leading to cell apoptosis and mediated the effect of ZBPYR in improving cognitive function. Conclusion: Our data not only suggest that the hippocampal PDHA1-PI3K/AKT-Warburg effect may be involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction, but also demonstrate that PDHA1 knockout can abolish the beneficial effects of ZBPYR on cognition. This research aids in unraveling the cause of cognitive dysfunction and, therefore, offers a promising and innovative therapeutic target for these patients.

AB  - Simple Summary Animals living in different environments must overcome different environmental pressures. Previous studies have explored this phenomenon for other aquatic organisms, including Fundulus genus, intertidal spiders, and intertidal chitons. Gobiidae is a group of bony fishes that is second most diverse group of vertebrates globally, and one of the most diverse families of fish. These fish occupy different environments, including marine, brackish, and freshwater habitats. One key reason for the successful colonization of different habitats by this group is their ability to adapt to different energy demands. Energy requirement is related to the ability of mitochondria in cells to generate energy via a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This study explored the genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptability of Gobiidae to different environments and energy requirements and, hence, their evolution. The Gobiidae family occupy one of the most diverse habitat ranges of all fishes. One key reason for their successful colonization of different habitats is their ability to adapt to different energy demands. This energy requirement is related to the ability of mitochondria in cells to generate energy via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here, we assembled three complete mitochondrial genomes of Rhinogobius shennongensis, Rhinogobius wuyanlingensis, and Chaenogobius annularis. These mitogenomes are circular and include 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and one non-coding control region (CR). We used comparative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome and selection pressure analyses to explore the structure and evolutionary rates of Gobiidae mitogenomics in different environments. The CmC model showed that the omega ratios of all mtDNA PCGs were <1, and that the evolutionary rate of adenosine triphosphate 8 (atp8) was faster in Gobiidae than in other mitochondrial DNA PCGs. We also found evidence of positive selection for several sites of NADH dehydrogenase (nd) 6 and atp8 genes. Thus, divergent mechanisms appear to underlie the evolution of mtDNA PCGs, which might explain the ability of Gobiidae to adapt to diverse environments. Our study provides new insights on the adaptive evolution of Gobiidae mtDNA genome and molecular mechanisms of OXPHOS.

AB  - Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are well-known for their crucial involvement in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, but the exact roles of the various receptor subtypes (M1-M5) are still not fully understood. Here, we studied how M1 and M3 receptors affect plasticity at the mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse. In hippocampal slices from M1/M3 receptor double knockout (M1/M3-dKO) mice, the signature short-term plasticity of the MF-CA3 synapse was not significantly affected. However, the rather unique NMDA receptor-independent and presynaptic form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of this synapse was much larger in M1/M3-deficient slices compared to wild-type slices in both field potential and whole-cell recordings. Consistent with its presynaptic origin, induction of MF-LTP strongly enhanced the excitatory drive onto single CA3 pyramidal cells, with the effect being more pronounced in M1/M3-dKO cells. In an earlier study, we found that the deletion of M2 receptors in mice disinhibits MF-LTP in a similar fashion, suggesting that endogenous acetylcholine employs both M1/M3 and M2 receptors to constrain MF-LTP. Importantly, such synergism was not observed for MF long-term depression (LTD). Low-frequency stimulation, which reliably induced LTD of MF synapses in control slices, failed to do so in M1/M3-dKO slices and gave rise to LTP instead. In striking contrast, loss of M2 receptors augmented LTD when compared to control slices. Taken together, our data demonstrate convergence of M1/M3 and M2 receptors on MF-LTP, but functional divergence on MF-LTD, with the net effect resulting in a well-balanced bidirectional plasticity of the MF-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of fermented products, including fermented soybean meal, and recently also fermented rapeseed meal, in the diet of pigs and other animals is becoming increasingly popular. A diet containing protein components from which anti-nutrients and allergenic substances have been eliminated by means of fermentation stimulates beneficial gastrointestinal microflora, resulting in improvement in metabolic processes and thus improved animal health. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of fermented soybean meal (FSBM) and/or rapeseed meal (FRSM) on the redox status of blood and tissues in piglets. The experiment was conducted on 150 28-day-old weaned piglets divided into five groups. Piglets in the control group received standard diets with soybean meal. Animals in the experimental groups received diets in which a portion of the soybean meal was replaced with FRSM and/or FSBM: group FR-8% FRSM; group FR/FS-6% FRSM and 2% FSBM; group FS/FR-2% FRSM and 6% FSBM; and group FS-8% FSBM. Group FR/FS showed an increase in total antioxidant potential of plasma (FRAP) and low-molecular-weight antioxidants, i.e., vitamin C, urea, uric acid, and albumin, as well as an increase in catalase activity. Blood levels of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) were decreased. A reduction in lipid peroxidation due to the use of FR/FS was also indicated by a decrease in liver MDA and jejunum wall LOOH levels. Increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity and vitamin C levels in these tissues were also noted. The results of the study indicate that the inclusion of fermented rapeseed meal in the diet (6%) in combination with soybean meal (2%), improved the redox status of the weaners.

Diesel exhaust (DE) is a principal component of ambient air pollution and a major contributor of PM. Our study aimed to examine whether early-life perinatal DE exposure is sufficient to affect behavioral and biochemical endpoints related to Alzheimer's disease later in life. To achieve this, mice were perinatally exposed (embryonic day 0-postnatal day 21) to DE (250-300 mu g/m(3)) or filtered air (FA), and allowed to reach aged status (>18 months). Mice underwent behavioral assessment at 6 and 20 months of age, with tissue collected at 22 months for biochemical endpoints. At 6 months, minimal changes were noted in home-cage behavior of DE treated animals. At 20 months, an alternation deficit was noted with the T-maze, although no difference was seen in the object location task or any home-cage metrics. DE exposure did not alter the expression of A beta 42, phosphorylated tau S199, or total tau. However, IBA-1 protein, a microglial activation marker, was significantly higher in DE exposed animals. Further, lipid peroxidation levels were significantly higher in the DE exposed animals compared to FA controls. Cytokine levels were largely unchanged with DE exposure, suggesting a lack of inflammation despite persistent lipid peroxidation. Taken together, the findings of this study support that perinatal exposure alone is sufficient to cause lasting changes in the brain, although the effects appear to be less striking than those previously reported in younger animals, suggesting some effects do not persist over time. These findings are encouraging from a public health standpoint and support the aggressive reduction of DE emissions to reduce lifetime exposure and potentially reduce disease outcome.

AB  - Although supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during porcine oocyte IVM is well-established, the available data are limited due to the lack of consistency. Moreover, to our knowledge, the anti-oxidant effects of DHA on porcine oocytes have not been reported. Hence, this study aimed to examine the effects of DHA supplementation on the regulation of energy metabolism during porcine oocyte maturation to improve oocyte maturation and embryonic development. By supplementing the IVM medium with various DHA concentrations, 25 mu M DHA was identified as the optimal concentration which improved intraoocyte glutathione content and enhanced embryonic development after parthenogenesis. Compared to embryos derived from the control group, those derived from SCNT or IVF showed significantly improved blastocyst formation upon DHA supplementation during IVM. In addition, various transcription factors associated with oocyte development and apoptosis in mature oocytes were beneficially regulated in the DHA-treated oocytes. Moreover, DHA improved the AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK)-regulatory ability of porcine oocytes and ameliorated nuclear maturation and embryonic development, which were decreased by artificially downregulating AMPK. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of DHA as an AMPK regulator on oocyte maturation and embryo development in pigs. Furthermore, DHA addition to the IVM medium upregulated the relative expression of genes associated with mitochondrial potential and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the membrane potential of mitochondria (evaluated based on the JC-1 aggregate/JC-1 monomer ratio) and the levels of fatty acids and lipid droplets in matured oocytes increased, resulting in increased ATP synthesis. In conclusion, the DHA treatment of porcine oocytes with 25 mu M DHA during IVM enhances the homeostasis of energy metabolism by improving mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, leading to improved quality of matured oocytes and enhanced embryonic developmental potential of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos. Thus, 25 mu M DHA supplementation could serve as a tool for improving the quality of IVP embryos. The study findings provide a basis for further research on improving the production efficiency of cloned animals by securing high-quality matured oocytes and enhancing energy metabolism in mammalian oocytes, including those of pigs.

AB  - The present study compared the outcomes of in vivo embryo production in Morada Nova ewes subjected to either 9-day (G-9(SOV), n = 21) or 12-day (G-12(SOV), n = 21) progesterone (P-4)-based estruses synchronization protocol coupled with superovulatory treatment with decreasing doses of porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (133 mg of pFSH given over 3 days). Non-surgical embryo recovery (NSER) was performed 6-7 days after the onset of oestrus. Total antral follicle count doubled from the first to the sixth pFSH dose in both groups (p < .05). Oestrus responses did not vary between the two groups of animals (95.2%). Corpora lutea (CL) were detected in 85.0% and 60.0% of ewes that previously manifested oestrus behaviour in G-9(SOV) and G-12(SOV) respectively. NSER was successfully completed in 86.2% of ewes that had CL (p > .05). The mean number of CL per ewe/successfully flushed donor ewe was greater (p < .05) in G-12(SOV) (12.3 +/- 1.7/12.1 +/- 1.9) than in G-9(SOV) (7.9 +/- 1.4/8.2 +/- 1.6). Mean numbers of retrieved blastocysts and viable embryos were greater (p > .05) in G-12(SOV) (5.8 +/- 1.9 and 3.7 +/- 1.7) than G-9(SOV) (3.5 +/- 1.1 and 0.8 +/- 0.3 respectively). The total follicle count (all follicles >= 2 mm in diameter) at the sixth pFSH dose (at P-4-device removal) was positively correlated (p < .05) with the number of CL (r = .95) and viable embryos (r = .91) in G-12(SOV). The ewes with >= 10 Cl (48% of all flushed donors) yielded 80.5% of viable embryos. In summary: (a) Morada Nova ewes from G-12(SOV) group had better superovulatory responses compared with G-9(SOV) group; (b) total follicle count at the last pFSH dose was a good predictor of superovulatory responses only in the ewes primed with P-4 for 12 days; and (c) animals with >= 10 ovulations are main contributors to viable embryo production in Morada Nova ewes.

AB  - Since the 1970s, maternal corticosteroid therapy has been used successfully to induce labor. This allows for better monitoring of parturients and provision of first aid to neonates, improving neonatal viability, as this treatment induces maturation in a variety of fetal tissues, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Although the effects of corticosteroids are well known, few studies have investigated the influence of this therapy in Santa In & ecirc;s sheep. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone at two doses (8 and 16 mg) to induce lambing in Santa In & ecirc;s ewes at 145 days of gestation and assess its effects on neonatal vitality. For this study, 58 ewes raised in an extensive system were investigated. Pregnancy was confirmed after artificial insemination at a set time or after controlled mounting. Ewes were separated into three groups: an untreated control group (G1: 0 mg) and groups treated with two doses of dexamethasone (G2: 8 mg and G3: 16 mg). In total, 79 lambs were born. Their vitality was assessed based on their Apgar score, weight, temperature, and postnatal behavior. SAS v9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to analyze data, considering a 5% significance level for all analyses. The births in the induced groups occurred 48.4 +/- 22.1 h after induction, while the ewes that underwent non-induced labor gave birth 131.96 +/- 41.9 h after placebo application (p < 0.05), confirming the efficacy of dexamethasone to induce and synchronize labor. The induced and non-induced neonates had similar Apgar scores, temperatures, weights, and postnatal behavioral parameters (p > 0.05). This study showed that inducing labor in Santa In & ecirc;s ewes at 145 days of gestation with a full (16 mg) or half dose (8 mg) of dexamethasone is an effective technique and does not compromise neonate vitality.

AB  - The abdomen is a key region in small animal veterinary practice, with the middle and caudal sections housing various organ systems that are susceptible to dysfunction, necessitating medical intervention or surgery. Sectional imaging techniques like CT and MRI are commonly used in small mammals, but no studies have focused on rodent abdomen. This study aimed to correlate micro-CT and MRI images of the middle and caudal abdominal regions with corresponding anatomical sections in Syrian hamsters (SHs), which are popular pets and experimental models. Ten healthy male SHs were used, and anatomical structures from frozen sections were compared with corresponding MCT and MRI images. Clinically relevant structures identified in anatomical sections were discernible on MCT and MRI scans. The key findings include the presence of glandular and non-glandular stomachs, the stomach and cecum primarily located on the left side, the absence of ampulla coli, sacculus rotundus, and cecal appendix, and sacculation of the colon, as well as the jejunum, mainly on the right side. The vesicular, coagulating, and prostate glands were also present, and the right kidney did not extend to the last thoracic vertebra. The results were similar to abdominal anatomical and radiologic studies in rats, mice, and guinea pigs, regardless of the rat's and mice's sacculated cecum and the guinea pig's glandular stomach. However, significant differences were observed compared to the rabbit abdomen's sectional anatomy and CT findings. This study highlights the diagnostic value of MCT and MRI in SHs and provides a valuable reference for interpreting cross-sectional abdominal images in SHs.

AB  - Simple Summary Bacillus licheniformis has been shown to be safe as a green additive in food and feed. This experiment was conducted to investigate the value of Bacillus licheniformis in the diet of piglets. Our results suggested that dietary Bacillus licheniformis supplementation plays an important role in improving the average daily gain, alleviating diarrhea, improving antioxidant capacity, promoting immune function, and regulating the intestinal microflora of weaned piglets. Bacillus licheniformis (B. licheniformis) is a safe probiotic that can promote animal growth and inhibit pathogenic bacteria. This study aimed to assess the effects of B. licheniformis, one green feed additive, on growth performance, diarrhea incidence, immune function, fecal volatile fatty acids, and microflora structure in weaned piglets. Weaned piglets (n = 180) were randomly divided into three treatment groups and fed a basal diet and a basal diet supplemented with 500 mg B. licheniformis per kg and 1000 mg B. licheniformis per kg, respectively. The dietary 500 mg/kg B. licheniformis inclusion improved the average daily gain, reduced diarrhea incidence, and strengthened antioxidant capacity. Piglets supplemented with B. licheniformis presented increased serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM) compared to the CON group. Meanwhile, the expression of anti-inflammation factors was increased, and the levels of pro-inflammation factors were reduced after B. licheniformis administration. Moreover, the levels of volatile fatty acids, including acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid, in the BL500 and BL1000 groups were increased compared with the CON group, and the concentration of valeric acid was higher in the BL500 group. Furthermore, piglets in the 500 mg/kg B. licheniformis addition group significantly altered fecal microbiota by increasing Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Oscillospira. In conclusion, dietary B. licheniformis relieved diarrhea, enhanced antioxidant capacity, immunity function, and fecal microflora structure in weaned pigs.

AB  - The current first-line antidepressants have the drawback of slow onset, which greatly affects the treatment of depression. Crocetin, one of the main active ingredients in saffron (Crocus sativus L.), has been demonstrated to have antidepressant activities, but whether it has a rapid antidepressant effect remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the onset, duration, and mechanisms of the rapid antidepressant activity of crocetin (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) in male mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS). The results of behavioral tests showed that crocetin exerted rapid antidepressant-like effect in mice with depression-like phenotypes, including rapid normalization of depressive-like behaviors within 3 h, and the effects could be maintained for 2 days. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Nissl staining showed that crocetin ameliorated hippocampal neuroinflammation and nerve injuries in mice with depression-like phenotypes. The levels of inflammatory factors, corticosterone and pro brain-derived neurotrophic factor in crocetin-administrated mice serum were significantly reduced compared with those in the CRS group, as well as the levels of inflammatory factors in hippocampus. What's more, Western blot analyses showed that, compared to CRS-induced mice, the relative levels of mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase 1 and toll-like receptor 4 were significantly reduced after the administration of crocetin, and the relative expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), cAMP-response element binding protein, phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3 kinase (p-PI3K)/PI3K, phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT)/AKT, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (p-GSK3 beta)/GSK3 beta, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR)/mTOR were markedly upregulated. In conclusion, crocetin exerted rapid antidepressant effects via suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the apoptosis of neuronal cells through PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The rapid antidepressant effect of crocetin (40 mg/kg) could be maintained for at least 2 days after single treatment.

AB  - The rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), particularly among underrepresented populations, highlights the urgent need for tools that can uncover clinically meaningful, population-specific genomic alterations. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a key role in tumor progression, survival, and therapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet its impact in EOCRC remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we developed AI-HOPE-PI3K, a conversational artificial intelligence platform that integrates harmonized clinical and genomic data for real-time, natural language-based analysis of PI3K pathway alterations. Built on a fine-tuned biomedical LLaMA 3 model, the system automates cohort generation, survival modeling, and mutation frequency comparisons using multi-institutional cBioPortal datasets annotated with clinical variables. AI-HOPE-PI3K replicated known associations and revealed new findings, including worse survival in colon versus rectal tumors harboring PI3K alterations, enrichment of INPP4B mutations in Hispanic/Latino EOCRC patients, and favorable survival outcomes associated with high tumor mutational burden in FOLFIRI-treated patients. The platform also enabled context-specific survival analyses stratified by age, tumor stage, and molecular alterations. These findings support the utility of AI-HOPE-PI3K as a scalable and accessible tool for integrative, pathway-specific analysis, demonstrating its potential to advance precision oncology and reduce disparities in EOCRC through data-driven discovery.

AB  - Simple Summary Although artificial antiviral drugs can effectively inhibit the proliferation of viruses, these drugs not only have serious side effects, but also create drug-resistant virus strains and produce harmful drug residues. In comparison, natural antiviral compounds have many distinctive advantages. For example, natural compounds, in general, have a lower toxicity, lower price, and better antiviral effects. Nowadays, wide applications of natural antiviral compounds not only provide us with safe meat products, but also reduce the abuse of antibiotics, thus reducing the number of drug-resilient microbes and viruses. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the antiviral activity of Ren's oligopeptides-1 against the pseudorabies virus (PRV). Ren's oligopeptides-1 is a plant-derived drug with an antiviral activity against herpesvirus. Ren's oligopeptides-1 contains ginger, garlic, onion, banana peel, and bitter melon. We discovered that the CC50 value of Ren's oligopeptides-1 was 15 mg/mL, while the EC50 value was 6 mg/mL. This indicated that the concentration of 6 mg/mL was optimal for inhibiting the replication of PRV. In this study, PRV was used to conduct in vitro experiments on PK15 cells to explore the antiviral effect of Ren's oligopeptides-1, which could become a promising feed additive. Newly synthesized Ren's oligopeptides-1 was found to have an antiviral effect in clinical trials, and the purpose of this study was to further demonstrate the antiviral activity of Ren's oligopeptides-1 against the PRV 152-GFP strain. We used the real-time cell analysis system (RTCA) to detect the cytotoxicity of different concentrations of Ren's oligopeptides-1. We then applied high content screening (HCS) to detect the antiviral activity of Ren's oligopeptides-1 against PRV. Meanwhile, the fluorescence signal of the virus was collected in real time and the expression levels of the related genes in the PK15 cells infected with PRV were detected using real-time PCR. At the mRNA level, we discovered that, at a concentration of 6 mg/mL, Ren's oligopeptides-1 reduced the expression of pseudorabies virus (PRV) genes such as IE180, UL18, UL54, and UL21 at a concentration of 6 mg/mL. We then determined that Ren's oligopeptides-1 has an EC50 value of 6 mg/mL, and at this level, no cytotoxicity was observed.

AB  - The iron and steel industry produces large volumes of iron and steel-making slags as mineral residues and a massive volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the consumption of raw materials, such as iron ore, lime, and coke. Converter slag, produced during the refining of pig iron to produce steel in steel-making furnaces, is a complex oxide composed of CaO, FeO, SiO2, and other minor oxides. The scope for recycling of converter slag is rather limited compared with that of blast furnace slag due to the unique chemical composition. Herein, we report a facile route to convert converter slag into a CaO-Fe3O4-SiO2 composite (Cslag-CFS) which possesses a high CO2 adsorption performance. A composite composed of crystalline CaO particles, Fe3O4 particles, and mesoporous SiO2 (mean surface area 64 m(2)/g) was synthesized using converter slag as the sole source material and formic acid as a leaching agent via a facile dissolution-hydrothermal process. Owing to the formation of a crystalline CaO phase, the composite exhibited a CO2 uptake of 23.4 wt % per mass of adsorbent and may be used as an efficient and regenerative solid adsorbent for CO2 capture. This study offers an alternative approach that may provide solutions to both recycling of waste slag and recovery of CO2 gas that the iron and steel-making industry is currently confronting.

AB  - Molecular composition, viscosity, and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) were investigated for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from synthetic mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) representing emission profiles for Scots pine trees under healthy and aphid-herbivory stress conditions. Model "healthy plant SOA" and "stressed plant SOA" were generated in a 5 m(3) environmental smog chamber by photooxidation of the mixtures at 50% relative humidity (RH). SOA from photooxidation of alpha -pinene was also prepared for comparison. Molecular composition was determined with high resolution mass spectrometry, viscosity was determined with the poke-flow technique, and liquid-liquid phase separation was investigated with optical microscopy. The stressed plant SOA had increased abundance of higher molecular weight species, reflecting a greater fraction of sesquiterpenes in the stressed VOC mixture compared to the healthy plant VOC mixture. LLPS occurred in both the healthy and stressed plant SOA; however, stressed plant SOA exhibited phase separation over a broader humidity range than healthy plant SOA, with LLPS persisting down to 23 +/- 11% RH. At RH <= 25%, both stressed and healthy plant SOA viscosity exceeded 10(8) Pa s, a value similar to that of tar pitch. At 40% and 50% RH, stressed plant SOA had the highest viscosity, followed by healthy plant SOA and then alpha -pinene SOA in descending order. The observed peak abundances in the mass spectra were also used to estimate the SOA viscosity as a function of RH and volatility. The predicted viscosity of the healthy plant SOA was lower than that of the stressed plant SOA driven by both the higher glass transition temperatures and lower hygroscopicity of the organic molecules making up stressed plant SOA. These findings suggest that plant stress influences the physicochemical properties of biogenic SOA. Furthermore, a complex mixture of VOCs resulted in a higher SOA viscosity compared to SOA generated from alpha -pinene alone at >= 25% RH, highlighting the importance of studying properties of SOA generated from more realistic multi-component VOC mixtures.

AB  - This report describes fossils recovered from Ganxian Cave in 2008 and 2018 by the Natural History Museum and Anthropology Museum of Guangxi. The cave sedimentary fill yielded rich mammalian fossils consisting mainly of isolated teeth of medium- to large-sized mammals (Primates, Proboscidea, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Rodentia, Artiodactyla) of typical 'Ailuropoda-Stegodon' fauna, (e.g. Stegodon orientalis, Ailuropoda baconi, Pongo weidenreichi, Tapirus sinensis, Megatapirus augustus, Crocuta ultima), and more numerous extant species belonging to 28 taxa in total. The biochronological age of the fauna agreed with the age estimates obtained using Uranium-series and coupled ESR/U-series dating. Collectively, these results indicate a Ganxian fossil age range of 168.9 +/- 2.4 ka to 362 +/- 78 ka and establish Ganxian Cave as one of the most precisely dated Middle Pleistocene fossil sites in southern China. Comparison of Ganxian fauna with Pleistocene fossil records of the well-documented faunas of southern China and southeast Asia indicates that the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) probably first appeared in Ganxian Cave. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction-based analysis of the large mammalian fossil assemblage from Ganxian Cave indicates that during the late Middle Pleistocene, the habitat consisted mainly of forests with some open areas and the climate was warm and humid.

AB  - In this study, blueberry anthocyanins extract (BAE) was used to investigate its protective effect on arsenicinduced rat hippocampal neurons damage. Arsenic exposure resulted in elevated levels of oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant capacity and increased apoptosis in rat hippocampal brain tissue and mitochondria. Immunohistochemical results showed that arsenic exposure also significantly decreased the expression of mitochondrial biosynthesis -related factors PGC-1 alpha and TFAM. Treatment with BAE alleviated the decrease in antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial biogenesis related protein PGC-1 alpha/NRF2/TFAM expression, and ATP production of arsenic induced hippocampal neurons in rats, and improved cognitive function in arsenic damaged rats. This study provides new insights into the detoxification effect of anthocyanins on the nervous system toxicity caused by metal exposure in the environment, indicating that anthocyanins may be a natural antioxidant against the nervous system toxicity caused by environmental metal exposure.

AB  - Cryopreserved ram sperm is highly sensitive to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) which impair sperm function and integrity. Antioxidants such as cysteine can mitigate the effect of ROS, although the optimal concentration or timing of supplementation is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of concentration and timing of cysteine supplementation on the integrity and function of cryopreserved ram spermatozoa. Nine ejaculates were collected from three Texel rams then cryopreserved and supplemented with cysteine (0, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/mL) added pre -freeze (PF), post -thaw (PT) or pre -freeze and post -thaw (PF + PT) generating seven treatments: 1) control 0 mg/mL, 2) PF 0.5 mg/mL, 3) PF 1 mg/mL, 4) PT 0.5 mg/mL, 5), PT 1.0 mg/mL, 6) PF + PT 0.5 mg/mL and 7) PF + PT 1.0 mg/mL. Sperm motility, viability, acrosome integrity, ROS production and penetrability through artificial cervical mucus were assessed post -thaw. Cysteine supplementation reduced ROS production which thereby improved spermatozoa motility, viability, acrosome integrity and penetrability (p < 0.001) Sperm integrity for all parameters was greatest in spermatozoa treated PF + PT with 1.0 mg/mL cysteine, although treatment pre -freeze or post -thaw also improved integrity beyond the control. This study has identified that 1.0 mg/mL cysteine is most beneficial and has highlighted the importance of preventing oxidative stress in spermatozoa post -thaw. These finding can help to mitigate the detrimental effect of cryopreservation on spermatozoa and aid the development of cryopreservation protocols in sheep.

AB  - Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in pregnancy is the most common form of thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy, which can affect fetal nervous system development and increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders after birth. However, the mechanism of the effect of maternal subclinical hypothyroidism on fetal brain development and behavioral phenotypes is still unclear and requires further study. In this study, we constructed a mouse model of maternal subclinical hypothyroidism by exposing dams to drinking water containing 50 ppm propylthiouracil (PTU) during pregnancy and found that its offspring were accompanied by severe cognitive deficits by behavioral testing. Mechanistically, gestational SCH resulted in the upregulation of protein expression and activity of HDAC1/2/3 in the hippocampus of the offspring. ChIP analysis revealed that H3K9ac on the neurogranin (Ng) promoter was reduced in the hippocampus of the offspring of SCH, with a significant reduction in Ng protein, leading to reduced expression levels of synaptic plasticity markers PSD95 (a membrane-associated protein in the postsynaptic density) and SYN (synaptophysin, a specific marker for presynaptic terminals), and impaired synaptic plasticity. In addition, administration of MS-275 (an HDAC1/2/3-specific inhibitor) to SCH offspring alleviated impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction in offspring. Thus, our study suggests that maternal subclinical hypothyroidism may mediate offspring cognitive dysfunction through the HDAC1/2/3-H3K9ac-Ng pathway. Our study contributes to the understanding of the signaling mechanisms underlying maternal subclinical hypothyroidism-mediated cognitive impairment in the offspring.
   Maternal subclinical hypothyroidism leads to increased expression of HDAC1/2/3 in the offspring, which in turn reduces the H3K9ac level on the Ng gene promoter and downregulates Ng level, leading to altered synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment. When MS-275 was administered to maternal subclinical hypothyroidism male offspring, it inhibited HDAC1/2/3 expression and activity, promoted H3K9ac enrichment of the Ng gene promoter, increased Ng expression, and alleviated cognitive impairment in maternal subclinical hypothyroidism offspring.image

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the storage oils of plant seeds, and these lipids provide energy for seed germination and valuable oils for human consumption. Three diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1, DGAT2, and DGAT3) and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferases participate in the biosynthesis of TAGs. DGAT1 and DGAT2 participate in the biosynthesis of TAGs through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway. In this study, we functionally characterized CsDGAT1 and CsDGAT2 from camelina (Camelina sativa). Green fluorescent protein-fused CsDGAT1 and CsDGAT2 localized to the ER when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. To generate Csdgat1 and Csdgat2 mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, camelina was transformed with a binary vector carrying Cas9 and the respective guide RNAs targeting CsDGAT1s and CsDGAT2s via the Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip method. The EDD1 lines had missense and nonsense mutations in the CsDGAT1 homoeologs, suggesting that they retained some CsDGAT1 function, and their seeds showed decreased eicosaenoic acid (C20:1) contents and increased C18:3 contents compared to the wild type (WT). The EDD2 lines had a complete knockout of all CsDGAT2 homoeologs and a slightly decreased C18:3 content compared to the WT. In conclusion, CsDGAT1 and CsDGAT2 have a small influence on the seed oil content and have an acyl preference for C20:1 and C18:3, respectively. This finding can be applied to develop oilseed plants containing high omega-3 fatty acids or high oleic acid.

AB  - A growing number of studies have examined alterations in white matter organization in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using diffusion MRI (dMRI), but the results have been mixed which may be partially due to relatively small sample sizes among studies. Altered structural connectivity may be both a neurobiological vulnerability for, and a result of, PTSD. In an effort to find reliable effects, we present a multi-cohort analysis of dMRI metrics across 3047 individuals from 28 cohorts currently participating in the PGC-ENIGMA PTSD working group (a joint partnership between the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis consortium). Comparing regional white matter metrics across the full brain in 1426 individuals with PTSD and 1621 controls (2174 males/873 females) between ages 18-83, 92% of whom were trauma-exposed, we report associations between PTSD and disrupted white matter organization measured by lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the tapetum region of the corpus callosum (Cohen's d = -0.11, p = 0.0055). The tapetum connects the left and right hippocampus, for which structure and function have been consistently implicated in PTSD. Results were consistent even after accounting for the effects of multiple potentially confounding variables: childhood trauma exposure, comorbid depression, history of traumatic brain injury, current alcohol abuse or dependence, and current use of psychotropic medications. Our results show that PTSD may be associated with alterations in the broader hippocampal network.

AB  - Many eukaryotic cell-surface proteins are post-translationally modified by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety that anchors them to the cell membrane. The biosynthesis of GPI anchors is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol. This reaction is catalyzed by GPI GlcNAc transferase, a multisubunit complex comprising the catalytic subunit Gpi3/PIG-A as well as at least five other subunits, including the hydrophobic protein Gpi2, which is essential for the activity of the complex in yeast and mammals, but the function of which is not known. To investigate the role of Gpi2, we exploited Trypanosoma brucei (Tb), an early diverging eukaryote and important model organism that initially provided the first insights into GPI structure and biosynthesis. We generated insect-stage (procyclic) trypanosomes that lack TbGPI2 and found that in TbGPI2-null parasites, (i) GPI GlcNAc transferase activity is reduced, but not lost, in contrast with yeast and human cells, (ii) the GPI GlcNAc transferase complex persists, but its architecture is affected, with loss of at least the TbGPI1 subunit, and (iii) the GPI anchors of procyclins, the major surface proteins, are underglycosylated when compared with their WT counterparts, indicating the importance of TbGPI2 for reactions that occur in the Golgi apparatus. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized TbGPI2 not only to the endoplasmic reticulum but also to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that in addition to its expected function as a subunit of the GPI GlcNAc transferase complex, TbGPI2 may have an enigmatic noncanonical role in Golgi-localized GPI anchor modification in trypanosomes.

AB  - The ability to learn and remember, which is fundamental for behavioral adaptation, is susceptible to stressful experiences during the early postnatal period, such as abnormal levels of maternal care. The exact mechanisms underlying these effects still remain elusive. This study examined whether early life stress (ELS) alters memory and brain activation patterns in male mice. Therefore, we examined the expression of the immediate early genes (IEGs) c-Fos and Arc in the dentate gyrus (DG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) after training and memory retrieval in a fear conditioning task. Furthermore, we examined the potential of RU38486 (RU486), a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, to mitigate ELS-induced memory deficits by blocking stress signalling during adolescence. Arc::dVenus reporter mice, which allow investigating experience-dependent expression of the immediate early gene Arc also at more remote time points, were exposed to ELS by housing dams and offspring with limited bedding and nesting material (LBN) between postnatal days (PND) 2-9 and trained in a fear conditioning task at adult age. We found that ELS reduced both fear acquisition and contextual memory retrieval. RU486 did not prevent these effects. ELS reduced the number of Arc::dVenus+ cells in DG and BLA after training, while the number of c-Fos+ cells were left unaffected. After memory retrieval, ELS decreased c-Fos+ cells in the ventral DG and BLA. ELS also altered the colocalization of c-Fos+ cells with Arc::dVenus+ cells in the ventral DG, possibly indicating impaired engram allocation in the ventral DG after memory retrieval. In conclusion, this study shows that ELS alters neuronal activation patterns after fear acquisition and retrieval, which may provide mechanistic insights into enduring impact of ELS on the processing of fear memories, possibly via changes in cell (co-) activation and engram cell allocation.

AB  - Background Adherens junctions (AJs) facilitate cell-cell contact and contribute to cellular communication as well as signaling under physiological and pathological conditions. Aberrant expression of AJ proteins is frequently observed in human cancers; however, how these factors contribute to tumorigenesis is poorly understood. In addition, for some factors such as a-catenin contradicting data has been described. In this study we aim to decipher how the AJ constituent a-catenin contributes to liver cancer formation.
   Methods TCGA data was used to detect transcript changes in 23 human tumor types. For the detection of proteins, liver cancer tissue microarrays were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Liver cancer cell lines (HLF, Hep3B, HepG2) were used for viability, proliferation, and migration analyses after RNAinterference-mediated gene silencing. To investigate the tumor initiating potential, vectors coding for alpha-catenin and myristoylated AKT were injected in mice by hydrodynamic gene delivery. A BioID assay combined with mass spectrometry was performed to identify alpha-catenin binding partners. Results were confirmed by proximity ligation and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Binding of transcriptional regulators at gene promoters was investigated using chromatin-immunoprecipitation.
   Results alpha-catenin mRNA was significantly reduced in many human malignancies (e.g., colon adenocarcinoma). In contrast, elevated alpha-catenin expression in other cancer entities was associated with poor clinical outcome (e.g., for hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC). In HCC cells, alpha-catenin was detectable at the membrane as well as cytoplasm where it supported tumor cell proliferation and migration. In vivo, alpha-catenin facilitated moderate oncogenic properties in conjunction with AKT overexpression. Cytokinesis regulator centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) was identified as a novel a-catenin-binding protein in the cytoplasm of HCC cells. The physical interaction between alpha-catenin and CEP55 was associated with CEP55 stabilization. CEP55 was highly expressed in human HCC tissues and its overexpression correlated with poor overall survival and cancer recurrence. Next to the alpha-catenin-dependent protein stabilization, CEP55 was transcriptionally induced by a complex consisting of TEA domain transcription factors ( TEADs), forkhead box M1 (FoxM1), and yes-associated protein (YAP). Surprisingly, CEP55 did not affect HCC cell proliferation but significantly supported migration in conjunction with alpha-catenin.
   Conclusion Migration-supporting CEP55 is induced by two independent mechanisms in HCC cells: stabilization through interaction with the AJ protein alpha-catenin and transcriptional activation via the FoxM1/TEAD/YAP complex.

AB  - This study aimed to identify transcriptome differences between distinct or transitional stage spherical, ovoid, and tubular porcine blastocysts throughout the initiation of elongation. We performed a global transcriptome analysis of differential gene expression using RNA-Seq with high temporal resolution between spherical, ovoid, and tubular stage blastocysts at specific sequential stages of development from litters containing conceptus populations of distinct or transitional blastocysts. After RNA-Seq analysis, significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways were identified between distinct morphologies or sequential development stages. Overall, 1898 significant DEGs were identified between distinct spherical and ovoid morphologies, with 311 total DEGs between developmental stages throughout this first morphological transition, while 15 were identified between distinct ovoid and tubular, with eight total throughout these second morphological transition developmental stages. The high quantity of DEGs and pathways between conceptus stages throughout the spherical to ovoid transition suggests the importance of gene regulation during this first morphological transition for initiating elongation. Further, extensive DEG coverage of known elongation signaling pathways was illustrated from spherical to ovoid, and regulation of lipid signaling and membrane/ECM remodeling across these early conceptus stages were implicated as essential to this process, providing novel insights into potential mechanisms governing this rapid morphological change.

AB  - Ischemia leads to a severe dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis and excitotoxic cell damage in the brain. Shorter episodes of energy depletion, for instance during peri-infarct depolarizations, can also acutely perturb glutamate signaling. It is less clear if such episodes of metabolic failure also have persistent effects on glutamate signaling and how the relevant mechanisms such as glutamate release and uptake are differentially affected. We modeled acute and transient metabolic failure by using a chemical ischemia protocol and analyzed its effect on glutamatergic synaptic transmission and extracellular glutamate signals by electrophysiology and multiphoton imaging, respectively, in the mouse hippocampus. Our experiments uncover a duration-dependent bidirectional dysregulation of glutamate signaling. Whereas short chemical ischemia induces a lasting potentiation of presynaptic glutamate release and synaptic transmission, longer episodes result in a persistent postsynaptic failure of synaptic transmission. We also observed unexpected differences in the vulnerability of the investigated cellular mechanisms. Axonal action potential firing and glutamate uptake were surprisingly resilient compared to postsynaptic cells, which overall were most vulnerable to acute and transient metabolic stress. We conclude that short perturbations of energy supply lead to a lasting potentiation of synaptic glutamate release, which may increase glutamate excitotoxicity well beyond the metabolic incident.

AB  - Ageing is a biological phenomenon that determines the impairment of cognitive performances, in particular, affecting memory. Inflammation and cellular senescence are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline. The gut microbiota-brain axis could exert a critical role in influencing brain homeostasis during ageing, modulating neuroinflammation, and possibly leading to inflammaging. Due to their anti-ageing properties, medicinal mushrooms can be utilised as a resource for developing pharmaceuticals and functional foods. Specifically, Hericium erinaceus (He), thanks to its bioactive metabolites, exerts numerous healthy beneficial effects, such as reinforcing the immune system, counteracting ageing, and improving cognitive performance. Our previous works demonstrated the capabilities of two months of He1 standardised extract oral supplementation in preventing cognitive decline in elderly frail mice. Herein, we showed that this treatment did not change the overall gut microbiome composition but significantly modified the relative abundance of genera specifically involved in cognition and inflammation. Parallelly, a significant decrease in crucial markers of inflammation and cellular senescence, i.e., CD45, GFAP, IL6, p62, and gamma H2AX, was demonstrated in the dentate gyrus and Cornus Ammonis hippocampal areas through immunohistochemical experiments. In summary, we suggested beneficial and anti-inflammatory properties of He1 in mouse hippocampus through the gut microbiome-brain axis modulation.

AB  - Microglia are innate immune cells within the brain that arise from a distinct myeloid lineage. Like other tissue resident macrophages, microglia respond to injury or immune challenges and participate in reparative processes such as phagocytosis to preserve normal function. Importantly, they also participate in normal homeostatic processes including maintenance of neurogenic niches and synaptic plasticity associated with development. This review highlights aspects of microglial biology and how repeated insults that occur with age, neurodegenerative disease and possibly radiation exposure may heighten microglial responses and contribute to their dysfunction, creating a situation where their normal reparative mechanisms are no longer sufficient to maintain brain health. These ideas are discussed in the context of an evolving literature focused on microglial responses as possible targets for mitigation of late CNS radiation effects that represent potential risks for future exploration of deep space environments.

AB  - The main concerns for agricultural production nowadays are excessive crop cultivation, water scarcity, and poor soil quality. It is possible to amend agronomic soil with activated biochar (BC) to achieve high water-fertilizer availability and Camelina crop production under rainfed conditions by using an efficient and environmentally safe technology. A split plot experiment was arranged on a randomized complete block design with nine treatments and three replications. The main and second factors were supplementary irrigation (SI) and BC, respectively, with SI comprising of no irrigation (control), irrigation at the flowering stage and seed-filling stage, while BC included control (BC0), 5 (BC5), and 10 (BC10) t ha- 1. The number of lateral branches and seeds in the silique, seed yield (2751.8 kg ha- 1), 1000-seed weight (1.16 g) and oil yield (991.50 kg ha- 1) were highest in response to irrigation at the flowering stage and the application of BC10. The gas chromatography analysis showed that the highest amount of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, linolenic, eicosadienoic and palmitic acids) was obtained in response to BC10 and irrigation at the seed-filling stage. Finally, the results showed that BC10 and the application of SI at the flowering stage increased the seed and oil yield, and unsaturated fatty acid content in Camelina. This study demonstrates that BC amendments can improve plant performance and preserve the environment, with significant implications for the alleviation of drought and sustainable Camelina production in arid regions. The study provides a practical way to produce Camelina in rainfed areas, which can benefit farmers economically.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease-related cognition impairment is correlated with increased neuroinflammation. Studies show that physical exercises improve cognitive function and regulate neuroinflammation. However, no sufficient studies have been performed to directly observe the mechanism of exercise-related effects on microglia and neuroinflammation, in association with memory function under Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to explore the relationship of TREM2, microglia activation and neuroinflammation in the development of Alzheimer's disease, followed by investigating why physical exercises improve cognition in the Alzheimer's disease model by means of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection. We found that: 1) Recognition memory impairment in A beta-induced Alzheimer's disease model was associated with the reduction in TREM2 which induced microglial activation and neuroinflammation; 2) Exercise activated the TREM2 pathway, which was necessary for inhibiting microglial activation and neuroinflammation, leading to improved recognition memory in the Alzheimer's disease model. Together, the improvement of AD-associated recognition memory by exercises is associated with up-regulation of the TREM2 pathway which promotes the phenotypic conversion of microglia and decreases the level of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Simple Summary Pre-weaning mortality is a significant economic and welfare issue for the Australian pig industry. Tryptophan can increase serotonin and melatonin production. Serotonin can decrease stress and indirectly increase calcium, which may improve sow health. Meanwhile, melatonin may decrease stillbirths and improve piglet viability at birth and, in turn, increase survival to weaning. This study determined whether feeding 0.16%, 0.42% or 0.56% tryptophan (per kg of feed) to sows during late pregnancy until seven days of lactation could improve piglet survival and viability to weaning and increase the levels of calcium and melatonin in sows. Supplementing tryptophan at levels of 0.42 and 0.56% increased piglet survival compared to no supplementation but did not have an effect on piglet viability. Furthermore, tryptophan supplementation did not increase sow melatonin and calcium levels compared to 0.16%. Further research is required to understand how tryptophan may improve piglet survival, particularly through sow maternal behaviour, and if 5-hydroxytryptophan (the form of tryptophan that directly converts to serotonin and melatonin) would further improve piglet survival. Tryptophan indirectly increases plasma calcium levels, which may improve sow health, and melatonin production, which may improve piglet survival when supplemented during late gestation and lactation. It was hypothesised that tryptophan would increase piglet survival and increase sow circulating melatonin and calcium. Seventy-two multiparous (Landrace x Large White) sows were allocated to either control (0.16% tryptophan; n = 24), low tryptophan (0.42%; n = 24) or high tryptophan (0.56%; n = 24). Piglet viability measures consisted of weights, behaviour, meconium staining, rectal temperature, blood glucose and serum immunoglobulin G concentration. Blood samples collected from sows were analysed for melatonin (two daytime and three night-time samples; n = 17) and calcium (two samples pre- and post-farrowing; n = 14). Both tryptophan treatments increased piglet survival compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Tryptophan had no effect on piglet viability (p > 0.05) and no effect on sow plasma melatonin and calcium concentrations compared with the control group (p > 0.05) except at 21:00 when low tryptophan sows had higher melatonin concentration compared with high tryptophan (p = 0.011). Further research to understand the mediating effects of tryptophan (particularly 5-hydroxytryptophan) on piglet survival, including sow behaviour, is warranted.

AB  - Lactoferricin is an amphipathic, cationic peptide with antimicrobial properties. This study aimed to investigate the combined effect of chitosan loaded with lactoferricin and antibody against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. lactoferricin was prepared using the modified method of Law and Reiter. By injecting two inactivated bacteria S. aureus and P. aeruginosa along with chitosan as an adjuvant to the camel neck, antibodies were prepared and their production was confirmed using the Indirect-ELISA method. Lactoferricin and antibody were loaded on chitosan using thiamine method. The combined effect of lactoferricin and antibody loaded on chitosan against bacteria was investigated using a bacterial growth test in the presence or absence (control) of the sample. Based on the results of statistical analysis, the data obtained from the combined effect of lactoferricin and antibody loaded on chitosan reduced the growth rate of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa compared to the control (without lactoferricin and antibody loaded on chitosan). There is a significant interaction (p <= 0.01) between different levels of lactoferricin and antibody loaded on chitosan on the growth of both bacteria. Bacterial growth curves (based on optical density) showed that all concentrations of lactoferricin and antibody dilutions significantly decreased the growth of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. According to the growth curves, it can be concluded that lactoferricin and antibody loaded on chitosan acted more effectively on gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. Based on the results, it can be stated that lactoferricin and antibody loaded on chitosan as an antibacterial can be useful in a variety of commercial programs to control the growth and survival of pathogens.

AB  - The phytohormone jasmonate (JA) plays a central role in plant defenses against biotic stressors. However, our knowledge of the JA signaling pathway in rice (Oryza sativa) remains incomplete. Here, we integrated multiomic data from three tissues to characterize the functional modules involved in organizing JA-responsive genes. In the core regulatory sector, MYC2 transcription factor transcriptional cascades are conserved in different species but with distinct regulators (e.g. bHLH6 in rice), in which genes are early expressed across all tissues. In the feedback sector, MYC2 also regulates the expression of JA repressor and catabolic genes, providing negative feedback that truncates the duration of JA responses. For example, the MYC2-regulated NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factor genes NAC1, NAC3, and NAC4 encode proteins that repress JA signaling and herbivore resistance. In the tissue-specific sector, many late-expressed genes are associated with the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites that mediate particular defensive functions. For example, the terpene synthase gene TPS35 is specifically induced in the leaf sheath and TPS35 functions in defense against oviposition by brown planthoppers and the attraction of this herbivore's natural enemies. Thus, by characterizing core, tissue-specific, and feedback sectors of JA-elicited defense responses, this work provides a valuable resource for future discoveries of key JA components in this important crop.
   Jasmonate-mediated defense responses in rice can be divided into the core regulatory sector, the local tissue-specific sector, and the negative feedback sector.

AB  - Simple Summary In the past decade, the spread of H5N6 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in birds and infection in humans has attracted increasing global attention, and these viruses have the potential to become a pandemic threat to global health. In this study, the HA genes of the HB1907 and HB1905 AIVs were clustered in the 2.3.4.4h clade, and the HA genes of both strains exhibited highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) characteristics. The HB1905 strain in this study has a binding preference for avian-like (alpha-2,3) receptors only, whereas the HB1907 strain has a binding preference for both avian-like (alpha-2,3) and human-like (alpha-2,6) receptors. Compared with the HB1905 strain, the HB1907 strain showed better replication ability in MDCK cells in the early stage of infection. At the same time, the HB1907 strain showed advantages in the pathogenicity of mice and the transmission ability of direct contact between guinea pigs. These results further suggest that epidemiological surveillance and the related studies of H5N6 AIVs are essential for public health safety and the healthy and sustainable development of the livestock industry. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have the potential for cross-species transmission and pandemics. In recent years, clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 AIVs are prevalent in domestic poultry, posing a threat to the domestic poultry industry and public health. In this study, two strains of H5N6 AIVs were isolated from chickens in Hebei, China, in 2019: A/chicken/Hebei/HB1907/2019(H5N6) and A/chicken/Hebei/HB1905/2019(H5N6). Phylogenetic analysis showed that both viral HA genes clustered in the 2.3.4.4h clade. Receptor binding analysis showed that the HB1905 strain preferentially binds to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid (SA) receptors, while the HB1907 strain preferentially binds to alpha-2,3- and alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid (SA) receptors. During early infection, the HB1907 strain is highly replicable in MDCK cells, more so than the HB1905 strain. Pathogenicity assays in mice showed that both viruses could replicate in the lungs without prior adaptation, with HB1907 being more highly pathogenic in mice than the HB1905 strain. Significantly, both the HB1905 and HB1907 strains can be transmitted through direct contact among guinea pigs, but the transmission efficiency of the HB1907 strain through contact between guinea pigs is much greater than that of the HB1905 strain. These results strengthen the need for ongoing surveillance and early warning of H5N6 AIVs in poultry.

AB  - Camel Trypanosomiasis is one of the most significant illnesses influencing the livestock economic development. The present study reports observations of histological and immunohistochemical alterations of Trypanosoma evansi infection in the liver samples of camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Al-Madinah district in Saudi Arabia. Liver of camels showed presence of red blood cells among the hepatic cells, infiltration of connective and fibrous tissue between the liver's lobules, and a reduced number of hepatic cells. Upon Masson trichrome staining the infected liver showed elevated deposition of thick collagen fibers that were conspicuously stained blue. Immunohistochemical study of the - SMA-positive cells in the T. evansi infected camels also exhibited considerable growth of the brownish cells between the sinusoidal walls and around the portal area. Moreover, increase numbers of -SMA-positive cells in the tissue zone around the portal vein, artery, and bile duct branches were observed. Overall, the infection stimulates hepatic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the liver, which is a well-known component of the immune response cascade, according to the study. The acquisition of milk, meat, and other products is crucial for camels. Therefore, it is essential to examine the camels' health, risks, and pathological effect of related diseases.

AB  - In this study, polyethersulfone (PES)/sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) composite nanofiltration membranes doped with different contents of monolayer titanium carbide nanosheets (Ti3C2TX) were prepared by the nonsolvent induced phase inversion (NIPS) method. The effects of Ti3C2TX on membrane structure, separation performance and antibacterial activity were investigated systematically. The results demonstrated that the viscosity of the casting solution increased significantly with the increasing content of Ti3C2TX. In addition, the pore size of the membrane surface first decreased and then increased; porosity and hydrophilicity were optimized synchronously; and the density of negative charges on the surface increased. The M2 membrane showed a rejection rate of more than 90% for Metanil yellow (MY) and methylene blue (MEB). The order of salt ion rejection rates was magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) > sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) > sodium chloride (NaCl), and water flux reached the peak (18.5 L/m(2)<middle dot>h<middle dot>bar). The antibacterial activity of the M2 membrane was significantly enhanced, and its antibacterial rate against Bacillus subtilis increased from 15% (M0) to 58%. This phenomenon was attributed to the synergistic mechanism of the Ti3C2TX physical capture effect, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and sharp edge damage to bacterial cell membranes. This study provides theoretical support and a technical path for the development of MXene composite membranes with high separation efficiency and excellent antibacterial properties.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a very fast and effective thermochemical conversion scheme, hence suitable for the processing of elephant grass, a fast-growing and invasive grass, into bioenergy. This research investigates the pyrolysis characteristics and the thermal degradation of elephant grass using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Different characterization techniques were carried out to study the biomass and its bio-oil in order to ascertain their fuel properties. The two most widely used iso-conversional methods, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), were used to analyze the TGA data obtained over a range of temperatures at heating rates of 10, 15, and 25 degrees C/min in order to calculate the activation energy and other thermodynamic parameters. From the pyrolysis study, the highest bio-oil yield of 39 wt% was achieved at 500 degrees C. The obtained bio-oil has excellent fuel properties because of its higher heating value (HHV) of 20.9 MJ/kg, low ash and sulphur contents. The average activation energies (E-a) were 172.48 kJ/mol and 164.11 kJ/mol, respectively, for the FWO and KAS methods, while the average enthalpy changes (triangle H) were 168.31 kJ/mol and 159.32 kJ/mol. These values of E-a and triangle H revealed that the overall reaction is favourable since their difference is less than 5 kJ/mol. FWO produces higher and more accurate results since it can capture the decomposition behaviour of the different biomass components for any conversion fraction, while KAS is based on the overall reaction.

AB  - Exosomes, key mediators of intercellular transmission of pathogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta and tau, significantly influence the progression and exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Present in a variety of biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, saliva, and nasal lavage fluid (NLF), exosomes underscore their potential as integral mediators of AD pathology. By serving as vehicles for disease-specific molecules, exosomes could unveil valuable insights into disease identification and progression. This study emphasizes the imperative to investigate the impacts of exosomes on neural networks to enhance our comprehension of intracerebral neuronal communication and its implications for neurological disorders like AD. After harvesting exosomes derived from NLF of 5XFAD mice, we utilized a high-density multielectrode array (HD-MEA) system, the novel technology enabling concurrent recordings from thousands of neurons in primary cortical neuron cultures and organotypic hippocampal slices. The ensuing results revealed a surge in neuronal firing rates and disoriented neural connectivity, reflecting the effects provoked by pathological amyloid-beta oligomer treatment. The local field potentials in the exosome-treated hippocampal brain slices also exhibited aberrant rhythmicity, along with an elevated level of current source density. While this research is an initial exploration, it highlights the potential of exosomes in modulating neural networks under AD conditions and endorses the HD-MEA as an efficacious tool for exosome studies.

AB  - The blue water footprint (WF) is an indicator of freshwater required to produce a given end product. Determining the blue WF for milk production, the seasonal water use and the impact of water conservation are important sustainability considerations for the dairy industry in Ontario (Canada). In this study, a water footprint network (WFN) method was used to calculate the seasonal blue WF's from in-barn water use data and the fat-protein-corrected milk (FPCM) production. Various water conservation options were estimated using the AgriSuite software. Results showed that the total water use (L of water center dot cow(-1)center dot d(-1)) and the average blue WF (L of water center dot kg(-1) of FPCM) were 246.3 +/- 6.8 L center dot cow(-1)center dot d(-1) and 7.4 +/- 0.2 L center dot kg(-1), respectively. The total water use and the blue WF could be reduced to 182.7 +/- 5.1 L center dot cow(-1)center dot d(-1) (25.8% reduction) and 5.8 +/- 0.1 L center dot kg(-1) (21.6% reduction), respectively, through adaptive water conservation measures as the reuse of the plate cooler and milk house water. For example, conservation practices could reduce the milk house wash water use from 74.3 +/- 8.8 L center dot cow(-1)center dot d(-1) to 16.6 +/- 0.1 L center dot cow(-1)center dot d(-1) (77.7% overall reduction).

AB  - Research studying aging in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is growing, but longitudinal work is needed. Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, altered hippocampal volumes and fornix integrity, and verbal memory difficulties compared with neurotypical (NT) adults. This study examined longitudinal aging in middle-age adults with ASD versus a matched NT group, and compared findings with cross-sectional age effects across a broad adult age range. Participants were 194 adults with (n = 106; 74 male) and without (n = 88; 52 male) ASD, ages 18-71. Participants (n = 45; 40-70 age range) with two visits (2-3 years apart) were included in a longitudinal analysis. Hippocampal volume, fornix fractional anisotropy (FA), and verbal memory were measured via T1-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, respectively. Longitudinal mixed models were used for hippocampal system variables and reliable change index categories were used for Auditory Verbal Learning Test analyses. Multivariate regression was used for cross-sectional analyses. Middle-age adults with ASD had greater longitudinal hippocampal volume loss and were more likely to show clinically meaningful decline in short-term memory, compared with NT. In contrast, cross-sectional associations between increasing age and worsening short-term memory were identified in NT, but not autistic adults. Reduced fornix FA and long-term memory in ASD were found across the broad cross-sectional age range. These preliminary longitudinal findings suggest accelerated hippocampal volume loss in ASD and slightly higher rates of clinically-meaningful decline in verbal short-term memory. Contradictory cross-sectional and longitudinal results underscore the importance of longitudinal aging research in autistic adults. Lay Summary Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, differences in brain memory structures, and difficulty with memory compared with neurotypical (NT) adults. However, there are no publications that follow the same middle-age autistic adults over time to see how their brain and memory change. Our preliminary findings in a small middle-age autism sample suggest a key memory brain structure, the hippocampus, may shrink faster over 2-3 years compared with NT, and short-term memory may become more challenging for some. Across a broad adult range, autistic adults also had reduced integrity of connections to the hippocampus and greater challenges with long-term memory. In our larger sample across a broad age range, the results did not hint at this aforementioned pattern of accelerated aging. This underscores the importance of more aging research in autism, and especially research where people are followed over time.

AB  - Loop diuretics like furosemide are commonly used in heart failure (HF) treatment, but their effects on disease progression are still unclear. Furosemide treatment accelerates HF deterioration in a swine model, but the mechanism of acceleration is poorly understood. We hypothesized that furosemide activates inflammatory signaling in the failing left ventricular (LV) myocardium, leading to adverse remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A total of 14 Yorkshire pigs underwent permanent transvenous pacemaker implantation and were paced at 200 beats per minute; 9 non-instrumented pigs provided controls. Seven paced animals received normal saline, and seven received furosemide at a dose of 1 mg/kg intramuscularly. Weekly echocardiograms were performed. Furosemide-treated animals reached the HF endpoint a mean of 3.2 days sooner than saline-treated controls (mean 28.9 +/- 3.8 SEM for furosemide and 32.1 +/- 2.5 SEM for saline). The inflammatory signaling protein transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and its downstream proteins were significantly (p <= 0.05) elevated in the LV after furosemide treatment. The regulatory factors in cell proliferation, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway proteins, and matrix metalloproteinases were elevated in the furosemide-treated animals (p <= 0.05). Our data showed that furosemide treatment increased ECM remodeling and myocardial fibrosis, reflecting increased TGF-beta signaling factors, supporting prior results showing worsened HF.

AB  - Simple Summary: On livestock farms, measuring individual intake is difficult to assess, but is a very important value for evaluating the feed efficiency of livestock. Feed efficiency has an impact on farm efficiency and, thus, on the economic balance sheet. The purpose of this work was to predict the intake of lactating Sarda ewes from milk spectra using multivariate approaches. Individual intake was found to be moderately correlated with the wavenumbers of the milk spectra. The preliminary results of this study showed that individual intake and, thus, feeding efficiency can be routinely estimated from milk spectra. Further large-scale studies may allow for a rapid, low-cost indicator to be used to keep constant tabs on feeding and farm efficiency.
   Individual dry matter intake (DMI) is a relevant factor for evaluating feed efficiency in livestock. However, the measurement of this trait on a large scale is difficult and expensive. DMI, as well as other phenotypes, can be predicted from milk spectra. The aim of this work was to predict DMI from the milk spectra of 24 lactating Sarda dairy sheep ewes. Three models (Principal Component Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression, and Stepwise Regression) were iteratively applied to three validation schemes: records, ewes, and days. DMI was moderately correlated with the wavenumbers of the milk spectra: the largest correlations (around +/- 0.30) were observed at similar to 1100-1330 cm(-1) and similar to 2800-3000 cm(-1). The average correlations between real and predicted DMI were 0.33 (validation on records), 0.32 (validation on ewes), and 0.23 (validation on days). The results of this preliminary study, even if based on a small number of animals, demonstrate that DMI can be routinely estimated from the milk spectra.

AB  - Quantifying sphingomyelin (SM) species by infusion-based mass spectrometry (MS) is complicated by the presence of isobaric phosphatidylcholine (PC) species, which generate a common m/z 184 product ion in the presence of ammonium ions as a result of the phosphocholine headgroup. Lithium ion adducts of SM undergo a selective dehydration [Li + H2O + (CH3)3NC2H4PO4] with a corresponding neutral loss of -207 Da. This neutral loss was employed to create a SM-selective method for identifying target species, which were quantitated using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). SM-selective fragments in MS3 were used to characterize the sphingosine base and acyl chain. These methods were used to identify 50 individual SM species in bovine milk ranging from SM 28:1 to SM 44:2, with d16:1, d17:1, d18:1, d19:1, and d20:1 bases, and acyl fatty acids ranging from 10 to 25 carbons and 0-1 desaturations. Spiked SM standards into milk had a recovery of 99.7%, and endogenous milk SM had <10% coefficient of variation for both intra-and interday variability, with limits of detection of 1.4-5.55 nM and limits of quantitation of 11.8-178.1 nM. This MS-MRM method was employed to accurately and precisely quantify SM species in dairy products, including bovine-derived whole milk, half and half, whipping cream, and goat milk.

AB  - Animal urine patches, particularly bovine, are the major source of gaseous and leaching losses of nitrogen (N) in livestock-grazed pastoral systems. One method of mitigating these losses is the application of N inhibitors to patches that slow down the N transformations, thus allowing more time for plant uptake. If inhibitors can be applied as spot-treatments, then the overall volume of chemical can be minimized without compromising inhibitor efficacy. To enable this, accurate and reliable methods of detecting patches within hours of deposition are required. In this study, we aimed to validate the output of the newly developed and modified instrument 'SpikeyR' for detecting and mapping urine patches via measurement of soil surface electrical conductivity with the aim of using these data for targeting in-situ spot treatment of detected patches. We compared measurements from Spikey-R against thermal imagery from a handheld camera taken during urine deposition, as well as imagery taken from a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS or 'drone') 2 weeks after deposition. Wetted areas, as a result of urine application, across all sites were 0.2-0.3 m2 (1 L urine), 0.3-0.5 m2 (2 L), and 0.3-0.8 m2 (3 L). Spikey-R data generally compared well with the reference map produced from the thermal imagery, with slightly larger mean patch areas that still fell within the bounds of uncertainty. Repeat Spikey-R runs over the same patches showed no significant difference in detected areas up to 48 h after application. The drone was successful in detecting most urine patches 14 days post-application and identified a much larger pasture response (average > 150% larger again) than the initial wetted area with sizes ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 m2 (1 L), to 0.5 to 1.1 m2 (2 L), to 0.5 to 1.5 m2 (3 L). Spikey-R proved to be an effective tool in a research setting; advantages and disadvantages of each technology are discussed in detail.

AB  - In 2002, the reform of the heating system in Shenyang led to the abandonment of a large number of boiler rooms. However, due to their unique technological requirements, these boiler rooms possess significant potential and value for transformation and reuse. Against the backdrop of urban renewal, the renovation and utilization of these structures hold profound research and practical significance. Based on this context, this study systematically surveyed and documented existing boiler rooms in the old town of Shenyang through comprehensive census, detailed investigation, and precise mapping. In utilizing advanced tools such as CAD and RHINO for modeling and D5 for rendering and integrating building information modeling (BIM) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, a robust SUPERMAP database platform was established. Compared to previous approaches, the adoption of state-of-the-art UAV and 3D geographic information system (3DGIS) platforms enabled data visualization and digital archiving, providing a clear and comprehensive database for future research on this building type and laying a solid foundation for further renovation and adaptive reuse.

AB  - Sea buckthorn and Japanese knotweed are known in many traditional medicine systems to be a great source of bioactive substances. This research aims to compare the bioactivity and protective effects of the phenolic extracts of leaves from sea buckthorn and roots and leaves from the Japanese knotweed on erythrocytes. The polyphenol composition of the extract was analyzed using UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS. The extracts' toxicity and impact on the erythrocytes' osmotic fragility were measured spectrophotometrically. The antioxidant activity was determined based on the inhibition of oxidation of erythrocytes and their membrane induced by 2,2 '-Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH),measured spectrophotometrically and using fluorimetry. To find the possible mechanism of the extracts' action, extract-modified cells were observed under a microscope, and the potential localization of the extract's phytochemical composition was checked using fluorescent probes. The results showed that the used extracts are not toxic to erythrocytes, increase their osmotic resistance, and successfully protect them against free radicals. Extract components localize on the outer part of the membrane, where they can scavenge the free radicals from the environment. Altogether, the presented extracts can greatly protect living organisms against free radicals and can be used to support the treatment of diseases caused by excess free radicals.

AB  - Feeding behavior is essential for ruminant nutrition and to guide management practices; it considers the time the animal spends feeding, ruminating, or engaging in other activities. Its execution is challenging due to the time and labor demands, as visual methodologies require animals to be monitored for 24 h or more. To reduce strain, visual intervals are used; however, longer intervals may not accurately reflect the time spent on each behavior, as activities can change quickly and go unnoticed during the assessment. This lack of precision can lead to under or overestimation of results and misguided decisions. Thus, precision livestock farming emerges as a solution to overcome the limitations of traditional visual methodologies. In this regard, the objective was to analyze the performance of an electronic device, based on triaxial accelerometer and artificial intelligence, and compare it with responses from different visual observation intervals for assessing feeding behavior in confined sheep. In the first step, 256 min of data collection on 19 animals were used to classify feeding, rumination, and other behaviors, resulting in 15,351 lines of data for each input variable in the model. Orange Data Mining (R) software was used to analyze the classification model's performance. In the second step, the device was used simultaneously with behavior assessments at different observation intervals: 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. Responses regarding the time animals spent performing each behavior were compared between those provided by the equipment and those obtained visually through regression testing, root mean square error, agreement index, and mean absolute error (MAE). The Neural Network model showed the best metrics. For feeding behavior, accuracy, F1 score, and precision reached 0.967, 0.954, and 0.952, respectively. For rumination behavior, they were 0.896, 0.828, and 0.804, while for other behaviors, they were 0.904, 0.860, and 0.885. Increasing observation intervals resulted in higher errors and lower coefficients of determination and agreement indices. For feeding behavior, MAE increased from the 10-minute interval, while for rumination and other behaviors, it was from the 5-minute interval. Therefore, the use of triaxial accelerometer-based devices and artificial intelligence is an alternative to overcome difficulties in assessing feeding behavior in confined sheep. A 5-minute visual observation interval is recommended if it is not possible to use technology for this purpose, as this interval provided more consistent results for these experimental conditions.

AB  - Generating synthetic locomotory and neural data is a useful yet cumbersome step commonly required to study theoretical models of the brain's role in spatial navigation. This process can be time consuming and, without a common framework, makes it difficult to reproduce or compare studies which each generate test data in different ways. In response, we present RatInABox, an open-source Python toolkit designed to model realistic rodent locomotion and generate synthetic neural data from spatially modulated cell types. This software provides users with (i) the ability to construct one- or two-dimensional environments with configurable barriers and visual cues, (ii) a physically realistic random motion model fitted to experimental data, (iii) rapid online calculation of neural data for many of the known self-location or velocity selective cell types in the hippocampal formation (including place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells, head direction cells) and (iv) a framework for constructing custom cell types, multi-layer network models and data- or policy-controlled motion trajectories. The motion and neural models are spatially and temporally continuous as well as topographically sensitive to boundary conditions and walls. We demonstrate that out-of-the-box parameter settings replicate many aspects of rodent foraging behaviour such as velocity statistics and the tendency of rodents to over-explore walls. Numerous tutorial scripts are provided, including examples where RatInABox is used for decoding position from neural data or to solve a navigational reinforcement learning task. We hope this tool will significantly streamline computational research into the brain's role in navigation.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive behaviors and altered communication abilities. Exercise is a low-cost intervention that could improve cognitive function and improve brain plasticity mechanisms. Here, the valproic acid (VPA) model was utilized to induce ASD-like phenotypes in rodents. Animals were exercised on a treadmill and performance was evaluated on a cognitive flexibility task. Biomarkers related to exercise and plasticity regulation were quantified from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and skeletal muscle. Exercised VPA animals had higher levels of hippocampal BDNF compared to sedentary VPA animals and upregulated antioxidant enzyme expression in skeletal muscle. Cognitive improvements were demonstrated in both sexes, but in different domains of cognitive flexibility. This research demonstrates the benefits of exercise and provides evidence that molecular responses to exercise occur in both the central nervous system and in the periphery. These results suggest that improving regulation of BDNF via exercise, even at low intensity, could provide better synaptic regulation and cognitive benefits for individuals with ASD.

AB  - Purpose Cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) is a globally distributed zoonosis. CE treatment is difficult, but radiation and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) can be effective. However, the combination of radiation and 5-FU has not been reported. This study evaluated the effect of combination of 5-FU and radiation on E. granulosus s.l. protoscoleces (PSCs). Material and Methods In this study, PSCs were collected from the liver of diseased sheep, and some were exposed to a single dose of 20 Gy 6-MV X-ray combined with (5 mu g/mL or 10 mu g/mL) 5-FU in vitro. Methylene blue staining was used to detect the viability of the PSCs. Transcription of EgHSP70 and Egp38 was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT- PCR). Results A single dose of radiation killed 18% of the PSCs, and 5-FU showed weak parasiticidal efficacy on the first day of treatment. After 14 d, 5 mu g and 10 mu g/mL of 5-FU killed 40.20% and 50.02% of the PSCs, whereas 20 Gy of radiation killed 31.44%. The combination of 5-FU (10 mu g/mL) with 20 Gy of radiation showed 77.55% killing efficacy. qRT-PCR showed that 5-FU inhibited Egp38 expression, whereas radiation increased its expression. EgHSP70 was highly expressed 14 days after radiation treatment. The data indicate that 5-FU has parasiticidal efficacy against the PSCs of E. granulosus s.l. Conclusion The lethal efficacy of PSCs caused by a single dose of radiation exposure is related to the upregulated expression level of Egp38 and EgHSP70. The killing effect of 5-FU (10 mu g/mL) with 20Gy of radiation was significantly better than that of single treatment group. This study provided a basis for the potential role of 5-FU combined with radiation in the treatment of CE.

AB  - Cardiac xenotransplantation has seen remarkable success in recent years and is emerging as the most promising alternative to human cardiac allotransplantation. Despite these achievements, acute vascular rejection still presents a challenge for long-term xenograft acceptance and new insights into innate and adaptive immune responses as well as detailed characterizations of signaling pathways are necessary. In allotransplantation, endothelial cells and their sugar-rich surface-the endothelial glycocalyx-are known to influence organ rejection. In xenotransplantation, however, only in vitro data exist on the role of the endothelial glycocalyx so far. Thus, in the current study, we analyzed the changes of the endothelial glycocalyx components hyaluronan, heparan sulfate and syndecan-1 after pig-to-baboon cardiac xenotransplantations in the perioperative (n = 4) and postoperative (n = 5) periods. These analyses provide first insights into changes of the endothelial glycocalyx after pig-to-baboon cardiac xenotransplantation and show that damage to the endothelial glycocalyx seems to be comparable or even less pronounced than in similar human settings when current strategies of cardiac xenotransplantation are applied. At the same time, data from the experiments where current strategies, like non-ischemic preservation, growth inhibition or porcine cytomegalovirus (a porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV)) elimination could not be applied indicate that damage of the endothelial glycocalyx also plays an important role in cardiac xenotransplantation.

AB  - Antivirulence vaccination represents a promising strategy for infection prevention, but achieving both safety and efficacy in toxoid vaccine preparation remains a challenge. Cell membrane-based nanotoxoids offer a safe delivery platform for bacterial virulence factors in antivirulence vaccination, but limited absorption capacity hampers their efficacy. Here, we develop a lipid-based toxoid vaccine platform, PSV-CNP, comprising a CpG-loaded polymeric core coated with phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin (PS) liposomes enriched with bacterial virulence factors. By enhancing virulence factor absorption, PSV-CNP elicits robust humoral immunity. In mice, it provides long-lasting protection against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and clinically isolated S. aureus (CI-SA), even under immunosuppression. In Bama pigs, PSV-CNP induces strong immune responses and prevents MRSA and CI-SA invasion. Furthermore, PS-liposomes efficiently absorb virulence factors from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), conferring protection against PA infections. This study establishes PS-coated nanoparticles as a broadly applicable, safe, and effective antivirulence toxoid vaccine platform.

AB  - Simple Summary Indirect inguinal hernia in sheep can reduce the fertility and affected animals may present serious problems that can be life-threatening. The aim of this work is to describe a laparoscopically assisted technique to suture the internal inguinal ring in rams, preserving testicles. In six ram cadavers, both vaginal rings were partially closed. Two methods were tested on each side. The number of sutures required to achieve a satisfactory closure was recorded. After the cadaveric study, the procedure was performed on three rams with inguinal hernia and the occurrence of re-herniation was followed up. In cadavers, the technique could be easily and satisfactorily performed with either of the two systems. In two clinical cases, the procedure was successfully performed without hernia recurrence or alterations in reproductive behavior in the following months. In the third case, problems during laparoscopy prevented hernioplasty and the animal herniated again. This technique can be used as a simple and feasible surgical treatment for rams with inguinal hernias when preservation of the testicles is preferred. Although a larger number of cases are needed to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness, this technique should be considered as an alternative to castration in rams with inguinal hernia. The aim of this study is to evaluate a laparoscopically assisted percutaneous suture (LAPS) procedure to treat inguinal hernia (IH) while preserving testicles in rams. An ex vivo experiment with six ram cadavers and a report of three clinical cases are discussed. In cadavers, both internal inguinal rings (IIR) were partially closed by LAPS. Two LAPS methods were tested: (1) using a laparoscopic portal closure device and (2) using a suture loop inserted through needles in each IIR. After each procedure, the closure was laparoscopically evaluated and the number of U- sutures was recorded. The procedure was also performed on three client-owned rams with unilateral non-strangulated IH and the occurrence of re-herniation was followed up. In cadavers, LAPS of the IIRs could be easily and satisfactorily performed with either of the two systems, requiring one to three U-sutures per IIR. No differences were observed between the two surgical procedures. In two clinical cases, the procedure was successfully performed without reoccurrence of herniation or alterations in reproductive behavior in the following 3 and 6 months. In the third case, the hernia was reduced but a retroperitoneal emphysema during laparoscopy prevented hernioplasty and the animal herniated again. In conclusion, LAPS of IIR can be used as a simple and feasible treatment to preserve testicles in rams with IH.

AB  - Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy marked by vascular dysfunction, large artery stiffness, and excess oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). oxLDL activates oxidative stress pathways which contribute to arterial stiffness through interaction with the lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1). Increased vascular stiffness is associated with higher pulse wave velocity and downstream microvasculature damage. Here we evaluated the ability of LOX-1 inhibition (LOX-1i) to prevent large artery structural and microvascular structural and functional changes via assessment of the descending thoracic aorta (DTAo) and posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) in a high cholesterol model of preeclampsia. Adult female Sprague Dawley normal late-pregnant (LP) and experimentally preeclamptic (ePE, high cholesterol diet d7-19) animals underwent intraperitoneal (i.p.) implantation of a mini-osmotic pump at d12 containing LOX-1 neutralizing antibodies (ePE + LOX-1i, n = 7) or goat IgG as vehicle control (LP + IgG, n = 8 and ePE + IgG, n = 8). Animals were studied at d19. DTAos and PCAs were removed for histologic assessment and isolated vessel experiments, respectively. Fetuses and placentas were weighed individually. Plasma was analyzed for markers of oxidative stress. ePE + IgG DTAo elastin content (an indirect metric of stiffness) was not significantly different from the LP + IgG group. Nonetheless, trending elastin break and sinuosity data (higher number of breaks and lower sinuosity in the ePE + IgG group compared to LP + IgG) suggested increased stiffness in this high cholesterol PE model. LOX-1i appeared to prevent a decrease in elastin. PCAs showed no structural changes with ePE or LOX-1i. ePE PCAs had increased reactivity to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and decreased tone that was unaffected by LOX-1i. ePE animals had increased plasma oxLDL and 3-nitrotyrosine that was unaffected by LOX-1i. Taken together, LOX-1i may improve large artery stiffness without mitigation of the oxidative stress or cerebral microvascular dysfunction seen in ePE. Understanding these mechanisms is important in abating the long-term risks of preeclampsia.

AB  - Background: Determining physiological mechanisms leading to circulatory failure can be challenging, contributing to the difficulties in delivering effective hemodynamic management in critical care. Continuous, nonadditionally invasive monitoring of preload changes, and assessment of contractility from Frank-Starling curves could potentially make it much easier to diagnose and manage circulatory failure. Method: This study combines non-additionally invasive model-based methods to estimate left ventricle enddiastolic volume (LEDV) and stroke volume (SV) during hemodynamic interventions in a pig trial (N = 6). Agreement of model-based LEDV and measured admittance catheter LEDV is assessed. Model-based LEDV and SV are used to identify response to hemodynamic interventions and create Frank-Starling curves, from which FrankStarling contractility (FSC) is identified as the gradient. Results: Model-based LEDV had good agreement with measured admittance catheter LEDV, with Bland-Altman median bias [limits of agreement (2.5th, 97.5th percentile)] of 2.2 ml [-13.8, 22.5]. Model LEDV and SV were used to identify non-responsive interventions with a good area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.83. FSC was identified using model LEDV and SV with Bland-Altman median bias [limits of agreement (2.5th, 97.5th percentile)] of 0.07 [-0.68, 0.56], with FSC from admittance catheter LEDV and aortic flow probe SV used as a reference method. Conclusions: This study provides proof-of-concept preload changes and Frank-Starling curves could be nonadditionally invasively estimated for critically ill patients, which could potentially enable much clearer insight into cardiovascular function than is currently possible at the patient bedside.

AB  - Objective: Epidemiological studies have reported an association between epilepsy and dementia. However, the causal relationship between epilepsy and the risk of dementia is not clear. We aimed to inspect the causal effect of epilepsy on memory loss and dementia.Methods: We analyzed summary data of epilepsy, memory loss, and dementia from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method. We used the estimated odds ratio of memory loss and dementia associated with each of the genetically defined traits to infer evidence for a causal relationship with the following exposures: all epilepsy, focal epilepsy (including focal epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, lesion-negative focal epilepsy, and focal epilepsy with other lesions), and genetic generalized epilepsy (including childhood absence epilepsy, generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone, Juvenile absence epilepsy, and Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy).Results: According to the result of MR using the inverse variance weighted method (IVW), we found that genetically predicted epilepsy did not causally increase the risk of memory loss and dementia (p > 0.05).Results of the MR-Egger and weighted median method were consistent with the IVW method.Conclusions: No evidence has been found to support the notion that epilepsy can result in memory loss and dementia. The associations observed in epidemiological studies could be attributed, in part, to confounding or nongenetic determinants.

AB  - BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory decline and mood alterations. A growing body of evidence implicates stress and other social determinants of health as potential contributors to the progressive cerebral alterations that culminate in AD. In the current study, we investigated the impact of neonatal maternal separation (MS) on the susceptibility of male and female mice to AD-associated memory impairments and depressive-like behavior in adulthood, and on brain levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotransmitters.MethodologyMale and female Swiss mice were exposed to MS for 180 min daily from post-natal day 1 to 10. Seventy days post-MS, mice received an intracerebroventricular infusion of amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta Os), and memory and mood were evaluated. Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, serotonin, dopamine, and related metabolites were determined in the cortex and hippocampus.ResultsPrevious exposure to MS alone did not cause memory impairments in adult mice. Interestingly, however, MS increased the susceptibility of adult male mice to memory impairment and depressive-like behavior induced by A beta Os, and potentiated the inhibitory impact of A beta Os on memory in adult females. Females were more susceptible to depressive-like behavior caused by a low dose of A beta Os, regardless of MS. No changes in IL-1 beta were found. A decrease in TNF-alpha was selectively found in females exposed to MS that received an infusion of 1 pmol A beta Os. MS led to an increase in serotonin (5-HT) in the hippocampus of male mice, without influencing the levels of the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA. Changes in serotonin turnover were predominantly observed in the cortex of female mice. No changes in dopamine or its metabolites were induced by MS or A beta Os in male or female mice.ConclusionsNeonatal MS enhances the susceptibility of adult mice to AD-associated cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior in a sex-specific manner. This suggests that early life stress may play a role in the development of AD.

AB  - The amygdala plays crucial roles in emotional processing, motivated behaviors, and stress responses. It receives sensory information and modulates fear- and anxiety-related behaviors. Neuronal activations are induced in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) when exposing to acute stress, leading to increased alertness and proper behavioral adaptation. Previous studies have shown that animals displayed a decrease in appetitive motivated behaviors under stress conditions. However, whether the hyperactive amygdala is responsible for the decrease in appetitive motivated behaviors remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of BLA or CeA activation in effort-based motivated behavior. We pharmacologically activated the BLA or the CeA with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) before the lever-pressing for food reward test on different fixed-ratio (FR) schedules (FR1, FR16, or FR32) in male Long-Evans rats. Our data showed that activation of either the BLA or the CeA with NMDA (0.05 mu g in 0.5 mu l per site) decreased the leverpressing behavior on higher FR schedules of FR16 and FR32, but not on the FR1 test. Importantly, locomotor activity and free-feeding food intake were intact under amygdala activation, suggesting that the decrease in lever-pressing behavior was not due to motor disablement or decreased appetite. These results suggested that activation of the BLA or the CeA negatively impaired the effort-based motivated behavior that the animals were less willing to work for food reward.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has a complex pathogenesis, making it a difficult disorder to treat. Identifying relevant signaling pathways in the brain may be useful for finding new pharmacological targets to treat AUD. The receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) activates the transcription factor STAT3 in response to ethanol in cell lines. Here, we show ALK activation and upregulation of known STAT3 target genes (Socs3, Gfap and Tnfrsf1a) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral hippocampus (HPC) of mice after 4 days of binge-like ethanol drinking. Mice treated with the STAT3 inhibitor stattic drank less ethanol than vehicle-treated mice, demonstrating the behavioral importance of STAT3. To identify novel ethanol-induced target genes downstream of the ALK and STAT3 pathway, we analyzed the NIH LINCS L1000 database for gene signature overlap between ALK inhibitor (alectinib and NVP-TAE684) and STAT3 inhibitor (niclosamide) treatments on cell lines. These genes were then compared with differentially expressed genes in the PFC of mice after binge-like drinking. We found 95 unique gene candidates, out of which 57 had STAT3 binding motifs in their promoters. We further showed by qPCR that expression of the putative STAT3 genes Nr1h2, Smarcc1, Smarca4 and Gpnmb were increased in either the PFC or HPC after binge-like drinking. Together, these results indicate activation of the ALK-STAT3 signaling pathway in the brain after binge-like ethanol consumption, identify putative novel ethanol-responsive STAT3 target genes, and suggest that STAT3 inhibition may be a potential method to reduce binge drinking in humans.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been extensively studied for its pleiotropic effects on central nervous system diseases. The neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects of TGF-beta 1 in specific brain areas may depend on the pathological process and cell types involved. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are essential ion channels for the generation of action potentials in neurons, and are involved in various neuroexcitation-related diseases. However, the effects of TGF-beta 1 on the functional properties of VGSCs and firing properties in cortical neurons remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGF-beta 1 on VGSC function and firing properties in primary cortical neurons from mice. We found that TGF-beta 1 increased VGSC current density in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was attributable to the upregulation of Nav1.3 expression. Increased VGSC current density and Nav1.3 expression were significantly abolished by preincubation with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (PD98059), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (SB203580), and Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 inhibitor (SP600125). Interestingly, TGF-beta 1 significantly increased the firing threshold of action potentials but did not change their firing rate in cortical neurons. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1 can increase Nav1.3 expression through activation of the ERK1/2-JNK-MAPK pathway, which leads to a decrease in the firing threshold of action potentials in cortical neurons under pathological conditions. Thus, this contributes to the occurrence and progression of neuroexcitatory-related diseases of the central nervous system.

AB  - The green synthesis method of was used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Camellia sinensis (green tea). The Camellia sinensis silver nanoparticles (CS-AgNPs) were characterized using different techniques, including UV-Vis (ultra violet-visible), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), and XRD (X-ray diffraction). The average size of the CS-AgNPs was 52 nm, according to TEM. The CS-AgNPs showed excellent antibacterial and antifungal activity. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) against bacterial isolates varied from 31.25 to 62.5 mu g/mL, whereas for fungal isolates, the MIC varied from 125 to 250 mu g/mL. The presence of a zone in the well diffusion assay showed the antimicrobial nature of CS-AgNPs. Further, CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy) showed that CS-AgNPs possess antibiofilm activity. The interaction of CS-AgNPs with the Candidal cells was analyzed using TEM, and it was revealed that CS-AgNPs entered the cell and disrupted the cell machinery.

AB  - Radiation therapy represents one of the primary treatment modalities for primary and metastatic brain tumors. Although recent advances in radiation techniques, that allow the delivery of higher radiation doses to the target volume, reduce the toxicity to normal tissues, long-term neurocognitive decline is still a detrimental factor significantly affecting quality of life, particularly in pediatric patients. This imposes the need for the development of prevention strategies. Based on recent evidence, showing that manipulation of the Shh pathway carries therapeutic potential for brain repair and functional recovery after injury, here we evaluate how radiation-induced hippocampal alterations are modulated by the constitutive activation of the Shh signaling pathway in Patched 1 heterozygous mice (Ptch1(+/-)). Our results show, for the first time, an overall protective effect of constitutive Shh pathway activation on hippocampal radiation injury. This activation, through modulation of the proneural gene network, leads to a long-term reduction of hippocampal deficits in the stem cell and new neuron compartments and to the mitigation of radio-induced astrogliosis, despite some behavioral alterations still being detected in Ptch1(+/-) mice. A better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neural decline following irradiation is essential for identifying prevention measures to contain the harmful consequences of irradiation. Our data have important translational implications as they suggest a role for Shh pathway manipulation to provide the therapeutic possibility of improving brain repair and functional recovery after radio-induced injury.

AB  - Prenatal environmental exposure could be an essential health risk factor associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the impact of prenatal PM2.5 exposure on offspring cognition remain unclear. In our recent study using a PM2.5 exposed pregnant mouse model, we observed significant synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampi of the offspring. Concurrently, the epigenetic regulator of KDM5A and the Shh signaling pathway exhibited decreased activities. Significantly, changes in hippocampal KDM5A and Shh levels directly correlated with PM2.5 exposure intensity. Subsequent experiments revealed a marked reduction in the expression of Shh signaling and related synaptic proteins when KDM5A was silenced in cells. Notably, the effects of KDM5A deficiency were reversed significantly with the supplementation of a Shh activator. Furthermore, our findings indicate that Shh activation significantly attenuates PM2.5-induced synaptic impairments in hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrated that EGR1, a transcriptional inhibitor, plays a direct role in KDM5A's regulation of the Shh pathway under conditions of PM2.5 exposure. Our results suggest that the KDM5A's inhibitory regulation on the Shh pathway through the EGR1 gene is a crucial epigenetic mechanism underlying the synaptic dysfunction in hippocampal neurons caused by maternal PM2.5 exposure. This emphasizes the role of epigenetic regulations in neurodevelopmental disorders caused by environmental factors.

AB  - This study examines the effect of advancing the breeding season on the reproductive performance of dromedary camels under an intensive management system. Using a synchronization protocol, timed natural mating in female camels was carried out either in September (2 months ahead of the natural breeding season, n = 182) or December (peak breeding season, n = 115). The ovarian responses (size of the dominant follicle at the time of mating and ovulation), pregnancy rate, and pregnancy losses were evaluated using ultrasonography. Blood samples were collected after mating to assess progesterone concentrations by RIA. The libido of male camels (n = 13) was evaluated objectively. Results showed that the percentage of female camels with an optimal sized follicle (11-17 mm) for breeding at the time of mating was lower in September compared to December (81.9 vs 91.3%, P = 0.03). The libido of male camels was lower in September than in December (P < 0.001). The ovulation rate (86.3 vs 93.9%, P = 0.04), size of the ovulated follicle (12.7 +/- 0.1 vs 13.7 +/- 0.2 mm, P < 0.001), pregnancy rates on Day 14 (47.8 vs 72.2%, P < 0.001) and Day 90 (38.5 vs 60.9%, P < 0.001) after mating was lower in September compared to December. However, pregnancy loss was not affected between months (15.7 vs 19.5%, P = 0.3). Among pregnant camels, the progesterone concentrations on Days 6, 8,10,12 and 14 after mating were lower in September as compared to December (P < 0.001). In non-pregnant camels, the progesterone concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 10 after mating were also lower in September as compared to December (P < 0.001). In conclusion, advancing the breeding season by two months, significantly affects the reproductive performance of dromedary camels, yet, acceptable pregnancy rates can be achieved.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Approximately 14% of U.S. households are food insecure. The neurocognitive and metabolic impacts of unpredictable food access during early-life periods of development are poorly understood. To address these gaps we devised a novel rat model of food insecurity to control the timing, type, and quantity of accessible food using programmable feeders. Male rats were divided into 3 groups: Secure-chow (SC), a control group given 100% of daily estimated caloric intake, distributed evenly across 4 daily meals of standard chow at set mealtimes; Securemixed (SM), a 2nd control group identical to the SC group except that the food type predictably alternated daily between chow and a high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFHS); and Insecure-mixed (IM), the experimental group given randomly alternating daily access to either chow or HFHS at either 85% or 115% of daily estimated caloric intake, distributed evenly across 3 daily meals with unpredictable mealtimes. These feeding schedules were implemented from postnatal days (PNs) 26-45, after which all groups received chow ad libitum. Metabolic assessments performed in adulthood revealed no group differences in caloric intake, body weight, or body composition when maintained on either chow (PN46-149) or a cafeteria diet (PN150-174). Behavioral measures (PN66-126) revealed no group differences in anxiety-like, exploratory, or impulsive behavior (zero maze, open field, differential reinforcement of low rates of responding procedures). However, the IM group exhibited hippocampus-dependent memory impairments compared to both control groups in the novel location recognition test. These findings suggest that early-life food insecurity may contribute to long-term impairments in memory function.

AB  - Frequent interspecies transmission of human influenza A viruses (FLUAV) to pigs contrasts with the limited subset that establishes in swine. While hemagglutinin mutations are recognized for their role in cross-species transmission, the contribution of neuraminidase remains understudied. Here, the NA's role in FLUAV adaptation was investigated using a swine-adapted H3N2 reassortant virus with human-derived HA and NA segments. Adaptation in pigs resulted in mutations in both HA (A138S) and NA (D113A). The D113A mutation abolished calcium (Ca2+) binding in the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket of NA, enhancing enzymatic activity and thermostability under Ca2+-depleted conditions, mirroring swine-origin FLUAV NA behavior. Structural analysis predicts that swine-adapted H3N2 viruses lack Ca2+ binding in this pocket. Further, residue 93 in NA (G93 in human, N93 in swine) also influences Ca2+ binding and impacts NA activity and thermostability, even when D113 is present. These findings demonstrate that mutations in influenza A virus surface proteins alter evolutionary trajectories following interspecies transmission and reveal distinct mechanisms modulating NA activity during FLUAV adaptation, highlighting the importance of Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity calcium-binding pocket.
   Modulation of calcium binding in the neuraminidase low-affinity calcium-binding pocket suggests a novel role of calcium during cross-species transmission of Influenza A viruses.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder associated with changes in inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota composition. Butyrolactone I (BTL-I), a fungal metabolite, has shown anti-inflammatory, microbiota regulating, and memory-improving potentials in previous in vitro and AlCl3-induced zebrafish studies. However, its effects of memory-improving and gutbrain axis regulating on A beta-induced mammalian AD models have not been explored. In this study, intragastric administrated BTL-I ameliorated cognitive deficits related to recognition and spatial memory impaired by A beta 1-42 intracerebroventricular injection in mice. BTL-I maintained gut microbiota balance by increasing the abundance of Blautia, Muribaculaceae, Bacteroides, Akkermansia, etc., and decreasing CAG-352, Clostridia UCG-014, different Lachnospiraceae groups, etc., and Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio and elevated the levels of short-chain fatty acids. Additionally, it alleviated intestinal oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and pathological damage. Furthermore, BTL-I reversed A beta{en1-42}-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus and inhibited the elevated oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines in both plasma and brain. The correlation analysis between the regulated taxa and biomarkers supports the role of gut microbiota in adjusting inflammation, oxidative stress, and memory. In conclusion, BTL-I may serve as a valuable drug lead for treating Alzheimer's disease by systematically inhibiting microbiota imbalance, inflammation, and oxidative stress along the gut-brain axis.

AB  - Background: Damaged mitophagy and impaired angiogenesis involve in the pathogenic development of ischemic stroke. Active fraction of Polyrhachis vicina (Roger) (AFPR) showed great potential on neurological disease with it's remarkable anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects.
   Purpose: This study designed to clarify the correlation between Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and angiogenesis after stroke, and to elucidate the role of SIRT3 in regulating mitophagy and angiogenesis, and to address the mechanism of AFPR on promoting mitophagy and angiogenesis in microvessels endothelium of ischemic brain.
   Study design: A cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) rat model was developed by middle cerebral artery occlusion procedure. bEnd.3 cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic CIR process. Neurological function, mitophagy and angiogenesis related indicators were measured. SIRT3 siRNA and 3-MA were used to verify the interaction between SIRT3-mediated mitophagy and angiogenesis.
   Methods: CIR rats were orally treated with AFPR (8 and 4 g raw drug /kg) and Nimodipine (10.8 mg/kg) for 12 days to mimic the recovery phase post-stroke. The neurological function assessment, TTC staining, HE staining, TUNEL staining and Nissl staining were performed to assess neuroprotective effects of AFPR against CIR. Then CD31-labeled microvessel density in brain was visualized and quantified by immunofluorescence staining. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscope scanning. Expressions of relative proteins,e.g. SIRT3, Pink1, Parkin, LC3-II, p62, VEGFA, involving in mitophagy and angiogenesis, were detected by Western blotting analysis. In vitro, bEnd.3 cells were cultured with AFPR or in combination of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA during the reoxygenation. Then cell viability, and LDH releasing were measured. Angiogenic indicators,such as migration and tube formation activity, VEGFA level were determined. To assess effects of AFPR on mitophagy, mitophagy-related proteins were detected, as well as the autophagosome engulfment and lysosome degradation of mitochondria. To address the role of SIRT3, deacetylation activity of SIRT3 was validated by detecting acetylated FOXO3A level with co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Pre-treatment of siRNA or combination use of 3-MA were used to verify the detailed mechanism.
   Results: AFPR remarkably reduced neurological scores and infarct size, alleviated neuron apoptosis in cortex, and increased Nissl density in hippocampus of CIR rats. In addition, AFPR significantly promoted angiogenesis by increasing microvessels density and VEGFA expressions, increased SIRT3 expression, and activated Pink1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. In bEnd.3 cells, the combination use of 3-MA and AFPR further demonstrated that AFPR might promote angiogenesis after OGD/R injury through activating Pink1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. Co-IP assay suggested AFPR reduced acetylated FOXO3A level. This might be correlated with an elevation of SIRT3 expression and it's deacetylation activity. SIRT3 siRNA pretreatment significantly abolished the activation of mitophagy through Pink1/Parkin axis, eventually inhibited angiogenesis.
   Conclusion: AFPR promoted angiogenesis through activating mitophagy after cerebral ischemia reperfusion, which might partially involved in the amelioration of SIRT3-mediated regulation on Pink1/Parkin axis. Our study will shed new light on the role of SIRT3 in ischemic brain, especially in regulating mitophagy and angiogenesis after stroke.

AB  - Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) are widely accepted for modeling essential hypertension and Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, data concerning central nervous system changes associated with behavioral responses of this strain and usage of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls are confounding. The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of anxiety and motor activity on the cognitive responses of SHRs compared to Wistar and WKY rats. In addition, the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus on cognitive behavior and seizure susceptibility in the three strains was evaluated. In Experiment#1, SHR demonstrated impulsive responses in the novelty suppression feeding test accompanied by impaired spatial working and associative memory in the Y maze and object recognition test compared with the Wistar rat but not WKY rats. In addition, the WKY rats exhibited diminished activity compared to Wistar rats in an actimeter. In Experiment#2, the seizure susceptibility was assessed by 3-min electroencephalographic (EEG) recording after two consecutive injections of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (20+40 mg/kg). The WKY rats were more vulnerable to rhythmic metrazol activity (RMA) than the Wistar rats. In contrast, Wistar rats were more prone to generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) than WKY rats and SHRs. Control SHR had lower BDNF expression in the hippocampus compared to Wistar rats. However, while the BDNF levels were elevated in the Wistar and WKY rats after PTZ injection, no change in this signaling molecule was observed in the SHR in the seizure condition. The results suggest Wistar rats as a more appropriate control of SHR than WKY rats for studying memory responses mediated by BDNF in the hippocampus. The higher vulnerability to seizures in Wistar and WKY rats compared to SHR might be linked to PTZ-induced decreased expression of BDNF in the hippocampus.

AB  - Tamoxifen is frequently used in murine knockout systems with CreER/LoxP. Besides possible neuroprotective effects, tamoxifen is described as having a negative impact on adult neurogenesis. The present study investigated the effect of a high-dose tamoxifen application on Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced hippocampal damage. Two weeks after TMEV infection, 42% of the untreated TMEV-infected mice were affected by marked inflammation with neuronal loss, whereas 58% exhibited minor inflammation without neuronal loss. Irrespective of the presence of neuronal loss, untreated mice lacked TMEV antigen expression within the hippocampus at 14 days post-infection (dpi). Interestingly, tamoxifen application 0, 2 and 4, or 5, 7 and 9 dpi decelerated virus elimination and markedly increased neuronal loss to 94%, associated with increased reactive astrogliosis at 14 dpi. T cell infiltration, microgliosis and expression of water channels were similar within the inflammatory lesions, regardless of tamoxifen application. Applied at 0, 2 and 4 dpi, tamoxifen had a negative impact on the number of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells within the dentate gyrus (DG) at 14 dpi, without a long-lasting effect on neuronal loss at 147 dpi. Thus, tamoxifen application during a TMEV infection is associated with transiently increased neuronal loss in the hippocampus, increased reactive astrogliosis and decreased neurogenesis in the DG.

AB  - Objective Exposure to high intensity, low frequency noise (HI-LFN) causes vibroacoustic disease (VAD), with memory deficit as a primary non-auditory symptomatic effect of VAD. However, the underlying mechanism of the memory deficit is unknown. This study aimed to characterize potential mechanisms involving morphological changes of neurons and nerve fibers in the hippocampus, after exposure to HI-LFN.Methods Adult wild-type and transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 4 knockout (TRPV4-/-) mice were used for construction of the HI-LFN injury model. The new object recognition task and the Morris water maze test were used to measure the memory of these animals. Hemoxylin and eosin and immunofluorescence staining were used to examine morphological changes of the hippocampus after exposure to HI-LFN.Results The expression of TRPV4 was significantly upregulated in the hippocampus after HI-LFN exposure. Furthermore, memory deficits correlated with lower densities of neurons and neurofilament-positive nerve fibers in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal areas in wild -type mice. However, TRPV4-/-mice showed better performance in memory tests and more integrated neurofilament-positive nerve fibers in the CA1 and DG areas after HI-LFN exposure.Conclusion TRPV4 up-regulation induced neurofilament positive nerve fiber injury in the hippocampus, which was a possible mechanism for memory impairment and cognitive decline resulting from HI-LFN exposure. Together, these results identified a promising therapeutic target for treating cognitive dysfunction in VAD patients.

AB  - Hydatidosis is a disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, which involves several organs of intermediate hosts. Evidence suggests a communication between hydatid cyst (HC) and hosts via extracellular vesicles. However, a little is known about the communication between EVs derived from HC fluid (HCF) and host cells. In the current study, EVs were isolated using differential centrifugation from sheep HCF and characterized by western blot, electron microscope and size distribution analysis. The uptake of EVs by human monocyte cell line (THP-1) was evaluated. The effects of EVs on the expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), 3 and 24 h after incubation. Moreover, the cytokine level of IL-10 was evaluated in supernatant of THP-1 cell line at 3 and 24 h. EVs were successfully isolated and showed spherical shape with size distribution at 130.6 nm. After 3 h, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL1 & UBeta;, IL15 and IL8) were upregulated, while after 24 h, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were decreased and IL13 gene expression showed upregulation. A statistically significant increase was seen in the levels of IL-10 after 24 h. The main mechanism of the communication between EVs derived from HCF and their host remains unclear; however, time-dependent anti-inflammatory effects in our study suggest that HC may modulate the immune responses via EVs.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Reproductive ability of sows is a primary element influencing the development of pig farming. Herbal extracts of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., and Polypodium glycyrrhiza D.C.Eaton showed effects on improvement of reproduction in sows. Aims of the study: To investigate the mechanism of the treatment effects by a compound of these four Chinese herbs in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (ALAE) on endometriosis, endometritis, uterine adhesion, intrauterine growth retardation, pre-eclampsia, and its enhancement of reproductive efficiency in sows. Materials and methods: Active components of ALAE were identified by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and network pharmacology. Then we used the results to construct a visualization network. Key targets and pathways of ALAE involved in sow reproduction improvement were validated in sow animals and porcine endometrial epithelial cells (PEECs). Results: A total of 62 active compounds were found in ALAE (41 in Polypodium glycyrrhiza D.C.Eaton, 5 in Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, 11 in Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., 5 in Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels) with 563 diseaserelated targets (e.g. caspase-3, EGFR, IL-6) involved in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, PI3K-AKT, and other signaling pathways. Molecular docking results indicated GC41 (glabridin), GC18 (medicarpin), EGFR and CCND1 are possible key components and target proteins related to reproductive improvement in sows. In PEECs, EGFR expression decreased at the mRNA and protein levels by three doses (160, 320, and 640 mu g/mL) of ALAE. The phosphorylation of downstream pathway PI3K-AKT1 was enhanced. The expression of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1 beta), ESR1 and caspase-3 decreased through multiple pathways. Additionally, the expression levels of an anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10), angiogenesis-related factors (MMP9, PIGF, PPAR gamma, IgG), and placental junction-related factors (CTNNB1, occludin, and claudin1) increased. Furthermore, the total born number of piglets, the number of live and healthy litters were significantly increased. The number of stillbirths decreased by ALAE treatment in sow animals. Conclusions: Dministration of ALAE significantly increased the total number of piglets born, the numbers of live and healthy litters and decreased the number of stillbirths through improving placental structure, attenuating inflammatory response, modulating placental angiogenesis and growth factor receptors in sows. The improvement of reproductive ability may be related to activation of the EGFR-PI3K-AKT1 pathway in PEECs. Moreover, ALAE maybe involved in modulation of estrogen receptors, apoptotic factors, and cell cycle proteins.

AB  - Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the etiology of psychiatric disorders associated with IBD remains uncertain, and an efficacious treatment approach has yet to be established. Herein, an oral hydrogel strategy (SP@Rh-gel) is proposed for co-delivery of Spirulina platensis and rhein to treat IBD and IBD-associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. SP@Rh-gel improves the solubility, release characteristics and intestinal retention capacity of the drug, leading to a significant improvement in the oral therapeutic efficacy. Oral administration of SP@Rh-gel can reduce intestinal inflammation and rebalance the disrupted intestinal microbial community. Furthermore, SP@Rh-gel maintains intestinal barrier integrity and reduces the release of pro-inflammatory factors and their entry into the hippocampus through the blood-brain barrier, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and maintaining neuroplasticity. SP@Rh-gel significantly alleviates the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, in a chronic colitis mouse model. This study demonstrates the significant involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the development of IBD with psychiatric disorders and proposes a safe, simple, and highly efficient therapeutic approach for managing IBD and comorbid psychiatric disorders.
   Oral microalgae-based hydrogel is developed to treat inflammatory bowel disease and its associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The hydrogel can reduce intestinal inflammation, maintain intestinal homeostasis, and inhibit neuroinflammation, then significantly alleviate the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. image

AB  - The development a photochemically driven polymeric composite for dental restorative materials to restore tooth cavities with antibacterial, biocompatibility, and outstanding mechanical properties is an urgent need for clinical application in stomatology. Herein, a series of polyurethane acrylate (PUA) prepolymers and antibacterial polyurethane acrylate quaternary ammonium salts (PUAQASs) were synthesized, and their mechanical and biological properties were explored. The unique secondary mercaptan with a long shelf life and low odor was used to reduce oxygen inhibition and increase cross-linking density; meanwhile, modified photo curable nano zirconia (nano ZrO2) enhances mechanical properties of the nanocomposites and possesses preeminent dispersion in the matrix. The results show that minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of PUAQASs are 200 and 800 mu g/mL for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. The addition of secondary thiols significantly increases the photopolymerization rate and monomer conversion. The highest hardness and modulus reach 1.8 and 8.7 GPa compared to 1.8 and 8.3 GPa for commercial resin. The lap shear stress on the pig bone is 912 MPa, and that on commercial resin is 921 MPa. Most importantly, the photochemically driven polymeric composite has excellent biocompatibility and significantly better antimicrobial properties than commonly used commercinl resins.

AB  - Exposure to repeated social stress may cause maladaptive emotional reactions that can be reduced by healthy nutritional supplementation. Histaminergic neurotransmission has a central role in orchestrating specific behavioural responses depending on the homeostatic state of a subject, but it remains to be established if it participates in the protective effects against the insults of chronic stress afforded by a healthy diet. By using C57BL/6J male mice that do not synthesize histamine (Hdc(-/-)) and their wild type (Hdc(+/+)) congeners we evaluated if the histaminergic system participates in the protective action of a diet enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin A on the deleterious effect of chronic stress. Behavioural tests across domains relevant to cognition and anxiety were performed. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity, cytokine expression, hippocampal fatty acids, oxylipins and microbiota composition were also assessed. Chronic stress induced social avoidance, poor recognition memory, affected hippocampal long-term potentiation, changed the microbiota profile, brain cytokines, fatty acid and oxylipins composition of both Hdc(-/-) and Hdc(+/+) mice. Dietary enrichment counteracted stress-induced deficits only in Hdc(+/+) mice as histamine deficiency prevented almost all the diet-related beneficial effects. Interpretation: Our results reveal a previously unexplored and novel role for brain histamine as a mediator of many favorable effects of the enriched diet. These data present long-reaching perspectives in the field of nutritional neuropsychopharmacology.

AB  - Glyght is a new photochromic compound described as an effective modulator of glycine receptors at heterologous expression, in brain slices and in zebrafish larvae. Glyght also caused weak inhibition of GABA(A)-mediated currents in a cell line expressing alpha 1/beta 2/gamma 2 GABA(A) receptors. However, the effects of Glyght on GABAergic transmission in the brain have not been analysed, which does not allow a sufficiently comprehensive assessment of the effects of the compound on the nervous system. Therefore, in this study using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we analysed the Glyght (100 mu M) action on evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in mice hippocampal slices. Two populations of cells were found: the first responded by reducing the GABAergic eIPSCs' amplitude, whereas the second showed no sensitivity to the compound. Glyght did not affect the ionic currents' amplitude induced by GABA application, suggesting the absence of action on postsynaptic GABA receptors. Additionally, Glyght had no impact on the paired-pulse modulation of GABAergic eIPSCs, indicating that Glyght does not modulate the neurotransmitter release mechanisms. In the presence of strychnine, an antagonist of glycine receptors, the Glyght effect on GABAergic synaptic transmission was absent. Our results suggest that Glyght can modulate GABAergic synaptic transmission via action on extrasynaptic glycine receptors.

AB  - A common symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cognitive decline, of which the potential pathogenesis remains unclear. In order to understand the mechanism of gut microbiota in AD, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolites. Behavioral tests, pathological examination, metagenomics, and metabolomics were applied to analyze the difference of gut microbiota and metabolome between APP(swe)/PS1(Delta E9) (PAP) mice with cognitive decline and age-matched controls, and their possible correlations. Our results showed that PAP mice and health mice had different structures of the bacterial communities in the gut. The abundances and diversities of the bacterial communities in health mice were higher than in PAP mice by metagenomics analysis. The abundances of Libanicoccus massiliensis, Paraprevotella clara, and Lactobacillus amylovorus were significantly increased in PAP mice, while the abundances of Turicibacter sanguinis, Dubosiella newyorkensis, and Prevotella oris were greatly reduced. Furthermore, PAP mice possessed peculiar metabolic phenotypes in stool, serum, and hippocampus relative to WT mice, as is demonstrated by alterations in neurotransmitters metabolism, lipid metabolism, aromatic amino acids metabolism, energy metabolism, vitamin digestion and absorption, and bile metabolism. Microbiota-host metabolic correlation analysis suggests that abnormal metabolism in stool, serum, and hippocampus of PAP mice may be modulated by the gut microbiota, especially T. sanguinis, D. newyorkensis, and P. oris. Therefore, abnormal metabolism activity is associated with gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease mice. Our results imply that modifying host metabolism through targeting gut microbiota may be a novel and viable strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD in the future.

AB  - Maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy leads to long-lasting effects on brain development and function. Several lines of evidence suggest that the maternal inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 plays a crucial role in the long-lasting effects of MIA on adult offspring. IL-6 is naturally produced during pregnancy in the absence of any underlying immune activation. The objective of this study was to assess whether this naturally occurring IL-6 has long-lasting effects on brain plasticity and function. Therefore, pregnant rats were given either an IL-6-neutralizing antibody (IL-6Ab) or vehicle during the third week of pregnancy. Newly born (doublecortin) and mature neurons (NeuN) were monitored in the hippocampus of adult male and female offspring. Prenatal IL-6Ab led to an enhanced number of newly born and mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of male but not female adult offspring. This enhanced neurogenesis was associated with an increased propensity in memory acquisition in male offspring. Blunting the naturally occurring IL-6 during pregnancy did not have a significant long-lasting impact on astrocyte cell density (GFAP), or on anxiety-like behavior as assessed with elevated plus maze and open field tests. Taken together, these data suggest that maternal IL-6 contributes, at least in part, to the programming of the brain's development in a sex-dependent manner.

AB  - Liver ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a pathological process that often occurs during liver and trauma surgery. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and potential mechanisms of sufentanil on hepatic I/R injury. I/R rat model and hypoxic/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced buffalo rat liver (BRL)-3A cell model were established. Following pretreatment with sufentanil, the enzymatic activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in rat serum and the changes of hepatic histopathology were evaluated to track the extent of liver injury. The levels of inflammatory factors were determined with ELISA kits and RT-qPCR. The infiltration of macrophages was assessed after detecting monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and F4/80 expression. Additionally, apoptosis was measured by means of TUNEL staining, and gene expression related to apoptosis was examined using RT-qPCR and western blotting. Then, TP53BP2 was overexpressed in BRL-3A cells exposed to H/R condition to evaluate whether sufentanil defended the liver against injury by regulating TP53BP2 expression. Moreover, the potential binding site of ATF4 on the TP53BP2 promoter was analyzed using JASPAR databases and verified by chromosomal immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Furthermore, TP53BP2 expression and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related protein levels were determined after ATF4 was overexpressed in sufentanil-treated BRL-3A cells. Results revealed that sufentanil significantly improved hepatic I/R injury, decreased the levels of inflammatory factors, and alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis. Notably, upregulated TP53BP2 expression was observed in hepatic tissues, and TP53BP2 overexpression markedly reversed the protective effects of sufentanil on the inflammation and apoptosis in H/R-stimulated BRL-3A cells. Additionally, ATF4 was confirmed to combine with the TP53BP2 promoter. ATF4 upregulation attenuated the inhibitory effects of sufentanil on the expression of TP53BP2 and ERS-associated proteins. These findings demonstrated that sufentanil protects the liver from inflammation and apoptosis injury induced by I/R by inhibiting ATF4 expression and further suppressing TP53BP2 expression, suggesting a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of liver I/R injury.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) carries risks of morbidity and mortality. Experimental studies have implicated the entorhinal cortex in prolonged seizures; however, studies in large human cohorts are limited. We hypothesised that individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and a history of SE would have more severe entorhinal atrophy compared to others with TLE and no history of SE. 357 individuals with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 100 healthy controls were scanned on a 3T MRI. For all subjects, the cortex was segmented, parcellated, and the thickness calculated from the T1-weighted anatomical scan. Subcortical volumes were derived similarly. Cohen's d and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests respectively were used to capture effect sizes and significance. Individuals with TLE and SE had reduced entorhinal thickness compared to those with TLE and no history of SE. The entorhinal cortex was more atrophic ipsilaterally (d = 0.51, p < 0.001) than contralaterally (d = 0.37, p = 0.01). Reductions in ipsilateral entorhinal thickness were present in both left TLE (n = 22:176, d = 0.78, p < 0.001), and right TLE (n = 19:140, d = 0.31, p = 0.04), albeit with a smaller effect size in right TLE. Several other regions exhibited atrophy in individuals with TLE, but these did not relate to a history of SE. These findings suggest potential involvement or susceptibility of the entorhinal cortex in prolonged seizures.

AB  - The study of an Ischemic stroke infarction allows verifying how the lesion produces alterations in the neuronal networks resulting in cognitive deficits. It also allows the verification of adaptive and maladaptive cerebral reorganization related to the injury. In our previous fMRI study, we found that patients without ischemic vascular lesions in left inferior frontal gyrus showed an efficient compensation mechanism during the associative encoding of face name pairs, by the increased activation of ventrolateral and dorsolateral areas of contralesional hemisphere associated with better memory performance. While patients with ischemic vascular lesions on left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) demonstrated worse memory performance and no signs of compensation mechanism. The present study explores more of these findings by analyzing perilesional and contralesional activations related to unfamiliar face name associative encoding in adults with chronic ischemic stroke, with or without left IFG lesion, compared to healthy controls. The main results showed that stroke survivors without lesions in IFG demonstrated increased activation in perilesional and contralesional prefrontal regions associated with better associative memory recognition, which are indicative of adaptive compensatory mechanisms. However, they also showed a negative correlation between the activation of right anterior prefrontal and inferior parietal regions and the associative memory performance, which may indicate the presence of maladaptive interhemispheric disinhibition. On the other hand, stroke survivors with IFG lesions demonstrated negative correlations in activations of the ipsilesional inferior parietal cortex and positive correlations in activations of the left middle frontal gyrus and left precentral cortex, which demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of adaptive and maladaptive brain reorganization mechanisms in this group. However, the increase in perilesional prefrontal regions, associated with bilateral activation of the hippocampus and amygdala, was not enough to compensate for the inefficiency of associative memory performance. Finally, the differences in activation observed in stroke survivors reflect their clinical heterogeneity and demonstrate that adaptive or maladaptive compensatory mechanisms can coexist in the same group of patients. Furthermore, they reinforce the importance of the left IFG in the associative encoding of unfamiliar face name pairs and may suggest a deficit in associative memory related to injury in this region.

AB  - The 17q21 asthma susceptibility locus includes asthma risk alleles associated with decreased sphingolipid synthesis, likely resulting from increased expression of ORMDL3. ORMDL3 inhibits serinepalmitoyl transferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo sphingolipid synthesis. There is evidence that decreased sphingolipid synthesis is critical to asthma pathogenesis. Children with asthma and 17q21 asthma risk alleles display decreased sphingolipid synthesis in blood cells. Reduced SPT activity results in airway hyperreactivity, a hallmark feature of asthma. 17q21 asthma risk alleles are also linked to childhood infections with human rhinovirus (RV). This study evaluates the interaction of RV with the de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway, and the alterative effects of concurrent SPT inhibition in SPT-deficient mice and human airway epithelial cells. In mice, RV infection shifted lung sphingolipid synthesis gene expression to a pattern that resembles genetic SPT deficiency, including decreased expression of Sptssa, a small SPT subunit. This pattern was pronounced in lung epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM(+)) cells and reproduced in human bronchial epithelial cells. RV did not affect Sptssa expression in lung CD45(+) immune cells. RV increased sphingolipids unique to the de novo synthesis pathway in mouse lung and human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, these de novo sphingolipid species were reduced in the blood of RV-infected wild-type mice. RV exacerbated SPT deficiency-associated airway hyperreactivity. Airway inflammation was similar in RV-infected wild-type and SPT-deficient mice.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis involves the generation of functional neurons from neural progenitor cells, which have the potential to complement and restore damaged neurons and neural circuits. Therefore, the development of drugs that stimulate neurogenesis represents a promising strategy in stem cell therapy and neural regeneration, greatly facilitating the reconstruction of neural circuits in cases of neurodegeneration and brain injury. Our study reveals that compound A5, previously designed and synthesized by our team, exhibits remarkable neuritogenic activities, effectively inducing neurogenesis in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Subsequently, transcriptome analysis using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq technology was performed to further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which Compound A5 promotes neurogenesis. Notably, comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were mainly associated with neurogenesis, and the down-regulated genes were mainly concerned with cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we confirmed that Compound A5 significantly affected the expression of transcription factors related to neurogenesis and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Collectively, these findings identify a new compound with neurogenic activity and may provide insights into drug discovery for neural repair and regeneration.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between bladder urothelial cancer (BLCA) and immunity, to screen prognosis-related immune genes (PIGs), and to construct an immune-related prognosis model (IRPM). We processed the relevant data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-BLCA) and GSE13507 using R software and Perl. We divided BLCA into high-immunity and low-immunity subtypes. There were significant differences in the two subtypes. In addition, we identified 13 PIGs of BLCA by jointly analyzing the gene expression data and survival information of GSE13507 and TCGA-BLCA, and constructed IRPM through nine of them. The low-risk group had better survival outcome than the high-risk group. We also constructed a nomogram based on clinicopathological information and risk scores of the patients. Moreover, the prognosis of BLCA patients was significantly impacted by the expression of almost every gene used to calculate the risk score. The result of real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that all the genes used to calculate the risk score were differentially expressed between BLCA and adjacent normal tissues, except PDGFRA. Our research provided potential targets for the treatment of BLCA and a reference for judging the prognosis of BLCA.

AB  - Increasing environmental exposure to silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and limited neurotoxicity studies pose a challenge for safety evaluation and management of these materials. This study aimed to explore the adverse effects and underlying mechanisms of subacute exposure to SiNPs by the intraperitoneal route on hippocampus function in rats. Data showed that SiNPs induced a significant increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress markers including reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein oxidation (PCO) and nitrite (NO) production accompanied by reduced antioxidant enzyme activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) and decreased glutathione (GSH). Phenotypically, SiNPs exhibited spatial learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, a decrease of the discrimination index in the novel object recognition test (NORT) and higher anxiety-like behavior. SiNPs affected the cholinergic system as reflected by reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. In addition, SiNPs significantly increased mRNA expression level of genes related to inflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and COX-2) and decreased mRNA expression level of genes related to cholinergic system including choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), AChE, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (m1AChR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Histopathological results further showed an alteration in the hippocampus of treated animals associated with marked vacuolation in different hippocampus areas. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SiNPs-induced hippocampal alterations leading to impairment of cognitive and behavioral functions, and implicating oxidative stress and inflammation in the hippocampus, as well as disruption of cholinergic system.

AB  - The corpus luteum (CL) is a temporary endocrine gland vital for pregnancy establishment and maintenance. Estradiol-17 beta (E2) is the major embryonic signal in pigs supporting the CL's function. The mechanisms of the luteoprotective action of E2 are still unclear. The present study aimed to determine the effect of E2 on luteal expression of factors involved in CL function. An in vivo model of intrauterine E2 infusions was applied. Gilts on day 12 of pregnancy and the estrous cycle were used as referential groups. Concentrations of E2 and progesterone were elevated in CLs of gilts receiving E2 infusions, compared to placebo-treated gilts. Estradiol-17 beta stimulated luteal expression of DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), but decreased expression of DNMT3B gene and protein, as well as DNMT3A protein. Similar results for DNMT3A and 3B were observed in CLs on day 12 of pregnancy compared to day 12 of the estrous cycle. Intrauterine infusions of E2 altered luteal expression of the genes involved in CL function: PTGFR, PTGES, STAR, HSD17B1, CYP19A1, and PGRMC1. Our findings indicate a role for E2 in expression regulation of factors related to CL function and a novel potential for E2 to regulate DNA methylation as putative physiological mechanisms controlling luteal gene expression.

AB  - D5, a member of the cyclic siloxane family, is widely used in personal care products such as shampoo, cosmetics, and deodorant and as an industrial intermediate. D5 can mainly be absorbed orally or through inhalation. Through these routes, people are exposed to D5 daily. However, the risk of prenatal exposure to D5 has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the effect of D5 on neural development was established through behavioral tests on offspring mice. The result confirmed that the maternal administration of 12 mg/kg of D5 showed depression in tail suspension and decreased performance in the forced swimming test as well as an increase in repetitive activity in both the marble-burying test and grooming test compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the 12 mg/kg group showed a decrease in cognitive ability and social behavior in the three-chamber test. In the novel object recognition test, memory impairment and a lack of exploring ability were found in the 12 mg/kg group. In conclusion, it is suggested that maternal D5 exposure has developmental neurotoxicity and can cause behavioral disorders in the offspring of mice. Thus, the usage of D5 needs to be considered carefully.

AB  - Anti-seizure medications used during pregnancy may havetransientor long-lasting impact on the nervous system of the offspring. Therefore,there is a great need to search for alternative therapies for pregnantwomen suffering from seizures. One of the solutions may be the useof the ketogenic diet (KD), which has been successfully applied asa treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in children and adults. However,the risks associated with the use of this dietary therapy during pregnancyare unknown and more investigation in this area is needed. To shedsome light on this problem, we attempted to determine the potentialabnormalities in brain biomolecular composition that may occur inthe offspring after the prenatal exposure to KD. To achieve this,the female Wistar rats were, during pregnancy, fed with either ketogenicor standard laboratory diet, and for further studies, their male offspringat 2, 6, or 14 days of age were used. Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopywas applied for topographic and quantitative analysis of main biologicalmacromolecules (proteins, lipids, compounds containing phosphate andcarbonyl groups, and cholesterol) in brain samples. Performed chemicalmapping and further semi-quantitative and statistical analysis showedthat the use of the KD during pregnancy, in general, does not leadto the brain biochemical anomalies in 2 and 6 days old rats. The exceptionfrom this rule was increased relative (comparing to proteins) contentof compounds containing phosphate groups in white matter and cortexof 2 days old rats exposed prenatally to KD. Greater number of abnormalitieswas found in brains of the 14 days old offspring of KD-fed mothers.They included the increase of the relative level of compounds containingcarbonyl groups (in cortex as well as multiform and molecular cellsof the hippocampal formation) as well as the decrease of the relativecontent of lipids and their structural changes (in white matter).What is more, the surface of the internal capsule (structure of thewhite matter) determined for this age group was smaller in animalssubjected to prenatal KD exposure. The observed changes seem to arisefrom the elevated exposition to ketone bodies during a fetus lifeand the disturbance of lipid metabolism after prenatal exposure tothe KD. These changes may be also associated with the processes ofcompensation of mother organism, which slowly began to make up forthe deficiencies in carbohydrates postpartum.

AB  - In the area of stem cell research, fusion of somatic cells into pluripotent cells such as mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells induces reprogramming of the somatic nucleus and can be used to study the effect of trans-acting factors from the pluripotent cell on the pluripotent state of somatic nucleus. As many other groups, we previously established a porcine pluripotent cell line at a low potential. Therefore, here, we performed experiments to investigate if the fusion with mouse ES cell could improve the pluripotent state of porcine pluripotent cell. Our data showed that resultant mouse-porcine interspecies fused cells are AP positive, and could be passaged up to 20 passages. Different degrees of increases in expression of porcine pluripotent genes proved that pig-origin gene network can be programmed by mouse ES. Further differentiation study also confirmed these fused cells' potential to form three germ layers. However, unexpectedly, we found that chromosome loss and aberrant (especially in porcine chromosomes) is severe after the cell fusion, implying that interspecies cell fusion may be not suitable to study porcine pluripotency without additional supportive conditions for genome stabilization.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) innervating several limbic and neocortical regions of the mammalian brain have long been implicated in motivation, rewarding and aversive behaviors, and memory processing. Recently, we demonstrated that somatodendritic release of DA in the VTA regulates the formation and maintenance of appetitive long-term memories (LTM). However, less is known about the impact of DA neurotransmission in the VTA on aversive LTM. Here, we describe the modulation of negative-valence memories by D1/D5-type DA (D1R)-receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the VTA. As aversive stimuli elicit both active and passive behavioral responses, we used two single-trial aversive training protocols: inhibitory avoidance task and conditioned place aversion. We bilaterally microinfused SCH23390, an antagonist of D1R, into the VTA immediately after training and found that DA neurotransmission in the VTA modulates LTM consolidation and persistence of aversive experiences. Together with previous findings demonstrating that D1R-mediated DA neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is involved in the formation and persistence of LTM for aversive events, our present results indicate that memory processing of environmental stimuli with negative-valence depends on the integration of information mediated by D1R activation in both the VTA region and in selected downstream target areas.

AB  - BackgroundSenecavirus A (SV-A) is an RNA virus that belongs to the genus Senecavirus within the family Picornaviridae. This study aimed to analyze factors that can influence the molecular diagnosis of Senecavirus A, such as oligonucleotides, RNA extraction methods, and RT-qPCR kits.MethodsSamples from suspected cases of vesicular disease in Brazilian pigs were analyzed for foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease, and vesicular stomatitis. All tested negative for these diseases but positive for SV-A. RT-qPCR tests were used, comparing different reagent kits and RNA extraction methods. Sensitivity and repeatability were evaluated, demonstrating efficacy in detecting SV-A in clinical samples.ResultsIn RNA extraction, significant reduction in Cq values was observed with initial dilutions, particularly with larger supernatant volumes. Trizol and Maxwell showed greater sensitivity in automated equipment protocols, though results varied in tissue tests. RT-qPCR kit comparison revealed differences in amplification using viral RNA but minimal differences with plasmid DNA. Sensitivity among methods was comparable, with slight variations in non-amplified samples. Repeatability tests showed consistent results among RT-qPCRs, demonstrating similarity between methods despite minor discrepancies in Cq values.ConclusionsTrizol, silica columns, and semi-automated extraction were compared, as well as different RT-qPCR kits. The study found significant variations that could impact the final diagnosis.

AB  - Elephants are on the verge of extinction due to extensive poaching to obtain ivory and illegal income. According to international law, the trade in ivory of African elephants is outlawed, with a few exceptions, as for example in European Union for antique ivory obtained before 1947. There is basically only one physical method for determining the age of ivory and that is radiocarbon dating. The method uses artificially temporarily enhanced C-14 content in the atmosphere to date relevant samples with high resolution. Since this advantage is slowly fading, the question arises of how to fill in the loss of the resolution. One possibility is exploiting the chronology of ivory. This work studies a whole elephant tusk and uses radiocarbon dating of samples obtained longitudinally and transversely from along the tusk to analyse the growth rate.

AB  - Silk fibroin (SF), as a special natural polymer, is a good candidate for preparing flexible sensor due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and amphiphilic properties. However, the high and uncontrollable crystallization of SF makes it challenge to be utilized in excellent biomimetic SF hydrogel sensor. Neat SF hydrogel is brittle and not adhesive. Here, polyacrylamide (PAM) was introduced to the SF hydrogel to address this issue. Due to their strong intermolecular interaction, the network morphology of SF/PAM hydrogel was altered to non-Euclidean pore from Euclidean one. Meanwhile, its beta-sheet crystallization was suppressed to nanoscale readily. These evolutions endow the SF/PAM hydrogel with not only enhanced mechanical properties but also excellent adhesion performance. Compared with that of neat PAM hydrogel, tensile strength, tensile failure strain, compressive strength (under 80% strain) and adhesion performance (on pig skin) of the SF8/PAM hydrogel are increased by 133.1%, 120.9%, 610.8% and 104.8%, respectively. Additionally, the amphiphilicity of SF could make the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) disperse well in hydrogel. CNT0.3/SF8/PAM hydrogel not only inherits but also improves the above properties. It exhibits excellent adhesive sensing performance with maximal gauge factor of 10.13, working strain range of 1000% and stability as long as over 500 cycles. The detection of six human activities was also demonstrated. This work affords a general strategy to achieve high-performance SF-based hydrogel and indicates that the SF/PAM hydrogel possesses great promise for applications in flexible wearable strain sensors.

AB  - Orexins and orexinergic receptors have been shown to play a critical role in reward processing and drug addiction. Previous studies showed that the orexinergic system in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus affects the conditioning (acquisition) and post-conditioning (expression) phases of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). The action of each orexin receptor within the DG during conditioning and expression phases for methamphetamine (METH)-induced CPP remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the role of orexin-1 and -2 receptors in the hippocampal DG in METH CPP acquisition and expression. During the 5-day conditioning phase, rats received an intra-DG microinjection of SB334867, a selective orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) antagonist, or TCS OX2-29, a selective orexin-2 receptor (OX2R) antagonist, before injection of METH (1 mg/kg; sc). In different sets of animals on the expression day, rats received each antagonist before the CPP test. The results showed that SB334867 (3, 10, and 30 nmol) and TCS OX2-29 (3, 10, and 30 nmol) significantly decreased the acquisition of METH CPP during the conditioning phase. Furthermore, administration of SB 334867 (10 and 30 nmol) and TCS OX2-29 (3 and 10 nmol) on the post-conditioning day significantly reduced METH-induced CPP expression. The results also indicated that orexin receptors play a more critical role in the conditioning phase than in the expression phase. In summary, the orexin receptors in the DG play a crucial role in drug learning and memory and are essential for METH reward acquisition and expression.

AB  - Clostridial disease causes severe economic losses in livestock by rapidly killing ruminants. Therefore, implementing effective control approaches to prevent this fatal disease is of high importance. The causative agent of this disease is Clostridium spp. Accurate identification of this microorganism is crucial for effectively managing clostridial diseases in farm. There are conventional methods for detecting the disease including microbiological and biochemical tests and many of these tests are time-consuming and exhibit low sensitivity. Therefore, this study aimed to use conventional and molecular approaches to identify Iranian isolates associated with animal infections. To achieve this, 61 samples were collected from 1984 to 2024, cultured on liver media and subsequently subjected to microbiological and biochemical tests. For molecular identification, the DNA of isolates were extracted and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. The results of the conventional analysis revealed that all Iranian isolates were identified as Clostridium perfringens and its type was determined using PCR assay. According to our findings, C. perfringens type A was the most prevalent strain in Iran which predominantly found in ostriches and bird samples followed by type D. This study underscored the presence of C. perfringens types across variety hosts and geographic locations in Iran. In conclusion, the combining conventional methods with PCR helped reliably detect Clostridium spp. This information holds the potential to significantly contribute to the development of preventive strategies against clostridial diseases in Iran.

AB  - Camellia vietnamensis grows in a unique tropical environment, and its seed oil has a rich aroma. The content of unsaturated fatty acids in C. vietnamensis oil is up to 90%, which can regulate human lipid metabolism and prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Compared with olive oil, C. vietnamensis oil has a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids. This study used eleven C. vietnamensis cultivars cultivated on Hainan Island. Among the 11 cultivars, "Boao 1" had fruits with the largest vertical diameter of 45.05 mm, while "Haida 1" had fruits with the largest horizontal diameter, single-fruit weight, and fresh 100-grain weight of 53.5 mm, 70.6 g, and 479.01 g, respectively. "Boao 3" had an acid value and peroxide value of 1.59 mg/g and 3.50 mmol/kg, respectively, and its saponification value content was 213.18 mg/g. "Boao 5" had the highest iodine value, 101.86 g/100 g, among the 11 cultivars. The content of unsaturated fatty acids in the seed oil of 11 cultivars ranged from 84.87% to 87.38%. The qRT-PCR results confirmed that "Boao 3" had a higher content of flavonoids and fatty acids than other cultivars. The comprehensive analysis of physiological and biochemical indices showed that the top five cultivars were "Haida 1", "Boao 3", "Haida 2", "Boao 1", and "Boao 5". These five cultivars were suitable for large-scale cultivation in tropical regions, such as Hainan Island. This study provided a theoretical basis for the breeding of C. vietnamensis cultivars in tropical regions.

AB  - An efficient two-step plasma oxidation and reduction process was proposed to recover value-added high-purity iron utilizing recycled pig iron (P-Fe). We researched the influence of different additions of industrial grade iron oxide (Fe2O3) and processing combinations on impurity removal. This involved 15 minutes of argon plasma arc melting (APAM) oxidation or followed by 5 minutes of hydrogen plasma arc melting (HPAM) reduction at 105 (N m-2). Meanwhile, thermodynamic/kinetic elimination models were introduced to describe processes of plasma oxidation, reduction, and evaporation. The obtained 3N high-purity iron demonstrated that, in the first APAM step with 18 pct Fe2O3 addition, over 85 pct of Si, C, and Ti in P-Fe were removed, increasing the purity from 91.7 to 99.906 pct. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, alongside studies using electrolytic iron (E-Fe), verified that the removal was attributed to the vaporized gaseous SiO, CO, and the stable TiO2. In the second HPAM step, residual O, N, and S were reduced to less ppm, achieving removal efficiencies of 99.99, 91.7, and 93.6 pct, respectively. The decarburization kinetics revealed high apparent rate constant of 0.00686 s-1 for APAM and 0.00701 s-1 for APAM-HPAM, both with 18 pct Fe2O3 as the oxidant. Furthermore, the kinetic model for Mn evaporation unveiled that gas interface mass transfer, with a rate of 1.399 E-7 m s-1 at 1800 K, was identified as the rate-limiting step.

AB  - KCNQ2 variants in children with neurodevelopmental impairment are difficult to assess due to their heterogeneity and unclear pathogenic mechanisms. We describe a child with neonatal-onset epilepsy, developmental impairment of intermediate severity, and KCNQ2 G256W heterozygosity. Analyzing prior KCNQ2 channel cryoelectron microscopy models revealed G256 as a node of an arch-shaped non-covalent bond network linking S5, the pore turret, and the ion path. Co-expression with G256W dominantly suppressed conduction by wild-type subunits in heterologous cells. Ezogabine partly reversed this suppression. Kcnq2(G256W/+) mice have epilepsy leading to premature deaths. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from G256W/+ brain slices showed hyperexcitability. G256W/+ pyramidal cell KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 immunolabeling was significantly shifted from axon initial segments to neuronal somata. Despite normal mRNA levels, G256W/+ mouse KCNQ2 protein levels were reduced by about 50%. Our findings indicate that G256W pathogenicity results from multiplicative effects, including reductions in intrinsic conduction, subcellular targeting, and protein stability. These studies provide evidence for an unexpected and novel role for the KCNQ2 pore turret and introduce a valid animal model of KCNQ2 encephalopathy. Our results, spanning structure to behavior, may be broadly applicable because the majority of KCNQ2 encephalopathy patients share variants near the selectivity filter.

AB  - BackgroundThe aim of the study was to explore a feasible method for alleviating limb ischemia-reperfusion injury (LI/RI) through the use of a high-concentration citrate solution (HC-A solution) for limb perfusion (LP). MethodsEighteen pigs were divided into three groups: the Sham group, LI/RI group, and HCA group. The Sham group underwent exposure of the iliac artery and vein. The LI/RI group underwent tourniquet placement and clamping of the iliac artery and vein to simulate LI/RI. The HCA group received HC-A solution LP for 30 min through the left iliac artery below the level of blood flow occlusion based on the LI/RI group. Oxidative stress markers and inflammatory response markers were compared among the three groups. ResultsCompared to the LI/RI group, the HCA group showed significantly lower levels of serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and significantly greater activities of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) or in muscle MDA, SOD, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 between the HCA group and the LI/RI group (p > 0.05). Compared to the LI/RI group, MDA, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels in the liver were significantly lower in the HCA group (p < 0.05), while SOD activities were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Histopathological examination revealed reduced skeletal muscle and liver damage in the HCA group compared to the LI/RI group. ConclusionsHC-A solution LP can alleviate liver damage caused by LI/RI in pigs.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is common in older adult patients and affects their prognosis. Studies suggested that autophagy and oxidative stress are key factors in the pathogenesis of POCD. This study aimed to determine whether electroacupuncture (EA) pre-treatment improves POCD in aged rats and the underlying mechanisms. We established a model of POCD by using propofol anaesthesia and caesarean section in aged mice and assessed whether electroacupuncture at the Baihui and Neiguan points modulates autophagy and oxidative stress involved in the pathological process of POCD. The Morris water maze test assessed postoperative cognitive function. Oxidative stress was assessed using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of the hippocampal cord neurons. In addition, protein blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed to assess SIRT1, FOXO1, and autophagy markers at both the protein and mRNA levels. The results showed that anaesthesia/surgery significantly impaired cognitive performance, increased oxidative stress, decreased autophagy in the hippocampus, damaged hippocampal neurones and disrupted the mitochondrial structure in aged rats. EA pre-treatment improved cognitive function, restored neuronal and mitochondrial function, increased Beclin-1 and SIRT1 levels and attenuated oxidative damage and autophagy dysfunction in POCD rats. In conclusion, EA pre-treatment improved POCD in aged rats, and this mechanism may be related to the enhancement of autophagy and the inhibition of oxidative stress through SIRT1/FOXO1 signalling.

AB  - Galloylated flavan-3-ols are key quality and health-related compounds in tea plants of Camellia section Thea. Camellia ptilophylla and Camellia sinensis are two representative species known for their high levels of galloylated flavan-3-ols. Building on our knowledge of galloyl catechin biosynthesis in C. sinensis, we now focus on the biosynthesis of galloylated phenolics in C. ptilophylla, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the high accumulation of these compounds in Camellia species. The phenolic compounds in C. ptilophylla were identified and quantified using chromatographic and colorimetric methods. Genes involved in polyphenol galloylation were identified by correlating gene expression with the accumulation of galloylated phenolics across 18 additional Camellia species and one related species using Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis. Key findings include the coexpression of SCPL4/2 and SCPL5 subgroup enzymes as crucial for galloylation of catechins, while SCPL3 and SCPL8 showed enzymatic activity related to hydrolyzable tannin synthesis. Variations in the amino acid sequences of SCPL5, particularly in the catalytic triad (T-D-Y vs S-D-H) observed in C. ptilophylla and C. sinensis, were found to significantly affect enzymatic activity and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) production. In conclusion, this research provides important insights into the metabolic pathways of C. ptilophylla, emphasizing the critical role of SCPL enzymes in shaping the phenolic profile within the section Thea. The findings have significant implications for the cultivation and breeding of tea plants with optimized phenolic characteristics.

AB  - Reserpine (RES) is an irreversible inhibitor of VMAT2 used to study Parkinson's disease (PD) and screening for antiparkinsonian treatments in rodents. Recently, the repeated treatment with a low dose of reserpine was proposed as a model capable of emulating progressive neurochemical, motor and non-motor impairments in PD. Conversely, compared to Wistar rats, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) are resistant to motor changes induced by repeated treatment with a low dose of RES. However, such resistance has not yet been investigated for RES-induced non-motor impairments. We aimed to assess whether SHR would have differential susceptibility to the object recognition deficit induced by repeated low-dose reserpine treatment. We submitted male Wistar and SHR rats to repeated RES treatment (15 s.c. injections of 0.1 mg/kg, every other day) and assessed object memory acquisition and retrieval 48 h after the 6th RES injection (immediately before the appearance of motor impairments). Only RES Wistar rats displayed memory impairment after reserpine treatment. On the other hand, untreated SHR rats displayed object recognition memory deficit, but RES treatment restored such deficits. We also performed immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) 48 h after the last RES injection. In a different set of animals submitted to the same treatment, we quantified DA, 5-HT and products of lipid peroxidation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). SHR presented increased constitutive levels of DA in the PFC and reduced immunoreactivity to TH in the medial PFC and dorsal HPC. Corroborating the behavioral findings, RES treatment restored those constitutive alterations in SHR. These findings indicate that the neurochemical, molecular and genetic differences in the SHR strain are potentially relevant targets to the study of susceptibility to diseases related to dopaminergic alterations.

AB  - Different memory systems operate in parallel to support behaviour. To evaluate procedural and reference subcategories of long-term memory as early as possible in the mouse, the Helico Maze (HM) was developed. BALB/c AnNCrl (BALB), C57BL/6JRj (C57) and DBA/2 JRj (DBA) mice were trained on this new maze. The three strains learned how to use the HM (procedural memory), and they then learned and remembered four odour-reward associations (reference memory). The three strains differed in the number of correct responses. BALB mice showed better performance than C57 and DBA mice. The results of the first block of each session revealed that only the BALB and C57 mice remembered the odour-reward associations. DBA mice needed to relearn the associations each day. With this new apparatus, the number of olfactory cue-reward associations was increased from 2 to 4 in comparison to a previous olfactory tubing maze. Consequently, a supplementary effort of memory was required, and the chance level was decreased from 50 % to 25 %. Thus, in several important respects, the HM can be considered to measure the hippocampus-dependent behaviour of the mouse, allowing to study, as early as possible in young mice, the different subcategories of long-term memory, such as those observed in humans.

AB  - Neurotoxicity investigations of inhaled organophosphorus pesticide (OP), ethyl-parathion (EP), were conducted in Sprague Dawley rats comparing exposures to EP volatilized at 0, 1, 10, and 20 mg/m3 versus EP incorporated into soil dust (5 mg/m3) at 0, 0.0095, 0.09, and 0.185 mg/mg3. All exposures were sublethal, caused no respiratory effects, and no effects on balance and coordination behavior. Both volatilized and dust-incorporated EP exposures significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in plasma and hippocampus tissue. Correspondingly, plasma and hippocampal dopamine levels spiked in these exposures suggesting compensatory cholinergic / dopaminergic signal balancing. The EP exposures significantly increased expression of proinflammatory genes, including MAPK-14, IL6, IL1(3, and TNF-alpha, while global RNA-seq results identified significant enrichment of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis pathways. Remarkably, dust-incorporated EP impacted similar molecular endpoints as volatilized EP but at concentrations two orders of magnitude lower highlighting potentially increased potency of EP incorporated into soil dust.

AB  - Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is postulated to exert "top-down control" on information processing throughout the brain to promote specific behaviors. However, pathways mediating top-down control remain poorly understood. In particular, knowledge about direct prefrontal connections that might facilitate top-down control of hippocampal information processing remains sparse. Here we describe monosynaptic long-range GABAergic projections from PFC to hippocampus. These preferentially inhibit vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing intemeurons, which are known to disinhibit hippocampal microcircuits. Indeed, stimulating prefrontal-hippocampal GABAergic projections increases hippocampal feedforward inhibition and reduces hippocampal activity in vivo. The net effect of these actions is to specifically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for hippocampal encoding of object locations and augment object-induced increases in spatial information. Correspondingly, activating or inhibiting these projections promotes or suppresses object exploration, respectively. Together, these results elucidate a top-down prefrontal pathway in which long-range GABAergic projections target disinhibitory microcircuits, thereby enhancing signals and network dynamics underlying exploratory behavior.

AB  - Growing studies indicate that vigilance states and circadian rhythms can influence seizure occurrence in patients with epilepsy and rodent models of epilepsy. Electrical kindling, referred to brief, repeated stimulations of a limbic structure, is a commonly used model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Kindling via the classic protocol lasting a few weeks does not generally induce spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), but extended kindling that applies over the course of a few months has shown to induce SRS in several animal species. Kindling-induced SRS in monkeys and cats were observed mainly during resting wakefulness or sleep, but the behavioral activities associated with SRS in rodent models of extended kindling remain unknown. We aimed to add information in this area using a mouse model of extended hippocampal kindling. Middle-aged C57 black mice experienced >= 80 hippocampal stimulations (delivered twice daily) and then underwent continuous 24 h electroencephalography (EEG)-video monitoring for SRS detection. SRS were recognized by EEG discharges and associated motor seizures. The five stages of the modified Racine scale for mice were used to score motor seizure severities. Seizure-preceding behaviors were assessed in a 3 min period prior to seizure onset and categorized as active and inactive. Three main observations emerged from the present analysis. (1) SRS were found to predominantly manifest as generalized (stage 3-5) motor seizures in association with tail erection or Straub tail. (2) SRS occurrences were not significantly altered by the light on/off cycle. (3) Generalized (stage 3-5) motor seizures were mainly preceded by inactive behaviors such as immobility, standing still, or apparent sleep without evident volitional movement. Considering deeper subcortical structures implicated in genesis of tail erection in other seizure models, we postulate that genesis of generalized motor seizures in extended kindled mice may involve deeper subcortical structures. Our present data together with previous findings from post-status epilepticus models support the notion that ambient cage behaviors are strong influencing factors of SRS occurrence in rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy.

AB  - There is substantial evidence linking the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to a variety of cognitive abilities, with adolescence being a critical period in its development. In the current study, we investigated the neural basis of differences in learning in pre-adolescent common marmosets. At 8 months old, marmosets were given anatomical and resting state MRI scans (n = 24). At 9 months old, association learning and inhibitory control was tested using a 'go/no go' visual discrimination (VD) task. Marmosets were grouped into 'learners' (n = 12) and "non-learners " (n = 12), and associations between cognitive performance and sub-regional PFC volumes, as well as PFC connectivity patterns, were investigated. "Learners " had significantly (p < 0.05) larger volumes of areas 11, 25, 47 and 32 than 'non-learners', although 'non-learners' had significantly larger volumes of areas 24a and 8 v than "learners ". There was also a significant correlation between average % correct responses to the 'punished' stimulus and volume of area 47. Further, 'non-learners' had significantly greater global PFC connections, as well as significantly greater numbers of connections between the PFC and basal ganglia, cerebellum and hippo-campus, compared to 'learners'. These results suggest that larger sub-regions of the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial PFC, as well more refined PFC connectivity patterns to other brain regions associated with learning, may be important in successful response inhibition. This study therefore offers new information on the neurodevelopment of individual differences in cognition during pre-adolescence in non-human primates.

AB  - The reuniens (Re) and rhomboid (Rh) nuclei of the ventral midline thalamus are bi-directionally connected with the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. They participate in a variety of cognitive functions, including information holding for seconds to minutes in working memory tasks. What about longer delays? To address this question, we used a spatial working memory task in which rats had to reach a platform submerged in water. The platform location was changed every 2-trial session and rats had to use allothetic cues to find it. Control rats received training in a typical response-memory task. We interposed a 6 h interval between instruction (locate platform) and evaluation (return to platform) trials in both tasks. After the last session, rats were killed for c-Fos imaging. A home-cage group was used as additional control of baseline levels of c-Fos expression. C-Fos expression was increased to comparable levels in the Re (not Rh) of both spatial memory and response-memory rats as compared to their home cage counterparts. However, in spatial memory rats, not in their response memory controls, task performance was correlated with c-Fos expression in the Re: the higher this expression, the better the performance. Furthermore, we noticed an activation of hippocampal region CA1 and of the anteroventral nucleus of the rostral thalamus. This activation was specific to spatial memory. The data point to a possible performance-determinant participation of the Re nucleus in the delayed engagement of spatial information encoded in a temporary memory.

AB  - Spatial working memory, the ability to temporarily maintain an internal representation of spatial information for use in guiding upcoming decisions, has been shown to be dependent upon a network of brain structures that includes the hippocampus, a region known to be critical for spatial navigation and episodic memory, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region known to be critical for executive function and goal directed behavior. Oscillatory synchronization between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to increase in situations of high working memory demand. Most of our knowledge about the anatomical connectivity between the PFC and hippocampus comes from the rodent literature. Thus, most of the findings that will be discussed here model human working memory using spatial working memory-dependent maze navigation tasks in rodents. It has been demonstrated that the ventral midline thalamic nucleus reuniens (Re) is reciprocally connected to both the infralimbic and prelimbic subregions of the PFC, collectively referred to as the medial PFC (mPFC), and the hippocampus. Given that the Re serves as a major anatomical route between the mPFC and hippocampus, it is perhaps not surprising that Re has been shown to be critical for spatial working memory. This review will describe the latest findings and ideas on how the Re contributes to prefrontal-hippocampal synchronization and spatial working memory in rodents. The review will conclude with possible future directions that will advance the understanding of the mechanisms that enable the Re to orchestrate long range synchrony in the prefrontalhippocampal network.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic neurobehavioral disorder whereby an imbalance between neurochemical excitation and inhibition at the synaptic level provokes seizures. Various experimental models have been used to study epilepsy, including that based on acute or chronic administration of Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). In this study, a single PTZ dose (60 mg/kg) was administered to adult male rats and 30 min later, various neurobiological parameters were studied related to the transmission and modulation of excitatory impulses in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA1 field. Rats experienced generalized seizures 1-3 min after PTZ administration, accompanied by elevated levels of Synaptophysin and Glutaminase. This response suggests presynaptic glutamate release is exacerbated to toxic levels, which eventually provokes neuronal death as witnessed by the higher levels of Caspase-3, TUNEL and GFAP. Similarly, the increase in PSD-95 suggests that viable dendritic spines are functional. Indeed, the increase in stubby and wide spines is likely related to de novo spinogenesis, and the regulation of neuronal excitability, which could represent a plastic response to the synaptic over-excitation. Furthermore, the increase in mushroom spines could be associated with the storage of cognitive information and the potentiation of thin spines until they are transformed into mushroom spines. However, the reduction in BDNF suggests that the activity of these spines would be down-regulated, may in part be responsible for the cognitive decline related to hippocampal function in patients with epilepsy.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gathered significant attention due to their pivotal role in plant growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stress resistance. Despite this, there is still little understanding regarding the functions of lncRNA in these domains in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), mainly attributable to the insufficiencies in gene manipulation techniques for tea plants. In this study, we designed a novel strategy to identify evolutionarily conserved trans-lncRNA (ECT-lncRNA) pairs in plants. We used highly consistent base sequences in the exon-overlapping region between trans-lncRNAs and their target gene transcripts. Based on this method, we successfully screened 24 ECT-lncRNA pairs from at least two or more plant species. In tea, as observed in model plants such as Arabidopsis, alfalfa, potatoes, and rice, there exists a trans-lncRNA capable of forming an ECT-lncRNA pair with transcripts of the 12-oxophytodienoate reductase (OPR) family, denoted as the OPRL/OPR pair. Considering evolutionary perspectives, the OPRL gene cluster in each species likely originates from a replication event of the OPR gene cluster. Gene manipulation and gene expression analysis revealed that CsOPRL influences disease resistance by regulating CsOPR expression in tea plants. Furthermore, the knockout of StOPRL1 in Solanum tuberosum led to aberrant growth characteristics and strong resistance to fungal infection. This study provides insights into a strategy for the screening and functional verification of ECT-lncRNA pairs.

However, the precise causal impact of peripheral inflammatory cytokines on changes in brain iron content remains uncertain.MethodsThe study utilized an available genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary associated with inflammatory cytokines from The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study and the FINRISK surveys. The GWAS data for brain iron markers were obtained from the UK Biobank. We assessed the iron content of each brain region using susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, utilizing both quantitative susceptibility mapping and T2* measurements. The primary outcomes were susceptibility (chi) and T2*, which serve as indices of iron deposition. To investigate the causal relationship between exposure and outcome, we primarily employed inverse variance weighting, MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods, collectively enhancing the robustness of our results.ResultsThe results of MR analyses demonstrate that our study unveiled that nerve growth factor-beta, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were associated with elevated brain iron content in the regions of left hippocampus, putamen, left thalamus, right pallidum, right hippocampus, left amygdala, respectively. Furthermore, our investigation provides evidence for a negative relationship between IL-1, IL-17, monocyte chemotactic protein-3, tumor necrosis factor-beta, and brain iron content in distinct regions.ConclusionsOur findings suggest a causal association between circulating inflammatory cytokines and brain iron deposition across various brain regions. This provides new insights into the immunopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and potential preventive strategies targeting iron metabolism.

AB  - BackgroundTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a prevalent neurological disorder, is associated with hippocampal oxidative stress and inflammation. A recent study reveals that the long noncoding RNA ILF3 divergent transcript (ILF3-AS1) level is elevated in the hippocampus of TLE patients; however, the functional roles of ILF3-AS1 in TLE and underlying mechanisms deserve further investigation. Hence, this study aimed to elucidate whether ILF3-AS1 is involved in the pathogenesis of TLE by regulating oxidative stress and inflammation and to explore its underlying mechanism in vitro.MethodsHuman hippocampal neurons were subjected to a magnesium-free (Mg2+-free) solution to establish an in vitro model of TLE. The potential binding sites between ILF3-AS1 and miRNA were predicted by TargetScan/Starbase and confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell viability and damage were assessed by cell counting kit-8 and lactate dehydrogenase assay kits, respectively. Levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase were determined by commercial kits. Levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of gene and protein were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis.ResultsIn Mg2+-free-treated hippocampal neurons, both ILF3-AS1 and HMGB1 were highly up-regulated, whereas miR-504-3p was down-regulated. ILF3-AS1 knockdown ameliorated Mg2+-free-induced cellular damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-504-3p was a target of ILF3-AS1 and was negatively regulated by ILF3-AS1. MiR-504-3p inhibitor blocked the protection of ILF3-AS1 knockdown against Mg2+-free-induced neuronal injury. Further analysis presented that ILF3-AS1 regulated HMGB1 expression by sponging miR-504-3p. Moreover, HMGB1 overexpression reversed the protective functions of ILF3-AS1 knockdown.ConclusionOur findings indicate that ILF3-AS1 contributes to Mg2+-free-induced hippocampal neuron injuries, oxidative stress, and inflammation by targeting the miR-504-3p/HMGB1 axis. These results provide a novel mechanistic understanding of ILF3-AS1 in TLE and suggest potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of epilepsy.
   Our findings indicate that ILF3-AS1 contributes to hippocampal neuron injuries following temporal lobe epilepsy by inhibiting neuronal oxidative stress and inflammation through the miR-504-3p/HMGB1 pathway in vitro. image

AB  - Learning to discriminate between environmental visual stimuli is essential to make right decisions and guide appropriate behaviors. Moreover, impairments in visual discrimination learning are observed in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Visual discrimination learning requires perception and memory processing, in which the hippocampus critically involved. To understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning hippocampus function in visual discrimination learning, we examined the hippocampal gene expression profiles of Sprague-Dawley rats with different cognitive performance (high cognition group vs. low cognition group) in the modified visual discrimination learning task, using high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. Compared with the low cognition group, bioinformatics analysis indicated that 319 genes were differentially expressed in the high cognition group with statistical significance, of which 253 genes were down-regulated and 66 genes were upregulated. The functional enrichment analysis showed that protein translation and energy metabolism were up-regulated pathways, while transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway, bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway, apoptosis, inflammation response, transport, and glycosaminoglycan metabolism were down-regulated pathways, which were related to good cognitive performance in the visual discrimination learning task. Taken together, our finding reveals the differential gene expression and enrichment biological pathways related to cognitive performance differences in visual discrimination learning of rats, which provides us direct insight into the molecular mechanisms of hippocampus function in visual discrimination learning and may contribute to developing potential treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders accompanied with cognitive impairments.

AB  - Genetic studies in humans have implicated the gene encoding neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) as a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Furthermore, it has been suggested that NRG-1 is involved in regulating the expression and function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the GABA(A) receptor in several brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Neonatal ventral hippocampal lesioned (NVHL) rats have been considered as a putative model for schizophrenia with characteristic post-pubertal alteration in response to stress and neuroleptics. In this study, we examined NRG-1, erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (erbB4), and phospho-erbB4 (p-erbB4) levels in the PFC and the distribution of NRG-1 in the NVHL rats by using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses. Neonatal lesions were induced by bilateral injection of ibotenic acid in the ventral hippocampus of postnatal day 7 Sprague-Dawley (SD)-rats. NVHL rats showed significantly decreased levels of NRG-1 and p-erbB4 in the PFC compared to sham controls at post-pubertal period, while the level of erbB4 did not differ between sham and NVHL rats. Moreover, microinjection of NRG-1 into the mPFC improved NVHL-induced prepulse inhibition deficits. Our study suggests PFC NRG-1 alteration as a potential mechanism in schizophrenia-like behaviors in the NVHL model.

AB  - Activation of cortical serotonin 5-HT1A receptors may be a promising strategy to achieve rapid-acting antide-pressant (RAAD) activity. NLX-204 is a selective 5-HT1A receptor biased agonist that, in naive mice, robustly decreases immobility in the forced swim test (FST), and preferentially phosphorylates extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK1/2), involved in antidepressant activity. Here, we evaluated the properties of NLX-204 in two mouse models of depression. Male CD-1 mice were subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) for 4-weeks or to repeated corticosterone (CORT, 20 mg/kg s.c./day) for 3-weeks before receiving acute administration of NLX-204 (2 mg/kg, p.o.). Depressive-like behavior was assessed in the FST, anhedonia-like behavior in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and locomotor activity was also recorded. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and cAMP response binding element (pCREB) were measured ex vivo in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). UCMS or CORT treatment increased immobility in the FST, elicited a sucrose preference deficit, and decreased pERK1/2 and pCREB levels in PFC and hippocampus. NLX-204 reduced depressive-like behavior in the FST in CORT and UCMS mice, and normalized sucrose preference in CORT mice, suggesting anti-anhedonic activity. NLX-204 increased pERK1/2 levels in PFC of UCMS mice. NLX-204 also increased pCREB levels in PFC of CORT mice. These data suggest that NLX-204 has RAAD-like properties not only in naive mice, but also in mice in a "depressive-like" state, and that these involve changes in PFC and hippocampal pERK1/2 and pCREB levels. These data provide additional evidence that activation of 5-HT1A receptors by selective biased agonists, such as NLX-204, may constitute a promising RAAD strategy.

AB  - Numerous clinical and animal studies have found that antenatal chronic stress can lead to pathological changes the hippocampal development from embryos to adult, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Proteomic analyses provide a new insight to explore the potential mechanisms of this impairment. In this study, gestating rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) during pregnant days using nine different stimulations, and the changes of the learning and memory performance and the expression of proteins in the hippocampus of offspring were measured. It was found that prenatal chronic stress led to growth retardation, impaired spatial learning and memory ability in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal stress caused various de-grees of damage to neurons, Nissl body, mitochondria and synaptic structures in hippocampal CA3 region of offspring. In addition, 26 significantly different expressed proteins (DEPs) were found between the two groups by using isoquantitative tag-based relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomics analysis. Further ana-lyses of these DEPs showed that involved with different molecular functions and several biological processes, such as biological regulation and metabolic processes. Among these, the KEGG pathway enrichment showed that learning and memory impairment was mainly associated with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate protein ki-nase G (cGMP-PKG) pathway. At the same time, compared with OPC group, the NO, nNOS and cGMP level were significantly decreased, and the expression of PKG protein was also dropped. All of these results suggested that pregnant rats exposed to chronic psychological stress might impair spatial learning and memory ability of offspring, by disturbing the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway.

AB  - Dopamine is a key factor in the enablement of cognition and hippocampal information processing. Its action in the hippocampus is mediated by D1/D5 and D2-like (D2, D3, D4) receptors. While D1/D5-receptors are well recognized as strong modulators of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and information storage, much less is known about the role of D2-like receptors (D2R) in these processes. Here, we explored to what extent D2R contribute to synaptic plasticity and cumulative spatial memory derived from semantic and episodic-like information storage. In freely behaving adult rats, we also assessed to what extent short and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity are influenced by pharmacological activation or blockade of D2R. Antagonism of D2R by means of intracerebral treatment with remoxipride, completely prevented the expression of both short-term (<1 h) and long-term potentiation (>4 h), as well as the expression of short-term depression (STD, <1 h) in the hippocampal CA1 region. Scrutiny of involvement of D2R in spatial learning revealed that D2R-antagonism prevented retention of a semantic spatial memory task, and also significantly impaired retention of recent spatiotemporal aspects of an episodic-like memory task. Taken together, these findings indicate that D2R are required for bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, they are critically involved in enabling cumulative and episodic-like forms of spatial learning.

AB  - Estimating the time since death (post mortem interval, PMI) represents one of the most important tasks in daily forensic casework. For decades, forensic scientists have investigated changes in post mortem body composition, focusing on different physical, chemical, or biological aspects, to discover a reliable method for estimating PMI; nevertheless, all of these attempts remain unsuccessful considering the currently available methodical spectrum characterized by great inaccuracies and limitations. However, recent promising approaches focus on the post mortem decomposition of biomolecules. In particular, significant advances have been made in research on the post mortem degradation of proteins. In the present study, we investigated early post mortem changes (during the first 24 h) in the proteome profile of the pig skeletal muscle looking for new PMI specific biomarkers. By mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we were able to identify a total of nine potential PMI biomarkers, whose quantity changed constantly and progressively over time, directly or inversely proportional to the advancement of post mortem hours. Our preliminary study underlines the importance of the proteomic approach in the search for a reliable method for PMI determination and highlights the need to characterize a large number of reliable marker proteins useful in forensic practice for PMI estimation.

AB  - The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is an associative neocortical region that integrates multiple streams of information and is implicated in spatial cognition and decision making. In some cases, however, the PPC is not required for these functions. One possibility is that the PPC is recruited when spatial complexity is high. Yet, few studies of PPC function have explicitly manipulated environmental complexity, complexity of spatial changes, or the temporal structure of spatial tasks. To examine whether task complexity recruits PPC function, we tested rats with neurotoxic damage to the dorsal PPC on a series of tasks varying in spatial and temporal complexity. Recognition memory was first assessed in standard exploration tasks, including object recognition, object location, and object in place, as well as a more complex object task in which spatial changes occurred across multiple delays. Spatial navigation was assessed in the circular hole board maze (Barnes maze), and temporal processing was assessed in a temporal order task. PPC damage spared performance on standard recognition memory tasks but caused deficits on tasks involving changes in object configuration or multiple changes across time. PPC damage spared acquisition on the Barnes maze but impaired retention and decreased efficiency of search strategies. PPC damage did not impact temporal order memory. Overall, these results suggest that the PPC is necessary when spatial complexity of the task increases attentional and long-term memory demands.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's ' s disease (AD) is linked to the accumulation of A beta, beta , increased tau hyperphosphorylation, persistent neuroinflammation, and a decline in neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Oxytocin (OT) has a significant impact on memory and learning. We examined the influence of intranasal (IN) OT on synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, histone acetylation, and spatial and cognitive memories in rats. Methods: A beta 25-35 (5 mu g/2.5 mu l) was administered bilaterally in the CA1 of male Wistar rats for four consecutive days. After seven days of recovery, OT (2 mu g/ mu l, 10 mu l in each nostril) was administered IN for seven consecutive days. Working, spatial, and cognitive memories, and gene expression of neurogenesis- and synaptic plasticity- involved factors were measured in the hippocampus. Histone acetylation (H3K9 and H4K8) was also measured using western blotting. Results: IN administration of OT significantly improved working and spatial memory impairment induced by A beta beta and increased the factors involved in synaptic plasticity (MeCP2, REST, synaptophysin, and BDNF) and neurogenesis (Ki67 and DCX). We also found an enhancement in the levels of H3K9ac and H4K8ac following OT administration. Conclusion: These findings indicated that IN OT could improve hippocampus-related behaviors by increasing synaptic plasticity, stimulating neurogenesis, and chromatin plasticity.

AB  - Episodic memory depends on the recollection of spatial and temporal aspects of past experiences in which the hippocampus plays a critical role. Studies on hippocampal lesions in rodents have shown that dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 are necessary to detect object displacement in memory tasks. However, the understanding of real-time oscillatory activity underlying memory discrimination of subtle and pronounced displacements remains elusive. Here, we chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in adult male Wistar rats to record network oscillations from DG, CA3, and CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus while animals executed an object recognition task of high and low spatial displacement tests (HD: 108 cm, and LD: 54 cm, respectively). Behavioral analysis showed that the animals discriminate between stationary and displaced objects in the HD but not LD conditions. To investigate the hypothesis that theta and gamma oscillations in different areas of the hippocampus support discrimination processes in a recognition memory task, we compared epochs of object exploration between HD and LD conditions as well as displaced and stationary objects. We observed that object exploration epochs were accompanied by strong rhythmic activity in the theta frequency (6-12 Hz) band in the three hippocampal areas. Comparison between test conditions revealed higher theta band power and higher theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the DG during HD than LD conditions. Similarly, direct comparison between displaced and stationary objects within the HD test showed higher theta band power in CA3 during exploration of displaced objects. Moreover, the discrimination index between displaced and stationary objects directly correlated with CA1 gamma band power in epochs of object exploration. We thus conclude that theta and gamma oscillations in the dorsal hippocampus support the successful discrimination of object displacement in a recognition memory task.

AB  - Introduction Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric illness with alarming mortality rates. Nevertheless, despite former and recent research results, the etiology of AN is still poorly understood. Of particular interest is that, despite exaggerated response control and increased perfectionism scores, patients with AN seem not to perform better that those unaffected in tasks that require inhibitory control. One reason might be aberrant processing of errors. The objective of our study was thus to obtain further insight into the pathopsychology of AN. We were particularly interested in neuronal and autonomic responses during error processing and their association with behavior. Methods We analyzed 16 acute patients suffering from restrictive type AN and 21 healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous physiological recordings during a Go/Nogo response inhibition task. Data were corrected for noise due to cardiac and respiratory influence. Results Patients and controls had similarly successful response inhibition in Nogo trials. However, in failed Nogo trials, controls had significantly greater skin conductance responses (SCR) than in correct Nogo trials. Patients did not exhibit elevated SCR to errors. Furthermore, we found significantly increased neuronal responses, especially in the amygdala and hippocampus, in controls compared to patients during error trials. We also found significant positive correlations in controls but not in patients between Nogo performance and activation in the salience network core regions after errors. Conclusion Acute restrictive type AN patients seem to lack neuronal and autonomic responses to errors that might impede a flexible behavior adaption.

AB  - The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is a complex area that is uniquely embedded across the core feeding, reward, arousal, and stress circuits. The PVT role in the control of feeding behavior is discussed here within a framework of adaptive behavioral guidance based on the body's energy state and competing drives. The survival of an organism depends on bodily energy resources and promotion of feeding over other behaviors is adaptive except when in danger or sated. The PVT is structurally set up to respond to homeostatic and hedonic needs to feed, and to integrate those signals with physiological and environmental stress, as well as anticipatory needs and other cognitive inputs. It can regulate both food foraging (seeking) and consumption and may balance their expression. The PVT is proposed to accomplish these functions through a network of connections with the brainstem, hypothalamic, striatal, and cortical areas. The connectivity of the PVT further indicates that it could broadcast the information about energy use/gain and behavioral choice to impact cognitive processes-learning, memory, and decision-making-through connections with the medial and lateral prefrontal cortical areas, the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala. The PVT is structurally complex and recent evidence for specific PVT pathways in different aspects of feeding behavior will be discussed.

AB  - Histone H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B (also known as Jumonji domain-containing protein D3, JMJD3) plays vital roles in the etiology of inflammatory responses; however, little is known about the role of KDM6B in neuroinflammation-induced anxiety-like behavior. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of KDM6B in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anxiety-like behavior and to evaluate whether it is associated with the modulation of vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4). The elevated plus maze, light-dark box, and openfield test were performed to test the anxiety-like behavior induced by LPS in C57BL/6 J male mice. Levels of relative protein expression in the hippocampus were quantified by western blotting. KDM6B inhibitor GSK-J4 and microglia inhibitor minocycline as well as adeno-associated virus of Vgll4 shRNA were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. We found that KDM6B, VGLL4, interleukin-113 (IL-113), and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1, microglia marker) protein levels were increased in LPS-dose dependent manner in the hippocampus but not in prefrontal cortex. GSK-J4 treatment attenuated LPS-induced VGLL4, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), IL-113 and Iba-1 upregulation and anxiety-like behavior. Knockdown VGLL4 with Vgll4 shRNA prevented the increase of anxiety-like behavior and levels of STAT3, IL-113, and Iba-1 expression in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. Moreover, minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia treatment blunted LPS-induced anxiety-like behavior. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the induction of neuroinflammation by LPS promotes KDM6B activation in the hippocampus, and LPS-induced anxiety-like behavior is associated with upregulation of VGLL4 by KDM6B in the hippocampus.

AB  - Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD) manifests predominantly as cognitive impairment and brain atrophy with the hippocampus showing particular vulnerability. Fasudil, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, has established neuroprotective properties; however, its impact on alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal structural damage remains unelucidated. This study probes Fasudil's neuroprotective potential and identifies its mechanism of action in an in vivo context. Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to 30% (v/v, 6.0 g/kg) ethanol by intragastric administration for four weeks. Concurrently, these mice received a co-treatment with Fasudil through intraperitoneal injections at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day. Fasudil was found to mitigate alcohol-induced spatial and recognition memory deficits, which were quantified using Y maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. Concurrently, Fasudil attenuated hippocampal structural damage prompted by chronic alcohol exposure. Notably, Fasudil moderated alcohol-induced disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules-mechanisms central to the maintenance of hippocampal synaptic integrity. Collectively, our findings indicate that Fasudil partially reverses alcohol-induced cognitive and morphological detriments by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for ARBD.

AB  - Objectives: To characterize a profile for patients with tumor-related epilepsy presenting olfactory auras. Materials and Methods: We conducted a monocentric, retrospective study on patients who underwent surgery in the Neurosurgery Unit of Udine University Hospital (Udine, Italy), between the 1st of January 2010 and the 1st of January 2019, for primary brain tumors (PBTs) involving the temporal lobe and the insula. All patients were affected by tumor-related epilepsy; the study group presented olfactory auras as well. We collected neuroradiological, neuropsychological and neurophysiological data from patients' medical charts. Results: The subtraction analysis of MRI data shows maximum lesion overlay in left olfactory cortex, left and right hippocampus, left amygdala, right rolandic operculum, right inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus. The presence of olfactory auras did not influence seizure outcome (p = 0.500) or tumor recurrence after surgery (p = 0.185). The type of auras (elementary vs. complex), also, did not influence seizure control (p = 0.222). Discussion: In presence of olfactory auras, anterior and mesial temporal regions are mainly involved, such as olfactory cortex, amygdala, and anterior hippocampus, together with right rolandic operculum, right inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus, suggesting their possible role in the genesis of olfactory auras. Post-surgical seizure outcome and disease relapse are not influenced by neither the presence nor the type of olfactory auras. Conclusions: Olfactory auras are rare event, however they may be often underestimated by the patients and under-investigated by the clinicians, even when their occurrence can represent a useful localizing tool.

AB  - This manuscript reviews several key observations from the research program of Professor John P. Bruno that are believed to have significantly advanced our understanding of the brain's mediation of behavior. This review focuses on findings within several important research areas in behavioral neuroscience, including a) age-dependent neurobehavioral plasticity following brain damage; b) the role of the cortical cholinergic system in attentional processing and cognitive flexibility; and c) the design and validation of animal models of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. In selecting these observations, emphasis was given to examples in which the heuristic potency was increased by maximizing the resolution and microanalysis of behavioral assays in the same fashion as one typically refines neuronal manipulations. Professor Bruno served the International Behavioral Neurosci-ence Society (IBNS) as an IBNS Fellow (1995-present) and President of the IBNS (2001-02).

AB  - Background Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for cognitive impairment, brain atrophy, and dementia. However, the relationship of other types of hypertensions, such as isolated hypertension on brain health and its comparison to systolic-diastolic hypertension (where systolic and diastolic measures are high), is still relatively unknown. Due to its increased prevalence, it is important to investigate the impact of isolated hypertension to help understand its potential impact on cognitive decline and future dementia risk. In this study, we compared a variety of global brain measures between participants with isolated hypertension to those with normal blood pressure (BP) or systolic-diastolic hypertension using the largest cohort of healthy individuals. Methods Using the UK Biobank cohort, we carried out a cross-sectional study using 29,775 participants (mean age 63 years, 53% female) with BP measurements and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We used linear regression models adjusted for multiple confounders to compare a variety of global, subcortical, and white matter brain measures. We compared participants with either isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension with normotensives and then with participants with systolic-diastolic hypertension. Results The results showed that participants with isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension taking BP medications had smaller gray matter but larger white matter microstructures and macrostructures compared to normotensives. Isolated systolic hypertensives had larger total gray matter and smaller white matter traits when comparing these regions with participants with systolic-diastolic hypertension. Conclusions These results provide support to investigate possible preventative strategies that target isolated hypertension as well as systolic-diastolic hypertension to maintain brain health and/or reduce dementia risk earlier in life particularly in white matter regions.

AB  - Dominance hierarchies typically emerge in systems where group members regularly encounter and compete for resources. In birds, the 'open' and dynamic structure of foraging groups may prevent the emergence of structured hierarchies, although this assumption have hardly been tested. We report on agonistic data for ravens Corvus corax, collected over two 18-month periods for 183 marked individuals of a wild (fluid) population and 51 birds from six captive (stable) groups. We show that the dominance structure (steep and transitive) in wild foraging groups is strikingly similar to that found in captivity. In the wild, we found that higher ranks are mainly occupied by males, older and more aggressive individuals that also tend to receive fewer aggressions. Exploring the mechanisms sustaining the wild dominance structure, we confirmed that males are more aggressive than females and, with age, tend to receive fewer aggressions than females. Males that are about to leave the foraging groups for some months are less aggressive than newcomers or locals, while newcomers are specifically targeted by aggressions in their first year (as juveniles). Taken together, our results indicate that the socially dynamic conditions ravens face during foraging do not hinder, but provide opportunities for, using (advanced) social cognition. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'.

AB  - Simple Summary Most U.S. beef calves are finished on grain-based rations, but a small proportion are finished on grass-dominated pastures. A number of temperate perennial legumes thrive when cultivated under irrigation in the U.S. Mountain West, including alfalfa, sainfoin, birdsfoot trefoil and cicer milkvetch. With the exception of alfalfa, these are non-bloating legumes, and all have fiber and non-fiber carbohydrate concentrations more similar to feedlot rations than to grass. This 3-year study was undertaken to compare the average daily gain of steer calves on monoculture legume pastures to the gain of calves on concentrate diets; in the final year, a grass pasture treatment was added. Gains of calves on birdsfoot trefoil pastures were two-thirds to three-quarters that of concentrate-fed calves; gains on cicer milkvetch pastures were about half that of concentrate-fed calves, and gains on grass pasture were about one-third that of concentrate-fed calves. The elevated gains of birdsfoot trefoil-fed calves compared with grass-fed calves were likely due to greater intake combined with the presence of a condensed tannin that precipitates excess plant protein in the rumen but does not interfere with post-ruminal digestion. Perennial legume pastures are a sustainable alternative to feedlot finishing for western U.S. beef producers. Fall- or spring-born steers grazed monoculture irrigated birdsfoot trefoil (BFT; Lotus corniculatus L.) or cicer milkvetch (CMV; Astragalus cicer L.) pastures for approximately 12 weeks for 3 years and were compared with steers on concentrate diets. In the 3rd year, an irrigated meadow bromegrass (MBG; Bromus biebersteinii Roem. and Schult.) pasture treatment was added for further comparison. Steer average daily gain (ADG) was 1.31, 0.94, 0.83 and 0.69 kg d(-1) on concentrate, 'Norcen' BFT, 'Oberhaunstadter' BFT, and 'Monarch' CMV diets, respectively; ADG on grass pastures was 0.43 kg d(-1). The ADG on the concentrate diet was greater than ADG on legume or grass pastures, ADG was greater on BFT than CMV in every year (p < 0.03), and ADG on BFT was greater than ADG on grass (p < 0.03). The rate constant of gas production of an in vitro rumen fermentation demonstrated a slower rate of microbial digestion for CMV than for BFT. The elevated ADG on BFT pastures may be due to greater non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) concentration and reduced neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration combined with condensed tannins that protect proteins in the rumen but do not impede protein digestion in the abomasum and intestines.

AB  - Carbonyl sulfide ( COS ), a trace gas in our atmosphere that leads to the formation of aerosols in the stratosphere, is largely taken up by terrestrial ecosystems. Quantifying the biosphere uptake of COS could provide a useful quantity to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). Some COS sources and sinks still contain large uncertainties, and several top-down estimates of the COS budget point to an underestimation of sources, especially in the tropics. We extended the inverse model TM5-4DVAR to assimilate Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) satellite data, in addition to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) surface data as used in a previous study. To resolve possible discrepancies among the two observational data sets, a bias correction scheme is necessary and implemented. A set of inversions is presented that explores the influence of the different measurement streams and the settings of the prior fluxes. To evaluate the performance of the inverse system, the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) aircraft observations and NOAA airborne profiles are used. All inversions reduce the COS biosphere uptake from a prior value of 1053 GgS a - 1 to much smaller values, depending on the inversion settings. These large adjustments of the biosphere uptake often turn parts of Amazonia into a COS source. Only inversions that exclusively use MIPAS observations, or strongly reduce the prior errors on the biosphere flux, maintain the Amazon as a COS sink. Inclusion of MIPAS data in the inversion leads to a better separation of land and ocean fluxes. Over the Amazon, these inversions reduce the biosphere uptake from roughly 300 to 100 GgS a - 1 , indicating a strongly overestimated prior uptake in this region. Although a recent study also reported reduced COS uptake over the Amazon, we emphasise that a careful construction of prior fluxes and their associated errors remains important. For instance, an inversion that gives large freedom to adjust the anthropogenic and ocean fluxes of CS 2 , an important COS precursor, also closes the budget satisfactorily with much smaller adjustments to the biosphere. We achieved better characterisation of biosphere prior and uncertainty, better characterisation of combined ocean and land fluxes, and better constraint of both by combining surface and satellite observations. We recommend more COS observations to characterise biosphere and ocean fluxes, especially over the data-poor tropics.

AB  - Metamizole (dipyrone) is still a frequently used drug in human and veterinary medicine, especially for pain relief, sometimes also in osteosarcoma treatment. It has a very strong analgesic and antipyretic effect and weaker anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, it has spasmolytic properties. It is used in many species, including dogs, cats, pigs, cattle, horses, and humans, in Europe, Canada, and South America. The aim of this study was to assess a potential synergism of metamizole as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with routinely used cytostatics (cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, and etoposide). In vitro studies were performed on a canine osteosarcoma D-17 cell line and a human U-2 OS cell line. We used the MTT method to assess cell viability, TUNEL staining to assess proapoptotic effects, and propidium iodide to analyse the cell cycle (potential arrest). The obtained results showed that metamizole at 50 mu g/mL has potential cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effects. Metamizole administered simultaneously with cytostatic drugs reduced their cytotoxic effect, which may suggest that such a combination of drugs used in the treatment of osteosarcoma may significantly reduce therapy effectiveness.

AB  - Heat stress causes many pathophysiological responses in the brain, including neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. p-Hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of BHBA on neuroinflammation induced by heat stress, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Mice were pretreated with vehicle. BHBA or minocycline (positive control group) and followed by heat exposure (43 degrees C) for 15 min for 14 days. In mice subjected to heat stress, we found that treatment with BHBA or minocycline significantly decreased the level of serum cortisol, the expressions of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and the density of c-Fos(+) cells in the hippocampus. Surprisingly, the ethological tests revealed that heat stress led to cognitive dysfunctions and could be alleviated by BHBA and minocycline administration. Further investigation showed that BHBA and minocycline significantly attenuated the activation of microglia and astrocyte induced by heat stress. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated in the hippocampus by BHBA and minocycline treatment. Importantly, compared with the heat stress group, mice in the BHBA treatment group and positive control group experienced a decrease in the expressions of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phospho-p38 (p-p38), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Our results elucidated that BHBA inhibits neuroinflammation induced by heat stress by suppressing the activation of microglia and astrocyte, and modulating TLR4/p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B pathways. This study provides new evidence that BHBA is a potential strategy for protecting animals from heat stress.

AB  - Background Working memory capacity (WMC) is the ability to maintain information over a few seconds. Although it has been extensively studied in healthy subjects and neuropsychiatric patients, few tasks have been developed to measure such changes in rodents. Many procedures have been used to measure WM in rodents, including the radial arm maze, the WM version of the Morris swimming task, and various delayed matching and nonmatching-to-sample tasks. It should be noted, however, that the memory components assessed in these procedures do not include memory capacity. Methods We developed an olfactory working memory capacity (OWMC) paradigm to assess the WMC of 3-month-old 5xFAD mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The task is divided into five phases: context adaptation, digging training, rule learning for nonmatching to a single sample odor (NMSS), rule learning for nonmatching to multiple sample odors (NMMS), and capacity testing. Results In the NMSS rule-learning phase, there was no difference between wild-type (WT) mice and 5xFAD mice in the performance correct rate, correct option rate, and correct rejection rate. The WT mice and 5xFAD mice showed similar memory capacity in the NMMS rule-learning phase. After capacity test, we found that the WMC was significantly diminished in 5xFAD mice. As the memory load increased, 5xFAD mice also made significantly more errors than WT mice. Conclusion The OWMC task, based on a nonmatch-to-sample rule, is a sensitive and robust behavioral assay that we validated as a reliable method for measuring WMC and exploring different components of memory in mice.

AB  - ABSTR A C T Dopaminergic neurons projecting from the Substantia Nigra to the Striatum play a critical role in motor functions while dopaminergic neurons originating in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and projecting to the Nucleus Accumbens, Hippocampus and other cortical structures regulate rewarding learning. While VTA mainly consists of dopaminergic neurons, excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) VTA-neurons have also been described: these neurons may also modulate and contribute to shape the final dopaminergic response, which is critical for memory formation. However, given the large amount of information that is handled daily by our brain, it is essential that irrelevant information be deleted. Recently, apart from the well-established role of dopamine (DA) in learning, it has been shown that DA plays a critical role in the intrinsic active forgetting mechanisms that control storage information, contributing to the deletion of a consolidated memory. These new insights may be instrumental to identify therapies for those disorders that involve memory alterations.

AB  - Currently, multidrug-resistant bacteria are rapidly increasing worldwide because of the misuse or overuse of antibiotics. In particular, few options exist for treating infections caused by long-persisting oxacillin-resistant strains and recently proliferating carbapenem-resistant strains. Therefore, alternative treatments are urgently needed. The antimicrobial peptide (AMP) Lycosin-II is a peptide consisting of 21 amino acids isolated from the venom of the spider Lycosa singoriensis. Lycosin-II showed strong antibacterial activity and biofilm inhibition effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolated from patients. In addition, Lycosin-II was not cytotoxic against human foreskin fibroblast Hs27 or hemolytic against sheep red blood cells at the concentration of which exerted antibacterial activity. The mechanism of action of Lycosin-II involves binding to lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes, respectively, to destroy the bacterial membrane. Moreover, Lycosin-II showed anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are increased during bacterial infection in Hs27 cells. These results suggest that Lycosin-II can serve as a therapeutic agent against infections with multidrug-resistant strains.

AB  - Synaptic dysfunction is an early feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and a major morphological correlate of memory deficits. Given the main synaptic location of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), their dysregulation has been implicated in these pathological effects. Here, to detect possible alterations in the expression and synaptic localisation of the GluN1 subunit in the brain of amyloidogenic APP/PS1 mice, we employed histoblot and SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labelling (SDS-FRL) techniques. Histoblots showed that GluN1 expression was significantly reduced in the hippocampus in a layer-dependent manner, in the cortex and the caudate putamen of APP/PS1 transgenic mice at 12 months of age but was unaltered at 1 and 6 months. Using quantitative SDS-FRL, we unravelled the molecular organisation of GluN1 in seven excitatory synapse populations at a high spatial resolution in the CA1 and CA3 fields and the DG of the hippocampus in 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice. In the CA1 field, the labelling density for GluN1 in the excitatory synapses established on spines and interneurons, was significantly reduced in APP/PS1 mice compared to age-matched wild-type mice in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare but unaltered in the stratum radiatum. In the CA3 field, synaptic GluN1 was reduced in mossy fibre-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses but unaltered in the A/C-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. In the DG, the density of GluN1 in granule cell-perforant pathway synapses was reduced in APP/PS1 mice. Altogether, our findings provide evidence of specific alterations of synaptic GluN1 in the trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus in A beta pathology. This differential vulnerability in the disruption of NMDARs may be involved in the mechanisms causing abnormal network activity of the hippocampal circuit and cognitive impairment characteristic of APP/PS1 mice.

AB  - While PTSD continues to be researched in great depth, less attention has been given to the continuum of traumatic responses that resides outside this diagnosis. This investigation begins with a literature review examining the spectrum of responses through the lens of the default mode network (DMN). To build upon this literature, a systematic exploratory study was incorporated, examining DMN-related neuropsychological functioning of 27 participants (16 trauma-exposed, and 11 non-trauma-exposed), with a subset (15 participants) completing neuroimaging. This study revealed that in comparison to the control group, the trauma-exposed group had reductions in their capacity for self-referential processing, social cognition, autobiographical recall, prospection, and increased mind-wandering. While correlations were encountered between cognitive findings and brain volume, comparative volumetric findings between trauma-exposed and non-t rauma exposed were insignificant. This suggests that the conservation of DMN structural integrity may play a role in resilience, supporting the existing theory that reduced hippocampal volume may be a pre-existing vulnerability to PTSD rather than a consequence and that reductions in DMN related cognition are functionally mediated.

AB  - Introduction Depressive-like behavior has been shown to be associated with liver damage. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of three different models of depression on the behavior of mice with liver injury.Methods During the 4 weeks of methionine/choline deficiency diet (MCD), adult C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: MCD (no stress protocol, n = 6), chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS, n = 9), acute and repeated forced swim stress [aFSS (n = 9) and rFSS (n = 9)].Results All depression protocols induced increased anhedonia and anxiety-like behavior compared to baseline and had no impact on the severity of liver damage, according to ultrasonography. However, different protocols evoked different overall behavior patterns. After the depressive-like behavior induction protocols, animals subjected to aFSS did not exhibit anxiety-like behavior differences compared to MCD animals, while mice subjected to CUMS showed additional weight loss compared to FSS animals. All tested protocols for inducing depressive-like behavior decreased the short-term memory of mice with liver damage, as assessed by the novel object recognition test (NORT).Discussion Our results show that the use of all protocols seems to generate different levels of anxiety-like behavior, but only the depressive-like behavior induction procedures associate additional anhedonia and memory impairment in mice with liver injury.

AB  - Improved understanding of the neurophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms underlying schizophrenia is essential for the identification of biological markers and developing new therapeutic targets. The development of behaviorally faithful, predictive animal models is crucial to this endeavor. We have developed a novel two-hit paradigm designed to recapitulate in rodents the developmental process leading to appearance of human schizophrenia symptomatology. The model pairs neonatal administration of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) openchannel blocker phencyclidine (PCP 10 mg/kg) to male rats at 7, 9 and 11 days of age, with later adolescent exposure (34 days of age) to a single prolonged stress paradigm consisting of 2 h restraint, followed by 20 min of forced swimming. Four experimental groups were examined: vehicle and no stress (VEH-NS), vehicle plus stress (VEH-S), PCP and no stress (PCP-NS), and PCP plus stress (PCP-S). Only pairing of neonatal PCP with single prolonged adolescent stress caused deficits in novel object recognition memory and increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze task, without altering locomotor activity. In a separate cohort of animals, the PCP-S group showed significant reduction in magnitude of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses following a single pair of theta-burst stimuli (TBS), while LTP was diminished in both PCP treated groups when elicited by a second pair of TBS. These results suggest that the combination of neonatal PCP and acute adolescent stress are necessary for lasting cognitive impairment and anxiety-like phenotype, and that these behavioral impairments may be due to deficits in LTP in hippocampus, and perhaps elsewhere in the brain.

AB  - BackgroundNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammatory assaults on the central nervous system (CNS), particularly on the optic nerves and spinal cord. In recent years, a wider range of clinical manifestations of this complex disease have been observed, emphasizing the importance of gaining a more profound understanding beyond optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis (TM).Current knowledgeThis study explores the many clinical symptoms of NMOSD, including common and uncommon presentations. Distinctive aspects of ON, TM, and diencephalic/brainstem syndromes are examined, highlighting their unique characteristics in contrast to conditions such as multiple sclerosis. We also discuss extra-CNS involvement, such as unusual signs, including muscle involvement, retinal injury, auditory impairment, and rhinological symptoms.Aims and objectivesOur study intends to highlight the wide range and complexity of NMOSD presentations, emphasizing the significance of identifying unusual symptoms for precise diagnosis and prompt management. The specific processes that contribute to the varied clinical presentation of NMOSD are not well understood despite existing information. This emphasizes the necessity for more study to clarify the mechanisms that cause different symptoms and discover new treatment targets for this complex autoimmune disorder.ConclusionIt is essential to acknowledge the complex and varied clinical manifestations of NMOSD to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and patient results. By enhancing our comprehension of the fundamental processes and investigating innovative therapeutic approaches, we may aim to enhance the quality of life for persons impacted by this illness.
   This study examines the diverse clinical presentations of NMOSD, contrasting them with multiple sclerosis, and includes extra-CNS symptoms like muscle, retinal, auditory, and rhinological issues. Recognizing these varied symptoms is crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment, highlighting the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and discover new therapeutic targets. image

The Bio Concentrate Assets (R) (ABC) method is a method of enriching organic infusion leaves (from Camellia sinensis) with organic dry and concentrated extracts using organic acacia gum, and its application to white tea has provided Qi cha tea (R). In the present study, the content of tea polyphenols and caffeine, and the biochemical properties of Qi cha tea (R) and its botanical constituents (elderberry, tulsi, Echinacea purpurea, orange peel, lemongrass, and acacia gum) were assessed. Antioxidant and cell viability activities were determined by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay in human Caco-2 and HCT-116 cell lines, and ascorbic acid and tamoxifen, respectively. The caffeine and polyphenol composition of Qi cha tea (R) was modified with less caffeine and gallic acid and more epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) than the original white tea. The majority of the tested botanical samples including Qi cha tea (R) at 50 mu g/mL show similar antioxidant activities, with the exception of Echinacea purpurea. The greatest effect was found for white tea. The antioxidant power of the Qi cha tea (R) (90% at 50 mu g/mL for pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) was divided by approximately a factor of two (61% at 50 mu g/mL for pressurized liquid extraction products (PLEP)), which corresponds to the 48.3% (mass/mass) white tea original content in the Qi cha tea (R). Qi cha tea (R) shows the lowest cytotoxic activity in the viability of the two cell lines when compared to white tea. The application of the ABC method to Qi cha tea (R) using various botanicals and dry extract with acacia gum as blinder has allowed the development of a new innovative functional health beverage that complies with European health claims.

AB  - Hippopotamus antiquus was an extinct semiaquatic megaherbivore foraging mainly on aquatic vegetation, with a biochronological range in the Italian peninsula spanning from around 2.2 to 0.4 Ma. Considering its large body size, and its lifestyle considered to be more aquatic than the current form H. amphibius, a correct estimate of the body mass is interesting to correctly interpret various biological aspects of this extinct megaherbivore. In this contribution, we propose an estimate of the body mass of H. antiquus by comparing the results obtained with classical regression formulae with the values obtained through a new 3D volumetric approach. For both approaches, we used the mounted specimen on display at the Museum of Geology and Palaeontology of the University of Florence. As already found in recent contributions, the estimates obtained with the regression methods provide very high ranges compared to the volumetric approach, with minimum estimates of 200 kg and maximum estimates of over 6 tons, completely incompatible with a tetrapod of this size. The new volumetric estimate provides an average value for the BM in H. antiquus of approximately 3170 tons, thus confirming a body weight approximately double compared to the average values in the extant species H. amphibius.

AB  - BACKGROUND Nutritional modulations may be considered a strategy to protect mental health. Neuronal homeostasis is highly dependent on the availability of glucose, which represents the primary energy source for the brain. In this study, we evaluated the effects of walnut intake and fructose-rich diet on the expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) in two rat brain regions: hypothalamus and hippocampus.
   RESULTS Our results show that walnut supplementation of fructose-fed animals restored the hypothalamic content of GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein. Furthermore, walnut intake did not affect increased hypothalamic GLUT2 content upon fructose consumption. These effects were accompanied by distinctive alterations of hippocampal GLUTs levels. Specifically, walnut intake increased GLUT1 content, whereas GLUT2 protein was decreased within the rat hippocampus after both individual and combined treatments.
   CONCLUSION Overall, our study suggests that walnut supplementation exerted modulatory effects on the glucose transporters within specific brain regions in the presence of developed metabolic disorder. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Mild intrauterine hypoperfusion (MIUH) can induce placental dysfunction and lead to long-term changes during the process of brain development. A better understanding of the mechanism of MIUH will help in the development of new neuroprotective strategies for the placental chamber. To better understand the mechanism of the effect of MIUH on the neural development of offspring, we constructed a model of MIUH in pregnant rats. The proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of hippocampal neurons in fetal rats were studied via flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, JC-1 staining, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction at different time points (6, 24, 48, and 72 h). The results showed that MIUH significantly inhibited the proliferation of hippocampal neurons and promoted their apoptosis and autophagy. Simultaneously, MIUH could promote PTEN expression and affect the PTEN signaling pathway. bpV, an inhibitor of PTEN, could restore the inhibition of hippocampal nerve cell growth caused by MIUH. MIUH may inhibit neuronal proliferation and promote neuronal apoptosis and autophagy by regulating the PTEN signaling pathway.

AB  - Introduction Clinical studies have established that patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are at an increased risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suggesting that mTBI increases vulnerability to subsequent PTSD onset. However, preclinical animal studies investigating this link remain scarce, and the specific biological mechanism through which mTBI increases vulnerability to PTSD is largely unknown.Methods In this study, we modeled mTBI in rats using a mild, closed-head, weight-drop injury, followed 72 h later by exposure to single prolonged stress (SPS) to simulate PTSD. Then, we investigated the impact of mTBI on subsequent PTSD development by observing the behaviors of rats in a series of validated behavioral tests and further explored the possible role of hippocampal DNA methylation.Results We found that, compared with rats in the PTSD-only group, those in the mTBI + PTSD group exhibited higher anxiety levels, higher depression levels, and impaired spatial learning and memory as determined in the open field test, the forced swimming test, and the Morris water maze test, respectively. Rats in the mTBI + PTSD group also exhibited higher hippocampal DNMT3b protein expression compared with those in the PTSD group.Conclusion In conclusion, our results demonstrated that mTBI increases vulnerability to PTSD in rats, possibly through alterations in hippocampal DNA methylation patterns.

AB  - Microglia, as immune cells in the central nervous system, are closely related to cognitive impairment associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Preliminary explorations have investigated the relationship between T2D-related cognitive impairment and the activation and polarization of microglia. This review summarizes the potential mechanisms of microglial activation and polarization in the context of T2D. It discusses central inflammatory responses, neuronal apoptosis, amyloid-(3 deposition, and abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein mediated by microglial activation and polarization, exploring the connections between microglial activation and polarization and T2D-related cognitive impairment from multiple perspectives. Additionally, this review provides references for future treatment targeting microglia in T2D-related cognitive impairment and for clinical translation.

AB  - The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small brainstem structure located in the lower pons and is the main source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Via its phasic and tonic firing, it modulates cognition and autonomic functions and is involved in the brain's immune response. The extent of degeneration to the LC in healthy ageing remains unclear, however, noradrenergic dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite their differences in progression at later disease stages, the early involvement of the LC may lead to comparable behavioural symptoms such as preclinical sleep problems and neuropsychiatric symptoms as a result of AD and PD pathology. In this review, we draw attention to the mechanisms that underlie LC degeneration in ageing, AD and PD. We aim to motivate future research to investigate how early degeneration of the noradrenergic system may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD and PD which may also be relevant to other neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - An implantable system for opioid safety
T2  - DEVICE
LA  - English
AB  - Naloxone can effectively rescue victims from opioid overdose, but less than 5% survive due to delayed or absent first responder intervention. Current overdose reversal systems face key limitations, including low user adherence, false positive detection, and slow antidote delivery. Here, we describe a subcutaneously implanted robotic first responder to overcome these challenges. This implantable system for opioid safety continuously monitors vital signs, detecting opioid overdose through an algorithm analyzing the interplay of cardiorespiratory responses. To address battery concerns with continuous monitoring and multi-sensing modality, an adaptive algorithm dynamically adjusts sensor resolution, reducing the need for frequent charging. Furthermore, the implant includes an ultra-rapid naloxone delivery pump, delivering the 10-mg antidote within 10 s. In animal trials, the robotic first responder successfully revived 96% of overdosed pigs (n = 25) within 3.2 min, showcasing its potential to dramatically improve survival rates and combat the opioid epidemic.

AB  - Simple Summary Noradrenaline is a crucial neurotransmitter produced by a group of neurons in the locus coeruleus and plays a significant role in regulating various physiological processes, including attention, arousal and stress responses. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by the accumulation in the brain of abnormal protein aggregates, such as amyloid-beta, tau and TDP-43, leading to the deterioration of neurons and cognitive decline. Studies have shown that the noradrenergic system is severely affected by Alzheimer's disease. This depletion of noradrenaline levels has been associated with the cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms observed in Alzheimer's patients. In this study, we showed that administering increasing doses of a selective noradrenergic immunotoxin caused dose-dependent working memory impairments and accumulation of TDP-43 phosphorylated at Ser 409/410 and Tau phosphorylated at Thr 217 in the cortex and hippocampus of developing rats. These findings suggest that boosting noradrenergic activity may have beneficial effects on cognitive functions and slow down disease progression. However, further research is needed to fully comprehend the complex relationship between noradrenaline, cognitive function and the aberrant accumulation of proteins in Alzheimer's disease and to develop effective treatments based on these findings.Abstract Noradrenaline (NA) depletion occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, its relationship with the pathological expression of Tau and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), two major hallmarks of AD, remains elusive. Here, increasing doses of a selective noradrenergic immunotoxin were injected into developing rats to generate a model of mild or severe NA loss. At about 12 weeks post-lesion, dose-dependent working memory deficits were detected in these animals, associated with a marked increase in cortical and hippocampal levels of TDP-43 phosphorylated at Ser 409/410 and Tau phosphorylated at Thr 217. Notably, the total levels of both proteins were largely unaffected, suggesting a direct relationship between neocortical/hippocampal NA depletion and the phosphorylation of pathological Tau and TDP-43 proteins. As pTD43 is present in 23% of AD cases and pTau Thr217 has been detected in patients with mild cognitive impairment that eventually would develop into AD, improvement of noradrenergic function in AD might represent a viable therapeutic approach with disease-modifying potential.

AB  - Simple Summary The conservation of endangered species and sustainability of managed populations requires good health and welfare of individuals. Male elephants experience a biological phenomenon called "musth", characterized by a suite of physiological and behavioral changes which serve to facilitate copulation between the sexes, but can also pose unique challenges under human care. This study characterized longitudinal patterns of circulating testosterone and cortisol in relation to musth in four adult Asian elephant bulls and assessed age-related effects on musth activity and adrenal responses to social changes and clinical health events. All bulls exhibited regular annual musth cycles, and there was no clear evidence of chronically elevated cortisol secretion outside of musth. Circulating cortisol covaried positively with testosterone and musth, highlighting intrinsic patterns that should be considered when evaluating the impact of changes on adrenal glucocorticoid activity. Testosterone decreased with age in sexually mature bulls, whereas age-related changes in cortisol varied across individuals, with the three older bulls showing the greatest rate of change during musth. Changes in cortisol were associated with treatment for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in two bulls, but not with activation of disease. In contrast to physiological factors, there was no evidence that social changes involving male herdmates impacted adrenal glucocorticoid activity in the short term. This study highlights the importance of longitudinal hormone monitoring to track changes in physiological function and identify factors that may influence welfare, which is important for making more informed decisions on how to manage male elephants under varying degrees of human care. The conservation of endangered species and sustainability of managed populations requires considerations to ensure the health and welfare of individuals. Male elephants experience a biological phenomenon called "musth", which is characterized by increased testosterone production, temporal gland secretion and urine dribbling, heightened aggression and sexual behavior, and therefore can pose unique challenges for human safety and animal welfare. This study characterized longitudinal (9 to 22 years) patterns of circulating testosterone and cortisol in relation to musth in four adult Asian elephant bulls spanning ages from 12 to 54 years. Age-related effects on musth activity and adrenal responses to social changes and clinical health events were also examined. All bulls exhibited regular annual musth cycles. Circulating cortisol covaried positively with testosterone and musth, highlighting intrinsic patterns that should be considered when evaluating the impact of social, health, and environmental changes on adrenal glucocorticoid activity. Except for an end-of-life cortisol increase in one bull, there was no clear evidence of chronically elevated cortisol secretion outside of musth in any individual. Testosterone decreased with age in sexually mature bulls, whereas age-related changes in cortisol varied across individuals, with the three older bulls showing the greatest rate of change during musth versus inter-musth periods. In contrast to physiological factors, there was no evidence of social factors, such as addition of a new male and death of male herdmates, impacting adrenal glucocorticoid activity in these bulls in the short term. Changes in cortisol were associated with treatment for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.
   tb) in two bulls, increasing after start of treatment and decreasing with cessation of treatment, but were not clearly associated with activation of disease. This study highlights the importance of longitudinal hormone monitoring to track changes in physiological function and responses to social, health, and environmental change in elephant bulls, which is important for making more informed decisions on how to manage male elephants under varying degrees of human care to ensure welfare and safety.

AB  - Mammalian heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes heme degradation using reducing equivalents supplied by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). The tertiary structure of the catalytic domain of a constitutively expressed isoform of HO, HO-2, resembles that of the inductive isoform, HO-1, whereas HO-2 has two heme regulatory motifs (HRM) at the proximal portion of the C-terminus, where the disulfide linkage reflects cellular redox conditions and the second heme binding site is located. Here, we report the results of crosslinking experiments, which suggest that HRM is located near the FMN-binding domain of the CPR when it is complexed with HO-2. The enzymatic assay and reduction kinetics results suggest that heme-bound HRM negatively regulates HO-2 activity in vitro. Cellular redox conditions and free heme concentrations may regulate HO-2 activity.

AB  - We reported that over-expression of MST1 induced the impairment of spatial memory via disturbing neural oscillation patterns in mice. Meanwhile, the P-MST1 is increased in the hippocampus after chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). However, it is unclear if MST1 knockdown protects against stress-induced memory deficits via modulating neural activities. In the study, a CUMS mouse model was established and an intrahippocampal injection of AAV-shMST1 was used to knockdown MST1 in the hippocampus. The data showed that there were memory deficits with over-expressed P-MST1 level in CUMS mice. However, MST1 knockdown can significantly prevent the damages of CUMS-induced working memory and synaptic plasticity via regulating neural oscillation patterns. It suggests that MST1 down-regulation effectively protected against stress-induced behavioral dysfunctions. Moreover, as a more convenient way, neural oscillation analysis could provide some assistance for the auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of depression.

AB  - The avian hippocampal formation (HF) is homologous to the mammalian hippocampus and plays a central role in the control of spatial cognition. In homing pigeons, HF supports navigation by familiar landmarks and landscape features. However, what has remained relatively unexplored is the importance of HF for the retention of previously acquired spatial information. For example, to date, no systematic GPS-tracking studies on the retention of HF-dependent navigational memory in homing pigeons have been performed. Therefore, the current study was designed to compare the pre- and post-surgical navigational performance of sham-lesioned control and HFlesioned pigeons tracked from three different sites located in different directions with respect to home. The pre- and post-surgical comparison of the pigeons' flight paths near the release sites and before reaching the area surrounding the home loft (4 km radius from the loft) revealed that the control and HF-lesioned pigeons displayed similarly successful retention. By contrast, the HF-lesioned pigeons displayed dramatically and consistently impaired retention in navigating to their home loft during the terminal phase of the homing flight near home, i.e., where navigation is supported by memory for landmark and landscape features. The data demonstrate that HF lesions lead to a dramatic loss of pre-surgically acquired landmark and landscape navigational information while sparing those mechanisms associated with navigation from locations distant from home.

AB  - BackgroundThe visually guided Rutgers Acquired Equivalence Test (RAET) and the various visual and audiovisual versions of the test with the same structure involve rule acquisition, retrieval, and generalization and is based on learning stimulus pairs (antecedents and consequents). In an earlier study we have found no difference in the acquisition learning and only slight enhancement in retrieval and generalization in the audiovisual learning compared to the visual one if complex readily verbalizable visual stimuli (cartoon faces and color fish) were used. In this study, we sought to examine whether similar phenomena can be observed with feature-restricted, less verbalizable visual stimuli (geometric shapes).MethodsA total of 119 healthy adult volunteers completed two computer-based test paradigms: Polygon (PO) and SoundPolygon (SP). PO is a visual test where the antecedents are shaded circles, and the consequents are geometric shapes. SP is an audiovisual test where the antecedents are sounds and the consequents are the same geometric shapes as in PO.ResultsThere were no significant differences in the performances and the reaction times in the acquisition phase between the PO (visual) and SP (audiovisual) tests. However, the performances in retrieval and generalization were significantly poorer in the audiovisual test and the reaction times were also longer.ConclusionThe acquisition phase seems to be independent from the stimulus modality if the simple geometric shapes were visual stimuli. However, feature-restricted, less verbalizable visual stimuli make more difficult to retrieve and generalize the already acquired audiovisual information.

AB  - Selective breeding has been utilized to study the genetic basis of exercise behavior, but research suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, also contribute to this behavior. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the brains of mice from a genetically selected high runner (HR) line have sex-specific changes in DNA methylation patterns in genes known to be genomically imprinted compared to those from a non-selected control (C) line. Through cross-fostering, we also found that maternal upbringing can modify the DNA methylation patterns of additional genes. Here, we identify an additional set of genes in which DNA methylation patterns and gene expression may be altered by selection for increased wheel-running activity and maternal upbringing. We performed bisulfite sequencing and gene expression assays of 14 genes in the brain and found alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression for Bdnf, Pde4d and Grin2b. Decreases in Bdnf methylation correlated with significant increases in Bdnf gene expression in the hippocampus of HR compared to C mice. Cross-fostering also influenced the DNA methylation patterns for Pde4d in the cortex and Grin2b in the hippocampus, with associated changes in gene expression. We also found that the DNA methylation patterns for Atrx and Oxtr in the cortex and Atrx and Bdnf in the hippocampus were further modified by sex. Together with our previous study, these results suggest that DNA methylation and the resulting change in gene expression may interact with early-life influences to shape adult exercise behavior.

AB  - Hippocampal hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic target to prevent A beta deposition in AD since enhanced neuronal activity promotes presynaptic A beta production and release. This article highlights the potential application of perampanel (PER), an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist approved for partial seizures, as a therapeutic agent for AD. Using transgenic AD mice combined with in vivo brain microdialysis and primary neurons under oligomeric A beta-evoked neuronal hyperexcitability, the acute effects of PER on A beta metabolism were investigated. A single oral administration of PER rapidly decreased ISF A beta(40) and A beta(42) levels in the hippocampus of J20, APP transgenic mice, without affecting the A beta(40)/A beta(42) ratio; 5 mg/kg PER resulted in declines of 20% and 31%, respectively. Moreover, PER-treated J20 manifested a marked decrease in hippocampal APP beta CTF levels with increased FL-APP levels. Consistently, acute treatment of PER reduced sAPP beta levels, a direct byproduct of beta-cleavage of APP, released to the medium in primary neuronal cultures under oligomeric A beta-induced neuronal hyperexcitability. To further evaluate the effect of PER on ISF A beta clearance, a gamma-secretase inhibitor was administered to J20 1 h after PER treatment. PER did not influence the elimination of ISF A beta, indicating that the acute effect of PER is predominantly on A beta production. In conclusion, acute treatment of PER reduces A beta production by suppressing beta-cleavage of amyloid-beta precursor protein effectively, indicating a potential effect of PER against A beta pathology in AD.

AB  - Active information gathering is a fundamental cognitive process that enables organisms to navigate uncertainty and make adaptive decisions. Here we synthesise current knowledge on the behavioural, neural, and computational mechanisms underlying information sampling in healthy people and across several brain disorders. The role of cortical and subcortical regions spanning limbic, insular, fronto-parietal, and striatal systems is considered, along with the contributions of key neurotransmitters involving norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. We also examine how various clinical conditions, including schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Parkinson's disease have an impact on information gathering behaviours. To account for the findings, we outline a neuroeconomic perspective on how the brain may evaluate the costs and benefits of acquiring information to resolve uncertainty. This work highlights how active information gathering is a crucial brain process for adaptive behaviour in healthy individuals and how its breakdown is relevant to several psychiatric and neurological conditions. The findings have important implications for developing novel computational assays as well as targeted interventions in brain disorders.

AB  - Rearing, i.e., standing on the hind limbs in an upright posture, is part of a rat's innate exploratory motor pro-gram. Here, we examined in developing rats whether rearing is critical for the pup's capability to form spatial representations based on distal environmental cues. Pups (male) were tested at PD18, i.e., the first day they typically exhibit stable rearing, on a spatial habituation paradigm comprising a Familiarization session (with the pup exposed to an arena with a specific configuration of distal cues) followed, 3 h later, by a Test session where the pups were either re-exposed to the identical distal cue configuration (NoChange) or a changed configuration (DistalChange). In Experiment 1, rearing activity (rearing events, duration) decreased from Familiarization to Test in the NoChange pups but, remained elevated in the DistalChange group indicating that these pups recognized the distal novelty. Recognition of distal novelty was associated with increased c-Fos expression in hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) areas, compared with NoChange pups. Analysis of GAD67+ cells suggested a parallel increase in excitation and inhibition specifically in prelimbic mPFC networks in response to distal cue changes. In Experiment 2, the pups were mechanically prevented from rearing while still seeing the distal cues during Familiarization. Rearing activity in the Test session of these pups did not differ between groups that were or were not exposed to a changed distal cue configuration at Test. The findings evi-dence a critical role of rearing for the emergence of allocentric representations integrating distal space during early development.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication deficit and repetitive behaviour. In the past few years, increasing clinical evidence has shown that the cerebellum may contribute to the neuropathology of ASD. However, studies in the mechanism for the involvement of the cerebellum in autism remained speculative. Although some have suggested the possibility of a change of glutamate decarboxylases in the cerebellum of autistic patients, this remains controversial and is limited to the alteration in transcriptional level. This study aimed to investigate the cerebellar structure and determine the expression of rate-limiting GABAergic enzymes in GABA signalling of the autism cerebellum. Pregnant C57BL/6 J mice were intraperitoneally injected with a dosage of 500 mg/kg valproic acid (VPA) on embryonic day 10.5 for autistic behavioural induction. This study found that early prenatal exposure to VPA led to tail deformation and decreased cerebellar weight and size. Early adult mouse models with autistic behaviour showed reduced expression of both isoforms of glutamate decarboxylases (GAD) 65 and 67 in the cerebellum. Also, protein expressions of cerebellar type 1 GABA transporter (GAT-1) and GABA transaminase (GABAT) were reduced in VPA mice. It indicated that abnormal GABA production, recycling, and metabolism could alter the excitatoryinhibitory balance in the autistic cerebellum. Thus, our findings provide supporting evidence that cerebellum impairment could be an etiology of environmentally induced autism. Changes in cerebellar structure and the altered GABAergic enzymes in the cerebellum provide targets for future therapeutic studies in idiopathic autism.

AB  - Both pictures and words are frequently employed as experimental stimuli to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms of emotional processing. However, it remains unclear whether emotional picture processing and emotional word processing share neural underpinnings. To address this issue, we focus on neuroimaging studies examining the implicit processing of affective words and pictures, which require participants to meet cognitive task demands under the implicit influence of emotional pictorial or verbal stimuli. A coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was conducted on these studies, which revealed no common activation maximum between the picture and word conditions. Specifically, implicit negative picture processing (35 experiments, 393 foci, and 932 subjects) engages the bilateral amygdala, left hippocampus, fusiform gyri, and right insula, which are mainly located in the subcortical network and visual network associated with bottom-up emotional responses. In contrast, implicit negative word processing (34 experiments, 316 foci, and 799 subjects) engages the default mode network and fronto-parietal network including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, indicating the involvement of top-down semantic processing and emotion regulation. Our findings indicate that affective pictures (that intrinsically have an affective valence) and affective words (that inherit the affective valence from their object) modulate implicit emotional processing in different ways, and therefore recruit distinct brain systems.

AB  - Objective
   Placebo as well as nocebo responses are widely found in scientific research and clinical practice. Growing evidence suggests sex differences in placebo as well as nocebo responses. However, data concerning this question are still insufficient. This study examined whether the BOLD signals of two responses, as measured with functional MRI (fMRI), differ by sex under conditions of equivalent experimental pain perception.
   Method
   Thirty-one healthy volunteers (14 female) underwent two fMRI scans, once during a placebo intervention and once during a nocebo intervention, pseudorandomly ordered, in an acute lower back pain (ALBP) model. We collected visual analog scale (VAS) data after each scanning. fMRI data from different sex groups were subjected to functional connectivity (FC) analysis and behavioral correlation analysis (BCA).
   Results
   The results showed statistical differences in VAS scores between male and female participants, in both placebo and nocebo responses. Both groups also showed reduced FC in the pain-associated network of the placebo response and elevated FC in the pain-related network of the nocebo response. However, in the placebo condition, male participants displayed increased FC in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus (PHP), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), while female participants showed increased FC in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampal gyrus (HP), and insular cortex (IC). In the nocebo condition, male participants showed decreased FC in the PCC and HP, while female participants displayed decreased FC in the mid-cingulate cortex, thalamus (THS), and HP. The BCA results of the two groups were also different.
   Conclusion
   We found that the endogenous opioid system and reward circuit play a key role in sex differences of placebo response and that anxiety and its secondary reactions may cause the sex differences of nocebo response.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) isa contagious and lethal hemorrhagic disease with a high case fatality rate. Since 2007, ASF has been spreading into many countries, especially in Europe and Asia. Given that there is no effective vaccine and treatment to deal with ASF, prevention is an important way for a country to avoid the effects of the virus. Australia is currently ASF-free but the disease has been reported in many neighboring countries, such as Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea. Therefore, it is necessary for Australia to maintain hypervigilance to prevent the ASF introduction. In this paper, we propose the use of fuzzy concepts to establish a fuzzy risk assessment model to predict the ASF introduction risk in Australia. From the analysis, the international passengers (IP) and international import trade (IIT) are concluded as the two main ASF introduction factors based on transmission features and past research. From the established fuzzy risk assessment model based on the analysis of the 2019 and 2020 data, the risks of ASF introduction into Australia are considered to be low. The model further deduced that the Asian region was the major source of potential risks. Finally, in order to validate the effectiveness of the established fuzzy risk assessment model, the qualitative data from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom was used. From the validation results, it has shown that the results were consistent when the same data is adopted, and thus proved that the functionality of the established fuzzy risk assessment model for assessing the risk in Australia.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently under investigation as a non-invasive tool to monitor neurodevelopmental trajectories and predict risk of cognitive deficits following white matter injury (WMI) in very preterm infants. In the present study, we evaluated the capacity of multimodal MRI (high-resolution T2-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging)to assess changes following WMI and their relationship to learning and memory performance in Wistar rats as it has been demonstrated for preterm infants. Multimodal MRI performed at P31-P32 shown that animals exposed to neonatal LPS could be classified into two groups: minimal and overt injury. Animals with overt injury had significantly enlarged ventricles, hippocampal atrophy, diffusivity changes in hippocampal white and gray matter, in the striatum and the cortex. Following neonatal LPS exposure, animals presented learning and memory impairments as shown at the fear conditioning test at P36-P38. The severity of learning and memory deficits was related to increased mean diffusivity in the hippocampal region. In conclusion, non-invasive multimodal MRI (volumetric and DTI) assessed and classified the extent of injury at long-term following neonatal LPS exposure. Microstructural changes in the hippocampus at DTI were associated to learning and memory impairments. This further highlights the utility of multimodal MRI as a non-invasive quantitative biomarker following perinatal inflammation.

Using rodent models, past work has demonstrated various behavioral and brain impairments in offspring after immune-activating events. We applied 5 mg/kg of poly(I:C) on gestation day 9 to pregnant mouse dams, whose offspring were then stressed during puberty. We show impairments in attentional set-shifting in a T-maze, and a decreased number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus as a result of peripubertal stress specifically in females.

AB  - The developmental onset of aversive learning processes depends on complex interactions between endocrine, neural, and social influences. Emergence of avoidance conditioning in rat pups is triggered by elevated plasma corticosterone activating the amygdala. Further, the mother's ability to buffer the corticosterone response delays the onset of avoidance in (similar to)2-week-old pups. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) also develops during the pre-weaning period. In previous work, little or no conditioning was observed on Day 17 for pups housed in the home cage with mother and littermates between training sessions, whereas pups isolated between training sessions did show some conditioning. This suggests that social buffering may also delay the onset of this form of aversive learning. In the present study with Day-17 pups, one session of periorbital shock, the typical EBC unconditioned stimulus for young rat pups, resulted in lower plasma corticosterone levels and neural activity in the central nucleus of the amygdale (CeA) of pups returned to the mother and homecage following the session as compared to pups isolated following the shock session. These findings demonstrate social buffering of the physiological response to aversive stimulus exposure under conditions of EBC and support the hypothesis that social buffering of early adverse experience may adjust the timing of emergence of EBC in rat pups.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is widely cultivated throughout the world for its unique flavor and health benefits. Galloylated catechins in tea plants serve as important secondary metabolites that play a pivotal role in tea taste determination and pharmacological effects. However, the genetic basis of galloylated catechins traits remains elusive. We identified a stable and major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with galloylated catechins index (GCI), designated qGCI6.2. Within the QTL's confidence interval, two shikimate dehydrogenases (CsSDH4, CsSDH3) were identified. These enzymes catalyze gallic acid (GA) production from 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, thereby contributing to galloylated catechins accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that CsSDH4 and CsSDH3 expression levels and GA and galloylated catechins contents were positively correlated. Furthermore, overexpressing CsSDH4 and CsSDH3 in transgenic tomato plants markedly increased GA and galloylated catechin contents. RNA-seq analysis of transgenic tomato indicated that CsSDH4 and CsSDH3 primarily regulate genes related to shikimic acid and flavonoid pathways, and jointly promote galloylated catechins synthesis. Our findings have further elucidated the galloylated catechins synthesis pathway and provided a theoretical basis for cultivation of tea cultivars with high galloylated catechin contents.

AB  - BackgroundMood disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, are associated with zinc dyshomeostasis and aberrant GABAergic signaling. Activation of ZnR/GPR39 by synaptic zinc in the hippocampus triggers phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2), which regulates the K+/Cl- cotransporter (KCC2) and thereby GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission and seizure activity. Therefore, we studied whether impaired ZnR/GPR39 signaling is linked to anxiety-related behavior in male or female mice.ResultsUsing the acoustic startle response, elevated plus maze, and open field test, we found increased anxiety-related behavior in ZnR/GPR39 knockout (KO) mice. Despite a well-established sex difference, where females are typically more prone to anxiety, both male and female ZnR/GPR39 KO mice exhibited increased anxiety-related behavior compared to wildtype (WT) mice. Additionally, ZnR/GPR39 KO mice displayed impaired motor coordination in the pole and rotarod tests but did not show reduced muscle strength, as indicated by a grip test. Finally, we found intrinsic alterations in the expression level of KCC2, a major Cl- transporter regulating GABAergic signaling, in the amygdala of na & iuml;ve ZnR/GPR39 KO mice compared to controls.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that loss of ZnR/GPR39 enhances anxiety-related behavior in both male and female mice. Moreover, ZnR/GPR39 KO mice exhibit impaired motor coordination, which may be associated with increased anxiety. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of ZnR/GPR39 modulates the expression of KCC2 in the amygdala. Thus, we propose that ZnR/GPR39 can serve as a target for regulating GABAergic signaling in anxiety treatment.

AB  - Psychological research on human motivation repeatedly observed that approach goals (i.e., goals to attain success) increase task enjoyment and intrinsic motivation more strongly than avoidance goals (i.e., goals to avoid failure). The present study sought to address how the reward network in the brain-including the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex-is involved when individuals engage in the same task with a focus on approach or avoidance goals. Participants reported stronger positive emotions when they focused on approach goals, but stronger anxiety and disappointment when they focused on avoidance goals. The fMRI analyses revealed that the reward network in the brain showed similar levels of activity to cues predictive of approach and avoidance goals. In contrast, the two goal states were associated with different patterns of activity in the visual cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum during success and failure outcomes. Representation similarity analysis further revealed shared and different representations within the striatum and vmPFC between the approach and avoidance goal states, suggesting both the similarity and uniqueness of the mechanisms behind the two goal states. In addition, the distinct patterns of activation in the striatum were associated with distinct subjective experiences participants reported between the approach and the avoidance conditions. These results suggest the importance of examining the pattern of striatal activity in understanding the mechanisms behind different motivational states in humans.

AB  - IntroductionIn patients with mild cognitive impairment, pathological changes begin in the amygdala (AMG) and hippocampus (HI), especially in the parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal cortex (ENT). These areas play an important role in olfactory detection and recognition. It is important to understand how subtle signs of olfactory disability relate to the functions of the above-mentioned regions, as well as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In this study, we evaluated brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), performed during the presentation of olfactory stimuli (classified as "normal odors" not inducing memory retrieval), and investigated the relationships of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal with olfactory detection and recognition abilities in healthy elderly subjects. MethodsTwenty-four healthy elderly subjects underwent fMRI during olfaction, and raw mean BOLD signals were extracted from regions of interest, including bilateral regions (AMG, HI, parahippocampus, and ENT) and orbitofrontal subregions (frontal inferior OFC, frontal medial OFC, frontal middle OFC, and frontal superior OFC). Multiple regression and path analyses were conducted to understand the roles of these areas in olfactory detection and recognition. ResultsActivation of the left AMG had the greatest impact on olfactory detection and recognition, while the ENT, parahippocampus, and HI acted as a support system for AMG activation. Less activation of the right frontal medial OFC was associated with good olfactory recognition. These findings improve our understanding of the roles of limbic and prefrontal regions in olfactory awareness and identification in elderly individuals. ConclusionFunctional decline of the ENT and parahippocampus crucially impacts olfactory recognition. However, AMG function may compensate for deficits through connections with frontal regions.

AB  - Hypobaric Hypoxia (HH) is known to cause oxidative stress in the brain that leads to spatial memory deficit and neurodegeneration. For decades therapeutic hypothermia is used to treat global and focal ischemia in preserving brain functions that proved to be beneficial in humans and rodents. Considering these previous reports, the present study was designed to establish the therapeutic potential of hypothermia preconditioning on HH induced spatial memory, biochemical and morphological changes in adult rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to HH (7620 m, similar to 282 mmHg) for 1, 3 and 7 days with and without hypothermic preconditioning. Spatial learning memory was assessed by Morris water maze (MWM) test along with evaluation of hippocampal pyramidal neuron damage by histological study. Oxidative stress was measured by studying the levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), oxidized and reduced glutathione (GSSG and GSH). Results of MWM test indicated prolonged path length and latency to reach the platform in HH groups that regained to normal in cold pre-treated groups. A likely neurodegeneration was evident in HH groups that lessen in the cold pre-treated groups. Hypothermic preconditioning prevented spatial memory impairment and neurodegeneration in animals subjected to HH via decreasing the NO, ROS and LPO compared to control animals. The GSH level and GSH/GSSG ratio was found to be higher in preconditioned animals as compared to respective HH exposed animals, indicative of redox scavenging and restoration of hippocampal neuronal structure as well as spatial memory. Therefore, hypothermic preconditioning improves spatial memory deficit by reducing HH induced oxidative stress and hippocampal neurodegeneration, hence can be used as a multi-target prophylactic measure to combat HH induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Mirror neurons show activity during both the execution (AE) and observation of actions (AO). The Mirror Neuron System (MNS) could be involved during motor imagery (MI) as well. Extensive research suggests that the cerebellum is interconnected with the MNS and may be critically involved in its activities. We gathered evidence on the cerebellum's role in MNS functions, both theoretically and experimentally. Evidence shows that the cerebellum plays a major role during AO and MI and that its lesions impair MNS functions likely because, by modulating the activity of cortical inhibitory interneurons with mirror properties, the cerebellum may contribute to visuomotor matching, which is fundamental for shaping mirror properties. Indeed, the cerebellum may strengthen sensory-motor patterns that minimise the discrepancy between predicted and actual outcome, both during AE and AO. Furthermore, through its connections with the hippocampus, the cerebellum might be involved in internal simulations of motor programs during MI. Finally, as cerebellar neuromodulation might improve its impact on MNS activity, we explored its potential neurophysiological and neurorehabilitation implications.

AB  - Vertebrate hippocampal formation is central to conversations on the comparative analysis of spatial cognition, especially in light of variation found in different vertebrate classes. Assuming the medial pallium (MP) of extant amphibians resembles the hippocampal formation (HF) of ancestral stem tetrapods, we propose that the HF of modern amniotes began with a MP characterized by a relatively undifferentiated cytoarchitecture, more direct thalamic/olfactory sensory inputs, and a more generalized role in associative learning-memory processes. As such, hippocampal evolution in amniotes, especially mammals, can be seen as progressing toward a cytoarchitecture with well-defined subdivisions, regional connectivity, and a functional specialization supporting map-like representations of space. We then summarize a growing literature on amphibian spatial cognition and its underlying brain organization. Emphasizing the MP/HF, we highlight that further research into amphibian spatial cognition would provide novel insight into the role of the HF in spatial memory processes, and their supporting neural mechanisms. A more complete reconstruction of hippocampal evolution would benefit from additional research on non-mammalian vertebrates, with amphibians being of particular interest.

AB  - In a previous study, we demonstrated that intermittent ethanol administration in male adolescent animals impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, particularly under conditions of excessive ethanol administration. In this current study, we subjected adolescent male and female Wistar rats an alcohol schedule-induced drinking (SID) procedure to obtain an elevated rate of alcohol self-administration and assessed their hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. We also studied hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity, as well as the expression levels of several genes involved in these mechanisms. Both male and female rats exhibited similar drinking patterns throughout the sessions of the SID protocol reaching similar blood alcohol levels in all the groups. However, only male rats that consumed alcohol showed spatial memory deficits which correlated with inhibition of hippocampal synaptic plasticity as long-term potentiation. In contrast, alcohol did not modify hippocampal gene expression of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor subunits, although there are differences in the expression levels of several genes relevant to synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory processes, related to alcohol consumption as Ephb2, sex differences as Pi3k or the interaction of both factors such as Pten. In conclusion, elevated alcohol intake during adolescence seems to have a negative impact on spatial memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in a sex dependent manner, even both sexes exhibit similar blood alcohol concentrations and drinking patterns.

AB  - Objectives The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the relationship between the number of head impacts sustained in a season of men's collegiate club ice hockey and behavioral traits of aggression and sensation seeking, and (2) explore the neural correlates of these behaviors using neuroimaging. Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Participants (n = 18) completed baseline surveys to quantify self-reported aggression and sensation-seeking tendencies. Aggression related to playing style was quantified through penalty minutes accrued during a season. Participants wore head impact sensors throughout a season to quantify the number of head impacts sustained. Participants (n = 15) also completed baseline anatomical and magnetic elastography neuroimaging scans to measure brain volumetric and viscoelastic properties. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to examine relationships between (1) impacts, aggression, and sensation seeking, and (2) impacts, aggression, and sensation seeking and brain volume, stiffness, and damping ratio, as an exploratory analysis. Results Number of head impacts sustained was significantly related to the number of penalty minutes accrued, normalized to number of games played (r = .62, p < .01). Our secondary, exploratory analysis revealed that number of impacts, sensation seeking, and aggression were related to stiffness or damping ratio of the thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, but not volume. Conclusions A more aggressive playing style was related to an increased number of head impacts sustained, which may provide evidence for future studies of head impact prevention. Further, magnetic resonance elastography may aid to monitor behavior or head impact exposure. Researchers should continue to examine this relationship and consider targeting behavioral modification programs of aggression to decrease head impact exposure in ice hockey.

AB  - The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is one of the key brain areas involved in pain modulation. Also, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus expresses various receptors, including dopaminergic receptors. Dopaminergic receptors play a key role in pain transmission and modulation within the brain. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of DG dopaminergic receptors in the LH-induced antinociception during the presence of inflammatory pain. Male Wistar rats were used in this study. Cannulae were unilaterally implanted in their skull for microinjections into the LH and DG. The LH was chemically stimulated by carbachol injection (250 nM/0.5 & micro;l saline). In separate groups, different doses (0.25, 1, and 4 & micro;g/0.5 & micro;l vehicle) of the D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists (SCH23390 and Sulpiride, respectively) were microinjected into the DG, 5 min prior to intra-LH injection of carbachol. Five min after the second injection, formalin test as a persistent inflammatory pain model in animals was done in all rats. The results revealed that carbachol could induce antinociception following formalin injection into rat's hind paw. The 4 & micro;g dose of both antagonists significantly reduced the LH stimulation-induced antinociception in both phases of formalin pain responses. Although the 1 & micro;g dose of sulpiride significantly reduced antinociception during both phases, 1 & micro;g SCH23390 could only reduce this antinociception during the late phase. These findings demonstrate the involvement of DG dopaminergic receptors in the LH-induced antinociception. The results also suggest that the effectiveness of DG dopaminergic receptors is more pronounced during the late phase of formalin-induced pain responses.

AB  - Weaning is a crucial period in the pig's life cycle, which is frequently followed by gastrointestinal (GI) infections, diarrhea and even death. This study focused on the impact of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) supplementation on the intestinal health of weaning piglets. Weaning piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, 23 days) were randomly allocated into four groups, which included negative control group (CON): basic diet; positive control group (ANT): basic diet + 20 mg/kg flavomycin + 100 mg/kg aureomycin; treatment group bLF-A: basic diet + 1 g/kg bLF; treatment group bLF-B: basic diet + 3 g/kg bLF. The result showed that dietary supplementation of bLF can improve growth performance and reduce diarrhea, which exhibits dose-dependency (P < 0.05). Compared with CON group, supplementation with bLF significantly improved immunity, and increased villus height and ratio of villus height/crypt depth at the small intestinal mucosa (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 was greatly increased in the ileum of bLF group on days 7 and 14 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the supplementation of bLF increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and decreased the abundance of Escherichia coli in the cecum on day 7 (P < 0.05). The dietary supplementation of bLF enhanced the growth performance, reduced diarrhea rate in weaning piglets by improving intestinal immunity, morphology and barrier function, balancing intestinal microbiota. And bLF can be a promising feed additive in relieving stress situation of weaning piglets.

AB  - The PCSK9 contribution to cholesterol and immunotolerance homeostasis and response to glucose, and insulin in testis and hypophysis were studied using Pcsk9-deficient ((-/-)) and transgenic [Tg (PCSK9)] mice, and diabetic, obese ob/ob and db/db mice. The spermatids/spermatozoa acrosome, peritubular vessels, and epididymal adipocytes were PCSK9- and LDL-R-positive. The pro-PCSK9/PCSK9 ratio was high in interstitial tissue-fractions (ITf) and spermatozoa and low in seminiferous tubule-fractions (STf) in normal adult mice. This ratio decreased in ITf in ob/ob and db/db mice but increased in tubules in ob/ob mice. Deleting pcsk9 lowered cholesterol in serum but increased testicular cholesterol. Furthermore, HMGCoA-red, ACAT-2 and LDL-R turnover increased whereas SR-BI decreased in ITf; in tubules, ABCA1 decreased and 160 kDa LDL-R increased in Pcsk9(-/-) mice. Excess testicular cholesterol could result from increased cholesterol synthesis and uptake with reduction in SR-BI-mediated efflux in ITf and from the overload of apoptotic cells, lowered ABCA1-mediated efflux and stimulated LDL-R protein synthesis in tubules in Pcsk9(-/-) mice. Concomitantly with the cholesterol accumulation, tubules showed infiltrates of immune cells, elevated IL-17A and IL-17RA, and changes in the immunotolerance homeostasis. PCSK9 deficiency decreased glucose in tubules and spermatozoa while increasing insulin2 in ITf and tubules not serum. Moreover, IR-alpha, and IR-beta augmented in tubules but decreased in the anterior pituitary; IR-alpha increased whereas IR-beta decreased in ITf. The histology and cholesterol levels were normal in Tg (PCSK9) mouse testis. The excess cholesterol creates a milieu favorable to the action of high IL-17A and IL-17RA, the development of inflammatory conditions and self-tolerance breakdown in testis.

AB  - Interval timing is a key executive process that involves estimating the duration of an interval over several seconds or minutes. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have deficits in interval timing. Since temporal control of action is highly conserved across mammalian species, studying interval timing tasks in animal AD models may be relevant to human disease. Amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark features of AD. While rodent models of amyloid pathology are known to have interval timing impairments, to our knowledge, interval timing has not been studied in models of tauopathy. Here, we evaluate interval timing performance of P301S transgenic mice, a widely studied model of tauopathy that overexpresses human tau with the P301S mutation. We employed an interval timing task and found that P301S mice consistently underestimated temporal intervals compared to wild-type controls, responding early in anticipation of the target interval. Our study indicating timing deficits in a mouse tauopathy model could have relevance to human tauopathies such as AD.

AB  - Hippocampal adult neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis throughout life. They play multifaceted roles in hippocampal function, including memory processing, stress regulation, and cognitive flexibility. Located in unique neurogenic niches like the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, NSCs exhibit notable heterogeneity and can be classified into quiescent, activated, and intermediate transitioning states. This diversity, while instrumental to their adaptability and function, presents challenges in molecular classification and functional interrogation. Here, we discuss current limitations and compare NSC transcriptional profiles from publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We address discrepancies in NSC classification between studies, identify conserved gene expression profiles, and propose new markers that could serve as standardized references. Furthermore, we explore how pseudotime inference analyses provide insights into the temporal dynamics of NSCs and their progression toward neural progenitors, further aiming to optimize their classification. We also examine cellular changes in NSCs during aging and explore the potential of these cells to undergo senescence. Our work helps to resolve inconsistencies in current cell-type annotations in literature and proposes a framework to study and classify the different states of NSCs, thereby offering a better understanding of their dynamic roles in neurogenesis, aging, and cellular senescence.

AB  - Neuroticism is one of the most robust higher-order personality traits associated with negative emotionality and risk of mental disorders. Many studies have investigated relationships between neuroticism and the brain, but the results have been inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional neuroimaging studies to identify the most stable neurofunctional substrates of neuroticism. We found stable significant positive correlations between neuroticism and resting-state brain activity in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left striatum, and right hippocampus. In contrast, resting-state brain activity in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) was negatively associated with neuroticism. Additionally, meta-regression analysis revealed brain regions in which sex and age moderated the link of spontaneous activity with neuroticism. This is the first study to provide a comprehensive understanding of resting-state brain activity correlates of neuroticism, and the findings may be useful for the targeting of specific brain regions for interventions to decrease the risks of mental health problems.

AB  - Nicotine and alcohol use is highly prevalent among patients with serious mental illness, including those with schizophrenia (SCZ), and this co-occurrence can lead to a worsening of medical and psychiatric morbidity. While the mechanistic drivers of co-occurring SCZ, nicotine use and alcohol use are unknown, emerging evidence suggests that the use of drugs during adolescence may increase the probability of developing psychiatric disorders. The current study used the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) rat model of SCZ, which has previously been shown to have enhanced nicotine behavioral sensitization and, following adolescent alcohol, increased alcohol consumption. Given how commonly alcohol is used by adolescents that develop SCZ, we used the NVHL rat to determine how exposure to adolescent alcohol impacts the development of nicotine behavioral sensitization in adulthood. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent the NVHL surgery or a sham (control) surgery and subsequently, half of each group was allowed to drink alcohol during adolescence. Nicotine behavioral sensitization was assessed in adulthood with rats receiving subcutaneous injections of nicotine (0.5 mg/kg) each day for 3 weeks followed by a nicotine challenge session 2 weeks later. We demonstrate that all groups of rats became sensitized to nicotine and there were no NVHL-specific increases in nicotine behavioral sensitization. We also found that NVHL rats appeared to develop sensitization to the nicotine paired context and that adolescent alcohol exposure blocked this context sensitization. The current findings suggest that exposure to alcohol during adolescence can influence behaviors that manifest in the adult NVHL rat (i.e., context sensitization). Interestingly, nicotine behavioral sensitization levels were not altered in the NVHL groups regardless of adolescent alcohol exposure in contrast to prior reports.

AB  - Introduction Pathological abnormalities first appear in the medial temporal regions including entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies showed that olfactory decline in elderly subjects was associated with volume reductions in the left hippocampus and left parahippocampus without cognitive impairment. The aim of this study is to investigate the link between olfaction and volume reductions in the medial temporal regions including the parahippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampal subfields.
   Method 27 elderly subjects and 27 young controls were measured olfaction acuity, cognitive function, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Image processing and gray matter volumetric segmentation were performed with FreeSurfer. Volume data were analyzed with SPSS Statistics software.
   Results Interesting results of this study were that volume reduction in the entorhinal cortex was not directly linked with declining olfactory ability. Volume reduction in the left entorhinal cortex was correlated with volume reduction in the left parahippocampus and dentate gyrus. However, left parahippocampus volume reduction had the greatest impact on olfactory decline, and the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus might additionally contribute to olfactory decline.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that olfactory decline may be directly reflected in the medial temporal regions as reduced parahippocampus volumes, rather than as morphological changes in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The parahippocampus may play an important role in the association between memory retrieval and olfactory identification.

AB  - The ventral midline thalamus, including the reuniens and rhomboid (ReRh) nuclei, connects bidirectionally with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (Hip), both essential for memory processes. This review compiles and discusses studies on a role for the ReRh nuclei in the system consolidation of memories, also considering their potentially limited participation in memory retrieval or early phases of consolidation. It also examines scientific literature on short- and long-term plasticity in ReRh-mPFC and ReRh-Hip connections, emphasizing plasticity's importance in understanding these nuclei's role in memory. The idea that the two nuclei are at the crossroads of information exchange between the mPFC and the Hip is not new, but the relationship between this status and the plasticity of their connections remains elusive. Since this perspective is relatively recent, our concluding section suggests conceptual and practical avenues for future research, aiming perhaps to bring more order to the apparently multi-functional implication of the ventral midline thalamus in cognition.

AB  - Polygala tenuifolia Wild is an ancient traditional Chinese medicine. Its main component, tenuifolin (TEN), has been proven to improve cognitive impairment caused by neurodegenerative diseases and ovariectomy. However, there was hardly any pharmacological research about TEN and its potential gender differences. Considering the reduction of TEN on learning and memory dysfunction in ovariectomized animals, therefore, we focused on the impact of TEN in different mice genders in the current study. Spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB), light-dark discrimination, and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were used to evaluate the mice's learning and memory abilities. The field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) of the hippocampal CA1 region was recorded using an electrophysiological method, and the morphology of the dendritic structure was examined using Golgi staining. In the behavioral experiments, TEN improved the correct rate in female mice in the SAB test, the correct rate in the light-dark discrimination test, and the number of crossing platforms in the MWM test. Additionally, TEN reduced the latency of female mice rather than male mice in light-dark discrimination and MWM tests. Moreover, TEN could significantly increase the slope of fEPSP in hippocampal Schaffer-CA1 and enhance the total length and the number of intersections of dendrites in the hippocampal CA1 area in female mice but not in male mice. Collectively, the results of the current study showed that TEN improved learning and memory by regulating long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendritic structure of hippocampal CA1 area in female mice but not in males. These findings would help to explore the improvement mechanism of TEN on cognition and expand the knowledge of the potential therapeutic value of TEN in the treatment of cognitive impairment.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a crucial role as a neurotransmitter in anxiety circuits, prominently in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. The synthesis of GABA in the central nervous system is primarily governed by glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67). Aging is associated with emotional alterations, and isolation stress has been linked to increased anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the impact of aging on the gene expression of GAD67 (Gad1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (m PC) and ventral hippocampus (v Hip) of fear-potentiated rats subjected to isolation stress. To conduct the study, Wistar rats of different age groups 21day-old (immature), 42-day-old (peri-adolescent), and 365-day-old (mature adult) were utilized. Each age level was categorized into four groups: 1) Control group - no pre-stressor, no maze, no drug, 2) Innate fear group (M) - no pre-stressor, maze, no drug, 3) Fear-potentiated group (IM) - isolation pre-stressor for 120 min, maze, no drug, and 4) Diazepam-treated group (IMD) - isolation pre-stressor for 120 min, maze, and diazepam administration. Following the tests, the (m PC) and (v Hip) regions were dissected, and Gad1 gene expression changes were assessed using Real-time PCR technique. The results revealed that, across all age groups, Gad1 expression in both the (m PC) and (v Hip) was significantly higher in the fear-potentiated groups (IM) compared to the control and innate fear (M) groups. Notably, in aged 365-day-old rats from the innate fear group (M), the expression of Gad1 in (v Hip) was also higher than that in the control group. Additionally, aged fear-potentiated rats exhibited elevated Gad1 gene expression in both structures compared to other age groups. These findings suggest that isolation stress before exposure to the elevated plus maze (EPM) can elevate Gad1 gene expression in both the (v Hip) and (m PC), and age may play a role in modulating its expression.

AB  - Simple Summary Fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails in humans and animals are the most prevalent mycoses worldwide, with a high economic burden. The high degree of transmissibility poses an epidemiological threat and gives these infections a significant importance as zoonoses. Hence, the control of the presence of dermatophytes in herds of cattle and other species of farm animals should be routinely performed. The ongoing improvements in the field of fungal detection techniques give new scope for clinical implementations in specialized laboratories and hospitals or veterinary clinics, including the monitoring of disease and the detection of side effects of drugs and environmental risks. This study aimed to evaluate the analytical specificity and clinical application of direct sample real-time PCR by comparison with direct microscopy and culture methods. The pan-dermatophyte primers in the qPCR technique facilitated detection of the presence of the genetic material of dermatophytes with greater specificity than the microscopic examination. Moreover, this article describes an interesting case of the isolation of two different species of dermatophytes from the same clinical lesion, i.e., Trichophyton verrucosum and T. benhamiae. Dermatophytes are filamentous fungi with the ability to digest and grow on keratinized substrates. The ongoing improvements in fungal detection techniques give new scope for clinical implementations in laboratories and veterinary clinics, including the monitoring of the disease and carrier status. The technologically advanced methods for dermatophyte detection include molecular methods based on PCR. In this context, the aim of this study was to carry out tests on the occurrence of dermatophytes in cattle herds using qPCR methods and a comparative analysis with conventional methods. Each sample collected from ringworm cases and from asymptomatic cattle was divided into three parts and subjected to the real-time PCR technique, direct light microscopy analysis, and culture-based methods. The use of the real-time PCR technique with pan-dermatophyte primers detected the presence of dermatophytes in the sample with a 10.84% (45% vs. 34.17%) higher efficiency than direct analysis with light microscopy. Moreover, a dermatophyte culture was obtained from all samples with a positive qPCR result. In conclusion, it seems that this method can be used with success to detect dermatophytes and monitor cowsheds in ringworm cases and carriers in cattle.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABA(B)R) has been extensively involved in alcohol use disorders; however, the mechanisms by which this receptor modulates alcohol drinking behavior remain murky. In this study, we investigate alcohol consumption and preference in mice lacking functional GABA(B)R using the 2-bottle choice paradigm. We found that GABA(B(1)), knockout (KO), and heterozygous (HZ) mice drank higher amounts of an alcoholic solution, preferred alcohol to water, and reached higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. The GABA(B)R agonist GHB significantly reduced alcohol consumption in the GABA(B(1)) HZ and WT but not in the KO mice. Next, because of a functional crosstalk between GABA(B)R and delta-containing GABA(A) receptor (delta-GABA(A)R), we profiled delta subunit mRNA expression levels in brain regions in which the crosstalk was characterized. We found a loss of the alcohol-sensitive GABA(A)R delta subunit in the hippocampus of the GABA(B(1)) KO alcohol-naive mice that was associated with increased gamma(2) subunit abundance. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that these molecular changes were associated with increased phasic inhibition, suggesting a potential gain of synaptic GABA(A)R responsiveness to alcohol that has been previously described in an animal model of excessive alcohol drinking. Interestingly, voluntary alcohol consumption did not revert the dramatic loss of hippocampal delta-GABA(A)R occurring in the GABA(B(1)) KO mice but rather exacerbated this condition. Finally, we profiled hippocampal neuroactive steroids levels following acute alcohols administration in the GABA(B(1)) KO and WT mice because of previous involvement of GABA(B)R in the regulation of cerebral levels of these compounds. We found that systemic administration of alcohol (1.5 g/kg) did not produce alcohol-induced neurosteroid response in the GABA(B(1)) KO mice but elicited an expected increase in the hippocampal level of progesterone and 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP in the WT controls. In conclusion, we show that genetic ablation of the GABA(B(1)) subunit results in increased alcohol consumption and preference that were associated with functional changes in hippocampal GABA(A)R, suggesting a potential mechanism by which preference for alcohol consumption is maintained in the GABA(B(1)) KO mice. In addition, we documented that GABA(B(1)) deficiency results in lack of alcohol-induced neurosteroids, and we discussed the potential implications of this finding in the context of alcohol drinking and dependence.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Although transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models have greatly contributed to our understanding of the disease, therapies tested in these animals have resulted in a high rate of failure in preclinical trials for AD. A promising model is Octodon degus (degu), a Chilean rodent that spontaneously develops AD-like neuropathology. Previous studies have reported that, during aging, degus exhibit a progressive decline in cognitive function, reduced neuroinflammation, and concomitant increases in the number and size of amyloid beta (A beta) plaques in several brain regions. Importantly, in humans and several AD models, a correlation has been shown between brain dysfunction and neuronal glucose utilization impairment, a critical aspect considering the high-energy demand of the brain. However, whether degus develop alterations in glucose metabolism remains unknown. In the present work, we measured several markers of glucose metabolism, namely, glucose uptake, ATP production, and glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux, in hippocampal slices from degus of different ages. We found a significant decrease in hippocampal glucose metabolism in aged degus, caused mainly by a drop in glucose uptake, which in turn, reduced ATP synthesis. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between age and PPP flux. Together, our data further support the use of degus as a model for studying the neuropathology involved in sporadic AD-like pathology and as a potentially valuable tool in the search for effective treatments against the disease.

AB  - Endel Tulving defined episodic memory as consisting of a spatiotemporal context. It enables us to recollect personal experiences of people, things, places, and situations. In other words, it is made up of what, where, and when components. However, this definition does not include arguably the most important aspect of episodic memory: the why. Understanding why we remember has important implications to better understand how our memory system works and as a potential target of intervention for memory impairment. The intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to why some experiences are better remembered than others have been widely investigated but largely independently studied. How these factors interact with one another to drive an event to become a lasting memory is still unknown. This review summarizes research examining the why of episodic memory, where we aim to uncover the factors that drive core features of our memory. We discuss the concept of episodic memory examining the what, where, and when, and how the why is essential to each of these key components of episodic memory. Furthermore, we discuss the neural mechanisms known to support our rich episodic memories and how a why signal may provide critical modulatory impact on neural activity and communication. Finally, we discuss the individual differences that may further drive why we remember certain experiences over others. A better understanding of these elements, and how we experience memory in daily life, can elucidate why we remember what we remember, providing important insight into the overarching goal of our memory system.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts a variety of cognitive and behavioral domains. While a genetic component of ASD has been well-established, none of the numerous syndromic genes identified in humans accounts for more than 1% of the clinical patients. Due to this large number of target genes, numerous mouse models of the disorder have been generated. However, the focus on distinct brain circuits, behavioral phenotypes and diverse experimental approaches has made it difficult to synthesize the overwhelming number of model animal studies into concrete throughlines that connect the data across levels of investigation. Here we chose to focus on one circuit, the hippocampus, and one hypothesis, a shift in excitatory/inhibitory balance, to examine, from the level of the tripartite synapse up to the level of in vivo circuit activity, the key commonalities across disparate models that can illustrate a path towards a better mechanistic understanding of ASD's impact on hippocampal circuit function.

AB  - A total of eight ([Landrace x Yorkshire] x Duroc) barrows with an initial body weight (BW) of 33.06 +/- 1.16 kg were placed in metabolism crates. The dietary treatments were structured using a 4 x 2 factorial design, which included two factors: four diet types (i.e., corn-based diet, CON; corn-plain bread meal (PBM)-based diet, PBMD; corn-sweet bread meal (SBM)-based diet, SBMD; and corn-biscuit meal (BM)-based diet (BMD) with or without 0.1% multi-enzyme supplementation). In this study, the concentrations of DE and ME were 4075 and 3981 kcal/kg dry matter (DM) in two-source bakery meals (i.e., PBM and SBM) and 4153 and 4075 kcal/kg DM in BM. The DE and ME (on a DM basis) in the bakery meals (i.e., PBM and SBM) and BM were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in corn. However, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the ATTD of DM, GE, and N among the dietary treatments, multi-enzyme, and their interaction. In summary, the bakery meals and biscuit meals investigated in this study have the potential to partially replace corn. Further research is necessary to ascertain the effects of multi-enzyme supplements on bakery meals and biscuit meals.

AB  - Most researchers assume minimal impact of pretreatment on strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) for bones and teeth, and methods vary tremendously. We compared 14 pretreatment methods, including no prep other than powdering enamel, ashing, soaking in water, an oxidizing agent (bleach or hydrogen peroxide) or acetic acid (0.1 M, 1.0 M, and 1.0 M buffered with calcium acetate), and a combination of these steps. We prepared and analyzed aliquots of powdered molar enamel from three proboscideans (one modern captive Indian elephant, Elephas maximus indicus; one Pleistocene mastodon, Mammut americanum; and one Miocene gomphothere, Afrochoerodon kisumuensis). Each pretreatment was performed in triplicate and we measured 87Sr/86Sr, Sr concentration, and uranium (U) concentration, using the same lab space and instrumentation for all samples. Variability in 87Sr/86Sr and Sr and U concentrations was considerable across pretreatments. Mean 87Sr/86Sr across methods ranged from 0.70999 to 0.71029 for the modern tooth, 0.71458 to 0.71502 for the Pleistocene tooth, and 0.70804 to 0.70817 for the Miocene tooth. The modern tooth contained the least Sr and negligible U. The Pleistocene tooth contained slightly more Sr and measurable amounts of U, and the Miocene tooth had approximately 5x more Sr and U than the Pleistocene tooth. For all three teeth, variance in 87Sr/86Sr, Sr concentrations, and U concentrations among replicates was statistically indistinguishable across pretreatments, but there were apparent differences among pretreatments for the modern and Pleistocene teeth. Both contained relatively little Sr, and it is possible that small amounts of exogenous Sr from reagents, building materials or dust affected some replicates for some pretreatments. For the modern tooth, median 87Sr/86Sr varied considerably (but statistically insignificantly) across pretreatments. For the Pleistocene tooth, variability in median 87Sr/86Sr was also considerable; some pretreatments were statistically distinct but there were no obvious patterns among methods. For the Miocene tooth, variability in median 87Sr/86Sr was much smaller, but there were significant differences among pretreatments. Most pretreatments yielded 87Sr/86Sr and Sr concentrations comparable to, or lower than, untreated powder, suggesting selective removal of exogenous material with high 87Sr/86Sr. Further evaluation of the mechanisms driving isotopic variability both within and among pretreatment methods is warranted. Researchers should clearly report their methods and avoid combining data obtained using different methods. Small differences in 87Sr/86Sr could impact data interpretations, especially in areas where isotopic variability is low.

AB  - Sepsis is characterized by multiple organ dysfunction, dysregulation of the response to the infection process, and a high mortality rate in intensive care units. In addition, individuals who overcome sepsis often manifest cognitive deficits associated with neuroinflammation resulting from the entry of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the brain. Post-translational protein modifications, such as SUMOylation, can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory genes during sepsis. Since SUMO-2/3 can play a role in pathological conditions, our aim was to investigate a potential link between sepsis-induced cognitive decline and SUMOylation by this isoform. Firstly, the cecal slurry model was induced by intraperitoneally injecting male Swiss mice with different volumes of a cecal solution. Following assessment of body temperature, mass and septic scores, the groups that received 300 mu L and 350 mu L of the cecal solution were selected for the behavioural tests, as they presented signs of sepsis without excessive mortality. Surviving animals were evaluated for cognition/memory and anxious/depressivelike behaviours through the open-field, object recognition, Y-maze, and tail suspension tests. Subsequently, SUMO-2/3 conjugation was determined in samples from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex by Western blotting. Mice in the septic groups showed decreased locomotor activity, anxious-and depressive-like behaviours, as well as impaired memory. These deficits were accompanied by a decrease in SUMO-2/3 conjugation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex at 24 h and 10 days after the induction of the cecal slurry model. Taken together, our findings suggest that SUMOylation is impaired in septic animals and this could be related to the behavioural deficits seen in the surviving mice.

AB  - The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has received considerable attention as a potential biomarker of major depressive disorder (MDD) and antidepressant response. We conducted an overview of meta-analyses investigating the relationship of BDNF with MDD, related clinical features, and antidepressant treatment. Based on a systematic screening on main electronic databases, 11 systematic reviews with meta-analyses were included. Available evidence suggests that people with MDD have peripheral and central BDNF levels lower than non-depressed individuals. A negative correlation between blood BDNF and symptom severity emerged, while no association with suicidality was detected. Moreover, an increase in blood BDNF levels after antidepressant treatment, proportional to symptom improvement, was reported. BDNF levels seem to be increased in both treatment responders and remitters, remaining stable in non-responders. Conversely, no variations of BDNF concentrations after non-pharmacological interventions (electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and physical activity) were found. The findings of this overview appear consistent with the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression, suggesting that BDNF may play a role in both MDD pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment response.

AB  - Episodic memory (EM) specifies the experience of retrieving information of an event at the place and time of occurrence. Whether non-human animals are capable of EM remains debated, whereas evidence suggests that they have a memory system akin to EM. We here trace the development of various behavioral paradigms designed to study EM in non-human animals, in particular the rat. We provide an in-depth description of the available behavioral tests which combine three spontaneous object exploration paradigms, namely novel object preference (for measuring memory for "what"), novel location preference (for measuring memory for "where") and temporal order memory (memory for "when"), into a single trial to gauge a memory akin to EM. Most important, we describe a variation of such a test in which each memory component interacts with the others, demonstrating an integration of diverse mnemonic information. We discuss why a behavioral model of EM must be able to assess the ability to integrate "what", "where" and "when" information into a single experience. We attempt an interpretation of the various tests and review the studies that have applied them in areas such as pharmacology, neuroanatomy, circuit analysis, and sleep. Finally, we anticipate future directions in the search for neural mechanisms of EM in the rat and outline model experiments and methodologies in this pursuit.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly abused substance on a global scale and has the capacity to elicit toxicity within the central nervous system. The neurotoxicity induced by METH encompasses neuronal degeneration and cellular demise within the substantia nigra-striatum and hippocampus. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a constituent of propolis, is a diminutive compound that demonstrates antioxidative and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Numerous investigations have demonstrated the safeguarding effects of CAPE in various neurodegenerative ailments. Our hypothesis posits that CAPE may exert a neuroprotective influence on METHinduced neurotoxicity via specific mechanisms. In order to validate the hypothesis, a series of experimental techniques including behavioral tests, immunofluorescence labeling, RNA sequencing, and western blotting were employed to investigate the neurotoxic effects of METH and the potential protective effects of CAPE. The results of our study demonstrate that CAPE effectively ameliorates cognitive memory deficits and anxiety symptoms induced by METH in mice. Furthermore, CAPE has been observed to attenuate the upregulation of neurotoxicityassociated proteins that are induced by METH exposure and also reduced the loss of hippocampal neurons in mice. Moreover, transcriptomics analysis was conducted to determine alterations in gene expression within the hippocampus of mice. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis was employed to investigate the divergent outcomes and identify potential key genes. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) was successfully identified and confirmed through RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques. Our research findings unequivocally demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of CAPE against METH-induced neurotoxicity, with ISG15 may have an important role in the underlying protective mechanism. These results offer novel perspectives on the treatment of METH-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Signaling mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is supported by the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95, has antidepressant effects. Conversely, clinical depression is associated with reduced BDNF signaling. We found that peptidomimetic compounds that bind to PSD-95 promoted signaling by the BDNF receptor TrkB in the hippocampus and reduced depression-like behaviors in mice. The compounds CN2097 and Syn3 both bind to the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95, and Syn3 also binds to an alpha-helical region of the protein. Syn3 reduced depression-like behaviors in two mouse models of stress-induced depression; CN2097 had similar but less potent effects. In hippocampal neurons, application of Syn3 enhanced the formation of TrkB-G alpha(i1/3)-PSD-95 complexes and potentiated downstream PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. In mice subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS), systemic administration of Syn3 reversed the CMS-induced, depression-associated changes in PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, dendrite complexity, spine density, and autophagy in the hippocampus and reduced depression-like behaviors. Knocking out G alpha(i1/3) in hippocampal neurons prevented the therapeutic effects of Syn3, indicating dependence of these effects on the TrkB pathway. The findings suggest that compounds that induce the formation of PSD-95-TrkB complexes have therapeutic potential to alleviate depression.

AB  - Termites are consistently confronted with a complex microbial environment. In addition to the role of their innate immune system in resisting pathogen infection, social immune behavior also plays a significant role in helping termites withstand the stress caused by pathogenic microorganisms. The allogrooming behavior among different individuals is commonly observed in termites, and it plays a crucial role in the social immune interaction network. In the case of Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki), Orco is specifically involved in detecting pheromones and volatile chemicals released by termites to communicate with each other. Nonetheless, the function of Orco in the social immunity remains unreported in O. formosanus. . Consequently, in this study, we recorded the allogrooming behavior of O. formosanus workers under SM1 stress. The results indicated a significant increase in allogrooming behavior due to SM1 infection. The allogrooming behavior of workers under SM1 stress was significantly increased after the addition of soldiers. Compared with pronotum group treated by SM1, SM1 treatment of workers' heads significantly reduced the allogrooming behavior among workers. In addition, we found that SM1 could greatly increase the expression of OforOrco. . Furthermore, interfering with OforOrco could markedly reduce the allogrooming behavior among workers under SM1 stress, and increase the mortality of worker under SM1 stress. This study demonstrated the significant role of OforOrco in the social immunity of O. formosanus, , which offers a theoretical foundation for the advancement of research on termite RNA biopesticides, and the integration of RNA interference (RNAi) with pathogens. This study is valuable for elucidating the social immune behavior and interaction network of termites.

AB  - Lameness in sows causes pain and poor welfare. Early detection is crucial if treatment is likely to be effective. Locomotion scoring is the best way to achieve this, but existing scoring systems are not sensitive enough to detect subtle deviations from optimal locomotion. Our objective was to develop a new visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure the locomotory ability of sows over time. Effectiveness in detecting slight deviations was tested in young female pigs by comparing the scale to an existing categorical scoring system. The VAS detected slight deviations from optimal locomotion over time more effectively than the categorical locomotion scoring system. It was also positively associated with hair cortisol concentrations (chronic stress) and measures of reproductive performance. If used by farmers, the VAS could potentially help in lameness prevention and thereby improve sow welfare and performance.
   Locomotion scoring is crucial for the early detection of lameness, which reduces sow welfare and performance. Our objective was to test the effectiveness of a visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure locomotory ability (OVERALL) compared to a categorical scoring system (CAT) and to investigate associations with hair cortisol and reproductive performance. Locomotion was scored in gilts (n = 51) at service, on day 57 and day 108 of pregnancy, and at weaning, using a VAS (150 mm line: 0 mm (perfect)-150 mm (severely lame)), and a CAT (1 (perfect)-5 (severely lame)). Hair cortisol concentration was measured on day 108 of pregnancy. Reproductive performance data (parity 1-4) were acquired from farm records. VAS detected deviations from optimal locomotion more effectively than the CAT (F-3,F-145 = 2.70; p <= 0.05 versus F-3,F-195 = 2.45; p = 0.065). Higher OVERALL scores at service (REG = 0.003 +/- 0.0012; F-1,F-48 = 4.25; p <= 0.05) and on day 57 (REG = 0.003 +/- 0.0013; F-1,F-48 = 6.95; p <= 0.05) were associated with higher hair cortisol concentrations on day 108. Positive associations were detected between OVERALL at service and the number of piglets born dead (REG = 0.01 +/- 0.006; F-1,F-36 = 4.24; p <= 0.05), and total born (REG = 0.1 +/- 0.03; F-1,F-120 = 4.88; p <= 0.05). The VAS better facilitates early detection of lameness, which could help to prevent detrimental effects, possibly mediated by chronic stress, on reproductive performance.

AB  - Isothiocyanates (ITCs) that are found in Brassicaceae exhibited obvious antifungal activity against Cochliobolus heterostrophus, which is the causal agent of southern corn leaf blight. However, the underlying antifungal mechanism of allyl-ITCs (A-ITCs) against C. heterostrophus remains largely unknown. Here, we used transcriptomic analysis to find that the high osmolarity pathway was upregulated significantly when treated with A-ITCs. To investigate the roles of the high osmolarity pathway in adaption to A-ITCs, we constructed Delta ssk2, Delta pbs2, and Delta hog1 mutant strains. Deletion of three genes (ChSSK2, ChPBS2, and ChHOG1) involved in the high osmolarity pathway resulted in significantly increased sensitivity of C. heterostrophus to ITCs. In addition, the phosphorylation level of ChHog1 was induced by A-ITC and was dependent on the presence of ChSsk2 and ChPbs2. Moreover, Delta ssk2, Delta pbs2, and Delta hog1 mutants exhibited a dramatically decreased virulence on maize leaves. Our findings demonstrated that the high osmolarity pathway played a positive role in ITC tolerance and virulence, which may provide novel insights into developing ITCs as a new fungicide against C. heterostrophus.

AB  - Current cellular hydrogel-based skin grafts composed of human dermal fibroblasts and a hydrogel scaffold tend to minimize contraction of full-thickness skin wounds and support skin regeneration. However, there has been no comparison between the sources of the dermal fibroblast used. Products using human adult or neonatal foreskin dermal fibroblasts are often expanded in vitro and used after multiple passages without a clear understanding of the effects of this initial production step on the quality and reproducibility of the cellular behavior. Based on the known effects of 2D tissue culture expansion on cellular proliferation and gene expression, we hypothesized that differences in donor age and time in culture may influence cellular properties and contractile behavior in a fibroblast-populated collagen matrix. Using porcine skin as a model based on its similarity to human skin in structure and wound healing properties, we isolated porcine dermal fibroblasts of three different donor ages for use in a 2D proliferation assay and in a 3D cell-populated collagen matrix contractility assay. In 2D cell culture, doubling time remained relatively consistent between all age groups from passage 1 to 6. In the contractility assays, fetal and neonatal groups contracted faster and generated more contractile force than the adult group at passage 1 in vitro. However, after five passages in culture, there was no difference in contractility between ages. These results show how cellular responses in a hydrogel scaffold differ based on donor age and time in culture in vitro, and suggest that consistency in the cellular component of bioengineered skin products could be beneficial in the biomanufacturing of consistent, reliable skin grafts and graft in vivo models. Future research and therapies using bioengineered skin grafts should consider how results may vary based on donor age and time in culture before seeding.
   Impact statementLittle is known about the impact of donor cell age and time in culture on the contraction of cellular, hydrogel-based skin grafts. These results show how cellular phenotypes of porcine fibroblasts differ based on donor age and time in culture. This information is beneficial when addressing important inconsistencies in biomanufacturing of bioengineered skin grafts and in vitro models. These findings are relevant to research and therapies using bioengineered skin graft models and the results can be used to increase reproducibility and consistency during the production of bioengineered skin constructs. The information from this study can be extrapolated to future in vivo studies using human dermal fibroblasts in an in vivo model to help determine the best donor age and time in culture for optimal wound healing outcomes or more reproducible in vitro testing constructs.

AB  - BackgroundEarly life stress (ELS) during the stress hypo-responsive period (SHRP) alters the curiosity-like behavior later during adolescence. Previous studies have shown maternal separation (MS) stress-induced heightened curiosity and associated risk-taking behavior in the object retrieval task (ORT). However, the neural correlates of curiosity in adolescent rats predisposed to early life stress remain unexplored. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the neural oscillatory patterns and network characteristics in the regions implicated in curiosity behavior, such as the Prelimbic cortex (PL), Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), and CA1 of the Hippocampus. The local field potentials data were analysed to understand the neural activity patterns in these areas during the risky zone crossing and object retrieval phase of the ORT in MS rats and compared with the normal control (NC) group.ResultsIn comparison to NC, MS rats showed a reduction in the theta power at 8-12 Hz, beta power at 12-20 Hz, and gamma power at 20-40 Hz range in the PL during risky zone crossing time. MS rats also showed reduced cross-correlation between PL-CA1 and reduced theta coherence between NAc-CA1 during risky zone crossing. During the object retrieval phase, the MS rats showed reduced peak cross-correlation between PL-CA1 and PL-NAc. Behaviourally, MS rats displayed an increased preference for the curiosity platform and retrieved more hidden objects, thus accounting for a higher curiosity index than controls.ConclusionIn summary, a reduced synchronization between the PL, NAc, and CA1 during the object retrieval task indicates how early MS stress during a critical developmental period impacts the limbic circuit connectivity. This corresponded with enhanced curiosity index in adolescent MS rats, predicting an altered intrinsic motivation and hence a higher susceptibility to substance use disorders during adolescence.

AB  - The amygdalohippocampal transition area (AHi) has emerged as a critical nucleus of sociosexual behaviors such as mating, parenting, and aggression. The AHi has been overlooked in rodent and human amygdala studies until recently. The AHi is hypothesized to play a role in metabolic and cognitive functions as well as social behaviors based on its connectivity and molecular composition. The AHi is small nucleus rich in neuropeptide and hormone receptors and is contiguous with the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus-hence its designation as a "tran-sition area". Literature focused on the AHi can be difficult to interpret because of changing nomenclature and conflation with neighboring nuclei. Here we summarize what is currently known about AHi structure and development, connections throughout the brain, molecular composition, and functional significance. We aim to delineate current knowledge regarding the AHi, identify potential functions with supporting evidence, and ul-timately make clear the importance of the AHi in sociosexual function.

AB  - The maturation of key corticolimbic structures and the prefrontal cortex during sensitive periods of brain development from early life through adolescence is crucial for the acquisition of a variety of cognitive and affective processes associated with adult behavior. In this chapter, we first review how key cellular and circuit level changes during adolescence dictate the development of the prefrontal cortex and its capacity to integrate contextual and emotional information from the ventral hippocampus and the amygdala. We further discuss how afferent transmission from ventral hippocampal and amygdala inputs displays unique age-dependent trajectories that directly impact prefrontal functional maturation through adolescence. We conclude by proposing that time-sensitive strengthening of specific corticolimbic synapses is a critical contributing factor for the protracted maturation of cognitive and emotional regulation by the prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) make important contributions to learning as they integrate into neuronal networks. Neurogenesis is dramatically reduced by a number of conditions associated with cognitive impairment, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Increasing neurogenesis may thus provide a therapeutic target for ameliorating diabetes-associated cognitive impairments, but only if new neurons remain capable of normal function. To address the capacity for adult-generated neurons to incorporate into functional circuits in the hyperglycemic DG, we measured Egr1 expression in granule cells (GCs), BrdU labeled four weeks prior, in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, an established model of T2DM, and age-matched Wistars. The results indicate that while fewer GCs are generated in the DG of GK rats, GCs that survive readily express Egr1 in response to spatial information. These data demonstrate that adult-generated GCs in the hyperglycemic DG remain functionally competent and support neurogenesis as a viable therapeutic target.

AB  - The noradrenergic systems play a key role in stress triggered disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that traumatic stress will alter expression of norepinephrine transporter (NET) in locus coeruleus (LC) and its target brain regions which could be related to hyperarousal. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to single prolonged stress (SPS) and several weeks later the LC was isolated. NET mRNA levels in LC, determined by RT-PCR, displayed variable response with high and low responsive subgroups. In different cohort, acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured 2 weeks after SPS and levels of NET mRNA and protein in LC determined. The high NET responsive subgroup had greater hyperarousal. Nevertheless, NET protein levels, as determined by western blots, were lower than unstressed controls in LC, ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex and displayed considerable variability. Hypermethylation of specific CpG region in promoter of SLC6A2 gene, encoding NET, was present in the low, but not high, NET mRNA responsive subgroup. Taken together, the results demonstrate variability in stress elicited changes in NET gene expression and involvement of epigenetic changes. This may underlie mechanisms of susceptibility and resilience to traumatic stress triggered neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially hyperarousal.

AB  - Glucose potently enhances cognitive functions whether given systemically or directly to the brain. The present experiments examined changes in brain extracellular glucose levels while rats were trained to solve hippocampus-sensitive place or striatum-sensitive response learning tasks for food or water reward. Because there were no task-related differences in glucose responses, the glucose results were pooled across tasks to form combined trained groups. During the first 1-3 min of training for food reward, glucose levels in extracellular fluid (ECF) declined significantly in the hippocampus and striatum; the declines were not seen in untrained, rewarded rats. When trained for water reward, similar decreases were observed in both brain areas, but these findings were less consistent than those seen with food rewards. After the initial declines in ECF glucose levels, glucose increased in most groups, approaching asymptotic levels similar to 15-30 min into training. Compared to untrained food controls, training with food reward resulted in significant glucose increases in the hippocampus but not striatum; striatal glucose levels exhibited large increases to food intake in both trained and untrained groups. In rats trained to find water, glucose levels increased significantly above the values seen in untrained rats in both hippocampus and striatum. The decreases in glucose early in training might reflect an increase in brain glucose consumption, perhaps triggering increased brain uptake of glucose from blood, as evident in the increases in glucose later in training. The increased brain uptake of glucose may provide additional neuronal metabolic substrate for metabolism or provide astrocytic substrate for production of glycogen and lactate.

AB  - Ghrelin is a peptide, secreted mainly from the stomach. But, it is also produced in the brain. Studies have confirmed the positive impact of ghrelin on memory formation. However, the expression levels of ghrelin or its receptors were not measured in the brain during the process of memory formation. The probable alteration in the expression levels of ghrelin or its receptors in the brain during memory formation can be a reason for the contribution of its signaling in this process. We quantified the gene expression levels of ghrelin and its receptors in the hippocampus during fear and spatial memory consolidation. Thirty- nine adult male Wistar rats weighing 180-220 g were utilized. Memory consolidation was evaluated using the inhibitory avoidance task and Morris water maze. Rats were euthanized at different times (1, 3, and 24 h) post-training and their hippocampi were removed and freezed directly in liquid nitrogen. Quantitative real-time polymerize chain reaction (PCR) was used to quantify the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of the hippocampal ghrelin and its receptors. The mRNA levels of ghrelin exhibited a significant increase, 24 h post-training in the inhibitory avoidance task, while its receptor levels were down-regulated. Also, the mRNA expression levels of the hippocampal ghrelin were not changed significantly during memory consolidation in the Morris water maze, while its receptor showed a significant increase, 24 h post-training. The results show a differential profile of the expression levels of the hippocampal ghrelin or its receptor mRNA during fear or spatial memory consolidation. This proposes that a local increase in the hippocampal ghrelin or its receptor levels might be crucial for fear, and spatial memory consolidation. However, due to the small sample sizes, it is worth noting the preliminary nature of the conclusions in the present study.

AB  - In domestic mammals, cold stress decreases the survival rate of newborns and increases the cost of management. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the main thermogenic organ for cubs, and well-developed fetal BAT (FBAT) is beneficial for newborns to maintain core temperatures during the first several days of life. However, our knowledge of the epigenetic mechanisms during the early development of FBAT remains largely unknown. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are economically important domestic animals. In this study, a histological analysis shows that the tissue content, thermogenic capacity, and lipid content of FBAT dramatically increases from gestational day 21 (G21) to gestational day 24 (G24) in rabbits. RNA-seq, microRNA-seq (miRNA-seq), and the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) show that many genes, miRNAs, and chromatin-accessible regions (referred to as peaks) were identified as significantly changed from G21 to G24, respectively. The upregulated genes from G21 to G24 were significantly enriched in the mitochondrial metabolism and thermogenesis-related signal pathways. The integrated analysis of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility reveals that the peaks in the promoters have a more regulatory effect than peaks in other genomic elements on the expression of their nearby genes in FBATs. The upregulated genes that are associated with increased chromatin accessibility in the promoter regions are involved in the energy metabolism-related signaling pathways. The genes that have a greater tendency to be regulated by miRNAs than the chromatin accessibility in gene promoters are involved in the apelin, insulin, and endocytosis signaling pathways. Furthermore, genome-wide transcription factor (TF) footprinting analysis identifies early B-cell factor1 (EBF1) as playing a key role during early FBAT development. The carbon metabolism, citrate cycle, and PPAR signaling pathways are significantly enriched by the predicted EBF1-regulated cascade TF-network. In conclusion, our work provides a framework for understanding epigenetics regulatory mechanisms underlying the early development of FBAT and identifies potential TF involved in the early development of FBAT in rabbits.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel hybrid optimization technique aimed at improving the prediction accuracy of solar photovoltaic (PV) outputs using an Improved Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm (IHO). The IHO enhances the traditional Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm by addressing its limitations in search efficiency, convergence speed, and global exploration. The IHO algorithm used Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) for population initialization, significantly enhancing the diversity and global search potential of the optimization process. The integration of the Jaya algorithm further refines solution quality and accelerates convergence. Additionally, a combination of unordered dimensional sampling, random crossover, and sequential mutation is employed to enhance the optimization process. The effectiveness of the proposed IHO is demonstrated through the optimization of weights and neuron thresholds in the extreme learning machine (ELM), a model known for its rapid learning capabilities but often affected by the randomness of initial parameters. The IHO-optimized ELM (IHO-ELM) is tested against benchmark algorithms, including BP, the traditional ELM, the HO-ELM, LCN, and LSTM, showing significant improvements in prediction accuracy and stability. Moreover, the IHO-ELM model is validated in a different region to assess its generalization ability for solar PV output prediction. The results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, making it a promising tool for predictive modeling in solar energy systems.

AB  - It has been estimated that up to a third of all rams have little to no sexual interest in ewes. Despite the prevalence of this issue, it is challenging to monitor the reproductive behaviour of individual sheep in an extensive farming environment. In this study, we developed a single-feature algorithm to detect in-paddock mounting activity from the accelerometer records of rams and androgenised wethers. Tri-axial accelerometers were first deployed on the necks and withers of the rams (n = 15) in a controlled pen test to determine the optimal attachment point for detecting mounting events. A Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) algorithm was applied to accelerometer data with a threshold of 0.3 g. Validation and performance evaluation of the algorithm was based on observed video footage. The MACD was more sensitive and precise when applied to data collected from the withers than the neck (100% vs 89%; 98% vs 86%; respectively). Following the pen test, the MACD was applied to data collected in-paddock from accelerometers attached to the withers of rams (n = 6) and androgenised wethers (n = 8). A MACD + was simultaneously evaluated, which included additional conditions that must be satisfied for the detected peak to be deemed a mounting event. For both algorithms, a series of thresholds were tested. The threshold that returned the highest F1 score (the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity) for the respective algorithm and male type was selected as the optimal threshold. At their respective optimal thresholds, the MACD + was marginally more precise than the MACD in-paddock for both wethers (91% vs 84%, respectively) and rams (94% vs 84%, respectively). The sensitivity of the MACD in detecting in-paddock mounting behaviour was 91% in rams and 86% in wethers. The MACD + was similarly sensitive at 91% for both rams and wethers. This research demonstrates the success of this algorithm, particularly the MACD+, in detecting mounting activity. Following integration into a commercial sensor and further validation, this algorithm would allow producers to identify rams with low libido and improve reproduction and productivity.

AB  - Chronic heart failure is associated with reduced myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor expression and mitochondrial function. Since these data coincide with increased plasma catecholamine levels, we investigated the relation between myocardial beta-receptor expression and mitochondrial respiratory activity under conditions of physiological catecholamine concentrations. This post hoc analysis used material of a prospective randomized, controlled study on 12 sexually mature (age 20-24 weeks) Early Life Stress or control pigs (weaning at day 21 and 28-35 after birth, respectively) of either sex. Measurements in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and instrumented animals comprised serum catecholamine (liquid-chromatography/tandem-mass-spectrometry) and 8-isoprostane levels, whole blood superoxide anion concentrations (electron spin resonance), oxidative DNA strand breaks (tail moment in the "comet assay"), post mortem cardiac tissue mitochondrial respiration, and immunohistochemistry (beta 2-adrenoreceptor, mitochondrial respiration complex, and nitrotyrosine expression). Catecholamine concentrations were inversely related to myocardial mitochondrial respiratory activity and beta 2-adrenoceptor expression, whereas there was no relation to mitochondrial respiratory complex expression. Except for a significant, direct, non-linear relation between DNA damage and noradrenaline levels, catecholamine concentrations were unrelated to markers of oxidative stress. The present study suggests that physiological variations of the plasma catecholamine concentrations, e.g., due to physical and/or psychological stress, may affect cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptor expression and mitochondrial respiration.

AB  - Age-related reduction in spine density, synaptic marker expression, and synaptic efficiency are frequently reported. These changes provide the cellular and molecular basis for the cognitive decline characteristic for old age. Nevertheless, there are several approaches that have the potential to ameliorate these processes and improve cognition, caloric restriction being one of the most promising and widely studied. While lifelong caloric restriction is known for its numerous beneficial effects, including improved cognitive abilities and increased expression of proteins essential for synaptic structure and function, the effects of late-onset and/or short-term CR on synaptic plasticity have yet to be investigated. We have previously documented that the effects of CR are strongly dependent on whether CR is initiated in young or old subjects. With this in mind, we conducted a long-term study in aging Wistar rats to examine changes in the expression of several key synaptic markers under the regimen of CR started at different time points in life. We found a significant increase in the expression of both presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. However, taking into account previously reported changes in the behavior detected in these animals, we consider that this increase cannot represent beneficial effect of CR.

AB  - Measuring distances in biology at the molecular level is of great importance for understanding the structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules and their complexes. Pulsed Dipolar Spectroscopy (PDS) offers advantages with respect to othermethods as it is uniquely sensitive and specific to electronic spin centers and allows measurements in near-native conditions, comprising the in-cell environment. PDSmethods measure the electron spin-spin dipolar interaction, therefore they require the presence of at least two paramagnetic centers, which are often stable radicals. Recent developments have introduced transient triplet states, photo-activated by a laser pulse, as spin labels and probes, thereby establishing a new family of techniques-Light-induced PDS (LiPDS). In this chapter, an overview of these methods is provided, looking at the chromophores that can be used for LiPDS and some of the technical aspects of the experiments. A guide to the choice of technique that can yield the best results, depending on the type of system studied and the information required, is provided. Examples of previous LiPDS studies of model systems and proteins are given. Characterization data for the chromophores used in these studies is tabulated to help selection of appropriate triplet state probes in future studies.

AB  - Predictive processing has become a leading theory about how the brain works. Yet, it remains an open question how predictive processes are realized in the brain. Here I discuss theta-gamma coupling as one potential neural mechanism for prediction and model updating. Building on Lisman and colleagues SOCRATIC model, thetagamma coupling has been associated with phase precession and learning phenomena in medio-temporal lobe of rodents, where it completes and retains a sequence of places or items (i.e., predictive models). These sequences may be updated upon prediction errors (i.e., model updating), signaled by dopaminergic inputs from prefrontal networks. This framework, spanning the molecular to the network level, matches excitingly well with recent findings on predictive processing, mnemonic updating, and perceptual foraging for the theta-gamma code in human cognition. In sum, I use the case of theta-gamma coupling to link the predictive processing account, a very general concept of how the brain works, to specific neural processes which may implement predictive processing and model updating at the cognitive, network, cellular and molecular level.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that stressful stimuli induced an adaptive response of reduced nociception, known as stress-induced analgesia (SIA). Since orexin neuropeptides are involved in pain modulation, and orexin neurons, primarily located in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), project to various hippocampal regions, such as the dentate gyrus (DG), the current study aimed to examine the role of orexin receptors within the DG region in the restraint SIA in the animal model of chronic pain. One hundred-thirty adult male Wistar rats (230-250 g) were unilaterally implanted with a cannula above the DG region. Animals were given SB334867 or TCS OX2 29 (1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol, 0.5 mu l/rat) into the DG region as orexin-1 receptor (OX1r) and orexin-2 receptor (OX2r) antagonists, respectively, five min before exposure to a 3-hour restraint stress (RS) period. Animals were then undergone the formalin test to assess pain-related behaviors as the animal model of chronic pain. The results showed that RS produces an analgesic response during the early and late phases of the formalin test. However, intra-DG microinjection of OX1r and OX2r antagonists attenuated the restraint SIA. OX2r antagonist was more potent than OX1r antagonist in the early phase of the formalin test, while OX1r antagonist was little more effective in the late phase. Predominantly, it could be concluded that the orexinergic system in the DG region might act as a potential endogenous pain control system and a novel target for treating stress-related disorders.

AB  - Connectivity of the brain at rest can reflect individual differences and impact behavioral outcomes, including memory. The present study investigated how culture influences functional connectivity with regions of the medial temporal lobe. In this study, 46 Americans and 59 East Asians completed a resting state scan after encoding pictures of objects. To investigate cross-cultural differences in resting state functional connectivity, left parahippocampal gyrus (anterior and posterior regions) and left hippocampus were selected as seed regions. These regions were selected, because they were previously implicated in a study of cultural differences during the successful encoding of detailed memories. Results revealed that left posterior parahippocampal gyrus had stronger connectivity with temporo-occipital regions for East Asians compared with Americans and stronger connectivity with parieto-occipital regions for Americans compared with East Asians. Left anterior parahippocampal gyrus had stronger connectivity with temporal regions for East Asians than Americans and stronger connectivity with frontal regions for Americans than East Asians. Although connectivity did not relate to memory performance, patterns did relate to cultural values. The degree of independent self-construal and subjective value of tradition were associated with functional connectivity involving left anterior parahippocampal gyrus. Findings are discussed in terms of potential cultural differences in memory consolidation or more general trait or state-based processes, such as holistic versus analytic processing.

AB  - Classical notion claims that a memory is implicit if has nothing to do with consciousness during the information retrieval from storage, or is otherwise explicit. Here, we demonstrate event-related potential evidence for involuntary consciousness during implicit memory retrieval. We designed a passive oddball paradigm for retrieval of implicit memory in which an auditory stream of Shepard tones with musical pitch interval contrasts were delivered to the subjects. These contrasts evoked a mismatch negativity response, which is an event-related potential and a neural marker of implicit memory, in the subjects with long-term musical training, but not in the subjects without. Notably, this response was followed by a salient P3 component which implies involvement of involuntary consciousness in the implicit memory retrieval. Finally, source analysis of the P3 revealed moving dipoles from the frontal lobe to the insula, a brain region closely related to conscious attention. Our study presents a case of involvement of involuntary consciousness in the implicit memory retrieval and suggests a potential challenge to the classical definition of implicit memory.

AB  - Adequate oxygen supply is essential for the human brain to meet its high energy demands. Therefore, elaborate molecular and systemic mechanism are in place to enable adaptation to low oxygen availability. Anxiety and depressive disorders are characterized by alterations in brain oxygen metabolism and of its components, such as mitochondria or hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-pathways. Conversely, sensitivity and tolerance to hypoxia may depend on parameters of mental stress and the severity of anxiety and depressive disorders. Here we discuss relevant mechanisms of adaptations to hypoxia, as well as their involvement in mental stress and the etiopathogenesis of anxiety and depressive disorders. We suggest that mechanisms of adaptations to hypoxia (including metabolic responses, inflammation, and the activation of chemosensitive brain regions) modulate and are modulated by stress-related pathways and associated psychiatric diseases. While severe chronic hypoxia or dysfunctional hypoxia adaptations can contribute to the pathogenesis of anxiety and depressive disorders, harnessing controlled responses to hypoxia to increase cellular and psychological resilience emerges as a novel treatment strategy for these diseases.

AB  - While there is a strong focus on the negative consequences of maternal immune activation (MIA) on developing brains, very little attention is directed towards potential advantages of early life challenges. In this study, we utilized a polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) MIA model to test visual paired discrimination (PD) and reversal learning (RL) in mice using touchscreen technology. Significant sex differences emerged in that MIA reduced the latency for males to make a correct choice in the PD task while females reached criterion sooner, made fewer errors, and utilized fewer correction trials in RL compared to saline controls. These surprising improvements were accompanied by the sex-specific upregulation of several genes critical to cognitive functioning, indicative of compensatory plasticity in response to MIA. In contrast, when exposed to a 'two-hit' stress model (MIA + loss of the social component of environmental enrichment [EE]), mice did not display anhedonia but required an increased number of PD and RL correction trials. These animals also had significant reductions of CamK2a mRNA in the prefrontal cortex. Appropriate functioning of synaptic plasticity, via mediators such as this protein kinase and others, are critical for behavioral flexibility. Although EE has been implicated in, delaying the appearance of symptoms associated with certain brain disorders, these findings are in line with evidence that it also makes individuals more vulnerable to its loss. Overall, with the right 'dose', early life stress exposure can confer at least some functional advantages, which are lost when the number or magnitude of these exposures become too great.

AB  - Background Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic recurrent intestinal inflammatory disease, often accompanied by poor adaptation and excessive stress response. However, the potential neurological mechanisms of these symptoms have not yet been studied in-depth.
   Objective To investigate alterations in brain activity in patients with Crohn's disease and study the relationship between altered regions and clinical indices.
   Methods A total of 15 CD patients and 26 matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants underwent fMRI scans. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) assessed differences in spontaneous regional brain activity. Differences between the groups were selected as seeds for functional connectivity (FC) analyses. Correlations between disease duration and ALFF/ReHo/FC values in abnormal regions were analyzed.
   Results Patients with CD had significantly higher ALFF values in the left superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary motor area, and lower values in the left hippocampus. They also had higher ReHo values in the left anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, putamen, and the bilateral superior frontal gyri. FC strength in the left precentral and middle temporal gyri was found to be increased when the left superior frontal gyrus was used as the seed point. FC strength was also observed to be increased in the left postcentral, middle frontal gyri, inferior frontal orbital cortex, and right rolandic operculum when the left anterior cingulate cortex was used as the seed point.
   Conclusion CD demonstrated abnormal neural activity and FC in various regions primarily associated with emotional, pain and cognitive-related functions, which provides more information to further understand the neural mechanisms of the disease.

AB  - Background: Black tea processing conditions significantly affect the final taste and flavor profiles, so researchers are now focusing on developing equipment and improving the appropriate processing conditions of major black tea varieties. Methods: Here, we tested the effect of four different initial drying temperatures, i.e., R65 (65 degrees C), R85 (85 degrees C), R105 (105 degrees C), and R125 (125 degrees C), on the sensory and biochemical profiles and volatilome of the black tea variety "Lishui wild" (LWV). Results: Our results indicate that both 85 and 105 degrees C are better than 65 and 125 degrees C for initial drying for 20 min. R105 had the highest sensory evaluation scores due to better shape, aroma, taste, leaf base, thearubigins, theanine, caffeine, and ratio of theaflavins + thearubigins to theaflavins. Both R85 and R105 had higher catechins than R65 and R125. The LWV volatilome consisted of esters (19.89%), terpenoids (18.95%), ketones (11.3%), heterocyclic compounds (9.99%), and alcohols (8.59%). In general, acids, aldehydes, amines, aromatics, ethers, hydrocarbons, phenols, sulfur compounds, and terpenoids accumulated in higher amounts in R85 and R105. The highly accumulated compounds in R105 were associated with green, fruity, sweet, woody, floral, hawthorn, mild, nutty, powdery, rose, and rosy flavors. The main pathways affected are secondary metabolites, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, ABC transport, glutathione metabolism, etc. Therefore, R105 can be used to achieve the optimal taste, flavor, and aroma of LWV. Conclusions: Overall, the presented data can be used by the tea industry for processing black tea with the most optimum volatile substances, catechins, theanine, amino acids, and other compounds.

AB  - Background: Camellia japonica radix (CJR), derived from the root of Camellia japonica L., has the potential to function as an herbal tea substitute for the prevention and intervention of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It can provide systemic therapeutic benefits, boast a favorable safety profile, facilitate convenient consumption, and support long-term applicability. Despite its potential, research on CJR remains limited. Purpose: The aim of this study aims is to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of CJR in MASLD, thereby providing evidence to support its clinical application. Methods: The therapeutic effects of CJR were evaluated using a water-supplementation model in MASLD mice. Integrated microbiome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses were employed to comprehensively explore the mechanisms involved. A drug-target pull-down assay was performed to identify specific protein targets of small molecule metabolites in vitro. Fecal microbiota transplantation in antibiotic-treated ABX mice was conducted to confirm the critical role of gut microbiota and its metabolites. Furthermore, customized medicated feed supplemented with linoleic acid was used to explore the intervention effect of its metabolite, 9 (S)-HpODE, as well as to evaluate its dietary intervention potential. Results: This present study explicitly elucidates the efficacy of CJR extract in alleviating hepatic inflammation and steatosis in a MASLD model mice, with its pharmacological mechanism associated with gut microbiota, linoleic acid metabolism, and GPX4-mediated ferroptosis. Notably, 9(S)-HpODE was discovered to be a key metabolite of linoleic acid, which could target both KEAP1 and SLC7A11, bidirectionally regulating GPX4mediated ferroptosis, while acting as a signaling molecule at low doses to induce redox adaptation via oxidative preconditioning, thus ameliorating oxidative stress in MASLD. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that both CJR and linoleic acid exhibit significant potential as dietary interventions for the management of MASLD, offering promising avenues for future research and clinical application.

AB  - Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays an anti-inflammatory role in several pathological processes, but its function in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) is still unknown. We designed a study to investigate the function of NRF2 in LPS-induced gEECs. LPS was found to increase the NRF2 expression and the nuclear abundance of NRF2 in gEECs in a dose-dependent manner. NRF2 knockout (KO) not only increased the expression of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8) but also increased the expression of TLR4, p-I kappa B alpha/I kappa B alpha, and p-p65/p65 proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NRF2 directly binds to p65 in the nucleus and inhibits the binding of p65 to downstream target genes (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8). Even though a NF-kappa B/p65 inhibitor (PDTC) reduced the LPS-induced NRF2 expression and nuclear abundance of NRF2, overexpressing TNF-alpha reversed the inhibitory effects of PDTC on the NRF2 expression and on its abundance in the nucleus. Similarly, knockdown of the proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, or IL-8) significantly decreased the LPS-induced NRF2 expression and NRF2 in the nucleus. In conclusion, our data suggest that proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS through the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway promote the NRF2 expression and its translocation into the nucleus. Our work also suggests that NRF2 inhibits the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by directly binding to p65.

AB  - The cellular trafficking pathways that conduct zinc to its sites of binding in functional proteins remain largely unspecified. In this study, the hypothesis was investigated that nonspecific proteomic binding sites serve as intermediates in zinc trafficking. Proteome from pig kidney LLC-PK1 cells contains a large concentration of such sites, displaying an average conditional stability constant of 10(10-11), that are dependent on sulfhydryl ligands to achieve high-affinity binding of zinc. As a result, the proteome competes effectively with induced metallothionein for Zn2+ upon exposure of cells to extracellular Zn2+ or during in vitro direct competition. The reaction of added Zn2+ bound to proteome with apo-carbonic anhydrase was examined as a potential model for intracellular zinc trafficking. The extent of this reaction was inversely dependent upon proteome concentration and under cellular conditions thought to be negligible. The rate of reaction was strictly first order in both Zn2+ and apo-carbonic anhydrase, and also considered to be insignificant in cells. Adding the lowmolecularweight fraction of cell supernatant to the proteomemarkedly enhanced the speed of this reaction, a phenomenon dependent on the presence of glutathione (GSH). In agreement, inclusion of GSH accelerated the reaction in a concentration-dependent manner. The implications of abundant high-affinity binding sites for Zn2+ within the proteome are considered in relation to their interaction with GSH in the efficient delivery of Zn2+ to functional binding sites and in the operation of fluorescent zinc sensors as a tool to observe zinc trafficking.

AB  - The endangered Asian elephant, Thailand's national symbol, is increasingly affected by human-elephant conflict (HEC), now a critical conservation and socio-economic concern. This study examined 341 HEC occurrences in 34 out of 77 Thai provinces between 2014 and 2023, based on data from official and private sources. These events resulted in both human and elephant casualties and property damage. Occurrences peaked in 2018 and 2023, with significant associations found between conflict rates, regions, and periods. The Eastern region and the July-to-October period (the rainy season) emerged as key high-risk areas, likely related to additional factors such as high elephant densities and abundant crop production. Most HECs occurred in agricultural land, where elephants searched for food. The findings suggest that the July-to-October period requires heightened surveillance and additional preventive actions. The Eastern region remains a priority for intervention due to its ongoing vulnerability and the movement of elephants across provincial boundaries. Furthermore, the rise of the Northeastern region as a new hotspot underlines the need for proactive measures to prevent escalation.

AB  - Aging results in a decline in neural stem cells (NSCs), neurogenesis, and cognitive function, and evidence is emerging to demonstrate disrupted adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of patients with several neurode-generative disorders. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing of the dentate gyrus of young and old mice shows that the mitochondrial protein folding stress is prominent in activated NSCs/neural progenitors (NPCs) among the neurogenic niche, and it increases with aging accompanying dysregulated cell cycle and mitochondrial activ-ity in activated NSCs/NPCs in the dentate gyrus. Increasing mitochondrial protein folding stress results in compromised NSC maintenance and reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, neural hyperactivity, and impaired cognitive function. Reducing mitochondrial protein folding stress in the dentate gyrus of old mice improves neurogenesis and cognitive function. These results establish the mitochondrial protein folding stress as a driver of NSC aging and suggest approaches to improve aging-associated cognitive decline.

AB  - Oncolytic viruses are being developed as novel strategies for cancer therapy. Our previous studies have shown that vaccinia viruses armed with marine lectins improved the antitumor efficacy in diverse cancer types. The objective of this study was to assess the cytotoxic effects of oncoVV harboring Tachypleus tridentatus lectin (oncoVV-TTL), Aphrocallistes vastus lectin (oncoVV-AVL), white-spotted charr lectin (oncoVV-WCL), and Asterina pectinifera lectin (oncoVV-APL) on HCC. Our data revealed that the effects of recombinant viruses on Hep-3B cells were oncoVV-AVL > oncoVV-APL > oncoVV-TTL > oncoVV-WCL; oncoVV-AVL showed stronger cytotoxicity than oncoVV-APL, while oncoVV-TTL/WCL had no effect on cell killing in Huh7 cells, and PLC/PRF/5 cells exhibited sensitivity to oncoVV-AVL/TTL but not to oncoVV-APL/WCL. The cytotoxicity of oncoVV-lectins could be enhanced by apoptosis and replication in a cell-type-dependent manner. Further research revealed that AVL may mediate various pathways, including MAPK, Hippo, PI3K, lipid metabolism, and androgen pathways through AMPK crosstalk, to promote oncoVV replication in HCC in a cell-dependent manner. OncoVV-APL replication could be affected by AMPK/Hippo/lipid metabolism pathways in Hep-3B cells, AMPK/Hippo/PI3K/androgen pathways in Huh7 cells, and AMPK/Hippo pathways in PLC/PRF/5 cells. OncoVV-WCL replication was also multi-mechanistic, which could be affected by AMPK/JNK/lipid metabolism pathways in Hep-3B cells, AMPK/Hippo/androgen pathways in Huh7 cells, and AMPK/JNK/Hippo pathways in PLC/PRF/5 cells. In addition, AMPK and lipid metabolism pathways may play critical roles in oncoVV-TTL replication in Hep-3B cells, and oncoVV-TTL replication in Huh7 cells may depend on AMPK/PI3K/androgen pathways. This study provides evidence for the application of oncolytic vaccinia viruses in hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - As power grids scale and aging assets edge toward obsolescence, grounding grid corrosion has become a critical vulnerability. Conventional diagnosis must fit high-dimensional electrical data to a physical model, typically yielding a nonlinear under-determined system fraught with computational burden and uncertainty. We propose the Enhanced Biomimetic Hippopotamus Optimization (EBOHO) algorithm, which distills the river-dwelling hippo's ecological wisdom into three synergistic strategies: a beta-function herd seeding that replicates the genetic diversity of juvenile hippos diffusing through wetlands, an elite-mean cooperative foraging rule that echoes the way dominant bulls steer the herd toward nutrient-rich pastures, and a lens imaging opposition maneuver inspired by moonlit water reflections that spawn mirror candidates to avert premature convergence. Benchmarks on the CEC 2017 suite and four classical design problems show EBOHO's superior global search, robustness, and convergence speed over numerous state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, including prior hippo variants. An industrial case study on grounding grid corrosion further confirms that EBOHO swiftly resolves the under-determined equations and pinpoints corrosion sites with high precision, underscoring its promise as a nature-inspired diagnostic engine for aging power system infrastructure.

AB  - Sauropod dinosaurs were abundant and diverse across much of the globe throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and include the largest terrestrial animals of all time. Since the discovery of the first near-complete skeletons in the late 19th century, sauropods have been almost universally interpreted as herbivorous. However, our concept of their diet is based on indirect evidence and inference since no sauropod fossilized gut contents (cololites) are known. Here, we describe a cololite associated with a specimen of the sauropod Diamantinasaurus matildae from the mid-Cretaceous (similar to 101-94 Ma) Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia. The cololite is hosted within an indurated rock layer, localized to the abdominal region, and closely and consistently associated with a layer of mineralized skin. Conifer pinnules, angiosperm leaves, and seed-fern fruiting bodies are preserved within, as are chemical biomarkers consistent with gymnosperms and angiosperms. This Diamantinasaurus cololite provides the first direct, empirical evidence in sauropods of herbivory, demonstrating generalist feeding, low-to high-level browsing, and minimal oral processing of food. The longevity of the clade Sauropoda was underpinned by the persistence through time of generalist feeders like Diamantinasaurus that were capable of feeding at a range of heights on a variety of different plant species.

AB  - Sex differences in declarative memory are described in humans, revealing a female or a male advantage depending on the task. Specifically, spatial memory (i.e., spatial navigation) is typically most efficient in men. This sexual dimorphism has been replicated in male rats but not clearly in mice. In this study, sex differences in spatial memory were assessed in thirty-six C57BL/6 J mice (Janvier Labs; i.e., C57BL/6JRj mice), a widely used mouse substrain. Both male and female mice (12 weeks-old) were subjected to standard behavioral paradigms: the elevated plus maze, the open field test, the novel object and place tests, the forced swimming test, and the water maze test for spatial navigation. Across assessment, no sex differences were found in measures of locomotor activity, emotional and behavioral responses, and object and place recognition memories. In the water maze, male mice were faster in learning the platform location in the reference memory training and used more spatial strategies during the first training days. However, both sexes reached a similar asymptotic performance and performed similarly in the probe trial for long-term memory consolidation. No sex differences were found in the cued training, platform inversion sessions, or spatial working memory sessions. Hippocampal expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor was similar in both sexes, either in basal conditions or after performing the behavioral training battery. Importantly, female mice were not more variable than males in any measure analyzed. This outcome encourages the investigation of sex differences in animal models and the usefulness of including female mice in behavioral research.

AB  - Adult rodents exhibit an exceptional ability to retrieve context fear memories across lengthy retention intervals. In contrast, these memories established in younger rodents are susceptible to significant forgetting. The present study aimed to examine the persistence of contextual fear memories established in juvenile and adult Long-Evans male and female rats. Testing 1-day after conditioning, adult males exhibited evidence for greater conditioning than juvenile males, while in females, conditioning did not differ between juvenile and adult rats. In adults, males displayed greater conditioning than females, while in juveniles, males and females reached similar conditioning levels. At the 60-day retention interval, adult sex differences were maintained; however, juvenile rats failed to retrieve this remote contextual fear memory. Next, we examined whether a savings test procedure could recover these remotely established juvenile memories. Following a 60-day retention test, the now adult rats were presented with an additional context-shock pairing to assess the level of savings. While this procedure produced greater conditioning in males than females, the relative savings of this early life memory were similar in males and females. The results of these experiments indicate that adult sex differences in contextual fear memory are maintained across an extended retention interval, while in juveniles, there were no significant sex differences. A novel finding in the present study was that both male and female rats failed to retrieve an initial juvenile memory following an extended retention interval. However, these memories were recovered with a single reminder of the original juvenile experience.

AB  - The consolidation of declarative memories is believed to occur mostly during sleep and involves a dialogue between two brain regions, the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. The information encoded during experience by neuronal assemblies is replayed during sleep leading to the progressive strengthening and integration of the memory trace in the prefrontal cortex. The gradual transfer of information from the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex for long-term storage requires the synchronization of cortico-hippocampal networks by different oscillations, like ripples, spindles, and slow oscillations. Recent studies suggest the involvement of a third partner, the nucleus reuniens, in memory consolidation. Its bidirectional connections with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex place the reuniens in a key position to relay information between the two structures. Indeed, many topical works reveal the original role that the nucleus reuniens occupies in different recent and remote memories consolidation. This review aimed to examine these contributions, as well as its functional embedment in this complex memory network, and provide some insights on the possible mechanisms.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial profile of semen collected from Holstein Friesian breeding bulls via a high-throughput sequencing approach for a 16S rRNA gene variability analysis. A total of 55 fresh semen samples of sexually mature breeding bulls were used in the study. They were gathered from Holstein Friesian breeding bulls at Slovak Biological Services in Nitra, Slovak Republic. To amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, universal primers 515F and 806R enhanced by a 6 bp barcode identification sequence were used. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing strategy was used. Two microbial clusters were identified among the analyzed samples-the first cluster was based on Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, while the second cluster contained a high prevalence of Fusobacteria.Bacterial contamination of semen is an important factor connected to the health status of bulls that may significantly affect semen quality for artificial insemination. Moreover, some important bovine diseases may be transmitted through semen. Up to now, only a very limited number of complex studies describing the semen microbiome of bulls have been published, as many bacteria are hard to cultivate using traditional techniques. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing strategy allows for the reliable identification of bacterial profiles of bovine semen together with the detection of noncultivable bacterial species. Fresh samples from Holstein Friesian breeding bulls (n = 55) were examined for the natural variability in the present bacteria. Semen doses were selected randomly from Slovak Biological Services in Nitra, Slovak Republic. The most predominant phyla within the whole dataset were Firmicutes (31%), Proteobacteria (22%), Fusobacteria (18%), Actinobacteria (13%) and Bacteroidetes (12%). Samples of semen were divided into two separate clusters according to their microbiome compositions using a cording partition around a medoids analysis. Microbiomes of the first cluster (CL1) of samples (n = 20) were based on Actinobacteria (CL1 average = 25%; CL = 28%) and Firmicutes (CL1 = 38%; CL2 = 27%), while the second cluster (CL2; n = 35) contained samples characterized by a high prevalence of Fusobacteria (CL1 = 4%; CL2 = 26%). Some important indicator microbial groups were differentially distributed between the clusters.

TI  - A novel nuclear receptor NR1D1 suppresses HSD17B12 transcription to regulate granulosa cell apoptosis and autophagy via the AMPK pathway in sheep

AB  - Dominant follicular development and atresia are governed by the proliferation of granulosa cells (GCs), a process influenced by the delicate balance between apoptosis and autophagy. Oxidative stress, a pivotal catalyst of GCs apoptosis, modulates gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms underpinning GCs functionality in relation to prolificacy remain inadequately elucidated. In this study, we discovered that the chromatin accessibility of nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1) was markedly enhanced in dominant follicular GCs from low-prolificacy sheep, as evidenced by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATACseq), which correlated with elevated NR1D1 transcript levels. Remarkably, NR1D1 emerged as a novel regulator of follicular development, exhibiting heightened expression in dominant follicles. The overexpression of NR1D1 induced cell cycle arrest, autophagy activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction via the AMPK pathway, while its knockdown fostered GCs survival and functionality. Furthermore, NR1D1 inhibits the transcription of HSD17B12, thereby contributing to oxidative stress (ROS)-induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by CUT&TagqPCR and dual luciferase assays. The downregulation of HSD17B12 partially alleviated the effects of NR1D1 knockdown on GCs functionality. These findings indicate that NR1D1 orchestrates GCs proliferation and apoptosis through the suppression of HSD17B12 and the activation of the AMPK pathway, establishing NR1D1 as a novel transcription factor implicated in follicular development and ovarian function, with significant implications for prolificacy.

AB  - Despite the widespread use of doxorubicin (DOX) as a chemotherapeutic agent, its severe cumulative cardiotoxicity represents a significant limitation. While the liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin (Myocet, MYO) reduces cardiotoxicity, it is crucial to understand the molecular background of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, we examined circular RNA expression in a translational model of pigs treated with either DOX or MYO and its potential impact on the global gene expression pattern in the myocardium. This study furthers our knowledge about the regulatory network of circRNA/miRNA/mRNA and its interaction with chemotherapeutics. Domestic pigs were treated with three cycles of anthracycline drugs (DOX, n = 5; MYO, n = 5) to induce cardiotoxicity. Untreated animals served as controls (control, n = 3). We applied a bulk mRNA-seq approach and the CIRIquant algorithm to identify circRNAs. The most differentially regulated circRNAs were validated under cell culture conditions, following forecasting of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. We identified eight novel significantly regulated circRNAs from exonic and mitochondrial regions in the porcine myocardium. The forecasted circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network suggested candidate circRNAs that sponge miR-17, miR-15b, miR-130b, the let-7 family, and miR125, together with their mRNA targets. The identified circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network provides an updated, coherent view of the mechanisms involved in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Soil, water, and forage contaminated with toxic heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, and Co can affect the meat and liver quality of camels raised in this area which affect human health. This study aimed to determine the concentrations of Pb, Cd and Co in soil, water, feed and young camels' carcass tissues (meat, liver, whole blood, rumen fluid and rumen tissue) from five districts in Saudi Arabia during the spring. All samples were wet-digested and analyzed by ICP-OES for heavy metals. In the liver, a significantly higher (p < 0.05) concentration of Pb and Co was observed in camels reared in the central and southern districts, while Cd was found significantly higher in the western and northern districts. The concentration of Pb, Cd and Co in meat of camels in the northern district was significantly higher (p < 0.05), and the meat of camels in the west had a higher (p < 0.05) concentration of Co. In addition, the Cd and Co concentrations in rumen fluid samples from camels in the eastern district were significantly higher than in the central district. A negative correlation between the concentration of Pb and Cd in rumen fluid and rumen tissue was reported. The accumulation of Cd, Pb, and Co in meat and liver was below the recommended maximum limit. Therefore, the harmful risk of human consumption of camel meat and liver is not possible.

AB  - Background: The gut -brain axis (GBA) plays a central role in cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Rhubarb, known for its purgative properties, has demonstrated protective effects against CIRI. However, it remains unclear whether this protective effect is achieved through the regulation of the GBA. Aim: This study aims to investigate the mechanism by which rhubarb extract improves CIRI by modulating the GBA pathway. Methods: We identified the active components of rhubarb extract using LC-MS/MS. The model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established to evaluate the effect of rhubarb extract. We conducted 16S rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to analyze intestinal contents. Additionally, we employed HE staining, TUNEL staining, western blot, and ELISA to assess intestinal barrier integrity. We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum via ELISA. We also examined blood -brain barrier (BBB) integrity using Evans blue (EB) penetration, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), western blot, and ELISA. Neurological function scores and TTC staining were utilized to evaluate neurological outcomes. Results: We identified twenty-six active components in rhubarb. Rhubarb extract enhanced alpha-diversity, reduced the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, and partially rectified metabolic disorders in CIRI rats. It also ameliorated pathological changes, increased the expressions of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin 1 in the colon, and reduced levels of LPS and D -lac in serum. Furthermore, it lowered the levels of IL -18, IL -6, IL -10, IL -17, and TNF-alpha in serum. Rhubarb extract mitigated BBB dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced EB penetration and improved hippocampal microstructure. It upregulated the expressions of ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin 1, while downregulating the expressions of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kappa B. Similarly, rhubarb extract decreased the levels of IL -18, IL -6, and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus. Ultimately, it reduced neurological function scores and cerebral infarct volume. Conclusion: Rhubarb effectively treats CIRI, potentially by inhibiting harmful bacteria, correcting metabolic disorders, repairing intestinal barrier function, alleviating BBB dysfunction, and ultimately improving neurological outcomes.

AB  - Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures, and its effective management continues to be a therapeutic challenge. Oxidative stress and local inflammatory response accompany the status epilepticus (SE). This study evaluated the effect of Melissa officinalis extract (MOE) on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus of pilocarpine (PILO)-administered rats, pointing to the involvement of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Rats received PILO via intraperitoneal administration and were treated with MOE for 2 weeks. MOE prevented neuronal loss; decreased lipid peroxidation, Cox-2, PGE2, and BDNF; and downregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus of PILO-treated rats. In addition, MOE enhanced GSH and antioxidant enzymes, upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA abundance, and increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the hippocampus of epileptic rats. Na+/K+-ATPase activity and GABA were increased, and glutamate and acetylcholine were decreased in the hippocampus of epileptic rats treated with MOE. In conclusion, MOE attenuated neuronal loss, oxidative stress, and inflammation; activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling; and modulated neurotransmitters, GFAP, and Na+/K+-ATPase in the hippocampus of epileptic rats. These findings suggest that M. officinalis can mitigate epileptogenesis, pending further studies to explore the exact underlying mechanisms.

AB  - The mechanisms of autism are of extreme interest due to the high prevalence of this disorder in the human population. In this regard, special attention is given to the transcription factor Freud-1 (encoded by the Cc2d1a gene), which regulates numerous intracellular signaling pathways and acts as a silencer for 5-HT1A serotonin and D2 dopamine receptors. Disruption of the Freud-1 functions leads to the development of various psychopathologies. In this study, we found an increase in the expression of the Cc2d1a/Freud-1 gene in the hippocampus of BTBR mice (model of autistic-like behavior) in comparison with C57Bl/6J mice and examined how restoration of the Cc2d1a/Freud-1 expression in the hippocampus of BTBR mice affects their behavior, expression of 5-HT1A serotonin and D2 dopamine receptors, and CREB and NF-kappa B intracellular signaling pathways in these animals. Five weeks after administration of the adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) carrying the pAAV_H1-2_shRNA-Freud-1_Syn_EGFP plasmid encoding a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) that suppressed expression of the Cc2d1a/Freud-1 gene, we observed an elevation in the anxiety levels, as well as the increase in the escape latency and path length to the platform in the Morris water maze test, which was probably associated with a strengthening of the active stress avoidance strategy. However, the Cc2d1a/Freud-1 knockdown did not affect the spatial memory and phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor, although such effect was found in C57Bl/6J mice in our previous study. These results suggest the impairments in the CREB-dependent effector pathway in BTBR mice, which may play an important role in the development of the autistic-like phenotype. The knockdown of Cc2d1a/Freud-1 in the hippocampus of BTBR mice did not affect expression of the 5-HT1A serotonin and D2 dopamine receptors and key NF-kappa B signaling genes (Nfkb1 and Rela). Our data suggest that the transcription factor Freud-1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of anxiety and active stress avoidance in autism.

AB  - Tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] is mainly grown in low- to middle-income countries (LMIC) and is a global commodity. Breeding programs in these countries face the challenge of increasing genetic gain because the accuracy of selecting superior genotypes is low and resources are limited. Phenotypic selection (PS) is traditionally the primary method of developing improved tea varieties and can take over 16 yr. Genomic selection (GS) can be used to improve the efficiency of tea breeding by increasing selection accuracy and shortening the generation interval and breeding cycle. Our main objective was to investigate the potential of implementing GS in tea-breeding programs to speed up genetic progress despite the low cost of PS in LMIC. We used stochastic simulations to compare three GS-breeding programs with a Pedigree and PS program. The PS program mimicked a practical commercial tea-breeding program over a 40-yr breeding period. All the GS programs achieved at least 1.65 times higher genetic gains than the PS program and 1.4 times compared with Seed-Ped program. Seed-GSc was the most cost-effective strategy of implementing GS in tea-breeding programs. It introduces GS at the seedlings stage to increase selection accuracy early in the program and reduced the generation interval to 2 yr. The Seed-Ped program outperformed PS by 1.2 times and could be implemented where it is not possible to use GS. Our results indicate that GS could be used to improve genetic gain per unit time and cost even in cost-constrained tea-breeding programs.

AB  - The Hippo pathway, mediated by its transcriptional effectors Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and WW-domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (TAZ), is crucial in maintaining lung homeostasis and facilitating injury repair. While its roles in epithelial cells are well established, its regulatory effects on lung fibroblasts remain less understood. We engineered a mouse model for the inducible knockdown of YAP/TAZ and showed that fibroblast-specific knockdown enhances PDGFR alpha+ alveolar fibroblasts' support for alveolar-epithelial-stem-cell-derived organoids in vitro. Single-cell profiling revealed changes in fibroblast subpopulations, including the emergence of a Wnt4+ enriched subpopulation. Epigenomic analyses revealed shifts in transcription factor motif enrichment in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells due to fibroblast YAP/TAZ suppression. Further computational and in vivo analyses confirmed increased Wnt signaling and Wnt4 expression in PDGFR alpha-lineage+ fibroblasts, which enhanced SPC+ alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell proliferation. These findings highlight a mechanistic role of YAP/TAZ in PDGFR alpha+ alveolar fibroblasts in supporting AT2 cell maintenance and proliferation via Wnt4 secretion.

AB  - Hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors have shown great potential in body movement tracking, early disease diagnosis, noninvasive treatment, electronic skins, and soft robotics. The good self-healing, biocompatible, sensitive and stretchable properties are the focus of hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors. Dual network (DN) hydrogels are hopeful to fabricate self-healing hydrogels with the above properties. Here, multifunctional DN hydrogels are prepared via a combination of host-guest interaction of beta-cyclodextrin and ferrocene with dynamic borate ester bonds of poly(vinyl alcohol) and borax. Carbon nanotubes are used to endow the DN hydrogels with good conductivity. The obtained DN composite hydrogels possess good biocompatibility, stretchability (436%), fracture strength (41.0 KPa), self-healing property (healing efficiency of 95%), and high tensile strain sensitivity (gauge factor of 5.9). The DN composite hydrogels are used as flexible strain sensors to detect different human motions. After cutting, the healed hydrogels also can monitor human motions and have good stability. In addition, the hydrogel sensors may track the respiratory movement of a pig lung in vitro. This work exhibits new ideas and approaches to develop multifunctional self-healing hydrogels for constructing flexible strain sensors.

AB  - This experiment was conducted in weaned piglets to determine the effects of exogenous protease to low soybean meal (SBM) diets on growth performance, diarrhea rate, nutrient digestibility, and intestinal morphology. Seventy-two Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire weaned barrows (21-day-old, 5.88 +/- 0.95 kg) were randomly divided into four treatments with six replicates in each following a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of SBM levels (0 to 14 d, 9%, 7.5%; 15 to 42 d, 20%, 18.5%) and protease (0 or 150 mg/kg) for a 42-day trial. Fecal samples were collected on days 11 to 14 and 38 to 42 of the experiment, and serum, intestinal tissue, and chyme samples were taken at the end of the experiments. Adding protease in low SBM diets had a significant increase in ADG (p < 0.05) and a decrease in F/G (p < 0.05). Protease significantly reduced the diarrhea rate (p < 0.05). Low SBM level decreased the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of crude protein (CP) and ash (p < 0.05) but increased the ATTD of dry matter (DM), ash, organic matter (OM), and CP after the addition of protease (p < 0.05). The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of aspartic acid (Asp), threonine (Thr), serine (Ser), alanine (Ala), lysine (Lys), and total amino acids (AAs) were significantly increased by protease supplementation (p < 0.05). Both the SBM-reduced and protease-added diets lead to lower albumin (ALB), albumin/globulin (A/G), and urea nitrogen (UREA) (p < 0.05), but greater globulin (GLOB) with low SBM diets (p < 0.05). The SBM-reduced and protease-added diets decreased the duodenum pH, respectively (p < 0.05). The protease increased the villus:crypt (V:C) in the duodenum and ileum, and ileal villus length (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the dietary supplementation of 150 mg/kg protease improved the intestinal health and performance of the weaned piglets and reversed the negative effect of a 1.5% SBM reduction in nutrient utilization, intestinal pH, and intestinal morphological parameters of weaned piglets.

AB  - In this study, we examined the effects of arginine (L-ArgHCl) on ultrafiltration performance, a process with practical significance for not only research but also pharmaceutical applications. Specifically, we assessed the yield and filtration rate of ultrafiltration using rabbit and goat polyclonal antibodies (neutral to basic isoelectric points) as well as model proteins, BSA (acidic) and lysozyme (basic). When a 1 mg/mL protein solution was concentrated approximately 10-fold using a standard commercially available centrifugal ultrafiltration device, the addition of L-ArgHCl significantly improved yield at near-neutral buffer pH. The observed order of improvement was: 20 mM L-ArgHCl >100 mM L-ArgHCl approximate to 0.5 M NaCl > no addition. A similar trend was observed with BSA, whereas lysozyme achieved slightly higher yields at 100 mM L-ArgHCl. In a 40-fold concentration of rabbit polyclonal antibody from 1 mg/mL, 20 mM L-ArgHCl enhanced yield at pH 6 and 7, but had minimal or no effect at pH 7.5. Notably, at pH 8, high yields were achieved without arginine. L-ArgHCl also accelerated the concentration rate at all pH levels, with greater enhancements observed at higher arginine concentrations. These findings suggest that L-ArgHCl mitigates protein precipitation and solubility loss by reducing protein-protein interactions and nonspecific binding to the ultrafiltration membrane. At pH 8, the increased surface charge of the antibody reduced hydrophobicity, further improving solubility. In summary, the addition of L-ArgHCl, particularly near pH 7, effectively enhanced ultrafiltration performance. This provides a practical strategy for improving protein concentration processes.

AB  - Background Neurons are highly specialized cells with a complex morphology generated by various membrane trafficking steps. They contain Golgi outposts in dendrites, which are formed from somatic Golgi tubules. In trafficking membrane fusion is mediated by a specific combination of SNARE proteins. A functional SNARE complex contains four different helices, one from each SNARE subfamily (R-, Qa, Qb and Qc). Loss of the two Qb SNAREs vti1a and vti1b from the Golgi apparatus and endosomes leads to death at birth in mice with massive neurodegeneration in peripheral ganglia and defective axon tracts. Methods Hippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated from Vti1a(-/-)Vti1b(-/-) double deficient, Vti1a(-/-)Vti1b(+/-), Vti1a(+/-)Vti1b(-/-) and Vti1a(+/-)Vti1b(+/-) double heterozygous embryos. Neurite outgrowth was determined in cortical neurons and after stimulation with several neurotrophic factors or the Rho-associated protein kinase ROCK inhibitor Y27632, which induces exocytosis of enlargeosomes, in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, postsynaptic densities were isolated from embryonic Vti1a(-/-)Vti1b(-/-) and Vti1a(+/-)Vti1b(+/-) control forebrains and analyzed by western blotting. Results Golgi outposts were present in Vti1a(-/-)Vti1b(+/-) and Vti1a(+/-)Vti1b(-/-) dendrites of hippocampal neurons but not detected in the absence of vti1a and vti1b. The length of neurites was significantly shorter in double deficient cortical neurons. These defects were not observed in Vti1a(-/-)Vti1b(+/-) and Vti1a(+/-)Vti1b(-/-) neurons. NGF, BDNF, NT-3, GDNF or Y27632 as stimulator of enlargeosome secretion did not increase the neurite length in double deficient hippocampal neurons. Vti1a(-/-)Vti1b(-/-) postsynaptic densities contained similar amounts of scaffold proteins, AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors compared to Vti1a(+/-)Vti1b(+/-), but much more TrkB, which is the receptor for BDNF. Conclusion The absence of Golgi outposts did not affect the amount of AMPA and NMDA receptors in postsynaptic densities. Even though TrkB was enriched, BDNF was not able to stimulate neurite elongation in Vti1a(-/-)Vti1b(-/-) neurons. Vti1a or vti1b function as the missing Qb-SNARE together with VAMP-4 (R-SNARE), syntaxin 16 (Qa-SNARE) and syntaxin 6 (Qc-SNARE) in induced neurite outgrowth. Our data show the importance of vti1a or vti1b for two pathways of neurite elongation.

AB  - Advancement of the oil tea industry requires the development of high-yielding and superior-quality varieties of Camellia oleifera, a major oilseed crop. However, traditional breeding methods, hampered by lengthy cycles and low selection accuracy, significantly constrain the breeding process. Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with target traits, and applying molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) for these traits, can thereby shorten the breeding cycles and amplify the breeding efficiency. In this study, we utilized the hexaploid C. oleifera as the reference genome to identify high-quality SNPs and constructed a high-density genetic linkage map of C. oleifera that spanned 1566.733 cM, included 3097 SNPs, and was anchored to 15 linkage groups. Using interval mapping, we localized quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 11 juvenile traits in C. oleifera, identifying 15 QTLs for growth traits and 24 QTLs for leaf traits, including 4 stable QTLs. The logarithm of odds (LOD) scores for individual QTLs ranged from 3.48 to 14.62, explaining 9.86-48.61% of the phenotypic variance. We further identified 2 SNPs associated with growth traits (marker11-951 and marker12-68) and 10 SNPs associated with leaf traits (marker11-276, marker11-410, marker11-560, marker13-16, marker13-39, marker13-110, marker13-731, marker14-701, marker14-910, and marker14-1331). These results provide valuable insights into the genetic mapping of key traits in C. oleifera and will contribute to the development of new varieties with high yield and superior quality in the future.

AB  - Alcohol (ethanol) exposure during pregnancy can adversely affect development, with long-lasting consequences that include neuroimmune, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunction. Alcohol-induced alterations in cytokine levels in the hippocampus may contribute to abnormal cognitive and behavioral outcomes in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Nutritional intervention with the essential nutrient choline can improve hippocampal-dependent behavioral impairments and may also influence neuroimmune function. Thus, we examined the effects of choline supplementation on hippocampal cytokine levels in adolescent and adult rats exposed to alcohol early in development. From postnatal day (PD) 4-9 (third trimester-equivalent), Sprague-Dawley rat pups received ethanol (5.25 g/kg/day) or sham intubations and were treated with choline chloride (100 mg/kg/day) or saline from PD 10-30; hippocampi were collected at PD 35 or PD 60. Age-specific ethanol-induced increases in interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and keratinocyte chemoattractant/human growth-regulated oncogene (KC/GRO) were identified in adulthood, but not adolescence, whereas persistent ethanol-induced increases of interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were present at both ages. Interestingly, choline supplementation reduced age-related changes in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) as well as mitigating the long-lasting increase in IFN-gamma in ethanol-exposed adults. Moreover, choline influenced inflammatory tone by modulating ratios of pro- to -anti-inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that ethanol-induced changes in hippocampal cytokine levels are more evident during adulthood than adolescence, and that choline can mitigate some effects of ethanol exposure on long-lasting inflammatory tone.

AB  - Background: Brassaiopsis glomerulata (Blum) Regel (B.glomerulata) is recognized as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) primarily used for promoting blood circulation and removing stasis. It is frequently utilized in the treatment of injuries resulting from falls and bumps. Purpose: Despite its effective use in clinical treatment for ischemic stroke (IS), there are currently no reports on its composition and mechanism of action, which affects its promotion. The study investigated the chemical components and molecular mechanisms of B.glomerulata, with the following components: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, network pharmacology Analysis and experimental verification in vivo and vitro. Methods: The effect of B.glomerulata on interfering with ischemic stroke was assessed on MCAO/R rats and ORD cell model. Then the compositional analysis was conducted using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Furthermore, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were explored to identify potential targets and pathways. The predicted mechanisms of action were ultimately confirmed by immunohistochemistry and protein blotting. Results: B. glomerulata exhibited neuroprotective effects in MCAO/R rats by reductions in hippocampal and cortical neuronal damage, brain infarction, and cerebral edema. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that it decreased ROS and MDA levels, increased SOD and GSH levels, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress. Moreover, the improvements in neuronal morphology and the modulation of Nissl bodies suggested a potential mechanism underlying its neuroprotective action. Additionally, B.glomerulata exhibited concentrationdependent reductions in Bax and Caspase-3 expressions, along with increases in GFAP, Bcl2/Bax ratio, p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR levels. Conclusion: B.glomerulata exhibited neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury both in vivo and in vitro. It prevented oxidative stress damage and inhibited apoptosis of ischemic stroke through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

AB  - The welfare of pet small mammals is an understudied, but growing research topic in the UK and Europe. We surveyed European veterinary experts who each rated severity and prevalence of a large number of issues in the eight most common species. Overall, 46 responses were obtained. We calculated the mean expert's ratings for severity and prevalence of each issue, which were multiplied together to create an overall impact score. We then ranked issues from most to least impactful for each species. The most impactful welfare issue was perceived to be small housing for all the species apart from the rat where the main concern was respiratory disease. Where comparing veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses, rating differed significantly on numerous issues. Veterinary nurses generally rated welfare issues as more prevalent than veterinary surgeons. UK respondents also rated numerous issues as more severe and prevalent than non-UK respondents. Better guidance on, and increased availability of, affordable large housing is likely to greatly improve small mammal welfare.

AB  - Obesity, a major global health concern, is represented by an accumulation of adipose tissue and body mass, leading to a higher incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Camellia sinensis var. assamica, known as cha-miang, contains catechin and its derivatives, which have been reported to affect several health-related concerns such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemia, and against cardiovascular disease. The research aimed to examine the anti-obesity and insulin resistance effects of fresh cha-miang extract (CME) and fermented cha-miang extract (FCME), and to investigate the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of CME and FCME in obese rats generated by a high-fat diet. The extracts demonstrated significant antioxidant potential, with CME demonstrating greater DPPH radical scavenging activity, whereas FCME excelled in ABTS radical scavenging. In the animal model, CME and FCME significantly reduced body weight, plasma insulin levels, insulin resistance, and accumulation of fat compared to the obese control group. Moreover, plasma biochemical analysis indicated that both extracts enhanced lipid profiles by reducing cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol levels, while elevating HDL-cholesterol. Histological analysis revealed decreased hepatic fat accumulation, especially when extracts were concurrently treated with metformin. The research indicates that CME and FCME, especially in conjunction with metformin, have potential anti-obesity and anti-insulin resistance benefits attributed to their abundant polyphenolic content and antioxidant characteristics. This indicates that cha-miang may serve as an effective option for the management of obesity and metabolic diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary: The control of several swine viral diseases relies mainly on evidence-based prevention protocols due to the lack of effective treatments or vaccines. To design these protocols, laboratory investigation of viral infections is critical to confirm their occurrence and determine their epizootiology. However, laboratory confirmation of certain swine viral diseases is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, requiring scientific personnel with relevant expertise. Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics are tests and devices that provide clinically relevant information on-site, facilitating decision-makers to swiftly take countermeasures for disease control. In the present study, novel photonic biosensors were integrated into a single, automated POC device that can record and analyze changes in the sensors' refractive index, allowing the detection of Porcine Parvovirus (PPV) and Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV-2) in oral fluids within 75 min. The objective of this work was to validate this device using reference and field samples (oral fluids). The system was able to detect PPV and PCV-2 in oral fluid samples satisfactorily. The device can be directly deployed in farms for the fast diagnosis of these diseases, contributing to farm biosecurity.Viral diseases challenge the health and welfare of pigs and undermine the sustainability of swine farms. Their efficient control requires early and reliable diagnosis, highlighting the importance of Point of Care (POC) diagnostics in veterinary practice. The objective of this study was to validate a novel POC system that utilizes Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) and microfluidics to detect swine viral pathogens using oral fluids and Porcine Parvovirus (PPV) and Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV-2) as proofs of concept. The sensitivity and specificity of the device were calculated for both viruses, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn. PPV had an Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.820 (95% CI: 0.760 to 0.880, p < 0.0001), and its optimal efficiency threshold of detection shifts was equal to 4.5 pm (68.6% sensitivity, 77.1% specificity and Limit of Detection (LOD) value 10(6) viral copies/mL). PCV-2 had an AUC value of 0.742 (95% CI: 0.670 to 0.815, p < 0.0001) and an optimal efficiency threshold of shifts equal to 6.5 pm (69.5% sensitivity, 70.3% specificity and LOD 3.3 x 10(5) copies/mL). In this work, it was proven that PICs can be exploited for the detection of swine viral diseases. The novel device can be directly deployed on farms as a POC diagnostics tool.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of extruded corn with different gelatinization degrees on the feed preference, growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and fecal microbiota of weaning piglets. The results showed that extruded corn can improve feed preference, increase growth performance and nutrient digestibility, and modify gut microbiota, and the ideal degree of gelatinization is approximately 41.82-62.60%. Preference and performance trials were conducted to investigate the effects of extruded corn with different degrees of gelatinization on the feed preference, growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and fecal microbiota of weaning piglets. In the preference trial, 144 piglets who were 35 days old were weighed and allotted to six treatments with four replications per treatment. Piglets in each treatment group were allowed to choose two of the following four corn-supplemented diets: conventional corn (NC) or extruded corn with low (LEC; 41.82% gelatinization), medium (MEC; 62.60% gelatinization), or high (HEC; 89.93% gelatinization) degrees of gelatinization for 18 days. The results showed that the piglets preferred diets supplemented with a low degree of gelatinization of extruded corn. In the performance trial, 144 piglets who were 35 days old were weighed and allotted into four treatments with six replications per treatment. Piglets in each treatment were fed one of the four diets for 28 days. The results showed that LEC and MEC decreased the feed:gain ratio at 14-28 days and 0-28 days, respectively, and increased the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of crude protein compared with NC. Meanwhile, LEC increased the total protein and globulin content in the plasma on day 14, and MEC increased the ATTD of ether extract (EE) compared with NC. Extruded corn with low and medium degrees of gelatinization increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level and Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella, Prevotellaceae_UCG-03, and Prevotella_2 at the genus level. The results showed that extruded corn can improve feed preference, increase growth performance and nutrient digestibility, and modify gut microbiota, and the ideal degree of gelatinization is approximately 41.82-62.60%.

AB  - Using a partial hippocampal cholinergic denervation model, we assessed the effects of the RGTA(R) named OTR4132, a synthetic heparan-mimetic biopolymer with neuroprotective/neurotrophic properties. Long-Evans male rats were injected with the cholinergic immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin into the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (0.37 mu g); vehicle injections served as controls. Immediately after surgery, OTR4132 was injected into the lateral ventricles (0.25 mu g/5 mu l/rat) or intramuscularly (1.5 mg/kg). To determine whether OTR4132 reached the lesion site, some rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intramuscular (I.M.) injections of fluorescent OTR4132. Rats were sacrificed at 4, 10, 20, or 60 days post-lesion (DPL). Fluorescein-labeled OTR4132 injected ICV or I.M. was found in the lesion from 4 to 20 DPL. Rats with partial hippocampal cholinergic denervation showed decreases in hippocampal acetylcholinesterase reaction products and in choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medial septum. These lesions were the largest at 10 DPL and then remained stable until 60 DPL. Both hippocampal acetylcholinesterase reaction products and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medial septum effects were significantly attenuated in OTR4132-treated rats. These effects were not related to competition between OTR4132 and 192 IgG-saporin for the neurotrophin receptor P75 (p75(NTR)), as OTR4132 treatment did not alter the internalization of Cy3-labelled 192 IgG. OTR4132 was more efficient at reducing the acetylcholinesterase reaction products and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons than a comparable heparin dose used as a comparator. Using the slice superfusion technique, we found that the lesion-induced decrease in muscarinic autoreceptor sensitivity was abolished by intramuscular OTR4132. After partial cholinergic damage, OTR4132 was able to concentrate at the brain lesion site possibly due to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and to exert structural and functional effects that hold promises for neuroprotection/neurotrophism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is a risk factor for developing sporadic forms of sporadic dementia. A human tau (htau) mouse model is available that exhibits age-dependent tau dysregulation, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress starting at an early age (3-4 months) and in which tau dysregulation and neuronal loss correlate with synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline.
   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the effects of chronic SHS exposure (10 months' exposure to similar to 30 mg/m(3)) on behavioral and cognitive function, metabolism, and neuropathology in mice.
   METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and htau female and male mice were exposed to SHS (90% side stream, 10% main stream) using the SCIREQ (R) inExpose(TM) system or air control for 168 min per day, for 312 d, 7 d per week. The exposures continued during the days of behavioral and cognitive testing. In addition to behavioral and cognitive performance and neuropathology, the lungs of mice were examined for pathology and alterations in gene expression.
   RESULTS: Mice exposed to chronic SHS exposure showed the following genotype-dependent responses: a) lower body weights in WT, but not htau, mice; b) less spontaneous alternation in WT, but not htau, mice in the Y maze; c) faster swim speeds of WT, but not htau, mice in the water maze; d) lower activity levels of WT and htau mice in the open field; e) lower expression of brain PHF1, TTCM1, IGF1 beta, and HSP90 protein levels in WT male, but not female, mice; and f) more profound effects on hippocampal metabolic pathways in WT male than female mice and more profound effects in WT than htau mice.
   DISCUSSION: The brain of WT mice, in particular WT male mice, might be especially susceptible to the effects of chronic SHS exposure. In WT males, independent pathways involving ascorbate, flavin adenine dinucleotide, or palmitoleic acid might contribute to the hippocampal injury following chronic SHS exposure.

AB  - Wound closure is critical for the care of wounds by preventing foreign matter entry and supporting healing. Failure of wound closure because of mechanical compromise or inflammation can lead to failure of effective apposition of tissues and manifest in delayed healing and even death, depending on the site of the wound. Therefore, a platform capable of identifying inflammation as well as delivery of therapeutics, including chemical, biological, and cellular therapies, could transform our capacity to effectively sense potential failure as well as maximize healing. Here, we report the development of a decellularized gut suture platform capable of sensing inflammation as well as delivering a broad array of therapeutics, including small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, and cell-based therapeutics. We demonstrate the mechanical and biological functionalities of our platform in rodents and pigs. We anticipate that this platform could transform how we care for wounds and anastomoses of patients.

AB  - Pyroptosis is an inflammation-associated programmed cell death, and neuroinflammation is strongly associated with severe neurological deficits in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Ethyl pyruvate (EP), a known anti-inflammatory agent, has shown promise in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) rats; nevertheless, the therapeutic mechanism of EP and its capacity to suppress neuronal pyroptosis in HIBD rats remain unclear. In both the neonatal Rice-Vannucci rat model and the OGD/R model, this study examined alterations in the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD classical pyroptosis pathway in hippocampal neurons during HIE and the potential inhibitory impact of ethyl pyruvate on this pathway. We used HE staining, immunofluorescence double staining, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot to demonstrate that EP effectively inhibited hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis and attenuated the activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway in HIBD rats, which resulted in a reduction of neuroinflammation and facilitated neural recovery. The results suggest that EP may be a promising neuroprotective agent for treating HIE.
   By inhibiting hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis and reducing NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD activation, ethyl pyruvate reduced neuroinflammation in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage rats and facilitated neural recovery (by Figdraw ID: YAYOI096d6). image

AB  - Delivering biologics to elicit a therapeutic response in the central nervous system (CNS) remains challenging due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Receptor-mediated transcytosis is a strategy to improve brain exposure after systemic drug administration. The availability of a clinically relevant in vitro BBB model is crucial to investigate transcytosis pathways and to predict the penetration of biologics into the CNS. We created a perfused human in vitro BBB model made of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) for studying transferrin receptor-mediated transcytosis. iPSC-derived BMEC were seeded in the top channel of a three-lane microfluidic device (OrganoPlate (R)). After 2 days in culture, the established cell model exhibited relevant BBB features, including physiological transendothelial electrical resistance in a transwell setting (1500 omega*cm2), reduced apparent permeability (Papp) to the fluorescence tracer Lucifer yellow (20-fold less than cell-free chips), expression of key BBB markers such as tight junctions proteins, transporters, receptors and functional P-gp efflux pump. Moreover, the model exhibited functional transferrin receptor-mediated uptake and transcytosis. To assess selective transferrin receptor-mediated transcytosis, a mixture of anti-human transferrin receptor (MEM-189) and control (sheep IgG anti-bovine serum albumin) antibodies was perfused in the top channel for 2 h. The Papp of MEM-189 was 11-fold higher than that of the control antibody, demonstrating facilitated receptor-mediated transcytosis. Compared to published work reporting a 2-fold ratio, this result is remarkable and establishes the suitability of our model for exploring receptor-mediated transcytosis and screening of antibodies for putative brain shuttle application.Graphical AbstractA perfused in vitro human model made of iPSC-derived BMEC with the chief characteristics (barrier tightness, functionality) of the human BBB can be applied to study transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated transcytosis of therapeutic antibodies. This may bring critical advances in drug shuttle technology. Graphical abstract generated with biorender.com.

AB  - The genomes of close unicellular relatives of animals encode orthologs of many genes that regulate animal development. However, little is known about the function of such genes in unicellular organisms or the evolutionary process by which these genes came to function in multicellular development. The Hippo pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and tissue size in animals, is present in some of the closest unicellular relatives of animals, including the amoeboid organism Capsaspora owczarzaki. We previously showed that the Capsaspora ortholog of the Hippo pathway nuclear effector Yorkie/YAP/TAZ (coYki) regulates actin dynamics and the three-dimensional morphology of Capsaspora cell aggregates, but is dispensable for cell proliferation control (Phillips et al., 2022). However, the function of upstream Hippo pathway components, and whether and how they regulate coYki in Capsaspora, remained unknown. Here, we analyze the function of the upstream Hippo pathway kinases coHpo and coWts in Capsaspora by generating mutant lines for each gene. Loss of either kinase results in increased nuclear localization of coYki, indicating an ancient, premetazoan origin of this Hippo pathway regulatory mechanism. Strikingly, we find that loss of either kinase causes a contractile cell behavior and increased density of cell packing within Capsaspora aggregates. We further show that this increased cell density is not due to differences in proliferation, but rather actomyosin-dependent changes in the multicellular architecture of aggregates. Given its well-established role in cell density-regulated proliferation in animals, the increased density of cell packing in coHpo and coWts mutants suggests a shared and possibly ancient and conserved function of the Hippo pathway in cell density control. Together, these results implicate cytoskeletal regulation but not proliferation as an ancestral function of the Hippo pathway kinase cascade and uncover a novel role for Hippo signaling in regulating cell density in a proliferation-independent manner.

AB  - Persistent or recurrent bleeding from microvessels inaccessible for direct endovascular intervention is a major problem in medicine today. Here, an innovative catheter-directed liquid embolic (P-LE) is bioengineered for rapid microvessel embolization to treat small vessel hemorrhage. Tested in rodent, porcine, and canine animal models under normal and coagulopathic conditions, P-LE outperformed clinically used embolic materials in both survival and non-survival experiments, effectively occluding vessels as small as 40 microns with no signs of recanalization. P-LE occlusion is independent of the coagulation cascade, and its resistance to displacement is approximate to 8 times greater than systolic blood pressure. P-LE is also found to be biocompatible and x-ray visible and does not require polymerization or a chemical reaction to embolize. To simulate the clinical scenario, acute microvascular hemorrhage is created in the pig kidney, liver, or stomach; these are successfully treated with P-LE achieving immediate hemostasis. Furthermore, P-LE is found to be bactericidal to highly resistant patient-derived bacteria, suggesting that P-LE may also protect against infectious complications that may occur following embolization procedures. P-LE is safe, easy to use, and effective in treating -microvessel hemorrhage.
   An innovative catheter-directed liquid embolic (P-LE) is bioengineered to achieve rapid and durable segmental hemostasis reaching microvessels. This novel approach demonstrated remarkable efficacy in rat, pig (non-survival and survival), and in anti-coagulated dog embolization models, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. P-LE represents a next-generation liquid embolic; it is biocompatible, x-ray visible, bactericidal, and embolizes distal, often unreachable microvessels with the potential to improve patient outcomes and potentially save lives. image

AB  - Background: Alzheimer 's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease and brings a serious burden to society and families. Due to lack of effective drugs for the treatment of AD, it 's urgent to develop new and effective drug for the treatment of AD. Purpose: The study aimed to investigate the potential of Zexieyin formula (ZXYF), a Chinese medicine formula, for the treatment of AD and its potential mechanism of action. Methods: We used chronic scopolamine (SCOP) induction mice model and APP/PS1 mice to reveal and confirm ZXYF for the treatment of AD with donepezil (DON) as a positive reference. The learning and memory function were detected by morris water maze test (MWM) and y -maze test. Moreover, western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the molecular mechanism of ZXYF for the alleviation of AD in hippocampus. Lastly, pharmacological technology was applied to evaluate AMPA receptor involved in the role of ZXYF in the treatment of AD. Results: The results showed that ZXYF could improve memory and learning deficits both in two AD models including scopolamine (SCOP)-induced mice model and APP/PS1mice. Moreover, ZXYF or not DON increased expressions of BrdU/DCX and Ki67 positive cells in dentate gyrus (DG), up -regulated the levels of AMPA subunit type (GluA1) and PKA in hippocampus in SCOP-induced mice model, although ZXYF and DON activated CaMKII, CaMKII-phosphorylation, CREB, CREB-phosphorylation and PSD95 in hippocampus in SCOP-induced mice model. ZXYF also activated CaMKII, CaMKII-phosphorylation and GluA1 in HT22 cells. Furthermore, transient inhibiting AMPA receptor was capable of blocking the effects of ZXYF to treat AD in MWM and suppressing the number of BrdU/DCX positive cells increased by ZXYF in DG in SCOP-induced mice model, but had no effect on the alteration of Ki67 positive cells. Conclusion: ZXYF had the therapeutic effects on AD -treatment, which activated CaMKII to promote AMPA receptor (GluA1) and subsequently up -regulated PKA/CREB signaling to facilitate neurogenesis to achieve enhanced postsynaptic protein.

AB  - Classical swine fever (CSF) is an acute and often fatal disease caused by CSF virus (CSFV) infection. In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in pigs infected with CSFV. The results revealed that CSFV inhibits IFN alpha/beta production, but up-regulates the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1); this result was verified in vitro. Interestingly, STAT1 is typically a downstream target of IFN alpha/beta, raising the question of how CSFV can inhibit IFN alpha/beta expression, yet up-regulate STAT1 expression. To explore this further, we observed that UV-treated CSFV induced STAT1 expression. Our results demonstrated that CSFV Erns, E1, and E2 could up-regulate STAT1 expression within the host cell cytoplasm and facilitate its translocation into the nucleus. The Erns, E1, and E2 proteins also separately induced the up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-10; IL-10 acts as the communicator connecting Erns, E1, and E2 proteins to STAT1, leading to the subsequent up-regulation, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of STAT1. Silencing of IL-10 down-regulated STAT1 expression. Finally, MX1 and OAS1 were identified as downstream targets of the IL-10-STAT1 pathway. In summary, a novel IL-10-STAT1 pathway independent of IFN alpha/beta induced by CSFV Erns, E1, and E2 was identified in this study.

AB  - Simple and inexpensive analytical methods for assessing redox balance in biological matrixes are widely used in animal and human diagnostics. Two of them, reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) and total oxidant status (TOS), evaluate the lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) content of the sample and are based on iron-mediated mechanisms. However, these tests provide uncorrelated results. In this study, we compared these two tests in the blood serum of goat kids and lambs, together with an evaluation of ceruloplasmin (CP) oxidase activity. No significant correlation was found between ROMs and TOS, or between TOS and CP oxidase activity, in either species. Conversely, ROMs and CP oxidase activity were highly correlated in both kid and lamb samples (p < 0.001). A significant progressive reduction in the analytical signal in the ROMs assay was observed when sodium azide, an effective CP inhibitor, was added to the samples before the assay (p < 0.001). This decrease was related to sodium azide concentration (p < 0.01) and was not found when sodium azide was added at the same concentrations in the TOS assay. These findings suggest that ROMs, unlike TOS, may be affected by CP, which interferes with LOOH detection in blood samples.

AB  - Simple Summary: The proportion of ewes conceiving triplets is increasing on farms across Australia as sheep producers adopt more fecund genetics and ewe management practices to increase lamb output per ewe mated. The aims of this research were to consult producers to quantify rates of ewe and lamb mortality in this cohort and identify priorities for future research to reduce these losses. Surveys of producers with experience in managing triplet-bearing ewes indicated the average mortality of triplet-bearing ewes was 6.4%, and the survival of triplet-born lambs was 59%. There was significant variation in the actual targets adopted by different producers for ewe condition score at lambing, mob size during lambing and feed-on-offer at lambing, and no differences in the average rate of mortality of triplet-bearing ewes or lamb survival between producers that prioritised adoption of certain management practices. The highest priorities for further research identified by producers from surveys, workshops and a webinar were ewe condition score, mob size, feed-on-offer at lambing and mineral supplementation.
   Consultation with sheep producers was used to quantify the mortality of triplet-bearing ewes and their lambs, identify management practices adopted by producers to reduce these losses and prioritise future research needs to improve the survival of triplet-bearing ewes and their lambs. Surveys were completed by 64 producers across Australia who identified and separated tripletbearing ewes from twin-bearing ewes in 2017 and/or 2018. On average, 5.9% of all ewes mated were identified as carrying triplets (6.6% of non-Merino ewes and 2.9% of Merino ewes). The average mortality of triplet-bearing ewes was 6.4%, and ewe mortality did not differ significantly between ewe breeds. The average survival of triplet-born lambs was 59%, and survival was significantly higher for lambs from non-Merino compared to Merino ewes (60.1 vs. 52.9%, p < 0.05). The key strategies adopted to reduce the mortality of triplet-bearing ewes and their lambs included management of condition score, feed-on-offer, mob size at lambing and use of shelter. There were no differences (p > 0.05) in the average mortality of triplet-bearing ewes or their lambs between producers that prioritised the adoption of certain management practices. However, significant variation existed between producers in their targets at lambing for ewe condition score (2.8 to 3.5), mob size (10 to 150 ewes) and feed-on-offer (800 to 2500 kg dry matter/ha). Overwhelmingly, the highest priorities for further research identified by producers from surveys, workshops and a webinar were ewe condition score, mob size, feed-on-offer at lambing and mineral supplementation. This study informs benchmarks for mortality of triplet-bearing ewes and their lambs under extensive grazing conditions in Australia, and the priorities for future research to reduce these losses.

AB  - PurposeNuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ promotes tumorigenesis in several cancers, including melanoma. Although the mechanisms underlying the nuclear retention of YAP are known, those underlying the retention of TAZ remain unclear. Our study investigates a novel acetylation/deacetylation switch in TAZ, governing its subcellular localization in melanoma tumorigenesis.MethodsImmunoprecipitation/Western blot assessed TAZ protein interactions and acetylation. SIRT5 activity was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunofluorescence indicated TAZ nuclear localization. TEAD transcriptional activity was measured through luciferase reporter assays. ChIP detected TAZ binding to the CTGF promoter. Transwell and wound healing assays quantified melanoma cell invasiveness and migration. Metastasis was evaluated using a mouse model via tail vein injections. Clinical relevance was explored via immunohistochemical staining of patient tumors.ResultsCBP facilitated TAZ acetylation at K54 in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation, while SIRT5 mediated deacetylation. Acetylation correlated with phosphorylation, regulating TAZ's binding with LATS2 or TEAD. TAZ K54 acetylation enhanced its S89 phosphorylation, promoting cytosolic retention via LATS2 interaction. SIRT5-mediated deacetylation enhanced TAZ-TEAD interaction and nuclear retention. Chromatin IP showed SIRT5-deacetylated TAZ recruited to CTGF promoter, boosting transcriptional activity. In a mouse model, SIRT5 overexpression induced melanoma metastasis to lung tissue following the injection of B16F10 melanocytes via the tail vein, and this effect was prevented by verteporfin treatment.ConclusionsOur study revealed a novel mechanism of TAZ nuclear retention regulated by SIRT5-mediated K54 deacetylation and demonstrated the significance of TAZ deacetylation in CTGF expression. This study highlights the potential implications of the SIRT5/TAZ axis for treating metastatic melanoma.

AB  - Coccinella septempunctata (Linnaeus) and Hippodamia convergens (Guerin Meneville) are important predators of many pests of agricultural crop importance. Feeding these predators with artificial diets (ADs) is an important means to achieve large-scale production. In this study, the effects of five different artificial diets on the development, survival and reproduction of the two predators were evaluated under laboratory conditions (26 +/- 2 C-degrees, 60% RH, and 12:12 (L:D) h). The artificial diets consisted of various main ingredients, including barley flour (BF-AD), soybean flour (SF-AD), potato flour (PF-AD), frozen aphids (FA-AD), and milk powder (MP-AD). Both predators successfully underwent their entire development on all of these formulated artificial diets. The results of this study show that the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae (Scopoli)) and artificial diets SF-AD and PF-AD appear to be the most suitable for mass rearing of the predators. These diets decreased the total pre-adult development period, increased female and male longevity, significantly increased larval and pupal survival rates, adult emergence and weight, oviposition period, and fecundity, and significantly decreased the pre-oviposition period compared to the other artificial diets tested. Similarly, the data showed that the highest values of growth index and success index were obtained with the predators fed the black bean aphid diet (9.6-15.0 and 1.0-1.0, respectively), followed by artificial diets SF-AD (9.1-13.5 and 0.9-1.0, respectively) and PF-AD (8.3-10.7 and 0.8-0.9, respectively). The artificial diets, particularly SF-AD and PF-AD, can be used for mass rearing of C. septempunctata and H. convergens for biological control applications and adult rearing during aphids scarcity.

KW  - PATHWAY
AB  - Background: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a crucial toxic signaling event triggered by chronic exposure to Ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), which significantly exacerbate photodamage responses in the irradiated skin. Therefore, the identification of agents capable of inhibiting ER stress could serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing the unmet clinical needs in the treatment of UVB-induced photodamage. Methods: A UVB-irradiated mouse model was used and topical administration of Panax ginseng extract was carried out for a duration of 9 weeks. Vitamin E was used as a positive control. After 9 weeks of administration, the skin appearance, epidermal hyperplasia, infiltration of inflammatory cells, apoptosis, and collagen content were measured. The keratinocytes were irradiated with 6 mJ/cm2 UVB to establish an in vitro model. The levels of ER stress and apoptosis were investigated both in vivo and in vitro using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Results: Among the 14 extracts derived from 13 distinct plant species that were screened, Panax ginseng, Prunus mume, and Camellia japonica showed inhibitory effect on UVB-induced ER stress. Notably, Panax ginseng effectively inhibits collagen degradation and apoptosis in both irradiated keratinocytes and Balb/C mice skin. Furthermore, the silencing of VMP1 significantly impeded the cellular protective effect of Panax ginseng extract on UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, indicating that Panax ginseng exerts its protective effects through targeted promotion of VMP1. Conclusion: Our data suggest that Panax ginseng extract possess a therapeutical effect on UVB radiation-induced photodamage by promoting VMP1-mediated inhibition of ER stress.

AB  - Simple Summary Since antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) possess broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and low drug resistance, their development as antibiotic alternatives are of interest. Previous studies reported that the performance of pigs was improved by AMPs through the protection of the intestine. Nevertheless, direct evidence linking AMPs and skeletal muscle growth is needed. In the current work, Iturin A as a novel antimicrobial peptide was selected to fight engineered STb-Rosetta Escherichia coli (STb-R) to measure pork skeletal muscle growth and further mechanisms. We found the restrictions of body weight gain and skeletal muscle growth caused by STb-R could be rescued after Iturin A gavage, and this was mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-Mtorc1 growth axis. The engineered STb-Rosetta Escherichia coli (STb-R) was designed to investigate the effects of Iturin A on the skeletal muscle growth of weaned piglets. A total of 28 piglets were randomly divided into 4 groups (7 piglets per group): the control group (100 mL PBS), the Iturin A group (100 mL 320 mg/kg body weight (BW) Iturin A), the STb-R group (100 mL 1 x 10(10) CFU/mL STb-R), and the Iturin A + STb-R group (100 mL 320 mg/kg BW Iturin A + 1 x 10(10) CFU/mL STb-R). Compared with the control, STb-R-reduced body weight gain were rescued by Iturin A. The semimembranosus muscle weight recovered to normal level in the Iturin A + STb-R group. The level of relevant genes of the growth axis were elevated by Iturin A, including GHRH in the hypothalamus, GHRHR and GH in the pituitary, and GHR, IGF-1 and IGF-1R in the semimembranosus muscle. Moreover, Iturin A increased the mean fiber area and the number of proliferating cells in the semimembranosus muscle, which were decreased by STb-R. Additionally, the mTORC1 pathway was reactivated by Iturin A to relieve the suppression of STb-R. Collectively, the hypothalamic-pituitary growth axis-mediated Iturin A reactivated the mTORC1 pathway to rescue STb-R-restricted pork skeletal muscle growth.

AB  - The experiment was conducted using a single-stage steel biodigester of 75 L working volume, charged with 75% pig manure and 25% pine wood sawdust and operated under batch mode at a psychrophilic temperature range (13.16-24.69 degrees C). The total viable count was determined via the spread plate method on selective microbiological media to determine viable numbers of the selected bacterial pathogens in samples collected from the biodigesting chamber every seven or fourteen days over the duration of study. Multiple linear regression models including the log bacterial counts (response) and number of days, pH, and average daily temperature as predictors were developed using Matlab for each bacterium. The reduction (90-99.9%) in numbers of isolates of E. coli, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and Listeria varied with time (days) from their initial respective counts of 2 x 10(6), 7 x 10(4), 3 x 10(5), 9 x 10(5), and 1 x 10(4) cfu/g to concentrations lower than the detection limit (DL = 10(2) cfu/g substrate). E. coli demonstrated the least resistance to the environmental conditions in the biodigester and survived only for 77 days, unlike L. monocytogenes that lasted for 175 days and was the most resistant bacterium. From the models, the number of days and temperature were directly and inversely related to log Listeria counts, respectively, contrary to the others. The predictors, number of days, pH, and average daily temperature, were described as either primary or secondary factors based on the bacteria via the reliefF test.

AB  - Background: Chronic ulcerative colitis (UC) is a lifelong disease, patients with chronic UC have a high prevalence of common mental disorders. The increasing interest in the role of gut-brain axis is seen in inflammatory bowel diseases.
   Purpose: Corylin is a representative flavonoid compound isolated from the Psoraleae Fructus. This study aimed to identify the effects and mechanism of corylin on the inflammation interactions and 5-HT synthesis between the gut and brain in chronic UC.
   Methods: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced chronic UC mouse model was established to assess the therapeutic effect of corylin on chronic UC symptoms. The expression of inflammatory cytokines was detected in the colon and brain. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins of intestinal mucosal barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) in the hippocampus were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, several tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and related neurotransmitters in faeces, colon, serum, and brain were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. The interaction between corylin and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase (5-HTPDC) was performed by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Finally, the changes of gut microbiota composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.
   Results: Corylin significantly alleviated colitis symptoms and inhibited inflammatory response in the colon and brain of DSS-induced chronic UC mice. The TJ proteins of intestinal mucosal barrier and BBB were improved and the expression of Iba1 in the hippocampus was normalized after corylin treatment. In addition, corylin treatment increased the expression of neurotransmitters in the brain, especially 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), but the expression of 5-HT in the colon was inhibited. Further study firstly proved that corylin could bind to the 5-HTDPC, and then inhibit the expression of 5-HTDPC and VB6, resulting in the 5-HT reduction and 5-HTP accumulation in the colon. Moreover, the intake of corylin transformed the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota, Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, and Turicibacter were decreased but Dubosiella, Enterorhabdus, and Candidatus_Stoquefichus were increased.
   Conclusion: Corylin administration ameliorated DSS-induced colitis and inhibited intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation via regulating the inflammation interactions across gut-brain axis and increasing 5-HTP generation in the colon.

AB  - Pseudorabies (also called Aujeszky's disease) is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the pseudorabies virus (PRV, or Suid herpesvirus 1). Although the disease has been controlled by immunization with the PRV-attenuated vaccine, the emerging PRV variants can escape the immune surveillance in the vaccinated pig, resulting in recent outbreaks. Furthermore, the virus has been detected in other animals and humans, indicating cross-transmission of PRV. However, the mechanism of PRV cross-species transmission needs further study. In this study, we compared the amino acid sequences of glycoproteins (gD), gL, and thymidine kinase (TK) of PRV strains, human PRV hSD-1 2019 strain, and the attenuated strain Bartha-K61, followed by predication of their spatial conformation. In addition, the interactions between the viral gD protein and host nectin-1, nectin-2, and HS were also evaluated via molecular docking. The results showed that the amino acid sequence homology of the gD, gL, and TK proteins of hSD-1 2019 and JL-CC was 97.5%, 94.4%, and 99.1%, respectively. Moreover, there were mutations in the amino acid sequences of gD, gL, and TK proteins of hSD-1 2019 and JL-CC compared with the corresponding reference sequences of the Bartha strain. The mutations of gD, gL, and TK might not affect the spatial conformation of the protein domain but may affect the recognition of antibodies and antigen epitopes. Moreover, the gD protein of JL-CC, isolated previously, can bind to human nectin-1, nectin-2, and HS, suggesting the virus may be highly infectious and pathogenic to human beings.

AB  - Zinc-enriched mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs) are bioceramics with potential antibacterial and osteogenic properties. However, few assays have been performed to study these properties in animal models. In this study, MBGs enriched with up to 5% ZnO were synthesized, physicochemically characterized, and evaluated for their osteogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo. The ZnO MBGs showed excellent textural properties despite ZnO incorporation. However, the release of Zn2+ ions inhibited the mineralization process when immersed in simulated body fluid. In vitro assays showed significantly higher values of viability and expression of early markers of cell differentiation and angiogenesis in a ZnO-content-dependent manner. The next step was to study the osteogenic potential in a sheep bone defect model. Despite their excellent textural properties and cellular response in vitro, the ZnO MBGs were not able to integrate into the bone tissue, which can be explained in terms of inhibition of the mineralization process caused by Zn2+ ions. This work highlights the need to develop nanostructured materials for bone regeneration that can mineralize to interact with bone tissue and induce the processes of implant acceptance, cell colonization by osteogenic cells, and regeneration of lost bone tissue.

AB  - Simple Summary Physiological changes to the body can affect the brain. For example, inflammation that originates in the body can be sensed by the brain. In this study, we used an agent called resiquimod (R848) to stimulate inflammation in the periphery and measured structural and metabolic brain responses in anesthetized mice using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Relative to baseline prior to drug administration, a high dose of R848 caused sickness behaviors and volume expansion in several cortical regions at 3 h that were no longer evident at 24 h. Transient volume expansion in response to peripheral immune stimulation is consistent with brain swelling. Peripheral administration of the E. coli endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rats promotes secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in previous studies was associated with transient enlargement of cortical volumes. Here, resiquimod (R848) was administered to mice to stimulate peripheral immune activation, and the effects on brain volumes and neurometabolites determined. After baseline scans, 24 male, wild-type C57BL mice were triaged into three groups including R848 at low (50 mu g) and high (100 mu g) doses and saline controls. Animals were scanned again at 3 h and 24 h following treatment. Sickness indices of elevated temperature and body weight loss were observed in all R848 animals. Animals that received 50 mu g R848 exhibited decreases in hippocampal N-acetylaspartate and phosphocreatine at the 3 h time point that returned to baseline levels at 24 h. Animals that received the 100 mu g R848 dose demonstrated transient, localized, volume expansion (~5%) detectable at 3 h in motor, somatosensory, and olfactory cortices; and pons. A metabolic response evident at the lower dose and a volumetric change at the higher dose suggests a temporal evolution of the effect wherein the neurochemical change is demonstrable earlier than neurostructural change. Transient volume expansion in response to peripheral immune stimulation corresponds with previous results and is consistent with brain swelling that may reflect CNS edema.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is an infectious-parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania spp. The available treatments are based upon expensive drugs bearing adverse side-effects. The search for new therapeutic alternatives that present a more effective action without causing adverse effects to the patient is therefore important. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of botryosphaeran, a (1 -> 3)(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucan, on the promastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis. The direct activity of botryosphaeran on promastigote forms was evaluated in vitro and inhibited proliferation, the IC50 7 mu g/mL in 48 h was calculated. After 48 h treatment, botryosphaeran induced nitric oxide production (NO), caused mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and accumulation of lipid vesicles in promastigotes, resulting in apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy, and was accompanied by morphological and ultrastructural changes. The range of concentrations used did not alter the viability of peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice and erythrocytes of sheep. Botryosphaeran was able to reduce the number of infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes per macrophage at 12.5 mu g/mL (50.75% +/- 6.48), 25 mu g/mL (55.66% +/- 3.93) and 50 mu g/mL (72.9% +/- 6.98), and IC50 9.3 mu g/mL (+/- 0.66) for intracellular amastigotes forms. The leishmanicidal effect was due to activation of NF-kappa B and promoted an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6), iNOS and microbial-derived ROS and NO, in addition to decreasing the levels of SOD. Based upon the data obtained, we infer that botryosphaeran exerted an active leishmanicidal and immunomodulatory effect, acting on promastigotes through autophagic, apoptotic and necrosis processes, and in the intracellular amastigote form, through the action of ROS and NO.

AB  - Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal syndrome (PMS) carries high risks of undesirable side effects. This study explores irisin as a potential alternative to HRT and investigates the underlying mechanisms. Ovariectomized (OVX) female mice was used as an animal model. The experimental mice were divided into sham, OVX, OVX + irisin (1, 3 mu g/kg), OVX+ estradiol (0.5 mg/kg), and OVX + irisin + compound C (AMPK inhibitor) groups. Results showed that OVX induced depression, anxiety, and bodyweight growth in female mice. These OVX-induced abnormalities were reversed by irisin treatment, while AMPK inhibitor abolished irisin's function, indicating that irisin's therapeutic effects on OVX mice were achieved by activating AMPK. Moreover, irisin could increase pAMPK levels and ameliorate the overexpression of NF-kappa B and its downstream factors including inflammatory factors (IL-1(3, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and neurotoxic mediators (COX-2 and iNOS) in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and serum of the OVX mice. However, irisin did not affect hypothalamus pAMPK level or food intake. These findings indicate that irisin's therapeutic effects on depression and anxiety may be linked to its inhibition of inflammatory factors and neurotoxic mediators in the serum and brain, occurring through the AMPK/NF-kappa B pathway. Additionally, irisin's effect of reducing bodyweight may be associated with an increase in serum pAMPK level, rather than a direct impact on food intake. Further mechanistic exploration revealed that the beneficial effects of irisin, including both the attenuation of bodyweight gain and the improvement of neurological deficits, are attributed to the activation of alpha V(35 receptors.

AB  - Stress contributes to numerous psychopathologies, including memory impairment, and threatens one's well-being. It has been reported that creatine supplementation potentially influences cognitive processing. Hence, in this study, we examined the effects of creatine supplementation on memory, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal arborization in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats under chronic restraint stress (CRS). Thirty-two adult male Wistar rats (8 weeks old) weighing 200-250 g were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8/per group): control, stress, creatine, and stress + creatine. CRS was induced for 6 h per day for 14 days, and creatine supplementation was carried out by dissolving creatine (2 g/kg body weight per day) in the animals' drinking water for 14 days. We used the Barnes maze and shuttle box for spatial and passive avoidance memory examination. The in-vivo field potential recording and Golgi-Cox staining were also used to investigate long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendrite arborization in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. Chronic stress impaired spatial memory, dysregulated LTP parameters, and decreased the number of dendrites in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of stressed rats, and creatine supplementation modified these effects in stressed rats. It seems that creatine supplementation can improve spatial memory deficits and synaptic plasticity loss induced by CRS in hippocampal CA1 neurons, possibly by reducing the dendrite arborization damages. However, understanding its mechanism needs further investigation.

AB  - Diminished hepatocyte regeneration is a key feature of acute and chronic liver diseases and after extended liver resections, resulting in the inability to maintain or restore a sufficient functional liver mass. Therapies to restore hepatocyte regeneration are lacking, making liver transplantation the only curative option for end -stage liver disease. Here, we report on the structure -based development and characterization (nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectroscopy) of first -in -class small molecule inhibitors of the dual -specificity kinase MKK4 (MKK4i). MKK4i increased liver regeneration upon hepatectomy in murine and porcine models, allowed for survival of pigs in a lethal 85% hepatectomy model, and showed antisteatotic and antifibrotic effects in liver disease mouse models. A first -in -human phase I trial (European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials [EudraCT] 2021-000193-28) with the clinical candidate HRX215 was conducted and revealed excellent safety and pharmacokinetics. Clinical trials to probe HRX215 for prevention/treatment of liver failure after extensive oncological liver resections or after transplantation of small grafts are warranted.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by sinonasal mucosal inflammation. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is associated with severe CRS phenotypes. Different animal models have been proposed to study the association of CRS and S. aureus. However, current animal models are expensive due to the use of large animals, have high barriers to ethics approval, or require invasive surgical intervention, necessitating a need for a model that can overcome these limitations. This study aimed at establishing a reliable and efficient rat lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory model for rhinosinusitis. Sprague Dawley rats received a daily intranasal application of 20 mu L of saline, S. aureus CI-182 exoprotein (250 mu g/mL), or exoprotein CI-182 in combination with S. aureus clinical isolate (CI-908 or CI-913) 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL. The rats' sinuses were harvested at 1 and 2 weeks post-intervention. The CFU and histopathologic examination of inflammation were evaluated. S. aureus clinical isolates CI-908 or CI-913 in combination with the exoprotein (CI-182) had higher CFUs and caused persistently higher inflammation at both the 1 and 2-week post-intervention compared to the exoprotein and saline group. The observed inflammatory cell type was lymphoplasmacytic. This study provided evidence that the combination of a S. aureus exoprotein with S. aureus induces inflammation that persists for a minimum of two weeks post-intervention. This model is the first known animal model to create the lymphoplasmacytic inflammation subtype seen in CRS patients. This offers a cost-effective, accessible, non-invasive, and easy-to-replicate model to study the causes and treatment of such inflammation.

AB  - Plasticity in the cardiac function of a marine mammal facilitates rapid adjustments to the contrasting metabolic demands of breathing at the surface and diving during an extended apnea. By matching their heart rate (f(H)) to their immediate physiological needs, a marine mammal can improve its metabolic efficiency and maximize the proportion of time spent underwater. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a known modulation of f(H) that is driven by respiration and has been suggested to increase cardiorespiratory efficiency. To investigate the presence of RSA in cetaceans and the relationship between f(H), breathing rate (f(R)) and body mass (M-b), we measured simultaneous f(H) and f(R) in five cetacean species in human care. We found that a higher f(R) was associated with a higher mean instantaneous f(H) (if(H)) and minimum if(H) of the RSA. By contrast, f(H) scaled inversely with M-b such that larger animals had lower mean and minimum if(H)s of the RSA. There was a significant allometric relationship between maximum if(H) of the RSA and M-b, but not f(R), which may indicate that this parameter is set by physical laws and not adjusted dynamically with physiological needs. RSA was significantly affected by f(R) and was greatly reduced with small increases in f(R). Ultimately, these data show that surface f(H)s of cetaceans are complex and the f(H) patterns we observed are controlled by several factors. We suggest the importance of considering RSA when interpreting f(H) measurements and particularly how f(R) may drive f(H) changes that are important for efficient gas exchange.

AB  - Research on marine mammal habitat-associations often uses satellite remote sensing of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and sea surface height to map mesoscale features, which may indicate areas of enhanced productivity and prey availability. However, for species that feed at depths >400 m, the increased productivity associated with mesoscale features observed near the surface may have little or no immediate effect on habitat-associations at depth. As a result, previous studies have found a weak correlation between mesoscale features and the movements of marine mammals. The advantage of biologging is that hydmgraphic variables are recorded in situ and at foraging depths using animal-borne instruments with sensors for temperature, conductivity (salinity), and dissolved oxygen. The goal of this study was to characterize the habitat-associations of female southern elephant seals (SES) from Peninsula Valdes, Argentina during the post-breeding foraging trip. Although female SES exhibited significant habitat-associations with sea surface height anomaly and chlorophyll concentrations, the presence or absence of eddies was not predictive of foraging behavior, and the majority of foraging dives (74%) and prey encounters (77%) occurred in the absence of eddies. The strongest habitat-association was with deep (>500 m) and cold (3.73 +/- 1.29 degrees C) subantarctic water, primarily during foraging dives from dusk to dawn. Female SES made most of their foraging dives (68%, mean maximum depth of 539 +/- 226 m) and had the most prey encounters (67%) in Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), which is formed near the Subantarctic Front on the northern flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our results suggest that AAIW is the principal foraging habitat of female SES from Peninsula Valdes, which may not be directly associated with near-surface mesoscale features. Future research on the habitat-associations for SES and other deep-diving marine mammals should focus on indices of foraging success and the hydrographic features of water masses at foraging depths, not mesoscale features observed near the surface.

AB  - The use of secondary metabolites of rice to control pests has become a research hotspot, but little is known about the mechanism of rice self-resistance. In this study, metabolomics analysis was performed on two groups of rice (T1, with insect pests; T2, without pests), indicating that fatty acids, alkaloids, and phenolic acids were significantly up-regulated in T1. The up-regulated metabolites (p-value < 0.1) were enriched in linoleic acid metabolism, terpene, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. Six significantly up-regulated differential metabolites in T1 were screened out: N-trans-feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine (1), N-trans-feruloyltyramine (2), N-trans-p-coumaroyltyramine (3), N-cis-feruloyltyramine (4), N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine (5), and benzamide (6). The insect growth inhibitory activities of these six different metabolites were determined, and the results show that compound 1 had the highest activity, which significantly inhibited the growth of Chilo suppressalis by 59.63%. Compounds 2-4 also showed a good inhibitory effect on the growth of Chilo suppressalis, while the other compounds had no significant effect. RNA-seq analyses showed that larval exposure to compound 1 up-regulated the genes that were significantly enriched in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, the cell cycle, ribosomes, and other pathways. The down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and other pathways. Eighteen up-regulated genes and fifteen down-regulated genes from the above significantly enriched pathways were screened out and verified by real-time quantitative PCR. The activities of detoxification enzymes (glutathione S-transferase (GST); UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT); and carboxylesterase (CarE)) under larval exposure to compound 1 were measured, which indicated that the activity of GST was significantly inhibited by compound 1, while the activities of the UGT and CarE enzymes did not significantly change. As determined by UPLC-MS, the contents of compound 1 in the T1 and T2 groups were 8.55 ng/g and 0.53 ng/g, respectively, which indicated that pest insects significantly induced the synthesis of compound 1. Compound 1 may enhance rice insect resistance by inhibiting the detoxification enzyme activity and metabolism of Chilo suppressalis, as well as promoting cell proliferation to affect its normal growth and development process. The chemical-ecological mechanism of the insect resistance of rice is preliminarily clarified in this paper.

AB  - Ketamine is a common anesthetic used in human and veterinary medicine. This drug has recently received increased medical and scientific attention due to its indications for neurological diseases. Despite being applied for decades, ketamine's entire metabolism and pharmacological profile have not been elucidated yet. Therefore, insights into the metabolism and brain distribution are important toward identification of neurological effects. Herein, we have investigated ketamine and its metabolites in the pig brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma using mass spectrometric and metabolomics analysis. We discovered previously unknown metabolites and validated their chemical structures. Our comprehensive analysis of the brain distribution of ketamine and 30 metabolites describes significant regional differences detected mainly for phase II metabolites. Elevated levels of these metabolites were identified in brain regions linked to clearance through the cerebrospinal fluid. This study provides the foundation for multidisciplinary studies of ketamine metabolism and the elucidation of neurological effects by ketamine.

AB  - As an organizing framework for questions of mind and brain, I discuss how the brain builds and uses mental models. Mental models provide a complex, structured description of some situation in the world. The role of perception is to build such a model for the current environment; knowledge provides many of the building blocks; in episodic memory, a previous model is reinstated; in cognitive control, the model dictates a choice of action. A model, I suggest, is a compositional, whole brain state, combining information from multiple specialised brain systems into a structured description of entities in the model and their roles and relationships. The default mode network may play an organizational role as parts of a model are combined into a broader whole. The model combines an active attentional foreground with a more extensive, latent background. Foreground is based on active neural firing, orchestrated by the brain's multiple demand network. Background may also include low-intensity neural activity, but with a substantial contribution from both faster and slower aspects of synaptic change. Interplay between foreground and background underlies core aspects of cognition, including cognitive control, problem solving, abstraction, and learning. Together, these proposals suggest how integrated, whole-brain functions build mental models, providing a unifying framework for the diverse concerns of cognitive neuroscience.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Altrenogest, also known as allyl trenbolone, is a steroidal progestin that is widely used in veterinary medicine to synchronize estrus in gilts. To achieve the target number of services per week, enough weaned sows and gilts are needed each week for breeding. A problem with progestogen-synchronized replacement gilts is the variation of the interval between last feeding of altrenogest and onset of estrus. In the present study, we found that gilt backfat thickness had a strong positive correlation with the interval between last feeding of altrenogest and onset of estrus. This result may come from a larger reservoir of altrenogest in adipose tissue in fatter gilts.
   Estrus synchronization of gilts can be achieved by feeding the orally active progestogen altrenogest (AT) to cycling gilts at 20 mg/day for 14 to 18 days with gilts usually returning to estrus 4 to 8 days after the last feeding. In practice, gilts failing to exhibit estrus by 6 days after AT withdrawal may compromise weekly breeding targets. The cause of prolonged intervals to estrus are unknown but may involve prolonged suppression due to the release of progesterone (P4), and by extension AT, from adipose tissues. The present study examined relationships between gilt P2 backfat depth (<13.5 mm, 14-16.5 mm, >17 mm groups), the AT withdrawal to estrus interval, and subsequent reproductive performance in gilts. We noted longer intervals to estrus in gilts with greater P2 backfat depths (p < 0.0001), and higher serum P4 concentrations on the last day of AT feeding and at estrus detection (p < 0.05). Total born litter sizes were unaffected by backfat depth, but pigs born alive progressively decreased with increasing backfat depth with the fattest gilts producing the fewest liveborn pigs (p < 0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that adipose tissues may provide a reservoir of steroid, with its release from fatter gilts having potential negative effects on their subsequent reproductive performance.

AB  - Stress-induced antinociception (SIA) is due to the activation of several neural pathways and neurotransmitters that often suppress pain perception. Studies have shown that the orexin neuropeptide system is essential in pain modulation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of orexinergic receptors in the hippocampal CA1 region in modulating SIA response during the formalin test as an animal model of inflammatory pain. The orexin-1 receptor (OX1r) antagonist, SB334867, at 1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol or TCS OX2 29 as an orexin-2 receptor (OX2r) antagonist at the same doses were microinjected into the CA1 region in rats. Five minutes later, rats were exposed to restraint stress (RS) for 3 h, and pain-related behaviors were monitored in 5-min blocks for the 60-min test period in the formalin test. Results showed that applying RS for 3 h reduced pain responses in the early and late phases of the formalin test. The main findings showed that intra-CA1 injection of orexin receptor antagonists reduced the antinociception caused by stress in both phases of the formalin test. In addition, the contribution of OX2r in mediating the antinociceptive effect of stress was more prominent than that of OX1r in the early phase of the formalin test. However, in the late phase, both receptors worked similarly. Accordingly, the orexin system and its two receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus regulate SIA response to this animal model of pain in formalin test.

AB  - BackgroundThe sorption characteristics and glass transition temperature are important attributes that determine the shelf life of foods, particularly in powder form, whereas color is a key factor influencing consumer acceptance. As the popularity of matcha green tea powder is increasing, this study investigated whether the country of origin of examples of matcha products available on the Polish market influenced the sorption properties, glass transition temperature, and color.ResultsAll matcha powders exhibited sigmoidal water adsorption isotherms at 25 degrees C. The monolayer moisture content corresponding to the point of maximum stability ranged from 0.045 to 0.053 g water per g of sample. The glass transition temperature of anhydrous matcha powders varied between 106.3 and 139.0 degrees C. Based on the sorption and glass transition results, the matcha from Brazil should be the most stable during storage. The same sample showed the highest water solubility index values at temperatures above 80 degrees C and the lowest bulk density. The color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C*, and h) depended on the matcha powder variant.ConclusionThe results indicate that the optimal storage conditions for tea powders do not depend directly on the country of origin. Further research should therefore focus on analyzing the impact of climate or fertilization. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematode parasitism is a major burden to small ruminant production globally, compounded by increasing anthelmintic resistance. Previous studies have identified essential oils (EOs) from the Lippia genus with antiprotozoal and anthelmintic effects. Lippia dominguensis Moldenke (Ld), an endemic specie from the Dominican Republic, has similar popular uses, however, is chemically and pharmacologically yet uncharacterized. Here, we investigated the in vitro anthelmintic activity of LdEO and its ultrastructural effects on eggs and adult nematodes of Haemonchus contortus multidrug-resistant isolated. The GC/MS analysis showed linalool (33.85 %), 1,8-cineole (30.88 %), and delta-terpineol (10.61 %) as the main EO constituents. The LdEO showed an IC50=0.523 mg/mL in the egg hatch test, and the motility in the adult worm motility test was 95.8 % at 1 mg/mL. The confocal scanning laser microscopy of eggs indicated permeabilization or disruption of egg cell membranes as the possible mechanism of action of LdEO. The scanning electron microscopy of adult worms showed wrinkling, undulations, and cuticular disruptions. The LdEO displayed significant in vitro anthelmintic activity on eggs and adult worms of H. contortus. Additionally, the LdEO showed low oral toxicity in mice at 2,000 mg/kg. Thus, additional in vivo studies are justified to determine its anthelmintic efficacy in small ruminants.

AB  - Simple Summary Total mixed rations (TMR) have become the usual feeding method for cattle, since being brought into ruminant feeding systems. Though there are numerous benefits of TMR, it also possesses some drawbacks, especially feed sorting. This has resulted in the recent tendency to provide fully pelleted TMR to sheep and goats in some regions of the world. However, the application of pelleted TMR treated with different non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) to neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ratio on Holstein growing cattle was unknown. This research was carried out to investigate the influences of low and high NFC to NDF ratio pelleted TMR on growth performance, rumen fermentation and inflammatory response in Holstein growing cattle. The results demonstrated that low NFC/NDF (1.07) pelleted TMR can improve the growth performance, reduce feed costs and elevate the digestibility of DM, NDF as well as ADF of Holstein growing cattle. However, high NFC/NDF (1.71) pelleted TMR has adverse effects on rumen fermentation and inflammatory response compared with low NFC/NDF (1.07). Under the condition of this experiment, low NFC/NDF (1.07) pelleted TMR is recommended when applied for Holstein growing cattle fattening. Twenty-four healthy castrated male Holstein growing cattle, with similar body weight (301 +/- 11.5 kg), were enrolled in this study and randomly allocated into two groups (12/pen). Holstein growing cattle in the LPT (low NFC/NDF pelleted TMR) group were fed basal pelleted TMR with a low NFC/NDF ratio (NFC/NDF = 1.07), while the HPT (high NFC/NDF pelleted TMR) group were fed with a high NFC/NDF ratio diet (NFC/NDF = 1.71). The results showed that: (1) Body measurements were found to be increased for the LPT group (p < 0.05); compared with the HPT group, feed intake to gain ratio and feed cost in the LPT group were decreased by 12.24% and 15.35%, respectively (p < 0.01). Compared with the HPT group, the LPT group tended to increase chest girth. (2) Digestibility of DM and NDF in the LPT group was higher (p < 0.05) than in the HPT group, being increased by 3.41% and 4.26%, respectively, and increased digestibility of ADF in the LPT group was significant (p < 0.01). (3) The daily feed consumption of NDF in the LPT group was higher than that in the HPT group and the daily rumination time and chewing time in the LPT group were longer than that in the HPT group (p < 0.05). (4) Compared with the LPT group, the parameter of pH, microbial protein and acetate: propionate (p < 0.05) in the HPT group were decreased by 8.57%, 12.46% and 23.71%, respectively. In contrast, the concentration of total volatile fatty acids, acetate and propionate were higher (p < 0.05) in the HPT group, and increased by 13.49%, 19.59% and 52.70%, respectively. (5) Compared with the LPT group, rumen fluid in the HPT group diet up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of BRECs pro-inflammatory factor IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05), and meanwhile, up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of BRECs pro-inflammatory factor IL-6 (p < 0.01); compared with the LPT group, rumen fluid in the HPT group diet up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of CCL28 and CCL20 (p < 0.05) chemokines in CCL types of BRECs; in addition, compared with the LPT group, rumen fluid in the HPT group up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL9 and CXCL14 chemokines in CXCL types of BRECs (p < 0.01), and the mRNA expression levels of the CXCL5 chemokine tended to be increased (p = 0.06).

AB  - Designed hen eggs enriched in DHA and EPA are an alternative source of essential phospholipids. This study assessed the effects of ovophospholipids on lymphocyte subsets in non-immunized mice and on the humoral immune response in sheep red blood cells (SRBC)-immunized mice. Ovophospholipids were administered orally for 14 days (once a day) at doses of 100, 10, and 1 mg/kg. Ovophospholipids increased the total lymphocyte count of in the lymphoid organs. At 10 and 1 mg/kg, ovophospholipids increased the subsets of CD4-CD8- and CD4+CD8+ thymocytes but decreased the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes. A stimulating effect on splenocytes was particularly evident 24 h after administration of the 10 and 1 mg/kg doses. Ovophospholipids also elevated the absolute counts of CD3+ and CD19+ splenocytes. An increase in the absolute count of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes of the mesenteric lymph nodes was observed 24 h after administration of the lowest dose. The increase in the percentage and absolute count of CD19+ cells and in the absolute count of CD3+ cells was still observed after 72 h. At all doses, ovophospholipids elevated the number of plaque-forming cells on day 4 and increased 2-mercaptoethanol-resistant antibody titer on day 7 after priming. In conclusion, ovophospholipids can modulate the immune response in mice.

AB  - Seasonal greening is a crucial survival strategy for albino tea cultivars, during which dysfunctional chloroplasts recover and chlorophyll biosynthesis increases in albino leaves. However, the regulatory mechanisms of seasonal greening in albino tea plants remain unclear. Here, we report that CsRVE1, a nuclear-located Myb-like transcription factor, can positively modulate the seasonal greening of albino Camellia sinensis cv. Huangkui leaves by activating the expression of genes involved in light harvesting and chlorophyll biosynthesis. The transcriptional expression of CsRVE1 increased during seasonal greening and was tightly correlated with increases in the expression of genes involved in light harvesting (CsLhcb) and chlorophyll biosynthesis (CsCHLH, CsHEMA1 and CsCAO). In vivo and in vitro molecular analyses showed that CsRVE1 can directly bind to the promoters of CsLhcb, CsCHLH and CsPORA, eventually leading to chlorophyll accumulation in tea leaves. Furthermore, transient suppression of CsRVE1 in tea leaves led to a decrease in target gene expression. In contrast, the overexpression of CsRVE1 in Arabidopsis led to chlorophyll increases and the activation of AtLhcb, AtPORA, AtCHLH, etc. These results identify CsRVE1 as an important promoter of seasonal greening that functions by regulating genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis in albino tea plants and shed new light on the regulatory mechanisms of leaf phenotypes in plants.

AB  - The accumulation of various pigments leads to the formation of different flower colors in plants. However, the regulation mechanism of yellow flower formation and flower color differences between Camellia nitidssima C.W.Chi (CN) and its hybrids C. 'Zhenghuangqi' (ZHQ), C. 'Huangxuanlv' (HXL), and C. 'Xinshiji' (XSJ), remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that the content of two flavonols, quercetin-7-O-glucoside (Qu7G) and quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Qu3G), was positively correlated with the yellow degree of petals in CN and its three hybrids. Additionally, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of petals of the four yellow camellia plants, which revealed 322 common upregulated and 866 common downregulated DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in the CN vs. ZHQ, CN vs. HXL, and CN vs. XSJ comparison groups. Their regulatory pathway analysis showed that flavonol biosynthesis genes (FLSs and GTs) and transcriptional regulatory genes MYBs were all expressed higher in CN than its three hybrids, which corresponded to differences in the flavonol content among the four yellow camellias. Further, two ethylene synthesis genes (ACSs, ACO) and three ethylene signaling genes (EIN2s, EIN3, ERFs) were all upregulated in the yellow petals of CN. In conclusion, the expression of flavonol-related genes and flavonols (Qu7G and Qu3G) accumulation could play a key role in the formation of yellow flowers in camellia, and the ethylene pathway might be involved in the regulation of yellow flower formation of camellias. This work describes the possible regulatory pathway of yellow camellia, thereby laying a foundation for future verification of genes linked to flower coloring and the breeding of yellow camellia.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate possible associations between body weight, conformation, testicular biometry, semen characteristics, and sexual behavior of young Creole bucks with high (HSH), medium (MSH), and low (LSH) social hierarchy (SH). A total of 15 young Creole bucks, aged 2-3-month-old with mean body weight of14.6 +/- 3.3 kg were used. Social behavior frequency was analyzed by chi-square test. Body weight, live body measurement, testosterone and semen characteristics were analyzed using a mixed-effects model. Pearson correlation coefficients was obtained for body weight, linear body measures, indexes, testicular and semen characteristics, sexual behavior, and social hierarchy. The HSH bucks presented more aggression events with contact (P <= 0.05). SH had a significant effect on live weight (22.5 kg), anamorphosis index (72.9), compactness index (37.37), and live body measurement, with HSH and MSH bucks being superior to LSH bucks. Scrotal circumference (21.6 cm), testicular biometry, and odor (2.5) were higher in HSH and MSH bucks than in LSH bucks (P <= 0.05). The ejaculate volume (0.52 mL), spermatozoa concentration (1.06 million/ml), and mass motility (2.3) were higher in HSH bucks than in LSH bucks (P <= 0.05). SH influenced libido (34.9%), mount latency (68.7 s), and response times (56.5 s); HSH bucks had more consummatory sexual behavior (36.5 %) than LSH bucks (P <= 0.05). Significant (P <= 0.05) correlations were observed between live body measurement, testicular and sexual characteristics to SH. It was concluded that young Creole bucks with medium and high social hierarchy had better testicular characteristics, semen quality, higher frequency of consummatory sexual behavior, and higher linear body measurement than Creole bucks with low social hierarchy.

AB  - Oral administration of protein drugs has always been challenging owing to various intestinal barriers. Herein, we developed an efficient oral protein delivery strategy by using in situ polymerization of zwitterions to encapsulate proteins, which were then loaded into enteric coated capsules for oral feeding. After oral administration of such capsules, the enteric coating would be degraded once the capsule enters the intestine, releasing polyzwitterion/protein nanocomplexes. With the help of polyzwitterion modification, such nano complexes were able to pass through the mucus and cellular barriers, likely by the proton-assisted amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) pathway. Such a polyzwitterion-based protein encapsulation strategy could allow for effective oral delivery of different proteins, including bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin, and antibodies. Using this strategy, the oral bioavailabilities of insulin and immunoglobin G (IgG) were measured to be as high as 16.9% and 12.5%, respectively. Notably, oral feeding of polyzwitterion/insulin capsules could effectively lower the blood glucose level of diabetic animals (mice, rats, and pigs). Moreover, polyzwitterion/antiprogramed death-1 (alpha PD-1) capsules were able to induce efficient antitumor immune responses, showing significant tumor inhibition effects toward B16F10-and 4T1-tumor bearing mouse models after oral administration. No significant toxic effect was observed for such oral protein formulations in the treated animals. Our work presents a strategy for the efficient oral delivery of protein drugs, including those with large molecular weights (e.g., antibodies) that can hardly be orally delivered using existing technologies.

AB  - Globally, farmers report high levels of occupational stress. The purpose of this study was to identify and explore factors associated with perceived stress among Canadian farmers. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods design was used. An online cross-sectional national survey of Canadian farmers (n = 1132) was conducted in 2015-2016 to collect data on mental health, demographic, lifestyle, and farming characteristics; stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale. A multivariable linear regression model was used to investigate the factors associated with perceived stress score. Qualitative interviews (n = 75) were conducted in 2017-2018 with farmers and agricultural sector workers in Ontario, Canada, to explore the lived experience of stress. The qualitative interview data were analyzed via thematic analysis and then used to explain and provide depth to the quantitative results. Financial stress (highest category-a lot: (B = 2.30; CI: 1.59, 3.00)), woman gender (B = 0.55; CI: 0.12, 0.99), pig farming (B = 1.07; CI: 0.45, 1.69), and perceived lack of support from family (B = 1.18; CI: 0.39, 1.98) and industry (B = 1.15; CI: 0.16-2.14) were positively associated with higher perceived stress scores, as were depression and anxiety (as part of an interaction). Resilience had a small negative association with perceived stress (B = -0.04; CI: -0.06, -0.03). Results from the qualitative analysis showed that the uncertainty around financial stress increased perceived stress. Women farmers described the unique demands and challenges they face that contributed to their overall stress. Results from this study can inform the development of mental health resources and research aimed at decreasing stress among Canadian farmers.

AB  - More than 50% of the world population is chronically infected with herpesviruses. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are the cause of herpes labialis (cold sores), genital herpes, and sight-impairing keratitis. Less frequently, life-threatening disseminated disease (encephalitis and generalized viremia) can also occur, mainly in immuno-compromised patients and newborns. After primary infection, HSV persists for life in a latent state in trigeminal or sacral ganglia and, triggered by diverse stimuli, disease recurs in more than 30% of patients up to several times a year. Current therapy with nucleoside analogs targeting the viral polymerase is somewhat effective but limited by poor exposure in the nervous system, and latent infections are not affected by therapy. Here, we report on an inhibitor of HSV helicase-primase with potent in vitro anti-herpes activity, a different mechanism of action, a low frequency of HSV resistance, and a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. Improved target tissue exposure results in superior efficacy in preventing and treating HSV infection and disease in animal models as compared to standard of care. Therapy of primary HSV infections with drug candidate IM-250 {(S)-2-(2',5'-difluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-N-methyl-N-(4-methyl-5-(S-methylsulfon-imidoyl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide} not only reduces the duration of disease symptoms or time to healing but also prevents recurrent disease in guinea pigs. Treatment of recurrent infections reduces the frequency of recurrences and viral shedding, and, unlike nucleosidic drugs, IM-250 remains effective for a time after cessation of treatment. Hence, IM-250 has advantages over standard-of-care therapies and represents a promising therapeutic for chronic HSV infection, including nucleoside-resistant HSV.

AB  - During late gestation and lactation, oxidative stress in sows can affect their health and reproductive performance. Supplemental amino acid contributes to the antioxidant capacity of pigs. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different combinations of Gln, Leu and gamma-GABA (amino acid mixtures, AAMs) during late gestation and lactation on the performance of the sows and their offspring. Fifty large white x landrace sows were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n = 10), including a control group and four AAMs groups (AAMs1, Gln + Leu; AAMs2 (Gln + GABA; AAMs3, Leu + GABA; AAMs4, Gln + Leu + GABA). AAMs supplementation improved the antioxidant capacity of sows, including significantly enhanced total antioxidant capacity in AAMs2, 3 and 4 groups and reduced malonaldehyde concentration in AAMs1, 3 and 4 groups. Additionally, all AAMs significantly increased lactoprotein, total solid and IgA levels of colostrum in sows during lactation. Average body weight of piglets on day 21 after birth in all AAMs groups were significantly increased. Furthermore, the significantly increased total antioxidant capacity was observed in the piglets of every AAMs group. In conclusion, supplementing AAMs during late gestation and lactation improved the antioxidant capacity of sows and colostrum composition, thereby enhancing antioxidant status and the growth performance of piglets. This study provides the possibility of maternal amino acid mixtures to improve the productivity of the swine industry.

AB  - Maternal undernutrition is highly prevalent in developing countries, leading to severe fetus/infant mortality, intrauterine growth restriction, stunting, and severe wasting. However, the potential impairments of maternal undernutrition to metabolic pathways in offspring are not defined completely. In this study, 2 groups of pregnant domestic pigs received nutritionally balanced gestation diets with or without 50% feed intake restriction from 0 to 35 gestation days and 70% from 35 to 114 gestation days. Full-term fetuses were collected via C-section on day 113/114 of gestation. MicroRNA and mRNA deep sequencing were analyzed using the Illumina GAIIx system on fetal liver samples. The mRNA-miRNA correlation and associated signaling pathways were analyzed via CLC Genomics Workbench and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software. A total of 1189 and 34 differentially expressed mRNA and miRNAs were identified between full-nutrition (F) and restricted-nutrition (R) groups. The correlation analyses showed that metabolic and signaling pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, death receptor signaling, neuroinflammation signaling pathway, and estrogen receptor signaling pathways were significantly modified, and the gene modifications in these pathways were associated with the miRNA changes induced by the maternal undernutrition. For example, the upregulated ( P < . 05) oxidative phosphorylation pathway in R group was validated using RT-qPCR, and the correlational analysis indicated that miR-221, 103, 107, 184, and 4497 correlate with their target genes NDUFA1, NDUFA11, NDUFB10 and NDUFS7 in this pathway. These results provide the framework for further understanding maternal malnutrition's negative impacts on hepatic metabolic pathways via miRNA-mRNA interactions in full-term fetal pigs.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Flavanols are known as the most important antioxidants in tea (Camellia sinensis), but their contribution to the antioxidant capacity across tea cultivars has not been quantified. This study explored whether the variations of antioxidant capacity across tea cultivars could be linked to variations in main flavanol concentrations using 20 widely planted Chinese tea cultivars. The results showed that concentrations of flavanols, both monomeric (total catechins; 3.77%-8.85% d.w.) and polymeric forms (condensed tannins; 9.48%-17.67% d.w.), varied largely across tea cultivars. The contribution of total catechins to the antioxidant capacity in tea (R-2 = 0.54-0.55) was greater than that of condensed tannins (R-2 = 0.35-0.36) and total phenolic concentrations (R-2 = 0.33-0.36). Individual catechin components collectively explained 54.94%-56.03% of the variations in antioxidant capacity across tea cultivars. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was the leading catechin component that determined the antioxidant capacity in tea (p < 0.001), accounting for up to 57% of the differences in catechin composition between tea cultivars with high and low antioxidant capacities. These results suggested that flavanols were stronger predictors of the antioxidant capacity across tea cultivars compared to total phenolic concentrations, providing guidance for breeding tea cultivars with strong antioxidant capacities.

AB  - Tea cultivars with yellow- or white-leaf variations have a high economic value due to their high amino acid (especially theanine) concentration. However, the dynamic changes of amino acid components (especially theanine) and related gene expression during new shoot development in these cultivars are still unclear. In this study, 264 tea samples from four representative varieties picked during the harvest period in spring were analyzed for their amino acid profiles. The dynamic change rules of ethylamine and 19 amino acids were summarized in normal green and yellow cultivars during new shoot development. Interestingly, the theanine concentration in the yellow cultivar was significantly higher than that in the green cultivar, and increased gradually as the leaves matured until they reached a maximum in the one bud and three leaves stage. The amino acid concentration in the leaves of the yellow cultivar increased significantly with leaf position, which was generally in contrast to the normal green cultivar. Transcriptome and correlation analyses revealed that CsGS1, CsPDX2, CsGGP5, CsHEMA3 and CsCLH4 might be the key genes potentially responsible for the differential accumulation of theanine in green and yellow tea cultivars. These results provide further information for the utilization and improvement of tea plants.

AB  - Lin28b and let-7 miRNA regulate mammalian pubertal initiation and Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) production. However, it remains unclear which signaling pathways Lin28b regulates to modulate GnRH production. In this study, the mRNA expression levels of Lin28b and let-7 in the pubertal and juvenile goat hypothalamus and pituitary gland were detected, and Lin28b expression in the pubertal hypothalamus decreased significantly compared with that in juvenile tissues. It was predicted that Lin28b might inhibit GnRH1 expression, which was verified in the GnRH-producing cell model GT1-7 cells. Lin28b inhibited GnRH1 expression and promoted Kiss1/Gpr54 signaling. The pyruvate content and the expression of Hif1a and Hk2, which were related to glycolysis, were also promoted by Lin28b overexpression. Additionally, 77 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIs) in Lin28b-overexpressed GT1-7 cells were identified. Bioinformatics analysis and mRNA expression of the target genes of DEMIs revealed that the MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways were key pathways that involved the regulatory effect of Lin28b on GnRH. In GT1-7 cells, GnRH1 expression was suppressed by blocking mTOR signaling with rapamycin, which was rescued by Lin28b overexpression. These results indicate that Lin28b-let-7 regulates GnRH1 expression through several pathways, including the Kiss1/Gpr54, MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways, which are all related to glucose metabolism and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the regulatory role of Lin28b on GnRH production.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disrupts cellular homeostasis through lysosomal dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy, contributing to neuronal degeneration. Despite advances in our understanding of these mechanisms, effective therapeutic options remain limited. This study investigates amlexanox (AMX), a broad-spectrum phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, as a potential treatment for TBI-induced neuronal damage. AMX not only increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by inhibiting multiple PDE isoforms but also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and glial activation via NF-kappa B and STAT3 pathway inhibition. This dual pharmacological profile suggests a multifaceted therapeutic potential for brain injury. High-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library identified AMX as an agent that restores lysosomal acidity through protein kinase A (PKA) activation in primary neuron cultures. In vitro scratch assays demonstrated that AMX enhances lysosomal function, reduces dendritic loss, and promotes neuronal survival. Using a controlled cortical impact model, in vivo experiments revealed that AMX alleviates oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, suppresses neuroinflammation by reducing microglial and astrocytic activation, and preserves neuronal viability in the hippocampus. Behavioral assessments confirmed significant improvements in cognitive and neurological deficits following TBI. These findings establish that AMX is a promising therapeutic agent that restores lysosomal function and mitigates TBI-induced neuronal damage through multi-target PDE inhibition and anti-inflammatory actions.

AB  - Changes in intestinal mucosal barrier permeability lead to antigen sensitization and mast cell-mediated allergic reactions, which are considered to play important roles in the occurrence and development of food allergies. It has been suggested that protein causes increased intestinal permeability via mast cell degranulation, and we investigated the effect of camellia Moringa oleifera leaves protein on intestinal permeability and explored its role in the development of food allergies. The current study investigated the effect of M. oleifera leaves protein on intestinal permeability through assessments of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transmembrane transport of FITC-dextran by Caco-2 cells. The expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), IL-8, Occludin, Claudin-1, and perimembrane protein family (ZO-1) were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting. The effect of M. oleifera leaves protein on intestinal permeability was verified in mice in vivo. The serum fluorescence intensity was measured using the FITC-dextran tracer method, and the expression of tight junction proteins was detected using Western blotting. The results showed that M. oleifera leaves protein widened the gaps between Caco-2 cells, reduced transmembrane resistance, and increased permeability. This protein also reduced the mRNA and protein levels of Occludin, Claudin-1, and ZO-1. Animal experiments showed that intestinal permeability was increased, and that the expression of the tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-1 were downregulated in mice. This study shows that M. oleifera leaves protein has components that increase intestinal permeability, decrease tight junction protein expression, promote transmembrane transport in Caco-2 cells, and increase intestinal permeability in experimental animals. The finding that M. oleifera leaves active protein increases intestinal permeability suggests that this protein may be valuable for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of M. oleifera leaves allergy.

AB  - Blastocystis, an obligate host-associated protist, is the most common microbial eukaryote in the human gut, and is widely distributed across vertebrate hosts. The evolutionary transition of Blastocystis from its free-living stramenopile ancestors to a radiation of host-associated organisms is poorly understood. To explore this, we cultured and sequenced eight strains representing the significant phylogenetic diversity of the genus using long-read, short-read, and Hi-C DNA sequencing, alongside gene annotation and RNA sequencing. Comparative genomic analyses reveal significant variation in gene content and genome structure across Blastocystis. Notably, three strains from herbivorous tortoises, phylogenetically distant from human subtypes, have markedly larger genomes with longer introns and intergenic regions, and retain canonical stop codons absent in the human-associated strains. Despite these genetic differences, all eight isolates exhibit gene losses linked to the reduced cellular complexity of Blastocystis, including losses of cilia and flagella genes, microtubule motor genes, and signal transduction genes. Isolates from herbivorous tortoises contain higher numbers of plant carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, suggesting that, like gut bacteria, these protists ferment plant material in the host gut. We find evidence that some of these carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes were horizontally acquired from bacteria, indicating that horizontal gene transfer is an ongoing process in Blastocystis that has contributed to host-related adaptation. Together, these results highlight substantial genetic and metabolic diversity within the Blastocystis genus, indicating that different lineages of Blastocystis have varied ecological roles in the host gut.

AB  - Formation and consolidation of memories for highly stressful (traumatic) events is a complex process that involves interplay between multiple memory systems and has implications for etiology and treatment of stress- and trauma-related disorders. Here we study effects of sleep/wake states and high intra-hippocampal corticosterone on consolidation of aversive contextual memories, as well as consolidation of association between auditory unpaired phasic background cues and fear response in rats. Animals were implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes for sleep assessment and cannulas for intra-hippocampal corticosterone application. They were familiarized to a "safe box" and then trained in a fear conditioning paradigm in a distinct "shock box" with a prominent unpaired phasic background auditory cue. Immediately after conditioning, animals received bilateral intra-hippocampal saline (1 mu l) or corticosterone (10 ng in 1 mu l) injection and were either allowed to sleep or were kept awake for a following two-hour consolidation period. Memory tests 24 h later revealed that the salineinjected animals that slept during consolidation had significantly stronger fear responses in the shock box compared to the safe box as well as increased fear response in response to the auditory cue. Lack of sleep during the consolidation period in saline injected animals led to generalization of the fear response to the safe context, while association between auditory cue and fear response was preserved. High intra-hippocampal corticosterone levels during memory consolidation led to generalization of fear response to the safe context, regardless of sleep/ wake state, while enhancement of response to auditory cue was not observed. Our results show how manipulation of conditions during consolidation can lead to greatly variable memories for an aversive episode with distinct behavioral outcomes. Observed overgeneralization of fear to safe context and altered fear response to background phasic cue has implications for understanding etiology of pathological memory alternations in stressrelated conditions e.g., in posttraumatic stress disorder in humans.

AB  - The devastation of crops by elephants is increasingly fuelling the anger of farmers in the human -elephant conflict. However, the crop damage attributed to elephants by farmers appears disproportionate. Despite the fact that observed crop damage has an impact on the lives of local populations, the assessment of damage remains a controversial issue. The multitude of evaluation methods used by informants makes it difficult to compare results from different areas and to harmonise and/or transpose management strategies. It is therefore wise to take an interest in evaluation methods, to know their constraints, their advantages, and their connection points. This is the purpose of this study, which offers a bibliographic synthesis of the subject based on documentary research and a synthetic analysis of articles and documents. Two types of damage assessment emerge: quantitative and qualitative. Each type of assessment requires different assessment methods, which can be combined to obtain more accurate results. A qualitative assessment can be carried out through interviews, questionnaires, bibliographic research/review, etc., and a quantitative assessment through a total site visit, a visit to conflict hot and cold spots, or a visit to a random sample of the site. Ratings can be combined because qualitative rating is subjective. Many informants use it because it is easy to carry out and gives an idea of the state of devastation of cultures and sociological constraints. Quantitative assessment requires resources but provides results on the ground. However, combining different types of assessment improves the accuracy, reliability of results, and understanding of the conflict. This bibliographic synthesis also reveals that damage assessment tools are today moving towards new information and communication technologies, because these make the work easier and more practical while improving precision.

AB  - The objective of our study was to investigate the impact of neonatal overfeeding on cognitive functions and neurosteroidogenesis in male rats. Offspring were assigned to either small litters (SL; 4 pups/mother), resulting in increased milk intake and body weight gain, or normal litters (NL; 10 pups/mother). On postnatal day (PND) 21, half of the male rats were euthanized, while the remaining were kept under standard conditions (4 rats/cage) until PND70. At this stage, subjects underwent assessments for locomotor activity, anxiety levels via the elevated plus maze, and episodic-like memory (ELM) tests. By PND90, the rats were euthanized for brain dissection. Utilizing micropunch techniques, dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, and CA3 regions were extracted for analysis of mRNA expression and methylation patterns. At PND21, SL rats exhibited increased body and adipose tissue weights, alongside elevated cholesterol, glucose, and triglyceride levels compared to NL counterparts. By PND90, although metabolic disparities were no longer evident, SL rats demonstrated heightened anxiety-like behavior and diminished performance in ELM tests. Early life changes included a decreased expression of aromatase (P450arom) and 3 alpha-HSD in CA1, with increased levels in CA3 and DG among SL rats. Additionally, PND90 rats from SL exhibited increased P450arom and decreased 5 alpha-reductase 1 (5 alpha R-1) expression in DG. Notably, some of these variations were correlated with changes in methylation patterns of their promoter regions. Our findings reveal that neonatal overfeeding exerts a long-term adverse effect on cognitive abilities and neurosteroidogenic pathways, underscoring the lasting impact of nutritional experiences during critical early postnatal development periods.

AB  - The amyloid cascade hypothesis assumes that the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is driven by a self-perpetuating cycle, in which beta-amyloid (A beta) accumulation leads to Tau pathology and neuronal damages. A particular mutation (A673T) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) was identified among Icelandic population. It provides a protective effect against Alzheimer- and age-related cognitive decline. This APP mutation leads to the reduced production of A beta with A2T (position in peptide sequence) change (A beta ice). In addition, A beta ice has the capacity to form protective heterodimers in association with wild-type A beta. Despite the emerging interest in A beta ice during the last decade, the impact of A beta ice on events associated with the amyloid cascade has never been reported. First, the effects of A beta ice were evaluated in vitro by electrophysiology on hippocampal slices and by studying synapse morphology in cortical neurons. We showed that A beta ice protects against endogenous A beta-mediated synaptotoxicity. Second, as several studies have outlined that a single intracerebral administration of A beta can worsen A beta deposition and cognitive functions several months after the inoculation, we evaluated in vivo the long-term effects of a single inoculation of A beta ice or A beta-wild-type (A beta wt) in the hippocampus of transgenic mice (APPswe/PS1dE9) over-expressing A beta 1-42 peptide. Interestingly, we found that the single intra-hippocampal inoculation of A beta ice to mice rescued synaptic density and spatial memory losses four months post-inoculation, compared with A beta wt inoculation. Although A beta load was not modulated by A beta ice infusion, the amount of Tau-positive neuritic plaques was significantly reduced. Finally, a lower phagocytosis by microglia of post-synaptic compounds was detected in A beta ice-inoculated animals, which can partly explain the increased density of synapses in the A beta ice animals. Thus, a single event as A beta ice inoculation can improve the fate of AD-associated pathology and phenotype in mice several months after the event.

AB  - This study integrates the Backpropagation (BP) Neural Network with several optimization algorithms, namely Hippopotamus Optimization (HO), Parrot Optimization (PO), Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA), and Goose Optimization (GO), to develop four predictive models for the adhesive strength of heat-treated wood: HO-BP, PO-BP, OOA-BP, and GO-BP. These models were used to predict the adhesive strength of the wood that was heat-treated under multiple variables such as treatment temperature, time, feed rate, cutting speed, and abrasive particle size. The efficacy of the BP neural network models was assessed utilizing the coefficient of determination (R2), error rate, and CEC test dataset. The outcomes demonstrate that, relative to the other algorithms, the Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) method shows better search efficacy and convergence velocity. Furthermore, XGBoost was used to statistically evaluate and rank input variables, revealing that cutting speed (m/s) and treatment time (hours) had the most significant impact on model predictions. Taken together, these four predictive models demonstrated effective applicability in assessing adhesive strength under various processing conditions in practical experiments. The MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2 values of the HO-BP model reached 0.0822, 0.1024, 1.1317, and 0.9358, respectively, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy compared to other models. These findings support industrial process optimization for enhanced wood utilization.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) resulting from hypertensive disease of pregnancy (HDP) leads to sexually dimorphic hippocampal-dependent cognitive and memory impairment in humans. In our translationally-relevant mouse model of IUGR incited by HDP, we have previously shown that the synaptic development in the dorsal hippocampus including GABAergic development, NPTX2+ excitatory synaptic formation, axonal myelination, and perineural net (PNN) formation, were perturbed by IUGR at adolescent equivalence in humans (P40). The persistence of these disturbances through early adulthood and the potential upstream mechanisms are currently unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that NPTX2+ expression, PNN formation, axonal myelination, all events closing synaptic development in the hippocampus, will be persistently perturbed, particularly affecting IUGR female mice through P60 given the fact that they had worse short-term recognition memory in this model. We additionally hypothesized that such sexual dimorphism is linked to persistent glial dysregulation. We induced IUGR by a micro-osmotic pump infusion of a potent vasoconstrictor U-46619, a thromboxane A2-analog (TXA2), in the last week of the C57BL/6 mouse gestation to precipitate HDP. Sham-operated mice were used as controls. At P60, we assessed hippocampal and hemispheric volumes, NPTX2 expression, PNN formation, as well as MBP, Olig2, APC/CC1, and M-NF expression. We also evaluated P60 astrocytic (GFAP) reactivity and microglial (Iba1 and TMEM119) activation using IF-IHC and Imaris morphological analysis plus cytokine profiling using mesoscale discovery platform (MSD). IUGR offspring continued to have smaller hippocampal volumes at P60 not related to changes in hemisphere volume. NPTX2+ puncta counts and volumes were decreased in IUGR hippocampal CA sub-regions of female mice compared to sex-matched shams. Intriguingly, NPTX2+ counts and volumes were concurrently increased in the DG sub-region. PNN volumes were smaller in CA1 and CA3 of IUGR female mice along with PNN intensity in CA3 but they had larger volumes in the CA3 of IUGR male mice. The myelinated axon (MBP+) areas, volumes and lengths were all decreased in the CA1 of IUGR female mice compared to sex-matched shams, which correlated with a decrease in Olig2 nuclear expression. No decrease number in APC/CC1+ mature oligodendrocytes was identified. We noted an increased in M-NF expression in the mossy fibers connecting DG to CA3 only in IUGR female mice. Reactive astrocytes denoted by GFAP areas, volumes, lengths, and numbers of branching were increased in IUGR female CA1 but in IUGR male CA3 compared to sex-matched shams. Lastly, activated microglia was only detected in IUGR female CA1 and CA3 sub-regions. We detected no difference in the cytokine profile between sham and IUGR adult mice of either sex. Collectively our data support a sexually-dimorphic impaired closure of pCP in the hippocampus of young adult IUGR mice with greater effects on females. A potential mechanism supporting such dimorphism may include oligodendrocytes dysfunction in IUGR females limiting myelination allowing axonal overgrowth followed by a reactive glial-mediated synaptic pruning.

AB  - This study reports the first complete mitochondrial genome assembly of Hippophae salicifolia, an ecologically and economically important plant endemic to the Himalayas. The 475,105 bp genome has a 44.80% GC content and an overall AT bias, comprising 74 genes (37 protein-coding, 31 tRNA, three rRNA, and three pseudogenes). We identified extensive repetitive elements, including 188 SSRs, 20 tandem repeats, and 455 dispersed repeats, and explored their potential roles in genome evolution. Codon usage analysis showed a bias for codons ending in A or U, while RNA editing analysis revealed 415 sites that mostly convert hydrophilic to hydrophobic amino acids. Phylogenetic and collinearity analyses clarified evolutionary relationships within Hippophae and uncovered genome rearrangements. In addition, extensive gene transfer was detected between the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes. Ka/Ks and nucleotide diversity analyses indicate that most genes are under purifying selection, with some possibly undergoing positive selection. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural and evolutionary features of the H. salicifolia mitochondrial genome and provide valuable insights for the genetic improvement and conservation of Hippophae species.

AB  - The fungal pathogen Didymella segeticola causes leaf spot and leaf blight on tea plant (Camellia sinensis), leading to production losses and affecting tea quality and flavor. Accurate detection and quantification of D. segeticola growth in tea plant leaves are crucial for diagnosing disease severity or evaluating host resistance. In this study, we monitored disease progression and D. segeticola development in tea plant leaves inoculated with a GFP-expressing strain. By contrast, a DNA-based qRT-PCR analysis was employed for a more convenient and maneuverable detection of D. segeticola growth in tea leaves. This method was based on the comparison of D. segeticola-specific DNA encoding a Cys2His2-zinc-finger protein (NCBI accession number: OR987684) in relation to tea plant Cs18S rDNA1. Unlike ITS and TUB2 sequences, this specific DNA was only amplified in D. segeticola isolates, not in other tea plant pathogens. This assay is also applicable for detecting D. segeticola during interactions with various tea cultivars. Among the five cultivars tested, 'Zhongcha102' (ZC102) and 'Fuding-dabaicha' (FDDB) were more susceptible to D. segeticola compared with 'Longjing43' (LJ43), 'Zhongcha108' (ZC108), and 'Zhongcha302' (ZC302). Different D. segeticola isolates also exhibited varying levels of aggressiveness towards LJ43. In conclusion, the DNA-based qRT-PCR analysis is highly sensitive, convenient, and effective method for quantifying D. segeticola growth in tea plant. This technique can be used to diagnose the severity of tea leaf spot and blight or to evaluate tea plant resistance to this pathogen.

AB  - D-serine and D-aspartate are involved in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-related physiological and pathological processes. D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 1 (DTD1) may biochemically contribute to D-serine or D-aspartate production. However, it is unclear thus far whether DTD1 regulates D-serine or D-aspartate content in neurobiological processes. In the present research, we found that DTD1 was essential to maintain the D-serine or D-aspartate homeostasis, which was consistent with the phenomenon that DTD1-deficiency resulted in changes in the quantity changes of functional NMDAR subunits in postsynaptic compartments. Moreover, DTD1 played a considerable role in regulating dendritic morphology and synaptic structure. As a consequence, DTD1 affected neurobiological events, including the synaptic strength of the CA3-to-CA1 circuit, dendritic spine density of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and behavioral performance of mice in the Morris water maze. These findings highlight the important role of DTD1 in synaptic transmission, neuronal morphology, and spatial learning and memory and suggest an undisclosed mechanism of DTD1 that participates the regulation of D-serine or D-aspartate homeostasis in hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Astrocytes can adopt multiple molecular phenotypes in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Here, we studied the associations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) levels with brain amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau pathologies. We assessed 121 individuals across the aging and AD clinical spectrum with positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging for A beta ([F-18]AZD4694) and tau ([F-18]MK-6240), as well as CSF GFAP and YKL-40 measures. We observed that higher CSF GFAP levels were associated with elevated A beta-PET but not tau-PET load. By contrast, higher CSF YKL-40 levels were associated with elevated tau-PET but not A beta-PET burden. Structural equation modeling revealed that CSF GFAP and YKL-40 mediate the effects of A beta and tau, respectively, on hippocampal atrophy, which was further associated with cognitive impairment. Our results suggest the existence of distinct astrocyte biomarker signatures in response to brain A beta and tau accumulation, which may contribute to our understanding of the complex link between reactive astrogliosis heterogeneity and AD progression.

AB  - Although circadian rhythms are thought to be essential for maintaining body health, the effects of chronic circadian disruption during neurodevelopment remain elusive. Here, using the "Short Day" (SD) mouse model, in which an 8 h/8 h light/dark (LD) cycle was applied from embryonic day 1 to postnatal day 42, we investigated the molecular and behavioral changes after circadian disruption in mice. Adult SD mice fully entrained to the 8 h/8 h LD cycle, and the circadian oscillations of the clock proteins, PERIOD1 and PERIOD2, were disrupted in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the hippocampus of these mice. By RNA-seq widespread changes were identified in the hippocampal transcriptome, which are functionally associated with neurodevelopment, translational control, and autism. By western blotting and immunostaining hyperactivation of the mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways and enhanced global protein synthesis were found in the hippocampi of SD mice. Electrophysiological recording uncovered enhanced excitatory, but attenuated inhibitory, synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These functional changes at synapses were corroborated by the immature morphology of the dendritic spines in these neurons. Lastly, autistic-like animal behavioral changes, including impaired social interaction and communication, increased repetitive behaviors, and impaired novel object recognition and location memory, were found in SD mice. Together, these results demonstrate molecular, cellular, and behavioral changes in SD mice, all of which resemble autistic-like phenotypes caused by circadian rhythm disruption. The findings highlight a critical role for circadian rhythms in neurodevelopment.

AB  - The Paraguayan Chaco has experienced, in the last few decades, some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. In parallel, this region has registered an increase in the number of cattle heads of 60% in the last decade. Taking into account the high environmental and socioeconomic impact of this expansion, the aim of this work was to reveal how Beef-cattle ranching is carried out and to establish a typology that allows us to identify the different land-use patterns followed by the ranches. Data were collected using face-to-face structured interviews of 80 ranch owners. In the region ranches co-exist that practise the cow-calf system, the whole-cycle system and the fattening system. In all cases, ranches are very large, pasture based, highly specialised in Beef-cattle and export-oriented. Three groups of ranches were identified, being the main differentiating drivers: (i) the availability of the different production factors, (ii) the distribution of total area, and (iii) the degree of intensification in the use of capital, labour and/or technology per unit of agricultural area. In addition, it is noted that the years of activity of the ranches are related to these drivers. The typology of ranches contributes to a better understanding of one of the most active livestock frontiers in the world and shows that the expansion process taking place in the Paraguayan Chaco is associated with an intensification of Beef-cattle systems. These results provide a useful approach to develop policies that regulate the expansion of the cattle frontier in the Paraguayan Chaco.

AB  - Alperujo (AL), a by-product of the olive oil industry typically stored in evaporation ponds, poses valorisation challenges in Mediterranean regions. Co-composting with organic wastes-pig slurry (PS), sewage sludge (SS), and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW)-offers a potential solution. A comprehensive study of the valorisation process of AL through co-composting, from the storage period to the obtention of the final product, was developed considering the physico-chemical and respirometric variables of the material as well as the emissions generated throughout the process. The storage time of AL emerges as a critical factor that directly influences mass yield of co-composting, compost quality, and total gaseous emissions, making it a key aspect to be evaluated in this research. Fresh AL (FAL) generated CO2 emissions up to 10.5 times higher than hydrolysed AL (HAL) stored for three months. Co-composting HAL with bulking agents and OFMSW resulted in notable ammonia (up to 4.99 & sdot;103 g/t) and methane (up to 2.73 & sdot;104 g/t) emissions, correlated with pH and temperature of compostable material. This study provided a deeper insight into the composition of gaseous emissions determined by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which identified up to 20 different families of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): ketones predominated in FAL, esters in HAL mixtures, and alcohols in PS-containing treatments. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) underscored the influence of AL hydrolysis, co-substrate type, environmental temperature, and composting duration on composting dynamics and emission profiles.

AB  - Kainate (KA) receptors (KARs) are important modulators of synaptic transmission. We studied here the role of KARs on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the CA2 region of the hippocampus where the actions of these receptors are unknown. We observed that KA depresses glutamatergic synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses; an effect that was antagonized by NBQX (a KA/AMPA receptors antagonist) under condition where AMPA receptors were previously blocked. The study of paired-pulse facilitation ratio, miniature responses, and fluctuation analysis indicated a presynaptic locus of action for KAR. Additionally, we determined the action mechanism for this depression of glutamate release mediated by the activation of KARs. We found that inhibition of protein kinase A suppressed the effect of KAR activation on evoked excitatory post-synaptic current, an effect that was not suppressed by protein kinase C inhibitors. Furthermore, in the presence of Pertussis toxin, the depression of glutamate release mediated by KAR activation was not present, invoking the participation of a G(i/o) protein in this modulation. Finally, the KAR-mediated depression of glutamate release was not suppressed by treatments that affect calcium entry trough voltage-dependent calcium channels or calcium release from intracellular stores. We conclude that KARs present at these synapses mediate a depression of glutamate release through a mechanism that involves the activation of G protein and protein kinase A.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution has become a serious environmental issue worldwide, but its potential effects on health remain unknown. The administration of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) to mice for eight weeks impaired learning and memory behavior. PS-MPs were detected in the brain especially in the hippocampus of these mice. Concurrently, the hippocampus had decreased levels of immediate-early genes, aberrantly enhanced synaptic glutamate AMPA receptors, and elevated neuroinflammation, all of which are critical for synaptic plasticity and memory. Interestingly, ablation of the vagus nerve, a modulator of the gut-brain axis, improved the memory function of PS-MPs mice. These results indicate that exposure to PS-MPs in mice alters the expression of neuronal activity-dependent genes and synaptic proteins, and increases neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, subsequently causing behavioral changes through the vagus nerve-dependent pathway. Our findings shed light on the adverse impacts of PS-MPs on the brain and hippocampal learning and memory.

AB  - Rapid uterus involution is essential for minimising interpartum intervals, enhancing reproductive performance, and optimising production in ewes. This study aimed to accelerate the uterine involution of postpartum ewes through a relatively simple hormone treatment approach. In this study, 96 Dorper x Hu F1 ewes were assigned to three groups. The ewes were subsequently injected with normal saline (control group), prostaglandin + oxytocin (PG + OT group) and prostaglandin + oxytocin + horse chorionic gonadotropin (PG + OT + eCG group). Each group had 16 ewes producing a single lamb and 16 ewes producing twin lambs used to determine the effects of different treatments on their uterine involution and reproductive performance. PG + OT + eCG treatment accelerated the rate of uterine horn involution of single lambs (21.40 +/- 0.89 days vs. 30.66 +/- 1.03 days, p < 0.05) and twin hlambs (22.2 +/- 1.09 days vs. 30.33 +/- 0.81 days, p < 0.05) compared to the control group. PG + OT + eCG treatment also accelerated the regression of the uterine wall serosa structure and the removal of uterine effusion compared to PG + OT treatment, whose effect was moderate. PG + OT and PG + OT + eCG treatments had no significant effect on the recovery of the maximum uterine diameter of single and double lambing ewes compared to the control group. However, both treatments shortened the first estrus time of postpartum ewes (53.73 +/- 3.69 days vs. 48.06 +/- 5.87 days vs. 46.46 +/- 7.41 days, p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the conception rate among groups (p > 0.05). Notably, the change trend of reproductive hormones in postpartum ewes was consistent. PG + OT and PG + OT + eCG treatments significantly increased the concentration of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone during uterine involution (p < 0.05), but inhibited the secretion of progesterone compared to the control group. The peak of the luteinising hormone in the two treatment groups appeared 14 days earlier compared to that of the control group. In summary, exogenous PG + OT + eCG increases the concentration of estradiol during uterine involution, inhibits the secretion of progesterone, and accelerates the postpartum uterine involution and postpartum estrus time of ewes. These findings provide a basis for exploring the mechanism of uterine involution in sheep and improving sheep production efficiency.

AB  - Bombesin receptor-activated protein (BRAP) and its homologous protein in mice, which is encoded by bc004004 gene, were expressed abundantly in brain tissues with unknown functions. We treated bc004004(-/-) mice with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to test whether those mice were more vulnerable to stress-related disorders. The results of forced swimming test, sucrose preference test, and open field test showed that after being treated with CUMS for 28 days or 35 days both bc004004(-/-) and bc004004(+/+) mice exhibited behavioural changes and there was no significant difference between bc004004(+/+) and bc004004(-/-) . However, behavioural changes were observed only in bc004004(-/-) mice after being exposed to CUMS for 21 days, but not in bc004004(+/+) after 21-day CUMS exposure, indicating that lack of BRAP homologous protein may cause vulnerability to stress-related disorders in mice. In addition, bc004004(-/-) mice showed a reduction in recognition memory as revealed by novel object recognition test. Since memory changes and stress related behavioural changes are all closely related to the hippocampus function we further analyzed the changes of dendrites and synapses of hippocampal neurons as well as expression levels of some proteins closely related to synaptic function. bc004004(-/-) mice exhibited decreased dendritic lengths and increased amount of immature spines, as well as altered expression pattern of synaptic related proteins including GluN2A, synaptophysin and BDNF in the hippocampus. Those findings suggest that BRAP homologous protein may have a protective effect on the behavioural response to stress via regulating dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - Accumulating evidence underscores exercise as a straightforward and cost-effective lifestyle intervention capable of mitigating the risk and slowing the emergence and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating these exercise-induced benefits in AD remain elusive. The present study delved into the impact of treadmill exercise on memory retrieval performance, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, synaptic morphology, and the expression and activity of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic receptors (AMPARs) in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice (4-month-old males) were randomly assigned to either a treadmill exercise group or a sedentary group, with C57BL/6J mice (4-month-old males) as the control group (both exercise and sedentary). The exercise regimen spanned 8 weeks. Our findings revealed that 8-week treadmill exercise reversed memory retrieval impairment in step-down fear conditioning in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, treadmill exercise enhanced basic synaptic strength, short-term potentiation (STP), and long-term potentiation (LTP) of the hippocampus in these mice. Moreover, treadmill exercise correlated with an augmentation in synapse numbers, refinement of synaptic structures, and heightened expression and activity of AMPARs. Our findings suggest that treadmill exercise improves behavioral performance and facilitates synaptic transmission by increasing structural synaptic plasticity and the activity of AMPARs in the hippocampus of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which is involved in pre- and postsynaptic processes.

AB  - Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is one of the most widely cultivated crops worldwide and is valued for its nutritional, economic, and ecological benefits. The regulation of defense mechanisms against herbivores, along with osmotic loss and environmental regulation, is greatly affected by trichomes in cucumbers. In this study, we attempted to characterize trichomes and examined fruit physiological and transcriptome profiles by RNA sequencing in cucumber breeding lines 6101-4 and 5634-1 at three stages of fruit development through foliar application with a combination of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) in comparison to non-treated controls. Notable increases in the number of trichomes and altered forms were observed for both inbred cultivars 6101-4 and 5634-1 against foliar application of chemical substances. RNA-seq analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in multiple pathways in cucumber trichome formation. The enrichment of differentially expressed transcripts showed that foliar application upregulated the expression of many stress-responsive and trichome-associated genes including plant hormone signal transduction, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The dominant regulatory genes, such as allene oxide synthase (AOS) and MYB1R1 transcription factor, exhibited significant modulations in their expression in response to chemical application. The RNA-seq results were further confirmed by RT-PCR-based analysis, which revealed that after chemical application, the dominant regulatory genes, such as allene oxide synthase (AOS), PTB 19, MYB1R1, bHLH62-like, MADS-box transcription factor, and salicylic acid-binding protein 2-like, were differentially expressed, implying that these DEGs involved in multiple pathways are involved the positive regulation of the initiation and development of trichomes in C. sativus. A comparison of trichome biology and associated gene expression regulation in other plant species has shown that silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) are also responsible for hormonal and signaling pathway regulation. This study improves our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in C. sativus trichome development. It also emphasizes the possibility of utilizing chemical composition to modulate C. sativus trichome-related characteristics of C. sativus, leading to the improvement of plant defense mechanisms as well as environmental adaptation.

AB  - Neuroleptics have to be used for a long time to produce a therapeutic effect. Cytochrome P450 2D (CYP2D) enzymes mediate alternative pathways of neurotransmitter synthesis (i.e. tyramine hydroxylation to dopamine and 5-methoxytryptamine O-demethylation to serotonin), and metabolism of neurosteroids. The aim of our present study was to examine the influence of chronic treatment with the new atypical neuroleptic asenapine on CYP2D in rat brain. In parallel, liver CYP2D was investigated for comparison. Asenapine added in vitro to microsomes of control rats competitively, but weakly inhibited the activity of CYP2D (brain: Ki = 385 mu M; liver: Ki = 36 mu M). However, prolonged administration of asenapine (0.3 mg/kg sc. for 2 weeks) significantly diminished the activity and protein level of CYP2D in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and cerebellum, but did not affect the enzyme in the hypothalamus, brain stem, substantia nigra and the remainder of the brain. In contrast, asenapine enhanced the enzyme activity and protein level in the striatum. In the liver, chronically administered asenapine reduced the activity and protein level of CYP2D, and the CYP2D1 mRNA level. In conclusion, prolonged administration of asenapine alters the CYP2D expression in the brain structures and in the liver. Through affecting the CYP2D activity in the brain, asenapine may modify its pharmacological effect. By increasing the CYP2D expression/activity in the striatum, asenapine may accelerate the synthesis of dopamine (via tyramine hydroxylation) and serotonin (via 5-methoxytryptamine O-demethylation), and thus alleviate extrapyramidal symptoms. By reducing the CYP2D expression/activity in other brain structures asenapine may diminish the 21-hydroxylation of neurosteroids and thus have a beneficial influence on the symptoms of schizophrenia. In the liver, by reducing the CYP2D activity, asenapine may slow the biotransformation of concomitantly administered CYP2D substrates (drugs) during continuous treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar disorders.

AB  - In the present study, extract (E) and bio-ferment (B) were obtained from ground and defatted thistle seeds of Silybum marianum. Their antioxidant activity was assessed using the DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP techniques, while total polyphenols were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. High antioxidant activity was found in both the E (0.91 mmol Trolox/L +/- 0.2) and B (1.19 mmol Trolox/L +/- 0.2) using DPPH methods, so the obtained cosmetic raw materials were incorporated into hydrogel and organogel substrates to obtain cosmetic formulations with antioxidant activity. However, there is a scarcity of research providing information on the skin penetration of the main active components of S. marianum, which have an antioxidant effect. Therefore, we assessed in vitro the penetration through pig skin of the main components contained in the obtained B and E, such as silybin and taxifolin, which are part of the silymarin complex. We also used pure silymarin (S) for comparison. Among the tested preparations, H-S showed the utmost significant penetration of taxifolin, having a cumulative permeation of 87.739 +/- 7.457 mu g/cm(2). Biodegradation tests of the prepared formulations were also performed, containing cosmetic raw materials and S. Studies of the effect of the cosmetic formulations on aerobic biodegradation showed a good level of degradation for the prepared formulations, some of which (O-B and O-S) were classified as easily degradable (OECD).

AB  - Injectable polymeric hydrogels delivered via endoscopic catheter have emerged as promising submucosal agents, offering durable, long-lasting cushions to enhance the efficacy of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the removal of small, flat polyps from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). However, polymer-based injections do not meet the easy-injectability criteria via catheter because their high viscosity tends to clog the catheter needle. To the best of knowledge, for the first time, report the fabrication of an amphiphile-based small molecule hydrogel of diglycerol monostearate (DGMS) that self-assembles to form hydrogel (DGMSH) for delivery via an endoscopic catheter. Physicochemical characterization of the hydrogel reveals its fibrous morphology, shear-thinning behaviour, and easy injectability, along with its scalability and long shelf-life (6 months). Ex vivo studies on the goat's stomach and intestine demonstrate the ease of injectability through the catheters and the development of visible submucosal cushion depots with the desired height. Moreover, the hydrogel can encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs/dyes. In vivo studies in small animals have found that the hydrogel depot is durable, biocompatible, non-immunogenic, and has a hemostatic effect. Endoscopic studies in the porcine model demonstrate a safe injection and endoscopic excision of GI polyps acting as a suitable agent for ESD.

AB  - Excitatory pyramidal (PYR) cell activation of interneurons (INT) produces network oscillations that underlie cognitive processes in the hippocampus (CA1). Neural projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the hippocampus contribute to novelty detection by modulating CA1 PYR and INT activity. The role of the VTA in the VTA-hippocampus loop is mostly attributed to the dopamine neurons although the VTA glutamate-releasing terminals are dominant in the hippocampus. Because of the traditional focus on VTA dopamine circuits, how VTA glutamate inputs modulate PYR activation of INT in CA1 neuronal ensembles is poorly understood and has not been distinguished from the VTA dopamine inputs. By combining CA1 extracellular recording with VTA photostimulation in anesthetized mice, we compared the effects of VTA dopamine and glutamate input on CA1 PYR/INT connections. Stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons shortened PYR/INT connection time without altering the synchronization or connectivity strength. Conversely, activation of VTA dopamine inputs delayed CA1 PYR/INT connection time and increased the synchronization in putative pairs. Taken together, we conclude that VTA dopamine and glutamate projections produce tract-specific effects on CA1 PYR/INT connectivity and synchrony. As such, selective activation or co-activation of these systems will likely produce a range of modu-latory effects on local CA1 circuits.

AB  - TTK21 is a small-molecule activator of p300/creb binding protein (CBP) acetyltransferase activity, which, upon conjugation with a glucose-derived carbon nanosphere (CSP), can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and activate histone acetylation in the brain. Its role in adult neurogenesis and retention of long-term spatial memory following intraperitoneal (IP) administration is well established. In this study, we successfully demonstrate that CSP-TTK21 can be effectively administered via oral gavage. Using a combination of molecular biology, microscopy, and electrophysiological techniques, we systematically investigate the comparative efficacy of oral administration of CSP and CSP-TTK21 in wild-type mice and evaluate their functional effects in comparison to intraperitoneal (IP) administration. Our findings indicate that CSP-TTK21, when administered orally, induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus without significantly altering basal synaptic transmission, a response comparable to that achieved through IP injection. Remarkably, in a spinal cord injury model, oral administration of CSP-TTK21 exhibits efficacy equivalent to that of IP administration. Furthermore, our research demonstrates that oral delivery of CSP-TTK21 leads to improvements in motor function, histone acetylation dynamics, and increased expression of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) in a spinal injury rat model, mirroring the effectiveness of IP administration. Importantly, no toxic and mutagenic effects of CSP-TTK21 are observed at a maximum tolerated dose of 1 g/kg in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats via the oral route. Collectively, these results underscore the potential utility of CSP as an oral drug delivery system, particularly for targeting the neural system.

AB  - Key message Among the variety of leaf defensive strategies to counteract herbivory attacks, the oak species analyzed in this study maximize investment in no more than one, with high-LMA oaks developing very tough leaves and low-LMA oaks favoring between high concentrations of condensed tannins or high growth rates.Context Plants develop a variety of defense strategies to counteract herbivory attacks, from physical and chemical defenses to tolerance strategies. Tradeoffs between strategies have been widely assessed from a resource allocation perspective, but there is a need to consider eventual interactions among them.Aim We evaluate the among-species tradeoff between three main constitutive plant defense traits, while considering the leaf mass per area ratio (LMA) as a proxy of leaf construction investment on area basis. Methods Leaf toughness measured as work of fracture, condensed tannins, and relative growth rate (RGR) were analyzed in a set of 19 Quercus L. species with contrasting LMA.Results Most species had low values either in two or in the three traits analyzed. Moreover, the highest values of work of fracture appeared in the species with high LMA; the highest values of condensed tannins were found in the species with the lowest LMA; and high values of RGR were measured in species with intermediate or lower values of LMA.Conclusion Oaks showed a trade-off among leaf defensive strategies influenced by LMA. Oaks with high LMA developed very tough leaves while oaks with low LMA presented lower values of toughness but favored between one of the two other strategies.

AB  - To explore the role of alleles in the aroma biosynthesis pathways of the tea plant, this study was conducted to identify and analyze the alleles of structural genes in the MVA, MEP, LOX and shikimate pathways based on Camellia sinensis 'Jinguanyin' haplotype-resolved genomes. The results showed that 69 pairs of alleles were identified in the four pathways, of which 24 genes showed allele-specific expression (ASE) in at least one tissue. TGY-allele and HD-allele correlations of buds, young leaves, and stems were higher in the six tissues of JGY. KEGG analysis revealed that 24 ASEGs were significantly enriched in GPI-anchor biosynthesis and monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathways. The results suggest that the specifically expressed alleles of CsMCT, CsGGPPS2, CsHMGS2, CsHMGR3, CsTPS10, CsADH4, CsDAHPS, CsCM3, and CsAS2 may play critical roles in the aroma formation of JGY cultivars. The qRT.PCR results showed that the bias of CsTPS1, CsMVD, CsDHQS, and CsAS2 alleles was basically consistent with the expression of the parents (TGY and HD) of JGY in young leaves. In addition, qRT.PCR was used to detect the expression of aroma-related genes during the manufacturing process of JGY and parents (TGY and HD) oolong tea. It showed that CsMVD, CsDXS2, CsTPS3, CsTPS9, CsTPS10, CsTPS13 and CsTPS14 play an essential role in the formation of the characteristic floral and fruit aromas of oolong tea.

AB  - As a new epigenetic mark, DNA N6-adenine (6mA) methylation plays an important role in various biological processes and has been reported in many prokaryotic organisms in recent years. However, the distribution patterns and functions of DNA 6mA modification have been poorly studied in non-model crops. In this study, we observed that the methylation ratio of 6mA was about 0.016% in the sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) genome using mass spectrometry. We first constructed a comprehensive 6mA landscape in sea buckthorn genome using nanopore sequencing at single-base resolution. Distribution analysis suggested that 6mA methylated sites were widely distributed in the sea buckthorn chromosomes, which were similar to those in Arabidopsis and rice. Furthermore, reduced 6mA DNA methylation is associated with different expression of genes related to the fruit-ripening process in sea buckthorn. Our results revealed that 6mA DNA modification could be considered an important epigenomic mark and contributes to the fruit ripening process in plants.

AB  - Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) are a major cause of primary aldosteronism, a common form of endocrine hypertension. Here, we demonstrate that Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) plays a dual role in adrenal cell biology, regulating both oxidative stress and aldosterone production. Using RNA sequencing of RSL3-treated human adrenal cells and spatial transcriptomics of adrenal glands from patients with primary aldosteronism, we identify EGR1 as a key gene associated with RSL3-related oxidative stress and APAs. We show that EGR1 silencing decreases oxidative stress and increases CYP11B2 gene expression and aldosterone production in adrenal cells, while its overexpression has the opposite effects. Notably, EGR1 expression is downregulated in APAs and aldosterone-producing micronodules compared to the adjacent adrenal cortex, which correlates in part with decreased levels of oxidative stress markers. The adrenal cortex of pigs with secondary hyperaldosteronism shows decreased immunostaining of EGR1 and a marker of oxidative stress, suggesting a potential link between EGR1 expression, oxidative stress levels, and adrenocortical function. These findings reveal a novel mechanism linking EGR1 to oxidative stress regulation and aldosterone production in adrenal cells, with potential implications for the pathogenesis of APAs and other adrenocortical tumors.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the hippocampus, a crucial region for memory and cognitive functions, is particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of exposure to heavy metals. Nickel (Ni) is a neurotoxic agent that, primarily induces oxidative stress, a process known to contribute to cellular damage, which consequently affects neurological functions. The antioxidant properties of melatonin are a promising option for preventing the adverse effects of Ni, especially by protecting cells against oxidative stress and related damage. In our investigation of the potential neuroprotective effects of melatonin against Ni-induced neurotoxicity, we chose to administer melatonin through intraperitoneal injection in rats following an intrahippocampal injection of Ni into the left hippocampus. This approach allows us a targeted investigation into the influence of melatonin on the neurotoxic effects of Ni, particularly within the crucial context of the hippocampus. In the present study, we demonstrated that melatonin efficiency reduced lactate dehydrogenase level, and preserved antioxidant enzyme activities in Ni-exposed hippocampal tissue. It also mitigated the decline in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. On the other hand, melatonin could act directly by reducing reactive oxygen species Ni-induced overproduction. Taking to gather these two potential mechanisms of action could be responsible for the adverse effect of Ni on the behavioral alteration observed in our study. This study provides significant insights into the potential of melatonin to mitigate the detrimental effects of Ni on the brain, particularly into the hippocampal region, suggesting its possible implications for the treatment of neurological disorders related to Ni exposure.

AB  - Oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) and vitrification procedures lead to detrimental effects on the overall oocyte quality. The addition of antioxidants during IVM, such as the coenzyme Q10 (Q10), has been demonstrated to positively impact on the cumulus-oocyte complexes due to its role in protection from oxidative damage and modulating gene transcription. Furthermore, glucocorticoids (GC) regulate gene transcription, energy metabolism and apoptosis during the early steps of reproduction. In this sense, most GC actions are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), a transcription factor. However, the specific roles of GC in ovarian physiology and oocyte maturation are still unknown. In this regard, a better knowledge on the expression of GC-related and apoptosis-related genes during IVM and cryopreservation procedures could potentially benefit the refinement of assisted reproductive techniques in the bovine species. The present study aims to explore the expression of NR3C1 mRNA in fresh and vitrified bovine oocytes and cumulus cells in response to Q10 (50 mu M), and the effect of cortisol addition (0.25 mu M, 0.5 mu M) on the expression of NR3C1. We also studied the mRNA expression of NR3C1-related genes belonging to the GC regulation pathway, such as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD11B1; HSD11B2), immunophilins (FKBP4; FKBP5), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3; STAT5A), the mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2), and to the apoptosis pathway, such as the anti- (BCL2) and pro-apoptotic (BAX) mRNA transcripts in oocytes and cumulus cells 1) after IVM, and 2) after vitrification, both in presence or absence of Q10 supplementation during IVM. Our results show that there is an increase in the NR3C1 receptor expression after vitrification of oocytes, but not after exogenous cortisol supplementation during IVM. In addition, Q10 reduces the mRNA expression of HSD11B1 and FKBP5 in oocytes at levels of immature oocytes (HSD11B1 mRNA expression also in cumulus cells), and the BAX:BCL2 ratio mRNA expression. After vitrification in the presence of Q10, HSD11B2 mRNA expression increases in cumulus cells, while HSD11B1 and BAX:BCL2 mRNA expression decreases significantly both in oocytes and cumulus cells. In conclusion, our results show for the first time the effect of IVM, vitrification and Q10 supplementation on the mRNA relative expression of GC-related and apoptosis genes, and the effect of vitrification in the protein expression of NR3C1.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Protein restriction strategies are often used in weaned piglets to reduce the incidence of intestinal disorders that are sensitive to dietary protein supply, but may lead to a decline in production performance. Subsequent protein realimentation can alleviate the detrimental effects of reduced dietary protein on growth. However, the effects of protein realimentation on the body composition, gut microbiota and metabolite profiles of piglets are poorly understood. The present study, combining comparative slaughter methods, microbiome and metabolome analyses, demonstrated that protein restriction and subsequent realimentation lead to compensatory growth and compensatory protein deposition in piglets, and contribute to animal intestinal health by altering the gut microbiota and metabolite profiles.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of protein restriction and subsequent protein realimentation on the body composition, gut microbiota and metabolite profiles of piglets. Fifty weaned piglets were randomly assigned to two treatments: a normal protein (NP) group (20% crude protein (CP)) or a low protein (LP) group (16% CP) with five animals per pen and five pens per group. Treatment diets were fed for 14 d during the protein restriction phase, and then all pigs were fed the same nursery diets with a normal CP level (19% CP) during the protein realimentation phase until they reached an average target body weight (BW) of 25 +/- 0.15 kg. At day 14 and the end of the experiment, one piglet close to the average BW of each pen was slaughtered to determine body composition, microbial composition and microbial metabolites. Results showed that there was no difference (p > 0.05) in the experimental days to reach target BW between the LP and NP groups. The average daily gain (ADG) and gain:feed ratio (G:F) during the protein restriction phase as well as BW at day 14, were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the LP group compared with the NP group. However, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) during the protein realimentation phase and the overall experiment. Similarly, piglets in the LP group showed a significantly decreased body protein content (p < 0.05) at day 14, but not (p > 0.05) at the end of the experiment. The relative abundance of Parabacteroides, Butyricicoccus, Olsenella, Succinivibrio and Pseudoramibacter were significantly increased (p < 0.05), while the relative abundance of Alloprevotella and Faecalicoccus were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the LP group at day 14. At the end of the experiment, the piglets in the LP group showed a higher (p < 0.05) colonic relative abundances of Parabacteroides, unidentified Christensenellaceae and Caproiciproducens, and a lower (p < 0.05) relative abundance of unidentified Prevotellaceae, Haemophilus, Marvinbryantia, Faecalibaculum, Neisseria and Dubosiella than those in the NP group. Metabolomics analyses indicated that tryptophan metabolism and vitamin metabolism were enriched in the LP group at day 14, and glycerophospholipid metabolism and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acid metabolism were enriched at the end of the experiment. Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated that the microbial composition was highly correlated with changes in colonic metabolites.
   Collectively, these results indicated that protein restriction and subsequent realimentation lead to compensatory growth and compensatory protein deposition in piglets and contribute to animal intestinal health by altering the gut microbiota and its metabolites.

AB  - Tanacetum vulgare L. has been traditionally applied as a remedy for headaches, rheumatism, digestion, respiratory and neurological problems, and other medical conditions. However, the literature data on its effects on cognitive function are scarce. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of two doses of T. vulgare alcohol extract on cognitive functions, hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, and organ toxicity in rats. Rats were treated with T. vulgare 200 mg/kg (TV 200) and 1000 mg/kg (TV 1000) for 28 days. After one week of pre-treatment, the animals were subjected to a series of tests. We found that in the active avoidance test, only TV 200 improved learning and memory, while in the passive avoidance test, both doses facilitated these processes. In addition, the two doses enhanced spatial memory. In the elevated plus maze test, only the higher dose of TV 1000 resulted in anxiolytic-like behavior. Both doses of the extract significantly increased the hippocampal expression of BDNF. We suggest that increased neurotrophic factor expression could be one of the important mechanisms underlying the cognition-enhancing effects of T. vulgare extract.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health concern and major contributor to death and long-term disability. After the initial trauma, a sustained secondary injury involving a complex continuum of pathophysiology unfolds, ultimately leading to the destruction of nervous tissue. One disease hallmark of TBI is ectopic protease activity, which can mediate cell death, extracellular matrix breakdown, and inflammation. We previously engineered a fluorogenic activity-based nanosensor for TBI (TBI-ABN) that passively accumulates in the injured brain across the disrupted vasculature and generates fluorescent signal in response to calpain-1 cleavage, thus enabling in situ visualization of TBI-associated calpain-1 protease activity. In this work, we hypothesized that actively targeting the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the injured brain would improve nanosensor accumulation in the injured brain beyond passive delivery alone and lead to increased nanosensor activation. We evaluated several peptides that bind exposed/enriched ECM constituents in the brain and discovered that nanomaterials modified with peptides that target hyaluronic acid (HA) displayed widespread distribution across the injury lesion, in particular colocalizing with perilesional and hippocampal neurons. Modifying TBI-ABN with HA-targeting peptide led to increases in activation in a ligand-valency-dependent manner, up to 6.6-fold in the injured cortex compared to a nontargeted nanosensor. This robust nanosensor activation enabled 3D visualization of injury-specific protease activity in a cleared and intact brain. In our work, we establish that targeting brain ECM with peptide ligands can be leveraged to improve the distribution and function of a bioresponsive imaging nanomaterial.

AB  - Coal dust (CD) is a common pollutant, and epidemiological surveys indicate that long-term exposure to coal dust not only leads to the occurrence of pulmonary diseases but also has certain impacts on cognitive abilities. However, there is little open-published literature on the effects and specific mechanisms of coal dust exposure on the cognition of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). An animal model has been built in this study with clinical population samples to explore the changes in neuroinflammation and cognitive abilities with coal dust exposure. In the animal model, compared to C57BL/6 mice, APP/PS1 mice exposed to coal dust exhibited more severe cognitive impairment, accompanied by significantly elevated levels of neuroinflammatory factors Apolipoprotein E4 (AOPE4) and Interleukin-6 (IL6) in the hippocampus, and more severe neuronal damage. In clinical sample sequencing, it was found that there is significant upregulation of AOPE4, neutrophils, and IL6 expression in the peripheral blood of MCI patients compared to normal individuals. Mechanistically, cell experiments revealed that IL6 could promote the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and enhance the expression of transcription factor SP1, thereby promoting AOPE4 expression. The results of this study suggest that coal dust can promote the upregulation of IL6 and AOPE4 in patients, exacerbating cognitive impairment.

AB  - Background: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) ranks second among primary liver cancers in terms of prevalence, characterized by poor prognosis and scarce therapeutic interventions. Fufang-Biejia-Ruangan tablet (BJRG), a traditional Chinese herbal remedy, has been widely used for liver diseases. However, its therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms in ICC remain poorly understood. Aim of the study: This study aims to systematically investigate the anti-ICC effects of BJRG, focusing on tumor progression and microenvironment modulation, through experimental and transcriptomic analyses. Methods: The chemical composition of BJRG was analyzed employing ultra-performance liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). In vitro assays were performed with QBC939 and LX-2 cell lines. Two primary ICC models (AKT/YAP and sgP53/KRAS) were established via hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of corresponding plasmids. A co-culture system for subcutaneous tumor formation was developed using cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from the AKT/YAP model and primary tumor cells derived from the sgP53/KRAS model. Results: UPLC-MS analysis identified 1091 chemical components, primarily terpenoids, sugars, glycosides, and phenylpropanoids. The therapeutic efficacy of BJRG was evaluated for the treatment of ICC. BJRG treatment slowed down the growth of both human ICC cell lines and AKT/YAP ICC mouse model. Mechanistically, BJRG inhibited HIPPO-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in ICC tumor cells. Importantly, BJRG significantly inhibited the growth of CAFs via HIPPO-PI3K/AKT cascades. Of note, co-culture CAFs with ICC cell lines substantially sensitized the efficacy of BJRG in sgP53/KRAS syngeneic tumor model. Furthermore, BJRG therapy not only affected CAFs but also induced alterations in vascular structures and hypoxic conditions within lesions in the AKT/YAP model. This intervention promoted the infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages into the tumor microenvironment, which may further augment the anti-proliferative effects of BJRG by enhancing the immune response within ICC tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our research demonstrates BJRG's anti-ICC efficacy via diverse pathways, including the suppression of tumor cell proliferation, regulation of CAFs activity, and promotion of immune cell infiltration. These findings underscore BJRG as a promising therapeutic candidate for ICC, offering novel mechanistic insights and highlighting its potential for clinical translation.

AB  - Long-term exposure to lead (Pb) can result in chronic damage to the body through accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS) leading to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study delves into the intricate role of miR-671/CDR1as regulation in the etiology of AD-like lesions triggered by chronic Pb exposure in adult mice. To emulate the chronic effects of Pb, we established a rodent model spanning 10 months of controlled Pb administration, dividing 52 C57BL/6J mice into groups receiving varying concentrations of Pb (1, 2, or 4 g/L) alongside an unexposed control. Blood Pb levels were monitored using serum samples to ensure accurate dosing and to correlate with observed toxicological outcomes. Utilizing the Morris water maze, a robust behavioral assay for assessing cognitive functions, we documented a dose-dependent decline in learning and memory capabilities among the Pb-exposed mice. Histopathological examination of the hippocampal tissue revealed tell-tale signs of AD-like neurodegeneration, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. At the molecular level, a significant upregulation of AD-associated genes, namely amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and tau, was observed in the hippocampal tissue of Pb-exposed mice. This was accompanied by a corresponding surge in the protein levels of APP, BACE1, amyloid-beta (A beta), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), further implicating Pb in the dysregulation of these key AD markers. The expression of CDR1as, a long non-coding RNA implicated in AD pathogenesis, was found to be suppressed in Pb-exposed mice. This observation suggests a potential mechanistic link between Pb-induced neurotoxicity and the dysregulation of the CDR1as/miR-671 axis, which warrants further investigation. Moreover, our study identified a dose-dependent alteration in the intracellular and extracellular levels of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). This finding implicates Pb in the modulation of NF-kappa B signaling, a pathway that plays a pivotal role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In conclusion, our findings underscored the deleterious effects of Pb exposure on the CNS, leading to the development of AD-like pathology. The observed modulation of NF-kappa B signaling and miR-671/CDR1as regulation provides a plausible mechanistic framework for understanding the neurotoxic effects of Pb and its potential contribution to AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Sleep associated memory consolidation and reactivation play an important role in language acquisition and learning of new words. However, it is unclear to what extent properties of word learning difficulty impact sleep associated memory reactivation. To address this gap, we investigated in 22 young healthy adults the effectiveness of auditory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during non-rapid eye movement sleep of artificial words with easy and difficult to learn phonotactical properties. Here, we found that TMR of the easy words improved their overnight memory performance, whereas TMR of the difficult words had no effect. By comparing EEG activities after TMR presentations, we found an increase in slow wave density independent of word difficulty, whereas the spindle-band power nested during the slow wave up-states - as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation - was significantly higher in the easy/effective compared to the difficult/ineffective condition. Our findings indicate that word learning difficulty by phonotactics impacts the effectiveness of TMR and further emphasize the critical role of prior encoding depth in sleep associated memory reactivation.

AB  - Nickel (Ni) is a heavy metal that is both an environmental pollutant and a threat to human health. However, the effects of Ni on the central nervous system in susceptible populations have not been well established. In the present study, the neurotoxicity of Ni and its underlying mechanism were investigated in vivo and in vitro. Ni exposure through drinking water (10 mg Ni/L, 12 weeks) caused learning and memory impairment in mice. Reduced dendrite complexity was observed in both Ni-exposed mouse hippocampi and Ni-treated (200 mu M, 72 h) primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The levels of histone acetylation, especially at histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac), were reduced in Ni-exposed mouse hippocampi and cultured neurons. RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing analyses revealed that H3K9ac-modulated gene expression were downregulated. Treatment with sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, attenuated Ni-induced H3K9 hypoacetylation, neural gene downregulation and dendrite complexity reduction in cultured neurons. Sodium butyrate also restored Ni-induced memory impairment in mice. These results indicate that Ni-induced H3K9 hypoacetylation may be a contributor to the neurotoxicity of Ni. The finding that Ni disturbs histone acetylation in the nervous system may provide new insight into the health risk of chronic Ni exposure.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major concern for public health worldwide, affecting 55 million people and being the leading cause of death and disability. To improve the outcomes and effectiveness of treatment for these patients, we conducted a study on the potential therapeutic use of N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (synaptamide) in mice using the weight-drop injury (WDI) TBI model. Our study focused on exploring synaptamide's effects on neurodegeneration processes and changes in neuronal and glial plasticity. Our findings showed that synaptamide could prevent TBI-associated working memory decline and neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus, and it could alleviate decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Furthermore, synaptamide regulated the production of astro- and microglial markers during TBI, promoting the anti-inflammatory transformation of the microglial phenotype. Additional effects of synaptamide in TBI include stimulating antioxidant and antiapoptotic defense, leading to the downregulation of the Bad pro-apoptotic marker. Our data suggest that synaptamide has promising potential as a therapeutic agent to prevent the long-term neurodegenerative consequences of TBI and improve the quality of life.

AB  - Background and objectiveNo autochthonous human cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported to date in the European Union (EU). In this study, we assess the likelihood of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) introduction and transmission within the EU and propose outbreak response measures.Risk assessmentGiven the global geographical distribution of JEV, the probability of virus introduction into the EU is currently very low, with viremic bird migration being the most plausible pathway of introduction. However, this likelihood would significantly increase if the virus were to become established in the Middle East, Caucasus, Central Asia or Africa. Considering the environmental conditions that are expected to be conducive for virus circulation, there is a high likelihood of virus transmission within the EU after its introduction in environmentally suitable areas. The spread of the virus within the EU would likely occur through the movement of wild birds, pigs and mosquitoes.MitigationTo mitigate or potentially contain the emergence of JE in the EU, early detection of both human and animal cases will be crucial.

AB  - Genistein and naringenin, plant phenolic compounds, are recognized for their health benefits and role in plant defense against herbivores. However, little research exists on how these compounds affect aphid feeding, particularly that of the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scopoli) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a major pest. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of genistein and naringenin, applied in vitro at different concentrations, on the feeding behavior of A. fabae. Statistical analysis indicated that both the type and concentration of flavonoids significantly influenced aphid stylet activity, salivation, and ingestion. Higher concentrations of both compounds hindered feeding behavior. A longer initial probe was observed on gels containing the studied flavonoids. Genistein at 0.1% completely inhibited salivation while at 0.01%, it reduced the duration of salivation activities. Both compounds also delayed the start and lengthened the duration of active ingestion, though A. fabae tolerated genistein better than naringenin. Naringenin's effects on feeding behavior were more pronounced at higher concentrations. These findings suggest that genistein and naringenin could be valuable chemicals to protect plants from aphids in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.

AB  - Preterm birth (birth < 37 completed weeks' gestation) is common, affecting 10.6% of live births globally (nearly 15 million babies per year). Having a new baby admitted to a neonatal unit often triggers stress and anxiety for parents. This paper seeks to explore experiences of preterm birth via Twitter. The intermingling of COVID-19 restrictions and World Prematurity Day allows for an understanding of both the additional stresses incurred as a consequence of the pandemic and the more "everyday " experiences in the NICU and beyond. The content analysis of the data included 3161 tweets. Three themes were identified: 1. COVID-19 was not the only trauma; 2. Raising awareness, especially World Prematurity Day; and, 3. Baby milestones. These themes highlight the multi-level challenges faced by parents of premature babies and the healthcare professionals involved in their care. The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions imposed on parents' contact with their babies have resulted in immense emotional strain for families. The reported COVID-19 pandemic "baby blind spot " appears to particularly impact this group of babies. Improved understanding of the lived experiences of preterm babies and their families should inform greater awareness and improved support.</p>

AB  - Several studies with Bos taurus cows report a decrease in voluntary intake close to parturition. However, there are few studies on the evaluation of these parameters in grazing Nellore cows receiving protein supplementation, which could mitigate the decrease in forage intake and improve animal performance. Hence, this study sought to understand how the feed intake and performance of Nellore cows on pasture changes during the peripartum period. Our study found a significant reduction in cows' voluntary intake as they approach parturition, which provides a rational approach to supplementing pregnant cows at the end of gestation, improving production rates in calf-cow systems in the tropics. We aimed to understand the changes in nutritional parameters and performance of beef cows during the peripartum, whether receiving or not receiving protein supplements. Forty cows were used, divided into two treatments: CON-mineral mix and SUP-protein supplementation. Digestibility trial was performed at 45, 30, and 15 days (d) before the parturition and at 20 and 40 d of lactation. The ADG of cows pre- and postpartum was recorded along with the BCS in gestational (GT) and maternal (MT) tissues in the prepartum. There was an effect of treatment and period (p <= 0.044) for intakes of DM and CP. The forage intake was similar (p > 0.90) but varied with the effect of days related to parturition (p < 0.001). There was a 14.37% decrease in DM intake from d -30 to d -15 of prepartum. In the postpartum, at 20 d of lactation, there was an increase of 72.7% in relation to d -15 of prepartum. No differences were observed in postpartum ADG or BCS at parturition and postpartum (p >= 0.12). However, higher total and MT ADG (p <= 0.02) were observed in animals receiving supplementation, while ADG in GT remained similar (p > 0.14). In conclusion, there is a decrease in intake for pregnant cows close to parturition and greater performance of animals supplemented in prepartum.

AB  - Purpose After radiation therapy of brain tumors, radiation-induced cognitive impairment is a common and severe complication. Neuroinflammation mediated by microglia is a critical event that accelerates cognitive or functional decline. Ferulic acid (FA), a phenolic plant component, possesses multiple pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-radiation. The current research attempts to ascertain the protection of FA on radiation-induced neuroinflammation and the mechanism of this effect. Materials and methods C57BL/6 mice were irradiated with Co-60 gamma-ray to establish a brain injury model. The Morris water maze experiment was used to observe the effects of FA on the spatial learning and memory impairment of irradiated mice. The pathological changes of hippocampal tissue were observed by HE staining. Besides, microglia BV-2 cell lines were used to study the anti-neuroinflammatory impacts of FA on radiation-induced microglial activation and further elucidate the potential mechanisms influencing FA-mediated neuroprotective properties. The cell morphological changes were observed using an optical microscope. The cytotoxicity of FA and radiation to BV-2 cells was determined using the CCK-8 assay. Additionally, Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR detected the expression and transcription of NLRP3 inflammasome and pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus and BV-2 cells. Results FA could enhance learning and memory capacity and ameliorate pathological changes in the hippocampal tissues of irradiated mice. The cell radiation injury model was established by 8 Gy Co-60 gamma-ray, and the concentration of subsequent administration was determined to be 2.5, 5, and 10 mu mol/L. Furthermore, FA could suppress the transcription and expression of NLRP3 in hippocampal tissue and microglia, and also the increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. Conclusion This study established that FA targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome has a neuroprotective effect against radiation-induced nerve damage, implying that FA might have some potential in the treatment of radiation-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - A great challenge for African conservationists is human-wildlife conflict outside the boundaries of protected areas (PAs). This is particularly true when considering large mobile species, such as elephants, that often disperse from PAs into community land. In Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, studies on elephant dispersal have focused on breeding herds. Here, we analyse the movements of five older, large males fitted with GPS collars. We found some dispersal outside Hwange, but large males were largely restricted to the Park, especially during the late dry season when water was scarce. Our findings may be useful to regional conservation decision makers.

AB  - Chronic wounds are a substantial clinical problem in diabetes and nearly 6% of diabetics suffer from foot disease including ulceration, infection, and tissue necrosis. Wound healing in diabetes is impaired and delayed and is augmented by diabetic complications. Wound healing involves complex cellular, molecular, and biochemical processes and animal models are the most suitable prototype to investigate and understand the underlying pathological changes in the process of wound healing. Animal models are also useful in evaluating the safety and efficacy of newer therapeutic agents and improving the clinical approaches for human patients with chronic ulcers. The wound healing strategies get more complicated in the presence of diabetes and its associated complication. Despite the advancement in methods of wound healing, the healing of the chronic diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) remains an important clinical problem resulting in costly and prolonged treatment and poses a risk for major amputation. Saying that it is important to elucidate the newer therapeutic targets and strategies via an in-depth understanding of the complicated cascade of the chronic DFU. A major challenge in translating lab findings to clinics is the lack of an optimal preclinical model capable of properly recapitulating human wounds. Both small and large animal models of wound healing involving rodents, rabbits, and pigs have been discussed. Mouse and rats as small animal models and pig as large animal models have been discussed in association with the diabetic wound but there are advantages and limitations for each model. In this review, we critically reviewed the pros and cons of experimental models of diabetic wound healing with a focus on type II diabetes rodent models.

AB  - Microglia play a crucial role in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). This study investigated the effects of microglial depletion and subsequent repopulation on POCD and its underlying mechanisms. An aged mouse model of POCD was induced by partial hepatectomy, and the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 was administered to facilitate microglial depletion and repopulation. Neutrophil involvement was assessed with anti-Ly6G antibodies, while ZEB1 was manipulated through shRNA knockdown and lentiviral overexpression in the BV2 microglial cell line. A TGF-beta 1 neutralizing antibody was employed to elucidate the relationship between ZEB1 and its downstream pathways. The results indicated that microglial depletion alone did not reverse cognitive impairments. However, microglial repopulation significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration and improved cognitive function post-surgery. This improvement correlated with ZEB1 upregulation in microglia, which decreased CXCL1 production by astrocytes via TGF-beta 1 signaling, thereby reducing neutrophil migration to the hippocampus. These findings suggest that microglial repopulation, dependent on ZEB1 and TGF-beta 1 signaling, effectively alleviates neuroinflammation, reduces neutrophil infiltration, and enhances cognitive function, highlighting microglia as a promising target for the prevention and treatment of POCD.

AB  - Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a known lung carcinogen and a driving mechanism in human lung cells for Cr(VI)-induced lung cancer is chromosome instability, caused by prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inducing DNA double-strand breaks, while simultaneously inhibiting the repair of these breaks. In North Atlantic right whales, Cr(VI) induces breaks but does not inhibit repair. It is unclear if this repair inhibition is specific to human lung cells or occurs in other species, as it has only been considered in humans and North Atlantic right whales. We evaluated these outcomes in rodent cells, as rodents are an experimental model for metal-induced lung carcinogenesis. We used a guinea pig lung fibroblast cell line, JH4 Clone 1, and rat lung fibroblasts. Cells were exposed to two different particulate Cr(VI) compounds, ranging from 0 to 0.5 ug/cm2, for 24 or 120 h and assessed for cytotoxicity, DNA double-strand breaks, and DNA double-strand break repair. Both particulate Cr(VI) compounds induced a concentration-dependent increase in cytotoxicity and DNA double-strand breaks after acute and prolonged exposures. Notably, while the repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double-strand breaks increased after acute exposure, the repair of these breaks was inhibited after prolonged exposure. These results are consistent with outcomes in human lung cells indicating rodent cells respond like human cells, while whale cells have a markedly different response.

AB  - The unbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been associated with the exacerbation of possible diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative illnesses. Mushrooms are very rich in bioactive nutrients such as phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, vitamins and other compounds that have antioxidant potential. A substrate obtained during mushrooms development is of great interest in terms of biomass valorization, since it can be reused for energy production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 g/L of phenolic compounds, extracted from the Tricholoma equestre mushroom species, produced from biomass, in the formation of cellular reactive oxygen species. The studies were performed in brain slices, using the fluorescent ROS indicator H(2)DCFDA. The results indicate that, for all concentrations, the mushroom phenolics enhanced the neuronal ROS signals, which include autofluorescence, in a concentration dependent way. The data obtained in the presence of the synthetic phenolic, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, which is the most abundant phenolic in the Tricholoma mushrooms, are similar to those found for the same concentration (1 g/L) of the phenolic extracts. However, upon removal, while some of the signals evoked by the extracts were not reversible those induced by the synthetic compound fully recovered. The equivalent antioxidant capacity of the Tricholoma phenolics was determined using the TEAC and the DPPH techniques. The analyses revealed that these phenolics have a large antioxidant capacity.

AB  - A considerable proportion of patients having respiratory tract or voice symptoms associated with workplace moisture damage (MD) could have multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). MCS is characterized by symptoms of different organ systems in association with low-level chemical exposure. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of MCS among patients referred to secondary health care because of respiratory or voice symptoms associated with workplace MD compared to the general working-age population. Using three subscales of the QEESI (c) questionnaire, we assessed MCS in the study patients and 1500 controls in the same district randomly selected from the Finnish Population Information System. Study patients had significantly more often high scores in chemical intolerance (39% vs. 23%, p = 0.001), symptom severity (60% vs. 27%, p < 0.001), and life impact subscales (53% vs. 20%, p < 0.001). Asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, laryngeal problems, and atopy were not associated with the presence of MCS. MCS is common among patients referred to secondary health care with respiratory tract and/or voice symptoms associated with workplace MD, and it considerably affects their everyday life. MCS should be considered as a possible explanatory factor for MD-associated symptoms.

AB  - Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in elderly surgical patients, with limited targeted interventions due to incomplete understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms. Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, involving glial cell activation, particularly astrocytes, is considered crucial in POD development. Butyrate, a four-carbon fatty acid, has shown protective effects in CNS diseases, but its potential in mitigating POD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of sodium butyrate on POD in aged mice. Behavioral tests, including open field, Y maze, and food burying tests, demonstrated that sodium butyrate preconditioning ameliorated laparotomy-induced delirium in aged mice. Pre-treatment with sodium butyrate inhibited astrocyte activation in the hippocampus, reduced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression levels, and protected hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the study revealed a connection between gut microbiota regulation and central neuroprotective effects mediated by astrocyte activation inhibition. Sodium butyrate improved the intestinal morphological barrier by rebalancing gut microbiota, inhibiting Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, reducing Allobaculum and Bacteroides abundance, and increasing Oscillospira abundance. This regulation decreased gut permeability, limiting the entry of toxic substances into the bloodstream, thereby reducing inflammation spread and astrocyte overactivation, leading to central anti-inflammatory effects. In conclusion, sodium butyrate may ameliorate POD by inhibiting astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation through gut microbiota rebalancing.

AB  - Exposure to stress during pregnancy consequently prompts long-lasting effects on fetal brain development and predisposes the offspring to mental illnesses in later life. Adolescence is a vulnerable period of prefrontal cortex (PFC) development and coincident with the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The medial PFC (mPFC) is the brain area that plays a significant role in emotional processing, and stress alters the function of this brain area leading to emotional disorders. Microglia not only play a role in neuroinflammatory responses but also play a crucial role in brain development, especially during synaptic development and pruning. Previous studies have revealed the long-term effects of prenatal stress (PS) on microglia activation and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of the offspring. However, there is still a need to investigate how PS alters the mPFC development during adolescence. This study examines the effects of maternal stress during the last week of gestation on microglia activation and neuroimmune response in the mPFC of adolescent offspring. Morphological study demonstrated that PS increased the density of activated microglia in the prelimbic region of the mPFC of adolescent offspring. Besides, PS significantly increased the levels of microglia marker (Iba1), interleukin-6 (IL -6), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the mPFC of the adolescent offspring. In conclusion, PS-induced microglia activation and neuroinflammation in the mPFC might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring in later years.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related chronic neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the pathological feature of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregation, with the exact disease pathogenesis unclear. During the onset and progression of PD, synaptic dysfunction, including dysregulation of axonal transport, impaired exocytosis, and endocytosis are identified as crucial events of PD pathogenesis. It has been reported that over-expression of alpha-syn impairs clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in the synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms still needs to be explored. In this study, we investigated the molecular events underlying the synaptic dysfunction caused by over-expression of wild-type human alpha-syn and its mutant form, involving series of proteins participating in CME. We found that excessive human alpha-syn causes impaired fission and uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles during synaptic vesicle recycling, leading to reduced clustering of synaptic vesicles near the active zone and increased size of plasma membrane and number of endocytic intermediates. Furthermore, over-expressed human alpha-syn induced changes of CME-associated proteins, among which synaptojanin1 (SYNJ1) showed significant reduction in various brain regions. Over-expression of SYNJ1 in primary hippocampal neurons from alpha-syn transgenic mice recovered the synaptic vesicle density, clustering and endocytosis. Using fluorescence-conjugated transferrin, we demonstrated that SYNJ1 re-boosted the CME activity by restoring the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate homeostasis. Our data suggested that over-expression of alpha-syn disrupts synaptic function through interfering with vesicle recycling, which could be alleviated by re-availing of SYNJ1. Our study unrevealed a molecular mechanism of the synaptic dysfunction in PD pathogenesis and provided a potential therapeutic target for treating PD.image

AB  - Biosynthesis based on natural compounds has emerged as a sustainable approach for the production of metallic nanoparticles (MNP). The main objective of this study was to biosynthesize stable and multifunctional silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using different plant by-products as reducers and capping agents. Extracts obtained from Eucalyptus globulus, Pinus pinaster, Citrus sinensis, Cedrus atlantica and Camellia sinensis by-products, were evaluated. From all plant by-products tested, aqueous extract of eucalyptus leaves (EL), green tea (GT) and black tea (BT) were selected due to their higher antioxidant phenolic content and were individually employed as reducers and capping agents to biosynthesize AgNP. The green AgNP showed zeta potential values of -31.8 to -36.3 mV, with a wide range of particle sizes (40.6 to 86.4 nm), depending on the plant extract used. Green AgNP exhibited an inhibitory effect against various pathogenic bacteria, including Gram-negative (P. putida, E. coli, Vibrio spp.) and Gram-positive (B. megaterium, S. aureus, S. equisimilis) bacteria with EL-AgNP being the nanostructure with the greatest antimicrobial action. EL-AgNP showed an excellent photodegradation of indigo carmine (IC) dye under direct sunlight, with a removal percentage of up to 100% after 75 min. A complete cost analysis revealed a competitive total cost range of 8.0-9.0 euro/g for the biosynthesis of AgNP.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exogenous melatonin administration on transferable embryos by increasing total antioxidant status before superovulation in Assaf ewes. Selected ewes were randomly divided into two equal groups: melatonin (n = 9) and control (n = 9). In the melatonin group, a melatonin implant (18 mg melatonin, Regulin (R), Ceva, Turkey) was placed under the skin of the ear 7 days prior to insertion of the progesterone-containing sponge. In the control group, a physiological saline solution was injected under the skin of the ear on the same day. The same superovulation protocol was used in both groups. In addition, blood samples for determination of Glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant status and total oxidant status concentrations were collected on five different days, including the day of melatonin implant placement (Day-7), vaginal sponge insertion (Day 0), vaginal sponge removal (Day 11), mating (Day 12-13) and uterine flushing (Day 19). Embryos were collected by laparotomy on the 7th day after mating. Uterine flushing taken into petri dishes were scanned under a stereomicroscope, and the quality and developmental stages of the embryos were recorded. In the study, total corpus luteum count and total cell count were found to be higher in the control group than in the melatonin group (p < .05). When the results were evaluated in terms of oxidative stress index, a negative correlation was found between the total number of corpus luteum, number of cells obtained, count of transferable embryos and number of Grade 1 embryos on Day 0. There was also a positive correlation oxidative stress index and the number of unfertilized oocytes on Day-7. As a result, exogenous melatonin administration prior to superovulation during the breeding season is thought to have a negative effect on embryo yield and quality. Therefore, the use of exogenous melatonin in MOET studies during the breeding season is recommended to be investigated in new studies.

AB  - Objective: Methamphetamine (METH) exposure is commonly believed to result in cognitive impairment. Hista-mine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists reportedly have potential applications for treating cognitive impairment accompanied by various neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of H3R blockade by Thioperamide (THIO) on METH-induced cognitive impairment and the underlying mechanism. Methods: In Experiment 1, C57BL/6 mice received daily injections of saline or 5 mg/kg METH for 5 consecutive days. The Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks were used to assess cognitive functions of mice. H3R protein expression and apoptosis were subsequently measured in the hippocampus. In Experiment 2, HT22 cells were first treated with ddH2O or 3 mM METH. The cell survival rate and H3R protein level were subsequently assessed. In Experiment 3, the animals were first treated with saline or 20 mg/kg THIO for 7 days, followed by co-administration of either saline or 5 mg/kg METH for an additional 5 days. The remaining experiments were carried out in the same manner as Experiment 1. In Experiment 4, HT22 cells were pretreated with either ddH2O or 5 mM THIO for 2 h, followed by ddH2O or 3 mM METH treatment for an additional 12 h. The remaining experiments were carried out in the same manner as Experiment 2. In Experiment 5, the changes in MEK1/2, p-MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 protein levels were examined in the hippocampus of all mice from Experiment 3 and HT22 cells from Experiment 4.Results: METH-treated mice showed significantly worsened NOR and MWM performance, along with markably hippocampal apoptosis. A significantly lower cell survival rate was observed in METH-treated HT22 cells. Increased levels of H3R protein were found in both METH-treated mice and HT22 cells. THIO significantly improved METH-induced cognitive impairment in mice and toxicity in HT22 cells. METH significantly increased the level of p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 proteins in the hippocampus of mice and HT22 cells, which was reversed by THIO pretreatment.Conclusion: Our findings reveal that H3R blockade by THIO yields a neuroprotective effect against METH-induced cognitive impairment in mice and toxicity in HT22 cells via the raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway.

AB  - The tea plant is a perennial leaf-used economical crop and cultivated all over the world. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) plays key roles in plant development and environmental stress. YUCCA (YUC) flavin monooxygenases are the rate-limiting enzymes of the TAA/YUC pathway, which is the most important IAA biosynthetic pathway in plants. The YUC gene family in tea plants has not been systematically studied so far. A total of 17 CsYUC members were identified from a tea plant genome database and phylogenetically classified into three subfamilies. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the CsYUC gene family is evolutionarily conserved. The physical and chemical properties, gene structures, and conserved domains were analyzed. The expression profiles of CsYUCs were analyzed on the basis of open available RNA-seq data, as well as by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR assays. Combined with previous studies, it can be concluded that YUC10 may play key roles in seed development. The results also showed that CsYUC2.1 may play important roles in the coordinated regulation of the growth of leaf buds and flower buds induced by pruning. Low temperature markedly induced the expression of CsYUC2.2, -11.8, and -11.9. Furthermore, CsYUC genes that might play key roles in the specific development stages and involve enhancing the resistance to drought and NaCl stress were screened, respectively. This study could provide a research basis for deeply studying the gene functions of the CsYUC family in the tea plant.

AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation play a significant role in depression. This research has shown that Ten-eleven translocation 2 (Tet2) deficiency prompts depression-like behaviors, but Tet2's transcriptional regulation remains unclear. In the study, bioinformatics is used to identify nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 3 (Nr2e3) as a potential Tet2 regulator. Nr2e3 is found to enhance Tet2's transcriptional activity by binding to its promoter region. Nr2e3 knockdown in mouse hippocampus leads to reduced Tet2 expression, depression-like behaviors, decreased hydroxymethylation of synaptic genes, and downregulation of synaptic proteins like postsynaptic density 95 KDa (PSD95) and N-methy-d-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1). Fewer dendritic spines are also observed. Nr2e3 thus appears to play an antidepressant role under stress. In search of potential treatments, small molecule compounds to increase Nr2e3 expression are screened. Azacyclonal (AZA) is found to enhance the Nr2e3/Tet2 pathway and exhibited antidepressant effects in stressed mice, increasing PSD95 and NMDAR1 expression and dendritic spine density. This study illuminates Tet2's upstream regulatory mechanism, providing a new target for identifying early depression biomarkers and developing treatments.
   This study demonstrates that Nr2e3 is a crucial transcription factor of Tet2. Nr2e3 binds to the Tet2 promoter and regulates its transcriptional activity. Nr2e3 knockdown in the hippocampus results in reduced Tet2 expression and depression-like behaviors in mice. Interestingly, azacyclonol is identified as a compound capable of effectively increasing Nr2e3 protein in the hippocampus and exhibits antidepressant effects in mice. These findings suggest that targeting the Nr2e3/Tet2 pathway holds promise for identifying early depression biomarkers and developing new treatments for depression. image

AB  - Bilio-biliary anastomosis (BBA) is a critical surgical procedure that is performed with the objective of restoring bile duct continuity. This procedure is often required in cases where there has been an injury to the extrahepatic bile ducts or during liver transplantation. Despite advances in surgical techniques, the healing of BBA remains a significant challenge, with complications such as stricture formation and leakage affecting patient outcomes. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF), a heterogeneous cell population derived from adipose tissue, has demonstrated promise in regenerative medicine due to its rich content of stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and growth factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of locally administered autologous SVF to enhance the healing of BBAs. Bilio-biliary anastomosis was performed on a swine model (female Landrace pigs). Six swine were divided into two groups: the treatment group (n = 3) received a local application of autologous SVF around the anastomosis site immediately following BBA formation, while the control group (n = 3) received saline. The primary outcomes were assessed over an eight-week period post-surgery, and included anastomosis healing, stricture formation, and bile leakage. Histological analysis was performed to evaluate fibrosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to assess healing-related markers (CD34, alpha-SMA) and the immunological microenvironment (CD3, CD10, tryptase). The SVF-treated group exhibited significantly enhanced healing of the BBA. Histological examination revealed increased angiogenesis and reduced fibrosis in the SVF group. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated higher vascular density in the anastomosed area of the SVF-treated group (390 vs. 210 vessels per 1 mm2, p = 0.0027), as well as a decrease in wall thickness (1.9 vs. 1.0 mm, p = 0.0014). There were no statistically significant differences in mast cell presence (p = 0.40). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the overexpression of markers associated with tissue repair. Local injections of autologous SVF at the site of BBA have been demonstrated to significantly enhance healing and promote tissue regeneration. These findings suggest that SVF could be a valuable adjunctive therapy in BBA surgery, potentially improving surgical outcomes. However, further investigation is needed to explore the clinical applicability and long-term benefits of this novel approach in clinical practice as a minimally manipulated cell application.

AB  - Engrams corresponding to distinct memories compete for retrieval in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, yet the detailed mechanisms underlying their formation remain elusive. Recent findings indicate that hippocampal inhibitory neurons display feature-selective firing patterns and diverse forms of synaptic plasticity, suggesting a crucial role in engram formation. Conventional CA3 attractor network models typically employ global inhibition, where inhibitory neurons uniformly suppress the activity of excitatory neurons. However, such models fail to capture the dynamics arising from sparse distributed coding or reflect inhibitory neurons' roles in the competition between engrams during memory retrieval. We propose a mechanism for engram formation in CA3 using a spiking neural network model that emphasizes heterosynaptic plasticity at excitatory-to-inhibitory (E-to-I) synapses. In our model, inhibitory neurons associate with specific neural assemblies during encoding and selectively inhibit competing engrams during retrieval. Driven by a simplified feedforward dentate gyrus (DG), this mechanism generates sparse, distributed engrams in CA3. This representation allows us to examine the effects of selective inhibition on pattern completion across various conditions, including partially overlapping engrams. Simulations show that selective inhibition substantially enhances recall stability and accuracy compared to global inhibition alone. Furthermore, emergent activity patterns across DG, CA3, and CA1 of the model replicate experimental signatures of pattern separation and completion. These results suggest that assembly-specific inhibition mediated by heterosynaptic plasticity could provide a parsimonious mechanism for engram formation and competition in CA3, offering testable predictions for future experiments.

AB  - Featured Application Improving the riding seat with the help of exercises simulating the effect of a living horse would represent a considerable benefit for beginner riders. In studies testing the effect of hippotherapy on the human body, no one has yet compared the involvement of the same specific muscles in exercises on a gymnastic (pommel) horse vs. a walking horse. To improve the correct riding seat and to compare the differences in electromyographic activity, we conducted an experimental study to measure the activity of selected muscles on a set of probands of both sexes during three exercises on a gymnastic horse vs. a walking horse. We measured the activity of eight selected muscles, expressed as the percentage value of the maximal voluntary contraction. Maximal voluntary contraction of each muscle was electromyographically measured using Janda's strength muscle test. These values were used as a standard for values obtained from exercising on a gymnastic horse and a walking horse. The effect of the studied factors was tested by analysis of variance. The muscle activity was statistically significantly affected by the studied factors. It was higher when riding a living horse than a gymnastic horse and in females compared to males. Although the exercises on a gymnastic horse generated lower muscle activity than those on a walking horse, there was a variation among individual muscles that justified further study.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative effect of platycodin D (PD) on cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its potential molecular mechanisms of action in vivo and in vitro. Materials and methods: An animal model of cognitive impairment in T2DM was established using a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg) after 8 weeks of feeding a high-fat diet to C57BL/6 mice. In vitro, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were employed to analyze the effects of PD on glucose-induced neurotoxicity in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22). Results: PD (2.5 mg/kg) treatment for 4 weeks significantly suppressed the rise in fasting blood glucose in T2DM mice, improved insulin secretion deficiency, and reversed abnormalities in serum triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein levels. Meanwhile, PD ameliorated choline dysfunction in T2DM mice and inhibited the production of oxidative stress and apoptosis-related proteins of the caspase family. Notably, PD dose-dependently prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, promotes phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and protein kinase B (Akt) in vitro, activates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) expression at the Ser9 site, and inhibits Tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Conclusions: These findings clearly indicated that PD could alleviate the neurological damage caused by T2DM, and the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 may be the key to its effect.

AB  - The aims of this study were to test the effects of dietary probiotics and acidifiers on the production performance, colostrum components, serum antioxidant activity and hormone levels, and gene expression in the mammary tissue of lactating sows. Four treatments were administered with six replicates to 24 lactating sows. The control group (GC) received a basal diet, while the experimental groups received a basal diet with 200 mL/d probiotics (GP), 0.5% acidifiers (GA), and 200 mL/d probiotics + 0.5% acidifiers (GM), respectively. Compared with the GC, (1) the average weight of the piglets on the 21st day of lactation in the GM was higher (p < 0.05); (2) the colostrum fat ratio increased significantly (p < 0.05); (3) the malondialdehyde levels in GP and GM were lower (p < 0.05) on the 11th day; (4) on the 1st, 11th, and 21st days, the prolactin in GP and GM increased (p < 0.05); (5) on the 21st day, the relative expression levels of the prolactin receptor and fatty acid synthase were increased (p < 0.05). In summary, the basal diet mixed with 200 mL/d probiotics + 0.5% acidifiers could improve the production performance, colostrum components, serum antioxidant activity, and hormone levels of lactating sows.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation is a promising technology employed in preserving highquality varieties in animal husbandry and is also widely applied in the human sperm bank. However, the compromised qualities, such as decreased sperm motility, damaged membrane structure, and reduced fertilization competency, have significantly hampered the efficient application of this technique. Therefore, it is imperative to depict various molecular changes found in cryopreserved sperm and identify the regulatory network in response to the cryopreservation stress. In this study, semen was collected from three Chinese Merino rams and divided into untreated (fresh semen, FS) and programmed freezing (programmed freezing semen, PS) groups. After measuring different quality parameters, the ultra-low RNA-seq and tandem mass tag-based (TMT) proteome were conducted in both the groups. The results indicated that the motility (82.63% +/- 3.55% vs. 34.10% +/- 2.90%, p < 0.05) and viability (89.46% +/- 2.53% vs. 44.78% +/- 2.29%, p < 0.05) of the sperm in the FS group were significantly higher compared to those in the PS group. In addition, 45 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes, as well as 30 upregulated and 48 downregulated proteins, were found in transcriptomics and proteomics data separately. Moreover, three integrated methods, namely, functional annotation and enrichment analysis, Pearson's correlation analysis, and two-way orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS) analysis, were used for further analysis. The results suggested that various differentially expressed genes and proteins (DEGs and DEPs) were mainly enriched in leishmaniasis and hematopoietic cell lineage, and Fc gamma receptor Ia (FCGR1A) was significantly downregulated in cryopreserved sperm both at mRNA and protein levels in comparison with the fresh counterpart. In addition, top five genes (FCGR1A, HCK, SLX4, ITGA3, and BET1) and 22 proteins could form a distinct network in which genes and proteins were significantly correlated (p < 0.05). Interestingly, FCGR1A also appeared in the top 25 correlation list based on O2PLS analysis. Hence, FCGR1A was selected as the most potential differentially expressed candidate for screening by the three integrated multi-omics analysis methods. In addition, Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that the expression level of FCGR1A was positively correlated with sperm motility and viability. A subsequent experiment was conducted to identify the biological role of FCGR1A in sperm function. The results showed that both the sperm viability (fresh group: 87.65% +/- 4.17% vs. 75.8% +/- 1.15%, cryopreserved group: 48.15% +/- 0.63% vs. 42.45% +/- 2.61%, p < 0.05) and motility (fresh group: 83.27% +/- 4.15% vs. 70.41% +/- 1.07%, cryopreserved group: 45.31% +/- 3.28% vs. 35.13% +/- 2.82%, p < 0.05) were significantly reduced in fresh and frozen sperm when FCGR1A was blocked. Moreover, the cleavage rate of embryos fertilized by FCGR1A-blocked sperm was noted to be significantly lower in both fresh (95.28% +/- 1.16% vs. 90.44% +/- 1.56%, p < 0.05) and frozen groups (89.8% +/- 1.50% vs. 82.53% +/- 1.53%, p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results revealed that the downregulated membrane protein FCGR1A can potentially contribute to the reduced sperm fertility competency in the cryopreserved sheep sperm.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that develops from exposure to trauma, mostly when normal psychological mechanisms fail. Studies have shown that people who have PTSD are susceptible to developing dementia, mostly Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting common underlying risk factors in the comorbidity. However, data elucidating links between these conditions is scarce. Here we show that footshock stress exacerbates AD-like pathology. To induce a trauma-like condition, the rats were exposed to multiple intense footshocks followed by a single reminder. This was followed by bilateral intrahippocampal lesions with amyloid-beta (A beta) (1-42), to model AD-like pathology. We found that footshocks increased anxiety behavior and impaired fear memory extinction in A beta(1-42) lesioned rats. We also found a reduced expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), NAD (P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and an increased expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the amygdala and hippocampus. Furthermore, oxidative stress level was sustained, which was associated with increased apoptosis in the amygdala and hippocampus. Our finding suggests that AD-like pathology can induce oxidative changes in the amygdala and hippocampus, which can be exaggerated by footshock stress.

AB  - Previous work identified that bacterial zoonoses (Brucella species, Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira hardjo) were present in Cameroonian pastoral cattle. To assess the characteristics of this zoonotic risk, we analyse seroprevalence of each pathogen and the associated management, herd and environmental factors in Cameroonian pastoral and dairy cattle. Cross-sectional samples included pastoralist herds in the Northwest Region (NWR n = 750) and Vina Division (VD n = 748) and small holder dairy herds in the NWR (n = 60). Exposure to Brucella spp., C. burnetii and L. hardjo were screened for using commercial ELISAs and population adjusted estimates made. In addition, individual, herd and ecological metadata were collected and used to identify risk factors associated with animal-level seropositivity. In the pastoral cattle, seroprevalence to Brucella spp. was relatively low but was higher in the NWR (4.2%, CI: 2.5%-7.0%) than the VD (1.1%: CI 0.5%-2.4%), while L. hardjo seroprevalence was much higher though similar in the NWR (30.7%, CI 26.3%-35.5%) and VD (35.9%, CI 31.3%-40.7%). No differences were noted in C. burnetii seroprevalence between the two study sites (NWR: 14.6%, CI 11.8%-18.0%. VD: 12.4%, 9.6%-15.9%). Compared to pastoral, dairy cattle had lower seroprevalences for L. hardjo (1.7%, CI: 0.0%-4.9%), C. burnetii (0.0%, CI 0.0%-6.0%) but similar for Brucella spp. (5.0%, CI 0.0%-10.6%). Increased odds of Brucella spp. seropositivity were associated with owning sheep or rearing sheep and fencing cattle in at night. Adult cattle had increased odds of being seropositive for both C. burnetii and L. hardjo. Additionally, exposure to C. burnetii was associated with local ecological conditions and L. hardjo was negatively associated with cattle undertaking transhumance. This work highlights that exposure to these 3 important production diseases and occupational zoonoses are widespread in Cameroonian cattle. Further work is required to understand transmission dynamics between humans and livestock to inform implementation of effective control measures.

AB  - M & oslash;ller and Erritz & oslash;e (2017) reported that birds killed by collisions with vehicles had on average relatively smaller brains than birds killed by other causes, which were not identified. Despite concerns about the method used to assess brain mass, we reanalyzed the published data of M & oslash;ller and Erritz & oslash;e (2017) after excluding extraneous species and confirmed a subtle tendency for birds killed by vehicular collision to have somewhat small brains. Some groups of birds (owls, hawks, garden birds and migratory species) did not reflect the overall result. Surprisingly there was no effect of age or sex, whereas one would expect inexperienced immature birds and females in breeding condition to be vulnerable. Overall, plots of brain mass in birds killed by vehicular collisions and other causes greatly overlap, and in some species, individuals killed by collisions have relatively larger brains. That is, the tendency for birds hit by vehicles to be relatively smaller brained is not universal, nor in any species is there an absolute difference in brain size between the two categories. It is possible that in the short time birds have interacted with moving vehicles that selection has acted on brain size to avoid collisions, although we suggest that slightly larger brains might represent an innate tendency to avoid rapidly approaching objects. An interesting question from their study is what was the cause of mortality in the birds not hit by vehicles. Likely sources of mortality of birds post-nestling stage include depredation (natural and house cats) and collisions with windows and other human structures. In fact, relatively large-brained birds might be more susceptible to collisions with windows or being caught by cats (i.e., the other sources of mortality), for which having a relatively larger brain would not appear to mitigate these sources of mortality.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with unmet medical need, and is the leading cause of age-related dementia affecting millions of people worldwide. This work aims at developing small, high-drug loading capacity (DL) and -entrapment efficiency (EE) memantine hydrochloride (MEM)/chitosan nanocrystals (CS-NCs) to treat moderate to severe dementia associated with AD. MEM-loaded chitosan nanocrystals (MEM/CS-NCs, further abbreviated as MEM-NCs) were prepared by the ionic gelation method. Different formulations were prepared by varying the concentrations of CS and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP). The prepared MEM-NCs formulations (n = 8) were evaluated for their particle size (PS), polydispersibility index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), DL, EE and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, in vitro (i.e., release behavior, cytotoxicity) and ex vivo studies (i.e., histopathology) studies were carried out. The results show that the DL was over 92% and the EE was higher than 73%, while the particles were relatively small with nanometric PS (152.63 +/- 12.95 to 310.23 +/- 10.49 nm), uniform with acceptable PDI (0.336 +/- 0.05 to 0.534 +/- 0.02), and stable with positive ZP (23.8 +/- 0.4 mV to 54.0 +/- 0.5 mV). The optimal formulation (MEM-NC3) was selected mainly based on the PS (152.63 +/- 12.95 nm), DL (98.44 +/- 3.31%), and EE (78.7 +/- 3.11%). Interestingly, it does not elicit any cytotoxic and tissue damage when examining at goat nasal mucosa. The selected formulation was subjected to surface morphological studies such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed that the NCs were spherical in shape and small (100 nm). Interestingly, the selected formulation was able to sustain the drug release for up to 24 h with an initial burst release (86.51 %). We conclude that the prepared MEM-NCs represent a promising drug formulation for further in vivo studies (in animal models and in a clinical setting) to prevent and treat AD.

AB  - To date, there have been no studies testing the capacity of GnRH analogs and respective doses to induce a LH peak in sheep. In this sense, the present study aimed to evaluate the capacity of different synthetic forms and doses of GnRH in inducing LH release in sheep, and the effect of GnRH administration at timed artificial insemination (TAI) on pregnancy per timed-AI. In experiment 1, ewes (n = 40) received an intravaginal device (IVD) of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 60 mg) for 7 d and prostaglandin F-2 alpha analog on Day 5. On Day 7, the ewes were allocated randomly into one of eight groups (n = 5/group), which received a GnRH analog at a specific dose, as follows: lecirelin (12.5 or 25 mu g), gonadorelin (50 or 100 mu g), buserelin acetate (4.2 or 8.4 mu g), or deslorelin (375 or 750 mu g). Blood samples for LH determination were obtained at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after GnRH and the IVDs were removed after the last blood collection. The maximal LH concentration induced by gonadorelin at doses of 50 mu g and 100 mu g (12.0 +/- 2.4 ng/mL and 28.6 +/- 7.1 ng/mL, respectively) was lower (P < 0.05) than serum LH induced by 8.4 mu g of buserelin (78.9 +/- 12.9 ng/mL), 375 mu g and 750 mu g of deslorelin (75.6 +/- 7.4 ng/mL and 72.1 +/- 10.6 ng/mL, respectively) and 12.5 mu g and 25 mu g of lecirelin (73.3 +/- 17.8 ng/mL and 61.6 +/- 5.9 ng/mL, respectively). However, the maximal LH concentration induced by 4.2 mu g of buserelin (49.4 +/- 5.9 ng/mL) was similar (P > 0.05) to the 100 mu g of gonadorelin. The total release of LH (area under the curve - AUC) after treatment with 50 mu g of gonadorelin (31.7 +/- 5.9 ng h/mL) was lower (P < 0.05) than after other agonists. In a second experiment, 330 ewes were treated with IVD containing MPA for 7 d. Simultaneously with IVD removal, 250 mu g of cloprostenol and 200 IU of eCG were administered. Then, ewes were assigned randomly to either no further treatment (control); or to receive 4.2 mu g of buserelin acetate (GnRH group) at cervical TAI, which was performed with fresh semen 54 h after IVD withdrawal in all the animals. Higher pregnancy per timed-AI was observed for GnRH (50.3 %) compared to control (40.7 %). We conclude that buserelin acetate (8.4 mu g), lecirelin (12.5 and 25 mu g) and deslorelin (375 and 750 mu g) induced a greater stimulatory effect on LH secretion than gonadorelin treatment. Furthermore, buserelin acetate treatment at TAI increased pregnancy per timed-AI in ewes previously treated with MPA and eCG.

AB  - Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most fatal subtype of stroke, has no disease-modifying treatment. Da-cheng-qi decoction (DCQ), composed of rhubarb, is one of the most commonly used Chinese traditional decoctions in ICH treatment. But the mechanism is not clear. Emodin is an active compound found in rhubarb.
   Purpose: To study the protective effects of DCQ on ICH and its possible mechanisms of action.
   Methods: The ICH model was reproduced by injecting collagenase-VII into the left caudate putamen (CPu) of rats. DCQ and emodin were used to treat the ICH rats for 7 days. Behavior tests, proteomic analysis, morphological studies, and western blotting were performed.
   Results: The neurological deficits in the ICH rats recovered with DCQ and emodin on the 14th day after ICH. The proteomics data revealed that DCQ significantly corrected the pathological signals in the CPu and hippocampus after ICH. The numbers of amoebic microglia in the CPu and M2 microglia in both CPu and hippocampus were significantly increased after DCQ and emodin treatment. The increase in GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor (NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein-95, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signals in the CPu, and secondary neurodegeneration (SND) in the hippocampus were significantly recovered in DCQ-treated rats. Inhibition of MAPK p38 (p38) in the hippocampus was observed after DCQ and emodin treatment.
   Conclusion: The protective effects of DCQ on ICH were confirmed in this study, and its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of MAPK and activation of M2 microglia. These results are beneficial to the development of ICH therapeutic targets.

AB  - Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHCs) are common in marine organisms. However, there is little research on their effects on the central nervous system's advanced activities, such as cognition. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity dynamically regulates cognition through the balance of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). However, the effects of AsHCs on bidirectional synaptic plasticity and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unexplored. This study provides the first evidence that 15 mu g As L-1 AsHC 360 enhances bidirectional synaptic plasticity, occurring during the maintenance phase rather than the baseline phase. Further calcium gradient experiments hypothesize that AsHC 360 may enhance bidirectional synaptic plasticity by affecting calcium ion levels. The enhancement of bidirectional synaptic plasticity by 15 mu g As L-1 AsHC 360 holds significant implications in improving cognitive function, treating neuro-psychiatric disorders, promoting neural recovery, and enhancing brain adaptability.

AB  - Uncontrolled traumatic hemorrhage is a leading cause of preventable death. As two main forms of hemostatic materials, however, both sponges and hydrogel adhesives usually fail to control massive hemorrhage due to their respective shortcomings. Hemostatic sponge shows weak tissue adhesion, while the gelation process of hydrogel makes it difficult to seal high-pressure bleeding wounds. There is an urgent need to develop next-generation hemostats combining the advantages of sponges and hydrogel adhesives. Herein, a general methodology to prepare novel Fe3+-laden porous material (Fe3+@GCS) for rapid hemostasis of the high-pressure and severe hemorrhages is proposed, which is fabricated by loading ferric chloride with ethanol into the catechol-modified carboxylated gelatin sponge (GCS). Notably, porous Fe3+@GCS can undergo water-triggered rapid transformation to robust-adhesive hydrogels. The sealing strength of Fe3+@GCS on wet tissues reaches an astonishing approximate to 600 mm Hg. Rapid water uptake of Fe3+@GCS around wound not only concentrates blood components but also excludes interfacial water, facilitating blood clotting and wound sealing with the in situ formed sticky hydrogel. Fe3+@GCS can efficiently stop the high-pressure hemorrhaging from traumatic injuries of arteries and hearts in rats and pigs, respectively, via a simple and short-time pressing. Furthermore, the wound sealing by Fe3+@GCS promotes wound repair and healing.

AB  - Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) interacts with tissues, leading to fast wound disinfection. Given the frequent global burden of burn injuries and the risks of infection associated with acute full-thickness burns (FTBs), this investigation examined CAP as a potential therapeutic method for wound healing due to its antimicrobial and pro-healing effects. Here, we examined the impacts of CAP on the healing of wounds resulting from acute FTSBs. We established an animal model that included four groups: (1) healthy control animals without burns, (2) untreated animals with acute FTSBs, (3) animals with acute FTSBs treated with CAP for 5 s per day for 21 days, and (4) animals with acute FTSBs treated with CAP for 10 s per day for 21 days. Wound healing was assessed using immunohistological methods. In animals with FTSBs, CAP therapy was accompanied by (i) accelerated wound closure, (ii) enhanced regeneration of the dermis and epidermis, and (iii) increased protein expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). These changes were more pronounced following CAP treatment for 10 s per day compared to CAP treatment for 5 s per day.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine which behaviours may be important for thermoregulation when gestating and lactating sows are housed outdoors in Quebec, Canada during the summer. We kept six groups of four Yorkshire-Landrace sows, from July to September 2018, in outdoor paddocks outfitted with a wallow, shade structure, individual farrowing huts and a pasture plot. From week 15 of gestation to week 3 of lactation, we recorded the location of each sow during five daily observation periods (5 days/week), each consisting of 15 consecutive scan samples at 1-min intervals. Simultaneously, we monitored environmental conditions with temperature and humidity loggers. We analyzed the impact of day relative to farrowing and the temperature humidity index (THI) on the percent of daily observations in the wallow, shade, and farrowing hut with polynomial regression models, with day and THI as covariates and the sow as the subject of repeated measures. In gestation, sows were mainly observed in the wallow (40 +/- 2% of observations), while in lactation, sows were primarily observed in the huts (54 +/- 17%) and were only in the wallow for 6 +/- 4% of observations. THI was associated with the percent of observations in the wallow (P < 0.001) during both gestation and lactation. Day also had a significant association with wallowing; gestating sows were observed in the wallow more often as farrowing drew nearer (P = 0.029), while lactating sows were observed in the wallow more often as the number of days since farrowing increased (P < 0.0001). In gestation, THI was negatively associated with the percent of observations in the farrowing hut (P < 0.0001); however, in lactation, only day predicted the use of the farrowing hut in a non-linear fashion (P < 0.01). In gestation, the sows' wallow use was associated with THI. However, lactating sows exhibited low wallow usage even when THI was high, instead prioritizing the farrowing hut, especially in the first few days after farrowing. The differences between gestation and lactation in the timing and frequency of the sows' use of the wallow and farrowing hut may indicate a conflict of motivation between thermoregulatory and maternal behaviours when sows are nursing their piglets.

AB  - Background: Doxorubicin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs for breast cancer while its common drug resistance leads to poor patient prognosis and survival. Growing evidence indicate dynamically reorganized chromatin allows rapid access of the gene regulatory machinery to open genomic regions facilitating subsequent gene expression through direct transcription factor (TF) activation and regulatory element binding.
   Methods: To better understand the regulatory network underlying doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells, we explored the systematic alterations of chromatin accessibility and gene expression by the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) in combination with RNA sequencing, followed by integrative analysis to identify potential regulators and their targets associated with differentially accessible regions (DARs) in doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 (MCF7-DR) cells.
   Results: A total of 3,963 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to doxorubicin resistance were identified, including dramatically up-regulated MT1E, GSTP1, LDHB, significantly down-regulated TFF1, UBB, DSCAM-AS1, and histone-modifying enzyme coding genes HDAC2, EZH2, PRMT5, etc. By integrating with transcriptomic datasets, we identified 18,228 DARs in MCF7-DR cells compared to control, which were positively correlated with their nearest DEGs (r = 0.6). There were 11,686 increased chromatin-accessible regions, which were enriched in up-regulated genes related to diverse KEGG pathways, such as the cell cycle, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, signaling pathways of MAPK, PI3K/Akt and Hippo, which play essential roles in regulating cell apoptosis, proliferation, metabolism, and inflammatory responses. The 6,542 decreased chromatin-accessible regions were identified for the declined doxorubicin-associated biological processes, for instance, endocrine and insulin resistance, central carbon metabolism, signaling pathways of TGF-beta and P53. Combining data from TCGA, analyses of the DAR sequences associated with the DNA-binding motifs of significantly enriched TF families including AP-1, TEAD and FOX, indicated that the loss-function of FOXA1 might play a critical role in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells (DOX-R BCCs).
   Conclusion: These data exhibit the non-genetic landscape of chromatin accessibility and transcript levels in the DOX-R BCCs, and provide clear insights and resources for the detection of critical TFs and potential cis-regulatory elements-based putative therapeutic targets.

AB  - Serine protease inhibitor-E2 (SERPINE2) is highly expressed in the granulosa cells of growing follicles and the dynamic changes in SERPINE2 expression are correlated with follicular development and ovulation in several mammals, including mice, cattle, sheep, and humans. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their functional receptors are extensively expressed in the ovary and play critical roles in the regulation of ovarian folliculogenesis and luteal function. To date, whether BMPs regulate the expression of SERPINE2 during human follicular development remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BMPs on the regulation of SERPINE2 expression (a major regulator of plasminogen activators [PA]) and the underlying mechanisms using primary and immortalized human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells. Our results demonstrated that these BMPs (BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7, and BMP15) induced differential upregulation of SERPINE2 expression. In this regard, BMP2 is the major modulator that has the best cellular activity, which further decreased the production of urokinase PA and tissue PA in hGL cells. In addition to canonical SMAD1/5/8 signaling, BMP2 also activates noncanonical SMAD2/3 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Using two inhibition approaches (kinase receptor inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown), we found that SMAD2/3-SMAD4 and p38 MAPK, but not SMAD1/5/8 signaling, was involved in the BMP2-induced upregulation of SERPINE2 expression via activin receptor-like kinase 3. These findings deepen our understanding of the differential effect of BMPs in regulating follicular function and provide new insights of the molecular mechanisms by which BMP2 regulates the expression of SERPINE2 in human granulosa cells.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia exacerbates AD. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play roles in limiting neuroinflammation by converting microglial polarization. Therefore, adoptive Treg therapy is considered an attractive option for neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism underlying Treg therapy via microglial modulation is not fully understood. In this study, we sought to determine whether adoptively transferred Tregs were effective when microglia proliferation was inhibited by using GW2580, which is an inhibitor of CSF1R. We found that inhibition of microglial proliferation during Treg transfer did not alter the therapeutic effects of Tregs on cognitive deficits and the accumulation of A beta and pTAU in 3xTg-AD mice. The expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers in the hippocampus of 3xTg mice showed that GW2580 did not affect the inhibition of neuroinflammation by Treg transfer. Additionally, adoptively transferred Tregs were commonly detected in the brain on day 7 after transfer and their levels decreased slowly over 100 days. Our findings suggest that adoptively transferred Tregs can survive longer than 100 days in the brain, suppressing microglial activation and thus alleviating AD pathology. The present study provides valuable evidence to support the prolonged efficacy of adoptive Treg therapy in AD.

AB  - The primary purpose of present study was to explore the effects of arsenic exposure on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway in the hippocampus of offspring mice at different developmental stages. Sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) at doses of 0, 15, 30 or 60 mg/L administered to female mice and their pups. The nuclear translocation levels of NF-kappa B were assessed by EMSA. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure Akt, NF-kappa B and PI3K mRNA levels. Protein expressions of PI3K, pAkt, inhibitor kappa B kinase (IKK), p-NF-kappa B, protein kinase A (PKA), inhibitor kappa B (I kappa B), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were measured by Western blot. Results disclosed that exposure to 60 mg/L NaAsO2 could suppress NF-kappa B levels of nuclear translocation of postnatal day (PND) 20 and PND 40 mice. Arsenic downregulated the transcriptional and translational levels of PI3K, Akt and NF-kappa B. Additionally, protein expressions of p-IKK, p-I kappa B, PKA and p-CREB also reduced. Taken together, results of present study indicated that arsenic could downregulate the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, particularly on PND 40, which might be involved in the cognitive impairments.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dihuang Drink (DHD), formulated by Liu Hejian during the Yuan Dynasty, is listed as one of the first ancient classical prescriptions by the National Medical Products Administration of China. It is commonly used for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study further investigates the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of DHD in AD. Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the cognitive improvement effects of DHD on scopolamine (SCOP)induced memory impairment in mice and to explore its anti-AD mechanisms mediated by exosomes. Materials and methods: A cognitive impairment model was established in C57BL/6J mice via intraperitoneal injection of SCOP (1 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days, followed by DHD intervention to assess its effects on learning, memory, hippocampal synaptic density, and the cholinergic system. SD rats were gavaged with DHD (22.00 g/kg) for 7 days, and plasma exosomes were extracted. These exosomes were injected into SCOP-treated mice (2 mg/kg, every other day for 14 days, 7 injections) to verify the role of exosomes in improving cognitive function. Behavioral performance and brain ChAT and BDNF levels were measured. Results: DHD improved learning and memory in SCOP model mice, attenuated neuronal loss and decreases in dendritic spines induced by scopolamine, and modulated the expression of BDNF, SYN-1, PSD95, and M1 mAChR. DHD-derived plasma exosomes further enhanced learning and memory function and significantly increased brain ChAT activity and BDNF levels. Conclusions: DHD may alleviate cognitive impairment in SCOP model mice, potentially through exosomemediated neuroprotection.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is a key mechanism underlying the cognitive impairment induced by PM2.5, and activated microglia plays an important role in this process. However, the mechanisms by which activated microglia induced by PM2.5 impair hippocampal neurons have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we focused on the role of HMGB1-NLRP3-P2X7R pathway which mediated the microglia activation in hippocampal neurons impairment induced by PM2.5 using a co-culture model of microglia and hippocampal neurons. We found that PM2.5 resulted in activated microglia and HMGB1-NLRP3 inflammatory pathway, and elevated proinflammatory cytokines of IL-18 and IL-113 in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, we next utilized previously reported pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA for HMGB1 and found that they significantly inhibited the activation of downstream NLRP3 and MAPK pathways derived from PM2.5 exposure, and down-regulated IL-18 and IL-113 in microglia. Furthermore, we employed co-cultured hippocampal neurons and microglia and found that reducing HMGB1 significantly decreased neuron impairment, apoptosis related protein of cl-caspase3, synaptic damage, and neurotransmitter receptor of 5-HT2A, along with notably elevated presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins of SYP and PSD-95, as well as learning and memory related proteins of p-CREB and BDNF. The neuronal impairment induced by PM2.5 could not be prevented in the case of simultaneous employment of HMGB1 siRNA and NLRP3 agonist. After silencing NLRP3 alone in microglia, hippocampal neurons demonstrated decreased excessive autophagy and up-regulated synaptic protein of GAP43 as well as learning and memory related protein of NCAM1. Therefore, we further studied how hippocampal neurons affected microglia under PM2.5 exposure, Further investigation indicated that silencing HMGB1 could affect the activation of P2X7R and reduce the release of ATP from hippocampal neurons, thus protecting the interaction between microglia and hippocampal neurons. The present work suggests that regulation of HMGB1-NLRP3-P2X7R pathway can inhibit the microglia activation induced by PM2.5 to alleviate hippocampal neuron impairment and stabilize the microenvironment between microglia and neurons. This contributes to maintaining the normal function of hippocampal neurons and alleviating the cognitive impairment derived from PM2.5 exposure.

AB  - Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) plays important roles in RNA stabilization, translation, transcriptional regulation, and mitophagy. However, its effects on porcine preimplantation embryos remain unclear. In this study, we knocked down YBX1 in the one-cell (1C) stage embryo via small interfering RNA microinjection to determine its function in porcine embryo development. The mRNA level of YBX1 was found to be highly expressed at the four-cell (4C) stage in porcine embryos compared with one-cell (1C) and two-cell (2C) stages. The number of blastocysts was reduced following YBX1 knockdown. Notably, YBX1 knockdown decreased the phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PRKN) mRNA levels. YBX1 knockdown also decreased PINK1, active mitochondria, and sirtuin 1 levels, indicating reduced mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, YBX1 knockdown increased the levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and calnexin, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Additionally, YBX1 knockdown increased autophagy and apoptosis. In conclusion, knockdown of YBX1 decreases mitochondrial function, while increasing ER stress and autophagy during embryonic development.

AB  - Iguanas are the most endangered family of reptiles, with 77% categorised as threatened or near threatened. Further, Cyclura is the most endangered reptile genus, with all 12 species considered threatened. Therefore, it is vital that we develop assisted reproductive technologies for Cyclura spp. to enhance their conservation efforts. The goals of this study were to collect semen, and to measure testicle size and testosterone concentrations in Grand Cayman rock iguana hybrids (Cyclura lewisi x nubila (CLN)) and rhinoceros rock iguanas (Cyclura cornuta (CC)). A prospective longitudinal study was performed in 9.0 CLN and 9.0 CC during their reproductive season in southern Florida (February-July). Serial testicle ultrasound measurements and plasma testosterone concentrations were collected monthly. Testicle measurements (length (L), width (W), height (H)) were collected and testicle volume (V) was estimated using the equation V = 0.52(LW2). There were significant differences in testicle L, W, H and V for both species. Testicle size peaked for CLN and CC in April and May respectively. Plasma testosterone concentrations increased from baseline during February, March and April in CLN and in March, April and May in CC. Ultrasound testicle measurements could be used to predict when to collect semen in these seasonally monocyclic iguanas.

AB  - Dynamic cell activity can be examined by collecting and analyzing cells every' few hours during the day. However, current techniques to extract and analyze skin cells are deemed ineffective and/or invasive. Thus, in this study, we designed and fabricated a device that collects skin cells using ultrasound irradiation. An ultrasonic horn amplifies a Langevin transducer, which then generates ultrasound and transmits it to a fine needle. Ultrasound is irradiated from the needle to the body surface, and ultrasonic oscillation and cavitation cut or weaken intercellular binding. We successfully aspirated 30 cells from pig skin using our minimally invasive device.

AB  - In modern intensive pig farming, accurately monitoring piglet behavior is crucial for health management and improving production efficiency. However, the complexity of existing models demands high computational resources, limiting the application of piglet behavior recognition in farming environments. In this study, the piglet multi-behavior-recognition approach is divided into three stages. In the first stage, the LAMP pruning algorithm is used to prune and optimize redundant channels, resulting in the lightweight YOLOv8-Prune. In the second stage, based on YOLOv8, the AIFI module and the Gather-Distribute mechanism are incorporated, resulting in YOLOv8-GDA. In the third stage, using YOLOv8-GDA as the teacher model and YOLOv8-Prune as the student model, knowledge distillation is employed to further enhance detection accuracy, thus obtaining the YOLOv8-Piglet model, which strikes a balance between the detection accuracy and speed. Compared to the baseline model, YOLOv8-Piglet significantly reduces model complexity while improving detection performance, with a 6.3% increase in precision, 11.2% increase in recall, and an mAP@0.5 of 91.8%. The model was deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX edge computing platform for the evaluation. The average inference time was reduced from 353.9 ms to 163.2 ms, resulting in a 53.8% reduction in the processing time. This study achieves a balance between model compression and recognition accuracy through the collaborative optimization of pruning and knowledge extraction.

AB  - The signals from the maternal environment play pivotal roles in regulating fetal neurodevelopment. Postnatal enriched environment (EE) exposure promotes neurogenesis and neurodevelopment. However, the roles of prenatal EE on fetal neurodevelopment and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study shows that prenatal EE exposure promotes neuronal development and regulates the expression of neurodevelopmental genes in fetal mice. The prenatal EE altered the maternal microbiota and enhanced the Lactobacillus levels in the maternal mice. It also significantly elevated indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), a metabolite produced by Lactobacillus, in both the maternal serum and fetal brains. IPA promoted the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of embryonic neural progenitor cells (eNPCs) by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-Src-Erk1/2 pathway in vitro and in vivo. Administration of Lactobacillus reuteri and IPA to pregnant mice also enhanced embryonic neurogenesis and neurodevelopment. Collectively, our study has revealed the essential function and underlying mechanisms of prenatal EE in regulating fetal neurodevelopment.

AB  - An animal entering a new environment typically faces three challenges: explore the space for resources, memorize their locations, and navigate towards those targets as needed. Here we propose a neural algorithm that can solve all these problems and operates reliably in diverse and complex environments. At its core, the mechanism makes use of a behavioral module common to all motile animals, namely the ability to follow an odor to its source. We show how the brain can learn to generate internal "virtual odors" that guide the animal to any location of interest. This endotaxis algorithm can be implemented with a simple 3-layer neural circuit using only biologically realistic structures and learning rules. Several neural components of this scheme are found in brains from insects to humans. Nature may have evolved a general mechanism for search and navigation on the ancient backbone of chemotaxis.

AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the most important support for patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure. As the key component, the oxygenation membrane has suffered the risk of blood coagulation and plasma leakage in the long term. Herein, we prepare a sulfonate polyamide film on poly(ether sulfone) (PES) support via interfacial polymerization modulated by a sulfonate amine monomer. The pore diameter of the prepared polyamide film is similar to 3.67 & Aring; (exactly a little smaller than the water molecule, the base of plasma). By such size repulsion effect, the polyamide film demonstrates remarkable plasma leakage resistance (confirmed by human plasma circulation). Moreover, the introduction of the sulfonate amine monomer effectively enhances the anticoagulation performance (activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolongation >10 s). In addition, the PES support used for interfacial polymerization is modified and realizes improved porosity, hydrophilicity, and positive charge potential, resulting in lower mass transfer resistance and improved interfacial strength between the support and polyamide film. ECMO-simulated circulation tests prove the facilitation effect on gas exchange derived from the support modification and interfacial polymerization modulation. This work provides a composite membrane simultaneously with significant plasma leakage resistance and anticoagulation properties for efficient blood oxygenation.

AB  - Sulfation is a widespread modification of biomolecules that has been incompletely explored to date. Through cross-phenotype meta-analysis of bone mineral density in up to 426,824 genotyped human participants along with phenotypic characterization of multiple mutant mouse lines, we identified a causative role for sulfate transporter solute carrier family 26 member A2 (SLC26A2) deficiency in osteoporosis. Ablation of SLC26A2 in osteoblasts caused severe bone loss and accumulation of immature bone cells and elicited peculiar pericellular matrix (PCM) production characterized by undersulfation coupled with decreased stiffness. These altered chemophysical properties of the PCM disrupted the formation of focal adhesions in osteoblasts. Bulk RNA sequencing and functional assays revealed that the mechanoreciprocal inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP)/WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 (TAZ) signaling impinged osteoblast maturation upon SLC26A2 deficiency. Moreover, pharmacological abrogation of the Hippo kinases and forced wheel-running ameliorated SLC26A2-deficient osteoporosis by promoting YAP/TAZ activity. Analysis of mouse single-cell RNA sequencing data suggested coordination among sulfate metabolism, focal adhesion, and YAP/TAZ activity during osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. In addition to the SLC26A2-deficient setting, altered FAK and YAP/TAZ signaling was also observed in bone cells of ovariectomized mice and patients with osteoporosis, and pharmacological enforcing of YAP/TAZ activity ameliorated bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Collectively, these data unveil a role for sulfation in the developmental mechanoreciprocity between matrix and osteoblasts, which could be leveraged to prevent bone loss.

AB  - The oilseed Camelina sativa was genetically engineered to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at levels similar to fish oil (FO), which we tested as a lipid source in diets for rainbow trout. Three experimental diets were tested, a FO control, a low-level transgenic camelina oil (LCO) diet (no FO with 12.5 g/kg camelina), and a high-level transgenic camelina oil (HCO) diet (no FO with 130 g/kg transgenic camelina). Trout (initial weight 49.8 +/- 11 g/fish) were fed for 12 weeks and were evaluated for growth performance, fatty acid content (muscle, liver, brain, and eye), and sensory properties of fillets. The final lengths and weights of fish fed LCO and HCO diets were higher compared to fish fed FO. There were no differences in weight gain, condition factor, specific growth rate, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio. EPA in muscle tissue was higher in fish fed HCO and FO diets compared to the LCO diet. Compound-specific stable isotope analysis revealed that rainbow trout fed the FO diet stored isotopically enriched DHA compared to the lighter DHA in fish fed HCO. Trout fillets from the HCO treatment were firmer in texture and had a higher orange intensity compared to the FO group.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown that phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) have multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective or neuroprotective functions, whereas their anti -tumor effects are rarely studied. Tubuloside B (Tub B) is a PhG isolated from Cistanche deserticola , a traditional Chinese medicine. To date, there is a lack of comprehensive research regarding the biological activity of Tub B. Purpose: The subject of the current study was to investigate the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell activity and the underlying mechanism of Tub B. Methods: We evaluated the in vitro anti-migratory effect of Tub B by scratch and transwell assays. RNA-seq was employed to identify the differential genes by Tub B. Besides, the functional mechanism of Tub B was investigated by distinct molecular biology techniques including immunofluorescent staining, quantitative PCR, as well as western blot analysis. Subsequently, we utilized Hep3B cells for in vivo metastasis assays through spleen injection and evaluated the anti-migratory effect of Tub B in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results: Tub B exhibited in vitro and in vivo inhibition of HCC cell migration. Tub B decreased the expression of transcriptional target genes downstream of the Hippo pathway, including CTGF, CYR61, and N-cadherin as determined by RNA-seq. Furthermore, mechanistic studies confirmed that Tub B increased phosphorylation of YAP at S127, which contributes to YAP cytoplasmic localization. Additionally, overexpression of YAP abrogated Tub B-induced inhibition of HCC migration and the mRNA levels of CTGF, CYR61, and N-cadherin . Conclusions: Taken together, these results illustrated that Tub B demonstrated great potential in inhibiting migration of HCC, and a portion of its impact can be attributed to the modulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway.

AB  - The zoo-housed southern white rhinoceros (SWR) population is of special concern due to their lack of consistent breeding success. An enhanced understanding of SWR social preferences could better inform management planning by promoting natural social relationships, which can positively affect their well-being. The large, multigeneration herd housed at the North Carolina Zoo provides an ideal opportunity to examine rhino sociality across different ages, kin types, and social groupings. Eight female rhinos' social and nonsocial behaviors were recorded from November 2020 through June 2021 across 242 h. Activity budget analyses revealed strong seasonal and temporal variations in grazing and resting behaviors, with no stereotypic behaviors recorded. Bond strength calculations suggested that each female maintained strong social bonds with one to two partners. Beyond mother-nursing calf bonds, we found that the strongest social ties were maintained between calf-less adults and subadults in these dyads. Considering these findings, we recommend that management plans attempt to house immature females with calf-less adult females, as they may be necessary to the social landscape of immature females and, ultimately, improve their welfare.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and cognitive impairments. Evidence suggests that Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) may exacerbate ASD-related abnormalities, while Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) may offer neuroprotection. This study investigates the effects of Vitamin A modulation on neuronal integrity, cognitive function, and social behavior in a valproic acid (VPA)-induced ASD rat model, focusing on histological changes, behavioral outcomes, and serum Vitamin A levels. Pregnant Wistar rats received VPA (500 mg/kg) on gestational day 12.5. Offspring were divided into Control, VPA, VAD, VPA + VAD, and VPA + VAS (2000 IU/kg diet) groups. Serum Vitamin A levels were quantified using spectrophotometry. Histopathological analysis of the hippocampus, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) assessed neuronal and glial cell densities. Behavioral tests included the Three-Chamber Social Interaction Test for sociability and the Novel Object Recognition Test for memory function. Serum analysis showed significantly lower Vitamin A levels in VAD and VPA + VAD groups, while VAS restored levels. Histological analysis revealed reduced neuronal density and increased glial activation in VPA, VAD, and VPA + VAD groups. The VPA + VAS group exhibited partial neuronal recovery. Behaviorally, VAS improved sociability and memory performance, correlating with neuronal preservation. These findings suggest that Vitamin A deficiency worsens ASD-related impairments, while supplementation restores neuronal integrity and cognitive function, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in ASD.

AB  - Non-O1 Vibrio cholerae is a highly virulent pathogen which has seriously threatened the development of Macrobrachium nipponense in various farms. However, little information is available in relation to underlying mechanisms of host-bacteria interaction in M. nipponense. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of M. nipponense at 6 and 12 h post-infection (hpi), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (P<0.05) were revealed by comparison of gene expression levels between 6 and 12 hpi. The results showed that expression of different immune-related genes was found significantly regulated at 6 hpi than at 12 hpi by transcriptome analysis, which was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 189 DEGs including 104 up regulated genes and 85 down-regulated genes from hepatopancreas at 6 hpi, 56 DEGs at 12 hpi were identified, which was much lower than that in the comparison of at 6 hpi and the up-regulated and down-regulated genes were 39 and 17, respectively. Many genes associated with Rap1 signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, Endocytosis, Hippo signaling pathway, Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and Phagosome were positively modified after non-O1 V. cholerae challenge, and most the immune-related pathways were activated at 6 hpi. We selected 6 DEGs and validated their expression level by RT-qPCR. The data generated in this study may provide a valuable resource for further immune response research and offer improved strategies against non-O1 V. cholerae infection in shrimp.

AB  - Heavy metal exposure-triggered growth retardation and physiology disorder in phytophagous insects have been widely understood, but only a few studies have investigated its immunomodulatory effects on herbivorous insects. Here, the innate immunity of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae under Cd stress was evaluated by integrating cellular and humoral immunity, and the immunomodulation mechanism of Cd stress was further understood by the proteomics analysis of larval hemolymph. Our results showed that the total hemocyte count, as well as phagocytic, encapsulation and bacteriostatic activity, of hemolymph in gypsy moth larvae exposed to Cd stress was significantly lower than that in un-treated larvae. Further proteomic analysis revealed that Cd exposure may reduce the total hemocyte count in larval hemolymph by inducing endoplasmic reticulum pathway-mediated hemocyte apoptosis, thereby causing the collapse of cellular immunity in gypsy moth larvae. In addition, the transcriptional level of signal transduction genes (IMD, Toll, Relish, JAK and STAT) and antimicrobial peptide genes (cecropin and lebocin), as well as the protein abundance of pattern recognition receptors (PGRP and GNBP3) in the Toll, IMD and JAK/STAT signaling pathways was significantly decreased in Cd-treated larvae, clearly implying an immunosuppresive effect of Cd stress on pathogen recognition, signal transduction and effector synthesis of humoral immunity in gypsy moth larvae. Taken together, these results suggest that Cd exposure decreases both cellular immunity and humoral immunity of gypsy moth larvae, and provides a new entry point for systematically and comprehensively unraveling the heavy metal pollutants-caused immunotoxicity.

AB  - This study aimed to provide data for fisheries management of two threatened guitarfish species, by using linear and geometric morphometric analyses. Linear morphometrics (LM) has limitations in determining minimum catch sizes, whereas geometric morphometrics offers a robust approach to quantifying body form variations with the potential to influence metrics set by legislation. Based on LM analysis, Pseudobatos horkelii were larger than Pseudobatos percellens. Based on geometric morphometric analysis body form differed between the two species, particularly in the head, disk, and posterior region. P. percellens were also sexual dimorphic in body form. Our findings provide valuable insights into permissible catch size limits of these threatened guitarfish and also contribute to improvement of fisheries management strategies where catch is still allowed. The study underscores the necessity of species-specific and sex-specific management directives to effectively ensure the population recovery of both guitarfish species.

AB  - Camellia japonica is a woody flower with high ornamental and economic value used for landscaping and as a pot plant. Floral colors are among the most important ornamental traits of flower plants, particularly multicolored flowers. The C. japonica cultivar 'Joy Kendrick' has multicolored flowers; the corolla is pink with darker red stripes, but the molecular mechanism underlying this trait is unknown. Here, pigment analysis showed that there are more anthocyanins accumulate in red petal regions than in pink areas, which may be key to formation of red stripes. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that anthocyanin biosynthesis, modification, and transporter genes are highly expressed in red stripes, consistent with the observed anthocyanin accumulation. In addition, many plant hormone signal transduction genes, particularly auxin, may contribute to the regulation of red stripe formation. This study provides broad insights into pigment accumulation and the regulatory mechanisms underlying floral color formation in C. japonica, and lays a foundation for breeding new C. japonica varieties.

AB  - Large pelagic finfish are highly mobile, distributed across broad geographical scales, and often targeted by both commercial and recreational sectors. Fishing effort in these fisheries is variable due to seasonal patterns in fish behaviour and accessibility of fishing locations. Similarly, fisher behaviour and access are likely to differ within the recreational sector, between private boat-based fishing and charter (or for hire) fishing. Here, we compare spatio-temporal patterns in catch per unit effort (CPUE), effort (boat days) and catch (total catch per fishing party) for private boat-based and charter fishing, and identify environmental variables that may influence those patterns, for two pelagic species (the tropical narrow-barred Spanish mackerel and temperate Samson fish) in Western Australia. Spatial and temporal patterns of CPUE were investigated using geostatistical indices, such as the global and local index of collocation which compares the spatial distribution of CPUE locations across years and CPUE values at common locations respectively, and the centre of gravity which calculates the mean fishing location weighted by CPUE, along with the influence of environmental variables (including rainfall and sea surface temperature) on catch using generalised additive models (GAMs). The global index of collocation showed consistency in spatial distribution of CPUE and effort between private boat-based and charter fishing for both species. In contrast, the local index of collocation showed differences in the ranges of CPUE and effort within common locations. Private boat-based fishing often occurred close to the coast and adjacent to population centres, while charter fishing occurred further offshore. Spatial shifts over time were more prominent for Spanish mackerel with an overall northerly shift. For private boat-based fishing, higher catches of Spanish mackerel were associated with higher rainfall, along with an increase in ambient air temperature. For charter fishing, higher catches of Spanish mackerel occurred with ambient air temperatures of around 30 degrees Celsius and a decrease in rainfall, where high catches of Samson fish were associated with a decrease in sea surface temperatures and austral winter months. This study highlights changes in the distributions of pelagic species over time and the potential to incorporate spatio-temporal monitoring of recreational harvest into fisheries management.

AB  - The ontogenetic development of the main digestive enzymes and in vitro digestibility were investigated in spotted Babylon (Babylonia areolata) veligers. The collected specimens included fertilized eggs, trochophores, veligers, and settlement stage larvae. The activity of each studied enzyme showed strongly positive pairwise correlations with the activity of every other enzyme studied (r = 0.498-0.847, n = 60, p < 0.01). Pepsin showed the highest specific activity during the development of the veligers (p < 0.05). Pepsin and chymotrypsin specific activity followed broadly similar trends, except in late trochophore and early veliger stages. Trypsin specific activity was highest in early-stage veligers. Amylase specific activity progressively increased in middle-stage veligers, and decreased in older veligers. Cellulase activity started to increase before hatching, exhibiting its highest activity during the first seven days of veliger development. Lipase specific activity increased progressively in early-stage veligers and then decreased and remained constant until the end of observation. The in vitro digestibility assay showed that three mixed rations (75:25, 25:75, and 0:100 w/w) of Chaetoceros sp. and Isochrysis sp., and single components of Spirulina meal, and clam feed were suitable for early-stage veligers, while all mixed rations of Chaetoceros sp. and Tetraselmis sp., and single components of Spirulina meal and herbivorous fish feed were suitable for late-stage veligers. Our findings can be used as a feed management reference for spotted Babylon veligers.

AB  - Background Doxorubicin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs for breast cancer while its common drug resistance leads to poor patient prognosis and survival. Growing evidence indicate dynamically reorganized chromatin allows rapid access of the gene regulatory machinery to open genomic regions facilitating subsequent gene expression through direct transcription factor (TF) activation and regulatory element binding.
   Methods To better understand the regulatory network underlying doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells, we explored the systematic alterations of chromatin accessibility and gene expression by the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) in combination with RNA sequencing, followed by integrative analysis to identify potential regulators and their targets associated with differentially accessible regions (DARs) in doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 (MCF7-DR) cells.
   Results A total of 3,963 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to doxorubicin resistance were identified, including dramatically up-regulated MT1E, GSTP1, LDHB, significantly down-regulated TFF1, UBB, DSCAM-AS1, and histone-modifying enzyme coding genes HDAC2, EZH2, PRMT5, etc. By integrating with transcriptomic datasets, we identified 18,228 DARs in MCF7-DR cells compared to control, which were positively correlated with their nearest DEGs (r = 0.6). There were 11,686 increased chromatin-accessible regions, which were enriched in up-regulated genes related to diverse KEGG pathways, such as the cell cycle, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, signaling pathways of MAPK, PI3K/Akt and Hippo, which play essential roles in regulating cell apoptosis, proliferation, metabolism, and inflammatory responses. The 6,542 decreased chromatin-accessible regions were identified for the declined doxorubicin-associated biological processes, for instance, endocrine and insulin resistance, central carbon metabolism, signaling pathways of TGF-beta and P53. Combining data from TCGA, analyses of the DAR sequences associated with the DNA-binding motifs of significantly enriched TF families including AP-1, TEAD and FOX, indicated that the loss-function of FOXA1 might play a critical role in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells (DOX-R BCCs).
   Conclusion These data exhibit the non-genetic landscape of chromatin accessibility and transcript levels in the DOX-R BCCs, and provide clear insights and resources for the detection of critical TFs and potential cis-regulatory elements-based putative therapeutic targets.

AB  - The exposure of cumulus cells to nuclear matured oocytes can be regulated through the forced delay of nuclear maturation or the alteration of in vitro maturation (IVM) time in cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). However, to date, no evidence has been presented for the enhancement of cytoplasmic matu-ration by them, indicating irrelevance of cumulus cells in cytoplasmic maturation. Therefore, in order to identify the requirement of cumulus cells in achieving the cytoplasmic maturation of immature oocytes, this study investigated the effects of cumulus cells on the in vitro cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes within COCs derived from porcine medium antral follicles (MAFs) post-the completion of nuclear maturation. For these, with IVM of COCs for 44 h (control), cumulus cell-free oocytes with completed nuclear maturation were in-vitro-matured additionally for 0, 6, or 12 h, and then a variety of factors representing the cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes were analyzed and compared. As the results, the IVM of COCs for 32 h showed complete nuclear maturation and incomplete cytoplasmic maturation. More-over, after the removal of cumulus cells from COCs with the completion of nuclear maturation, IVM for an additional 6 or 12 h resulted in significant increases in the size of the perivitelline space, the proportion of oocytes with a normal intracellular mitochondrial distribution and a normal round first polar body, and the preimplantation development into the 2-cell and blastocyst stages after parthenogenetic acti-vation. Simultaneously, they showed significant reduction in the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species and no significant differences in the total number of blastocysts. Furthermore, oocytes obtained by this approach did not significantly differ from control oocytes produced by IVM of COCs for 44 h. Our results demonstrate that the cumulus cells enclosing COCs derived from porcine MAFs are not essential for the completion of cytoplasmic maturation after complete nuclear maturation by COCs.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Prions are transmissible protein pathogens most reliably detected by a bioassay in a suitable host, typically mice. However, the mouse bioassay is slow and cumbersome, and relatively insensitive to low titers of prion infectivity. Prions can be detected biochemically in vitro by the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique, which amplifies diseaseassociated prion protein but does not detect bona fide prion infectivity. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila transgenic for bovine prion protein (PrP) expression can serve as a model system for the detection of bovine prions significantly more efficiently than either the mouse prion bioassay or PMCA. Strikingly, bovine PrP transgenic Drosophila could detect bovine prion infectivity in the region of a 10-12 dilution of classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) inoculum, which is 106-fold more sensitive than that achieved by the bovine PrP mouse bioassay. A similar level of sensitivity was observed in the detection of H-type and L-type atypical BSE and sheep-passaged BSE by bovine PrP transgenic Drosophila. Bioassays of bovine prions in Drosophila were performed within 7 weeks, whereas the mouse prion bioassay required at least a year to assess the same inoculum. In addition, bovine PrP transgenic Drosophila could detect classical BSE at a level 105-fold lower than that achieved by PMCA. These data show that PrP transgenic Drosophila represent a new tractable prion bioassay for the efficient and sensitive detection of mammalian prions, including those of known zoonotic potential.

AB  - Ionizing radiation (IR) is widely present in the environment, with 137Cesium (Cs) radiation having particularly severe impacts during nuclear accidents. The objective of our study was to assess the radiation protection or repair effect of one year (WT-1Y) or seven years (WT-7Y) of storage on white teas, as well as to investigate the mechanism of radioprotection. HGC-27 cells exposed to 137Cs gamma-rays (30 Gy) exhibited significant changes in cell structure, apoptosis, ROS, LDH, and their expression of p53 and Caspase-3. The results showed that WT-1Y and WT-7Y acted as antioxidants, showed reduced ROS and LDH levels, and had increased CAT and SOD activities as well as cell survival rate. The WT treatments significantly inhibited apoptosis in both the pre- and post-radiation groups, with WT-1 showing stronger effects in pretreatment by reducing LDH, p53, and Caspase-3 levels and enhancing ROS scavenging and enzyme activities. Post-treatment analysis revealed WT-7 had greater effects on cell viability and SOD activity. Overall, both WT-1 and WT-7 mitigated radiation damage, likely by inhibiting the p53/Caspase-3 apoptosis pathway. A Spearman analysis of the differential metabolites in WT-1Y and WT-7Y with cellular radioprotective indicators revealed that metabolites, such as EGC, procyanidin B4, and phenolic acids (abundant in WT-1Y), quercetin-3-glucosylrutinoside, and caffeine (enriched in WT-7Y) contributed to their distinct effects in the pre- and post-treatment of 137Cs gamma-rays.

AB  - Understanding how A beta 42 oligomers induce changes in neurons from a mechanobiological perspective has important implications in neuronal dysfunction relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains challenging to profile the mechanical responses of neurons and correlate the mechanical signatures to the biological properties of neurons given the structural complexity of cells. Here, we quantitatively investigate the nanomechanical properties of primary hippo campus neurons upon exposure to A beta 42 oligomers at the single neuron level by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We develop a method termed heterogeneity-load-unload nano mechanics (HLUN), which exploits the AFM force spectra in the whole loading-unloading cycle, allowing comprehensive profiling of the mechanical properties of living neurons. We extract four key nanomechanical parameters, including the apparent Young's modulus, cell spring constant, normalized hysteresis, and adhesion work, that serve as the nanomechanical signatures of neurons treated with A beta 42 oligomers. These parameters are well-correlated with neuronal height increase, cortical actin filament strengthening, and calcium concentration elevation. Thus, we establish an HLUN method-based AFM nanomechanical analysis tool for single neuron study and build an effective correlation between the nanomechanical profile of the single neurons and the biological effects triggered by A beta 42 oligomers. Our finding provides useful information on the dysfunction of neurons from the mechanobiological perspective.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common brain function disorder. The present study aims to evaluate the long-term effect of perampanel (PRM) and lacosamide (LCM), administered singly in a high-dose or in a low-dose combination of both, on comorbid anxiety, cognitive impairment, BDNF, and Cyclin D1 hippocampal expression in an experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy with lithium-pilocarpine. PRM (3 mg/kg, p.o.)/LCM (30 mg/kg, p.o.) or PRM+LCM (0.5 mg/kg + 3 mg/kg, p.o.) treatments were administered three hours after the lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and continued for up to ten weeks in adult Wistar rats. Our study demonstrated that perampanel and lacosamide administered singly in high doses improved epilepsy-associated cognitive impairment through ameliorating anxiety and facilitating passive learning and memory, with spatial and recognition memory measured in the elevated plus maze, step-through, Y-maze, and object recognition tests, respectively. In addition, the combination of both drugs in low doses demonstrated similar anxiolytic and cognitive-improving effects compared to the singly administered drugs. Moreover, the three experimental groups enhanced the hippocampal expression of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and mitigated the increased levels of the apoptotic factor Cyclin D1. These beneficial effects could be essential mechanisms through which administered anticonvulsants preserve neuronal survival and homeostasis in the CNS and especially in the hippocampus.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: Qisheng Wan formula (QWF) was first described in the book Sheng Ji Zong Lu in 1117. The book states that QWF can cure forgetfulness, improve the mind, and make people smart. Hence, QWF has been widely used to treat patients with forgetfulness or dementia. QWF, a classic Chinese formulation, comprises seven herbal drugs: the sclerotium of Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl, root of Polygala tenuifolia Willd., root and rhizome of Panax ginseng C. A. Mey., root of Asparagus cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr., root and rhizome of Acorus tatarinowii Schott, and root bark of Lycium chinense Mill. Aim of the study: This study aimed to utilize modern pharmacological methods to evaluate the therapeutic effects and explore the underlying mechanism of QWF action on rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Materials and methods: The chemical profile of QWF was characterized using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The AD rat model was established via a bilateral intraventricular injection of amyloid-beta (1-42) (A beta 1-42). The rats were subsequently treated daily with QWF for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate the cognition processes in the rats, whereas histological changes in the hippocampus were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression levels of A beta 1-42, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-Kappa B), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6 in the hippocampus and colon were assessed. Moreover, the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota were analyzed using 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Results: One hundred and fourteen compounds were characterized in QWF. QWF significantly ameliorated the cognition processes and histopathological damages due to AD in rats by decreasing the deposition of A beta 1-42 and downregulating the expression of NF-Kappa B, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. QWF also modulated changes in the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota to suppress the relative abundance of inflammation-associated microbiota. Conclusion: This study showed that QWF can suppress proinflammatory factors and modulate the intestinal microbiota in AD rats.

AB  - Bifacial photovoltaic sunshade (BiPVS) is an innovative building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology. Vertically mounted BiPVS is capable of converting part of the incident solar radiation into electricity, regulating the indoor heat gain from solar penetration and improving daylighting. An excellent BiPVS design should comprehensively consider its impact on building performance and economic viability. This study aims to address this issue by proposing a parametric design-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework to maximize indoor useful daylight illuminance, minimize air-conditioning energy consumption, and shorten the payback period by optimizing BiPVS design parameters. The framework utilizes the Ladybug, Honeybee, and Wallacei plugins on the Rhino-Grasshopper simulation platform. It validates the optimization potential of BiPVS in a typical office located in a hot summer and warm winter zone. The results indicate that BiPVS has significant energy-saving and daylighting potential. Compared to the baseline model without BiPVS, useful daylight illuminance is increased by 39.44%, air-conditioning energy consumption is reduced by 12.61%, and the economically satisfactory payback period is 4.80 years. This study provides a practical solution for the competing objectives of daylighting and energy saving in buildings with significant renewable energy utilization. The developed framework is highly efficient and versatile and can be applied to other BIPV designs, which benefits the realization of carbon-neutral goals in the building sector.

AB  - BackgroundCerebrolysin (CBL), a peptide derived from pig brain, is recognized for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. This research aimed to investigate the effects of CBL on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, spatial memory, the tryptophan/kynurenine (TRP/KYN) pathway, and inflammation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a mouse model for schizophrenia.Methods and resultsThirty-six male BALB/c mice were allocated into three experimental groups: control, ketamine (Ket) (20 mg/kg per day, i.p.), and Ket + CBL (2.5 mL/kg per day, i.p.). The open field test was used to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity, while the tail suspension test was used to assess depression-like behavior. Spatial memory was evaluated using the Lashley III Maze. Moreover, KYN and TRP levels were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inflammatory factors NLRP3 and IL-1 beta were assessed via the Western blot method. The results demonstrated that CBL administration significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviors, improved locomotor activity, decreased immobility time, and enhanced spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, CBL significantly lowered KYN levels and increased TRP levels in the PFC. Administration of Ket caused an increase in IL-1 beta levels. However, CBL did not significantly impact NLRP3 and IL-1 beta levels compared to the Ket group.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the neuroprotective properties of CBL, which are likely due to its modulatory action on the TRP/KYN pathway and improvement in spatial memory, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors in schizophrenia mice.

AB  - Simple Summary Broilers are especially heat sensitive because of the absence of sweat glands and their elevated metabolism. Under commercial conditions, extremely high temperatures (heat stress) reduce their performance. This research aimed to assess spray-dried feeding plasma (SDP) during constant heat stress (HS) on the performance, intestinal permeability, and bone strength in broilers. Chickens fed with a diet supplemented with SDP increased both their body weight and body weight gain compared to the HS control group. At the end of the study (d 42 of age), chickens fed with SDP significantly alleviated the increased gut leakage induced by HS and showed a significant increase in tibia strength compared with control HS chickens. The results in the present study suggest SDP mends gut integrity, hence reducing chronic systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to see how spray-dried plasma (SDP) supplementation affected broiler chicken performance, intestinal permeability, and bone strength during persistent heat stress. One-day-old chicks (n = 480) were randomly assigned into twelve environmental corrals; four thermoneutral (TN-negative control, maintained at 24 degrees C from d 21-42); four heat stress (HS, exposed to 35 degrees C from d 21-42); and four heat stress treated with 2% SDP in the feed until d 28 followed by 1% SDP until d 42 (HS-SDP). The performance and serum levels of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-d) were evaluated at d 21, 28, 35, and 42. The tibias strength was evaluated on d 21 and 42. The increment in chicken temperature (p < 0.05) was observed two h following the increase in environmental temperature in both HS groups and was associated with decreased performance parameters compared with the TN group. At d 42 of age, the chickens exposed to HS had an impaired gut permeability and decreased tibia strength compared to the TN group (p < 0.05). However, partially feeding SDP mitigated these adverse effects significantly. These findings imply that using SDP strategically during stressful times, such as prolonged heat stress, may help mitigate its negative consequences.

AB  - Simple Summary Over the past three decades, the litter size of sows has been increased to improve productivity. This has not only led to more piglets per sow, but also an increased proportion of low birth weight piglets, and consequently, higher pre-weaning mortality. In an attempt to improve the resilience of small piglets, an oral supplementation (drenching) with a bioactive compound can be applied. In this study, low birth weight piglets were drenched with bovine colostrum, short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides or quercetin (each dissolved in a plain milk replacer) during the first seven days after birth. The animals' body weight, mortality, skin lesions, and different blood parameters were evaluated between birth and 2 weeks post-weaning. None of the supplemented compounds had a positive effect on any of the parameters, and thus, on the resilience of low birth weight piglets. Moreover, a negative effect on survival was observed in piglets that were drenched with short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides. These results showed that the evaluated bioactive compounds, in their given dosages, were unable to improve the low birth weight piglets' survival and emphasized the complex, multifactorial origin of pre-weaning mortality. The introduction of hyperprolific sows has resulted in more low birth weight (LBW) piglets, accompanied by higher mortality. A possible strategy to enhance the resilience and survival of LBW piglets is oral supplementation (drenching) of bioactive substances. This study evaluated the supplementation of bovine colostrum, short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) or quercetin that were dissolved separately in a milk replacer. The study was divided into two sub-experiments. First, the milk replacer was compared with a sham drenched group. Secondly, each dissolved compound was compared with the milk replacer. The LBW piglets, defined as weighing between (mean litter birth weight -1*SD) and (mean litter birth weight -2.5*SD), were randomly allocated to the different treatments and drenched once a day for seven days. On day 1, 3, 9, 24 and 38, piglets were weighed and scored for skin lesions. Blood samples were collected on day 9 and 38 and analyzed to determine glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, urea, immunoglobulin G, insulin-like growth factor 1, and a standard blood panel test. There was no difference between sham drenched piglets and piglets that were drenched with milk replacer regarding any of the parameters. No effect was observed between the milk replacer group and any of the bioactive compounds either, except a higher mortality within the scFOS group. In conclusion, this study showed that drenching the evaluated bioactive compounds, in the used dosages, did not improve LBW piglets' resilience or survival and more research is required to determine the effect of scFOS on small piglets.

AB  - We comprehensively assessed marine recreational fishing of threatened guitarfishes (Pseudobatos percellens, Pseudobatos horkelii, and Zapteryx brevirostris) in Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. A dual-method approach integrated social media reports and in-person interviews to explore practices, challenges, and conservation implications of recreational fishing for these species. Seasonal capture of guitarfishes required the promotion of catch-and-release, especially during gestational periods, and the development of best angling practices manuals and accessible identification guides. With a focus on land-based activities and engagement with fishers, our findings underscored the importance of collaboration among researchers, recreational fishers, and conservationists to map and monitor recreational capture and contribute to guitarfish research and conservation.

AB  - Objectives: Exposure to food additives, especially during the critical development period, has been associated with some behavioral disorders and learning difficulties in childhood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of sodium benzoate (NaB) on learning and neurobehavior in prepubertal rats.Methods: 42 male rats (4-week-old) were divided into three groups as the control (CG), experiment 1 (NaB-ADI (acceptable daily intake) dose, Exp1G), and experiment 2 (NaB-NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) dose, Exp2G) groups and NaB was administered by oral gavage for six weeks. Changes in learning, memory, motor activity and neurobehavior were evaluated by Morris water maze and open field tests. At the end of the experiment, rats' hippocampi were extracted; NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and nAChR alpha 7 receptor concentrations and mRNA expressions were determined.Results: Neurobehavioral tests supported the possibility of increased anxiety and decreased motivation in the Exp1G. Also, molecular tests showed that NR2B receptor protein and mRNA expression levels significantly increased in Exp2G compared to CG.Conclusions: Our study showed that NaB administration in the prepubertal period may cause increased anxiety, decreased motivation, and attention with ADI dose. Furthermore, NOAEL dose administration may lead to an increase in NR2B receptor levels. In light of these results, NaB consumption in childhood may affect hippocampal functions related to learning and neurobehavior.

AB  - Macrobrachium nipponense, an important economic aquaculture species in China, is experiencing degradation of shrimp germplasm resources. Hybridization is a means of genetic improvement and can contribute to overcoming this serious problem. However, the molecular mechanisms of heterosis resulting from hybridization is unknown. In this study, LC-MS/MS combined with TMT tags were used for comparative proteomics analyses of the broodstock populations (Dianshan, DS) and hybrid offspring (DS female x CD [Changjiang, CJ male x Dongting, DT female], SCD) in M. nipponense. A total of 57 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, of which 35 proteins were up-regulated and 22 proteins were down-regulated. The results showed that the 57 differential proteins correspond to three functional types, including 431 biological processes, 458 cellular components and 762 molecular functions. KEGG pathway analyses identified growth- and immunity-related pathways, including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (ko00250), arginine biosynthesis (ko00220), arginine and proline metabolism (ko00330), hippo (ko04390), apoptosis (ko04215), p53 (ko04115) and complement system (ko04610). The expression of genes encoding the differentially expressed proteins were verified using real-time quantitative PCR, and the results showed that the hybrid population was superior to the parent population in terms of growth and immunity. This study provided important data for genetic and breeding research of Macrobrachium nipponense.

AB  - Lead exposure is a significant health concern, ranking among the top 10 most harmful substances for humans. There are no safe levels of lead exposure, and it affects multiple body systems, especially the cardiovascular and neurological systems, leading to problems such as hypertension, heart disease, cognitive deficits, and developmental delays, particularly in children. Gender differences are a crucial factor, with women's reproductive systems being especially vulnerable, resulting in fertility issues, pregnancy complications, miscarriages, and premature births. The globalization of lead exposure presents new challenges in managing this issue. Therefore, understanding the gender-specific implications is essential for developing effective treatments and public health strategies to mitigate the impact of lead-related health problems. This study examined the effects of intermittent and permanent lead exposure on both male and female animals, assessing behaviours like anxiety, locomotor activity, and long-term memory, as well as molecular changes related to astrogliosis. Additionally, physiological and autonomic evaluations were performed, focusing on baro- and chemoreceptor reflexes. The study's findings revealed that permanent lead exposure has more severe health consequences, including hypertension, anxiety, and reactive astrogliosis, affecting both genders. However, males exhibit greater cognitive, behavioural, and respiratory changes, while females are more susceptible to chemoreflex hypersensitivity. In contrast, intermittent lead exposure leads to hypertension and reactive astrogliosis in both genders. Still, females are more vulnerable to cognitive impairment, increased respiratory frequency, and chemoreflex hypersensitivity, while males show more reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus. Overall, this research emphasizes the importance of not only investigating different types of lead exposure but also considering gender differences in toxicity when addressing this public health concern.

AB  - Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with no effective treatment available currently. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is emerging as a promising neuromodulation technique to treat autism. However, the mechanism how rTMS works remains unclear, which restrict the clinical application of magnetic stimulation in the autism treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of low -frequency rTMS on the autistic -like symptoms and explored if this neuroprotective effect was associated with synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. A rat model of autism was established by intraperitoneal injection of valproic acid (VPA) in pregnant rats and male offspring were treated with 1 Hz rTMS daily for two weeks continuously. Behavior tests were performed to identify behavioral abnormality. Synaptic plasticity was measured by in vivo electrophysiological recording and Golgi-Cox staining. Synapse and inflammation associated proteins were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. Results showed prenatal VPA-exposed rats exhibited autistic -like and anxiety -like behaviors, and cognitive impairment. Synaptic plasticity deficits and the abnormality expression of synapse -associated proteins were found in the hippocampus of prenatal VPAexposed rats. Prenatal VPA exposure increased the level of inflammation cytokines and promoted the excessive activation of microglia. rTMS significantly alleviated the prenatal VPA-induced abnormalities including behavioral and synaptic plasticity deficits, and excessive neuroinflammation. TMS maybe a potential strategy for autism therapy via rescuing synaptic plasticity and inhibiting neuroinflammation.

AB  - Pre-trained models like FourCastNet, Pangu and GraphCast have gained popularity in the meteorological field. In hydrology, data-driven rainfall-runoff models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have been successfully applied for various purposes. As large-sample hydrological datasets (e.g., Caravan) continue to grow, it is foreseeable that pre-trained models tailored for hydrology will emerge. These pre-trained models have the potential to bypass the need for training data-driven models from scratch, enabling us to focus more swiftly on customized applications. Additionally, they offer opportunities explore model performance in changing environment, which is also a key consideration when using data-driven models in unseen scenarios. However, the hydrological field has seen limited attempts to employ, transfer, and fine-tune pre-trained models. This study aims to explore the possibility of using fine-tuning techniques to achieve a smooth transition of LSTM-based rainfall-runoff models from pre-training to post-application scenarios. By utilizing ERA5-Land reanalysis precipitation data within the Caravan dataset, we calibrated a pre-trained LSTM model for runoff simulation. Subsequently, we transitioned the model to use near-real-time satellite precipitation estimates as the input, targeting satellite-driven predictions. Our results show that fine-tuning parameters lead to improvements in various metrics, including the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and hydrological signature metrics such as high and low flows, compared to outcomes without parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning using locally calibrated models enhanced performance in 73.5% of the basins. In contrast, the results of fine-tuning regional models were mixed; while it benefited 55.1% of the basins, it also led to a deterioration in model performance in 44.9% of cases. This study is a pioneering exploration of the adaptability of LSTM models from pre-training to post-application. It also lays the groundwork for future investigations aimed at enhancing the adaptability of data-driven models to the impacts of changing environment.

AB  - Prenatal Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure (PTE) poses long-lasting neuropsychiatric risks, as evidenced by clinical and preclinical studies, yet the neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly defined. Emerging evidence implicates the neurolipidome, a critical mediator of neurodevelopment and endocannabinoid signaling, as a potential contributor. Here, we demonstrate that dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation sex-selectively ameliorates neurodevelopmental deficits induced by PTE in a Wistar rat model. Omega-3 supplementation reduced cognitive and emotional disturbances in male offspring and normalized many neuronal and neurochemical abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and ventral hippocampus. However, lipidomic analyses, regardless of omega-3 supplementation, uncovered pronounced, sex-specific PTE-induced disruptions in pathways critical for synaptic integrity and neurodevelopment, including those related to the endocannabinoid system. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between lipid metabolism and the endocannabinoid system in the context of PTE.

AB  - Background: Toxoplasma gondii is a very common zoonotic parasite in humans and animals worldwide. Human seroprevalence is high in some regions of Canada's North and is thought to be associated with the consumption of traditionally prepared country foods, such as caribou, walrus, ringed seal and beluga. While numerous studies have reported on the prevalence of T. gondii in these animals, in the general absence of felid definitive hosts in the North there has been considerable debate regarding the source of infection, particularly in marine mammals. It has been proposed that fish could be involved in this transmission. Aims: The objectives of the present study were to perform a targeted survey to determine the prevalence of T. gondii DNA in various tissues of anadromous Arctic charr sampled in Nunavik, Qu & eacute;bec, and to investigate the possible role of this commonly consumed fish in the transmission of infection to humans and marine mammals in Canada's North. Methods and Results: A total of 126 individual Arctic charr were sampled from several sites in Nunavik, and various tissues were tested for the presence of T. gondii DNA using PCR. Overall, 12 out of 126 (9.5%) Arctic charr tested in the present study were PCR-positive, as confirmed by DNA sequencing. Brain tissue was most commonly found to be positive, followed by heart tissue, while none of the dorsal muscle samples tested were positive. Conclusions: Although the presence of T. gondii DNA in brain and heart tissues of Arctic charr is very intriguing, infection in these fish, and their possible role in the transmission of this parasite to humans and marine mammals, will need to be confirmed using mouse bioassays. Arctic charr are likely exposed to T. gondii through the ingestion of oocysts transported by surface water and ocean currents from more southerly regions where the definitive felid hosts are more abundant. If infection in Arctic charr can be confirmed, it is possible that these fish could play an important role in the transmission of toxoplasmosis to Inuit, either directly through the consumption of raw fish or indirectly through the infection of fish-eating marine mammals harvested as country foods.

AB  - Comparative psychologists study cognition by characterizing the behavior of individual species and explicitly comparing behavior across species. We use the extensive comparative literature on transitive inference (TI) as a case study to evaluate four central methodological questions that continue to be debated in the field of comparative psychology: 1) Are contextual variables sufficient to explain species differences in cognition? 2) Can cognitive performance be accounted for by associative processes alone? 3) Can we determine the cognitive mechanisms by which animals solve tasks? and 4) What is the role of ecologically driven hypotheses in comparative psychology? Although contextual variables and associative processes undeniably influence choice behavior in TI tasks, neither is sufficient to explain all performance. Instead, multiple distinct cognitive mechanisms, including associative processes, logical inference, and spatial representations, can and do result in successful TI performance. TI is not a unitary task solved using a single mechanism; multiple processes are recruited, with their degree of involvement dependent on context, species, and evolutionary pressures. This suggests that rather than asking whether animals possess a certain cognitive ability, research should focus on differences in when and how species employ tools from what is often a reasonably similar cognitive toolbox. We join others who have proposed that a main goal of comparative psychology should be to determine how animals solve cognitive tasks, through minimizing and studying the influence of contextual variables, evaluating the contributions of associative processes, clearly characterizing and testing alternative cognitive mechanisms, and using strong evolutionary hypotheses to guide predictions.

AB  - This study explored the chemical and pharmacological mechanisms of Shao Yao Gan Cao decoction (SYGC) in the treatment of Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction (SOD) through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Quadrupole Exactive-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap HR-MS), network pharmacology, transcriptomics, molecular docking and in vivo experiments. First, we identified that SYGC improves SOD in guinea pigs by increased c-kit expression and decreased inflammation infiltration and ring muscle disorders. Then, a total of 649 SOD differential genes were found through RNA sequencing and mainly enriched in complement and coagulation cascades, the B cell receptor signaling pathway and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. By combining UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS with a network pharmacology study, 111 chemicals and a total of 52 common targets were obtained from SYGC in the treatment of SOD, which is also involved in muscle contraction, the B cell receptor signaling pathway and the complement system. Next, 20 intersecting genes were obtained among the PPI network, MCODE and ClusterOne analysis. Then, the molecular docking results indicated that four active compounds (glycycoumarin, licoflavonol, echinatin and homobutein) and three targets (AURKB, KIF11 and PLG) exerted good binding interactions, which are also related to the B cell receptor signaling pathway and the complement system. Finally, animal experiments were conducted to confirm the SYGC therapy effects on SOD and verify the 22 hub genes using RT-qPCR. This study demonstrates that SYGC confers therapeutic effects against an experimental model of SOD via regulating immune response and inflammation, which provides a basis for future research and clinical applications.

AB  - In a previous study, we used natural butterfly wings as a cell growth matrix for tissue engineering materials and found that the surface of different butterfly wings had different ultramicrostructures, which can affect the qualitative growth of cells and regulate cell growth, metabolism, and gene expression. However, the biocompatibility and biosafety of butterfly wings must be studied. In this study, we found that Sprague-Dawley rat dorsal root ganglion neurons could grow along the structural stripes of butterfly wings, and Schwann cells could normally attach to and proliferate on different species of butterfly wings. The biocompatibility and biosafety of butterfly wings were further examined through subcutaneous implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, intraperitoneal injection in Institute of Cancer Research mice, intradermal injection in rabbits, and external application to guinea pigs. Our results showed that butterfly wings did not induce toxicity, and all examined animals exhibited normal behaviors and no symptoms, such as erythema or edema. These findings suggested that butterfly wings possess excellent biocompatibility and biosafety and can be used as a type of tissue engineering material. This study was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Jiangsu Province of China (approval No. 20190303-18) on March 3, 2019.

AB  - Objective. We hypothesized that, in our REPRO_PL cohort, exposure to indoor allergens and lifestyle factors in early life are associated with risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis at ten years of age. Methods. We only examined children who had lived in the same house from birth. Children's exposure to tobacco smoke was assessed based on cotinine levels in urine. House dust samples were collected. Results. Higher Fel d1 concentration in house dust was associated with significantly higher risk of developing asthma at age 10 years (95% CI,10.87 to 20.93; p < 0.001). Frequent house cleaning was associated with development of atopic dermatitis (odds ratio 0.61; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.99; p = 0.045). Clustering of exposure to HDM revealed two types of environment. Cluster 1, defined as lower HDM (dust), in contrast to Cluster 2, defined as higher HDM, was characterized by old-type windows, lower fungus and dampness levels, as well as more frequent house cleaning. Conclusion. Exposure to cat allergens and new-type buildings that limit air flow while increasing the condensation of steam on the windows and thereby stimulating the growth of fungi are risk factors for the development of asthma.

AB  - This study used intra-hippocampal injections of Kainic Acid (KA) in Wistar rats to induce spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) after a 9-day latent period. A post-conditioning protocol with LPS, injected at the same site 72 h after the initial KA insult, was employed to trigger secondary competing processes. To evaluate the post- conditioning effect of LPS, 25 animals were divided into four groups: SAL-SAL (n = 6), KA-SAL (n = 6), SALLPS (n = 7), and KA-LPS (n = 6). SRS occurrence and seizure duration were quantified through video monitoring from days 9 to 17, along with other ictal behaviors, such as tail-chasing and wet-dog-shakes. Behavioral assessments revealed that the KA-LPS group had preserved sucrose preference and intact long-term memory in the object recognition test, indicating reduced depressive-like behavior and cognitive preservation compared to the KA-SAL group. The forced swim test showed increased depressive-like behavior in the SAL-LPS group, with LPS mitigating these effects in the KA group. The marble-burying test showed no significant differences among groups. Animals were euthanized on day 26, and hippocampal slices were analyzed using fluoro-jade staining for cell death and immunofluorescence staining for Iba-1 (microglia) and GFAP (astrocyte) labeling. The results support the hypothesis that epileptogenesis involves a cascade of plastic changes in neural networks and that precise, timely interventions can potentially interfere with this process.

AB  - Although bio-adhesives have achieved many progresses, creating robust bio-glues that could withstand the complex physiological microenvironment remains a significant challenge such as limited bioadhesion strength and stability, as well as slow adhesion speed caused by pH, enzymes, salt, and bacteria. Herein, a series of strong bio-glues are successfully fabricated using a polyphenol-acrylamide-ruthenium crosslinking (PARC) reaction under visible light irradiation, involving acrylamides radical polymerization, polyphenols (extracts) coupling reaction, and ruthenium-mediated photochemistry. The resulting bio-glues underwent rapid sol-gel transition and exhibited adhesive properties within a short of time (approximate to 5 s), which could quickly bond to various bio-tissues. Moreover, these bioadhesives demonstrate high adhesion strength and stability with mucosal tissue in the oral environment, effectively promoting rat and pig oral mucosal wound healing. It is anticipated that this class of visible light-responsive polyphenolic bio-glues could serve as a robust tool for addressing oral mucosal defects in the clinic, offering a promising alternative to traditional treatments for oral mucosal disorders.

AB  - The European aquaculture industry began to undertake Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) aquaculture in the 1980s due to the favorable growth rate and high market value of this cold-water marine fish. Atlantic halibut cultivation began in Chile in 1996 in the Magallanes region (53S). Chilean aquaculture facilities were finally equipped to begin rearing Atlantic halibut after 12 years and a total investment of $ 2 million USD. Infrastructure is now in place to manage the entire production cycle, including broodstock rearing, egg incubation, larval rearing (yolk-sac stage, first-feeding), weaning, the nursery stage, on-growing in land-based tanks, harvest, and marketing. The hatchery phase to produce 10-g juveniles requires 10-12 months, followed by an approximately 30-month grow-out phase in land-based tanks to produce 3-kg fish. Further research and development are being performed in nutrition (diet formulation), genetics (selection for disease resistance and growth rate), fish health, and environmental issues to support the development of a sustainable marine aquaculture industry for this species.

AB  - Bomb-produced radiocarbon (14C) was used to validate age estimates of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) using a stained otolith cross-section method. The Delta 14C in eastern Bering Sea (EBS) Greenland halibut otoliths was compared to both EBS and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) Pacific halibut (Hippoglossoides stenolepis) otolith reference chronologies to evaluate which reference chronology was most suitable, and to quantitatively estimate age determination bias. Using Bayesian analysis and a coupled-function model, the Delta 14C in the Greenland halibut showed greatest similarities to the Delta 14C in the GOA reference chronology. Although the model indicated under ageing, the bias was not large. Assigning an age less than the true age by more than a one year is about 73%, and less than the true age by more than 2 years is only about 25%. When considering the age at which Greenland halibut is only 7.5% of its maximum longevity (50+ years) and that the probability of underageing by 3 years being less than 5%, it is likely that between-age-reader variation will cancel out any systematic bias that exists in the age determination protocols. Prior to the use of stained cross-sections the maximum age was 38 years, now a maximum age of 53 years is supported.

AB  - This essay analyzes a robust body of C and N stable isotopes from human and animal collagen and plant remains (n = 423) in the area of Lower Yangtze River dating to 8000-4300 cal. BP, combined with new isotopic data recovered from the Zhelin site in Shanghai, to explore the dietary differences between coastal region and the inland core area of the Liangzhu culture (5300-4300 cal. BP). Our findings suggest that the food variety of the peripheral inhabitants of the core area of the Liangzhu culture may became less diverse over time, while at the same time their reliance on a few domesticated species (rice and pigs) increased. It may be a result of the growing economic and cultural influence of the populations in the inland core Liangzhu area.

AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) is an essential neurotransmitter for the refined organization of the cerebral cortex. Studies have suggested that altered serotonin signaling contributes to cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders. However, the exact role of this neurotransmitter on the development of hippocampal neurons is not recognized. Here we aimed to examine the effects of the para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 100 mg/kg/daily, s.c. during the postnatal days 10-20), a reversible inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis, on the serotonin level of the hippocampal and prefrontal cortex. We also focused on the morphology of the neurons in the hippocampus and spatial learning and memory. Our results indicated that the administration of PCPA led to a decrease in serotonin levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Postnatal serotonin depletion also induced subtle alterations in the neuronal populations of the hippocampus and impaired spatial memory in the adulthood period of life. We found that critical developmental periods of serotonin depletion caused degeneration and swelling of neurons as well as significant neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) areas. Thus, serotonin, a strikingly important neurotransmitter, can affect neuronal morphology, development, and hippocampal-dependent memory.

AB  - Antidepressants (ADs) are, for now, the best everyday treatment we have for moderate to severe major depressive episodes (MDEs). ADs are among the most prescribed drugs in the Western Hemisphere; however, the trial-and-error prescription strategy and side-effects leave a lot to be desired. More than 60% of patients suffering from major depression fail to respond to the first AD they are prescribed. For those who respond, full response is only observed after several weeks of treatment. In addition, there are no biomarkers that could help with therapeutic decisions; meanwhile, this is already true in cancer and other fields of medicine. For years, many investigators have been working to decipher the underlying mechanisms of AD response. Here, we provide the first systematic review of animal models. We thoroughly searched all the studies involving rodents, profiling transcriptomic alterations consecutive to AD treatment in naive animals or in animals subjected to stress-induced models of depression. We have been confronted by an important heterogeneity regarding the drugs and the experimental settings. Thus, we perform a meta-analysis of the AD signature of fluoxetine (FLX) in the hippocampus, the most studied target. Among genes and pathways consistently modulated across species, we identify both old players of AD action and novel transcriptional biomarker candidates that warrant further investigation. We discuss the most prominent transcripts (immediate early genes and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity pathways). We also stress the need for systematic studies of AD action in animal models that span across sex, peripheral and central tissues, and pharmacological classes.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper introduces a new method of finding the best locations to place video cameras inside large cattle barns to monitor the behavior and health of the animals. Current approaches to livestock video monitoring rely on mounting cameras in the most convenient places for installation, but those locations might either be impractical for actual barns and/or might not capture the best views. This work showed that there is short list of the best placement options for the cameras to choose from which will provide the best camera views. Computer vision has been extensively used for livestock welfare monitoring in recent years, and data collection with a sensor or camera is the first part of the complete workflow. While current practice in computer vision-based animal welfare monitoring often analyzes data collected from a sensor or camera mounted on the roof or ceiling of a laboratory, such camera placement is not always viable in a commercial confined cattle feeding environment. This study therefore sought to determine the optimal camera placement locations in a confined steer feeding operation. Measurements of cattle pens were used to create a 3D farm model using Blender 3D computer graphic software. In the first part of this study, a method was developed to calculate the camera coverage in a 3D farm environment, and in the next stage, a genetic algorithm-based model was designed for finding optimal placements of a multi-camera and multi-pen setup. The algorithm's objective was to maximize the multi-camera coverage while minimizing budget. Two different optimization methods involving multiple cameras and pen combinations were used. The results demonstrated the applicability of the genetic algorithm in achieving the maximum coverage and thereby enhancing the quality of the livestock visual-sensing data. The algorithm also provided the top 25 solutions for each camera and pen combination with a maximum coverage difference of less than 3.5% between them, offering numerous options for the farm manager.

AB  - Neuroinflammation not only contributes to epileptogenesis and neurodegeneration, but is also associated with cognitive impairment. Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomemediated neuroinflammation is positively correlated with progression of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and cognitive impairment. Recent studies have shown that the anti-aging protein, klotho, exerts antineuroinflammation effects and enhances cognition in neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of klotho action in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation in a TLE model. Specifically, we first injected an adeno-associated viral (AAV)mediated overexpression of klotho (AAV-KL) into the bilateral hippocampus of rats. After 3 weeks, rats were intraperitoneally injected with lithium-chloride pilocarpine (LiCl-Pilo) to generate a TLE model. Results showed that klotho was significantly downregulated six weeks after TLE, while AAV-mediated klotho overexpression substantially attenuated TLE-induced hippocampal neuronal injury and cognitive impairment. Interestingly, klotho overexpression significantly alleviated expression of NLRP3, IL-18, and caspase-1 proteins, but up-regulated activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). However, treatment with Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 significantly reversed klotho's beneficial effects, including alleviated neuroinflammation, attenuated neuronal injury, and improved cognitive function. Taken together, these results indicated that klotho alleviated NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in the TLE rat model, suggesting that this the anti-aging protein could be a novel and promising therapeutic agent for managing TLE-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), a leading cause of disability in young adults, often results from external forces that damage the brain. Cellularly, mTBI induces oxidative stress, characterized by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and diminished antioxidant capacity. This redox imbalance disrupts hippocampal glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity, where NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are crucial. The exocyst, a vesicle tethering complex, is implicated in glutamate receptor trafficking. We previously showed that Exo70, a key exocyst subunit, redistributes within synapses and increases its interaction with the NMDAR subunit GluN2B following mTBI, suggesting a role in GluN2B distribution from synaptic to extrasynaptic sites. This study investigated whether Exo70 could mitigate mTBI pathology by modulating NMDAR trafficking under elevated oxidative stress. Using a modified Maryland mTBI mouse model, we overexpressed Exo70 in CA1 pyramidal neurons via lentiviral transduction. Exo70 overexpression prevented mTBI-induced cognitive impairment, assessed by the Morris water maze. Moreover, these mice exhibited basal and NMDAR-dependent hippocampal synaptic transmission comparable to sham animals, preventing mTBI-induced deterioration. Preserved long-term potentiation, abundant synaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs, and downstream signaling indicated that Exo70 overexpression prevented mTBI-related alterations. Our findings highlight Exo70's crucial role in NMDAR trafficking, potentially counteracting oxidative stress effects. The exocyst complex may be a critical component of the machinery regulating NMDAR distribution in health and disease, particularly in pathologies featuring oxidative stress and NMDAR dysfunction, like mTBI.

AB  - Southern elephant seal (SES) and Antarctic fur seal (AFS) are short Southern Ocean food web top predators and are spatial and temporal trend bioindicators of Antarctic Hg bioavailability. Hg, stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and trophic position (TP) regarding sex were determined using lanugo samples from Antarctic pin-nipeds pups (SES n = 35 and AFS n = 11). Hg concentrations in over 50% of the SES pups (mean 5.9 +/- 3.1 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) are compatible with those found to cause neurologic damage to polar bears in the Arctic. No significant differences regarding sexes for SES or AFS are found based on mean Hg concentrations normalized by body weight. delta N-15 values and TPs are similar among both species, indicating that gestating SES and AFS mothers feed at the same trophic level. Significantly different delta C-13 values were found, indicating distinct feeding grounds for mothers belonging to both species when pup lanugo is formed in utero; while SES females like to feed in Antarctic waters, AFS females remain in sub-Antarctic waters. The differences in Hg and delta C-13 observed for both species reflect not only contrasting feeding habits and anthropogenic Hg inputs, but also maternal foraging strategies.

AB  - There is limited research into horse slaughter, particularly ante mortem welfare, and the effectiveness of captive-bolt gun (CBG) stunning, despite this being a widely used method worldwide. To address this evidence gap and explore associations between ante and post mortem factors, the welfare of 62 horses was assessed at a commercial Italian abattoir. Animal-based measures were used to identify stress-related behaviours and stunning effectiveness. A sub-sample (44%; 27/62) of heads were assessed for gross brain pathology. All animals in the study showed stress-related behaviours at all stages of the slaughter process. Additionally, 53% (33/62) of horses slipped in the stunning box, with poor floor surface condition and use of force associated with this. At least one sign of an ineffective stun was observed in 22% (14/62) of animals. Six animals were shot twice, with the application of a second shot significantly associated with a higher stress behaviour index score in the stunning box. Damage to critical brainstem structures was found in 85% (23/27) of heads that were assessed with gross pathology. An absence of damage to critical brainstem structures meant that animals were ten times more likely to show signs of ineffective stunning. These results highlight the risks to equine welfare throughout the slaughter process and suggest that mitigating ante mortem stress could improve stunning effectiveness, whilst CBG usage should be refined to ensure that critical brainstem structures are targeted.

AB  - Identifying and monitoring parturition of individual animals may help producers increase attentiveness, enabling early detection of dystocia during parturition. Parturition events are marked by subtle behavioral changes often difficult to detect by observation alone. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of tri-axial accelerometer data to accurately identify and predict parturition-related behavior of mature ewes in a pen setting. Triaxial accelerometers recording at 12.5 Hz were placed on ear tags and attached to 13 Debouillet mature ewes before parturition. Activity was monitored 7 days prior to lambing (d -7); on the day of lambing (d 0); and 7 days post lambing (d +7). Using random forest machine learning, accelerometer data and visual observations were used to predict (i) seven mutually-exclusive behaviors; and (ii) activity (active and inactive behavior) based on five metrics calculated using variation of movements recorded by the accelerometer. The accuracy of seven predicted behaviors from an independent validation set was 66.7 %, and the accuracy for activity was 87.2 %. In addition to predicted behavior and activity, metrics calculated from accelerometer data and used for random forest predictions were evaluated 7 d before and after lambing and 12 h before and after lambing on six of the 13 ewes where the actual time of lambing was observed. No differences were detected in the seven predicted behaviors either before or after lambing. Four of five accelerometer metrics (P < 0.002) were higher during the 7 d after lambing than the 7 d before lambing. Values for three of the five metrics were highest (P < 0.01) on the day of lambing. All five accelerometer metrics varied during the 12 h pre- and 12 h post parturition (P < 0.004). All accelerometer metrics increased (P < 0.008) 1?2 h before parturition compared to 3?4 h before parturition. In this current study, calculated direct sensor metrics served as a better indicator of lambing than predicted behaviors, processed through complex machine learning algorithms. Commercial use of accelerometers by producers may allow for detection of prolonged labor indicating potential dystocia during parturition, which may reduce lamb mortality and increase production efficiency. These results suggest that real time accelerometers could remotely monitor ewes and potentially provide managers an indication that the dam may lamb soon.

AB  - Continuous chemotherapy pressure-elicited annexin-A6 (ANXA6)-containing exosome (ANXA6-exo) secretion contributes to paclitaxel (PTX) resistance in breast cancer (BC), but the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. The present study managed to investigate this issue and found that ANXA6-exo promoted PTX resistance and cancer progression in BC cells in a Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)-dependent manner. Specifically, the parental PTX-sensitive BC (PS-BC) cells were exposed to continuous low-dose PTX to generate PTX-resistant BC (PR-BC) cells, and we found that BC stem cells tended to be enriched in the descendent PR-BC cells in contrast with the PS-BC cells. In addition, PR-BC cell-derived exosomes were featured with highly expressed ANXA6, and ANXA6-exo delivered ANXA6 to promote cell migration, growth, autophagy, and stemness in PS-BC cells. Interestingly, ANXA6-exo increased PTX resistance in PS-BC cells via inducing autophagy, and the effects of ANXA6-exo on PTX resistance in PS-BC cells were abrogated by co-treating cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms were uncovered, and we evidenced that ANXA6-exo up-regulated YAP1 to promote Hippo pathway dysregulation, and the promoting effects of ANXA6-exo on PTX resistance and cancer aggressiveness in BC cells were abrogated by silencing YAP1. Taken together, this study firstly elucidated the underlying mechanisms by which BCSC-derived ANXA6-exo facilitated BC progression and PTX resistance, which might help to develop novel treatment strategies for BC in clinic.

AB  - Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are sold primarily for traditional medicine (TM) uses in Southeast Asia. Although Malaysia is reportedly an important global seahorse exporter, documentation on the current extent of seahorse catch and trade of seahorse-based TM within the country is limited. This study aimed to quantify patterns of seahorse bycatch, gear-specific biological parameters of caught seahorses, and trade characteristics in Malaysia. Questionnaire-based fisher and TM surveys were administered nationwide from March 2021 to March 2023. Seventy-one percent of fisher respondents (612 out of 860) reported catching seahorses, with gill or drift net fishers (73 %) more likely to have caught seahorses than trawlers (12 %). Significant spatial differences in species composition was observed between Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo (Sabah state). The total estimated annual seahorse catch within Malaysia was approximately 3376 kg per year, with 77 % of the catch attributed to gill or drift nets and 23 % to trawling operations. Almost half (40 %) of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners/ traders (n = 138), 3 % of Malay TM practitioners (n = 3), and 88 % of other TM traders (n = 7) reported selling seahorse species. This study is one of the first to quantify the often overlooked but critical contribution of small-scale fisheries, especially gill and drift nets, towards seahorse bycatch. The current supply volume and selling price of seahorses were observed to be relatively high, while the present-day demand was reportedly low. Almost half of TCM practitioners/ traders interviewed were still actively selling seahorses, indicating that there is still considerable demand. To ensure the sustainability of seahorse populations in Malaysia, efforts in both small-scale and trawl fisheries must be reduced while strictly enforcing seahorse trade regulations.

AB  - Mammalian Ste20-like kinase 2 (MST2) is a core component of the Hippo pathway and plays an important role in regulating cell apoptosis, cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, but it has rarely been studied in in-vertebrates, especially crustaceans. In this study, the MST2 gene in penaeus japonicus shrimp was characterized. A 2111 bp long nucleotide sequence encoding 690 amino acids was obtained. The molecular weight of MST2 protein is 78.47222 kDa. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that the MST2 protein has an S_TK-c (Ser/Thr kinase) domain and a SARAH (Salvador/Ras-association domain family/Hippo) domain, which is consistent with other species. The analysis of subcellular localization showed that MST2 was mainly present in the cytoplasm. Real time PCR and apoptosis analysis indicated that MST2 was involved in the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection process and inhibited viral infection by promoting apoptosis. This study revealed the potential function of MST2 in virus invasion and cell apoptosis, providing a new target for preventing shrimp virus infection.

AB  - Objective Lipofection-mediated introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in porcine zygotes provides a simple method for gene editing, without requiring micromanipulation. However, the gene editing efficiency is inadequate. The aim of this study was to improve the lipofection-mediated gene editing efficiency by optimizing the timing and duration of lipofection. Results Zona pellucida (ZP)-free zygotes collected at 5, 10, and 15 h from the start of in vitro fertilization (IVF) were incubated with lipofection reagent, guide RNA (gRNA) targeting GGTA1, and Cas9 for 5 h. Lipofection of zygotes collected at 10 and 15 h from the start of IVF yielded mutant blastocysts. Next, ZP-free zygotes collected at 10 h from the start of IVF were incubated with lipofection reagent, gRNA, and Cas9 for 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 h. The blastocyst formation rate of zygotes treated for 20 h was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the other groups, and no mutant blastocysts were obtained. Moreover, the mutation rates of the resulting blastocysts decreased as the incubation time increased. In conclusion, a lipofection-mediated gene editing system using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in ZP-zygotes is feasible; however, further improvements in the gene editing efficiency are required.

AB  - In previous studies, there was a limited comprehension of the interactions and synergistic migration behaviors among K, Na, and F, which substantially affect the softening-melting properties of iron ores containing these elements. To bridge this knowledge gap, our research calculated the thermodynamically stable temperature ranges for compounds of K, Na, and F, observed the distribution of these elements at specific temperatures to elucidate their interactions, and investigated the underlying mechanisms governing their microscopic synergistic migration behaviors. The results indicated that K2O and Na2O were reduced to produce alkali metal vapor at 1100 K and 1300 K, respectively, which interacted with CaF2 to form alkali metal fluorides. Na+, with a lower standard electrode potential, migrated alongside F- towards metallic iron through a dual electrode reaction. K was predominantly found within the w & uuml;stite and slag phases, with a gradual transition into the gas phase beyond 1400 K. As the temperature increased to 1713 K, FeF2 begun to gasify, leading to the evaporation of F from metallic iron into the gas phase or its absorption by the slag. Consequently, F was excluded from the pig iron produced in the blast furnace process. This study provides a deeper understanding of the interactions and microscopic synergistic migration behaviors of K, Na, and F, offering a theoretical foundation for the smelting of special ores containing these elements.

AB  - Odor nuisance is a major impediment for public acceptance and wider implementation of biogas plants. Knowledge on composition and dynamics of emissions from these plants is highly needed for development of robust mitigation solutions. In this study, odorant emissions were investigated from two biogas plants of different sizes and capacities. Measurements using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) revealed that hydrogen sulfide was the main odorant and constituted 82% and 71% of the odor activity sums (SOAV) at the two studied plants, respectively. Long-term time-resolved measurements furthermore revealed that emissions were highly dynamic with distinct short-term emission peaks. By deploying an array of electrochemical sensors, the main sources of hydrogen sulfide emission were subsequently identified and correlated with operational data to identify the major causes for the highly fluctuating emissions. Addition of biomasses in the form of animal slurry to pre-tanks, were shown to be the major cause of periodic hydrogen sulfide emission within the range of 50-1200 ppm. Such hydrogen sulfide peak emissions could challenge odor abatement from biogas plants and should be taken into account when designing odor abatement technologies for biogas plants.

AB  - In this study, the drying behavior and quality of the dried leaves of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) of the 'Rayong 5' cultivar from Thailand were investigated. An increase in the drying temperature resulted in an increased drying rate and a reduction in drying time. The Page model provided the best fit for describing the drying characteristics of cassava leaves, with the entire drying process occurring in the falling rate period. The results showed that cyanide content was sensitive to high temperatures, with drying at 80 degrees C being the most effective method for toxin elimination. Prolonged drying periods lead to the degradation of vitamin C. Drying cassava leaves at 50-80 degrees C did not significantly affect beta-carotene levels. However, lutein, chlorophyll-a, and chlorophyll-b were reduced after drying. The drying processes did not change the crude proteins content but increased the levels of histidine, alanine, and aspartic acid. In this study, high-temperature, short-time drying was identified as the optimal condition for detoxification, maintaining nutrients, and preserving the color of dried cassava leaves.

AB  - Maternal gut microbiome impairment has garnered attention for its potential role in influencing neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring, especially in situations that increase brain vulnerability such as perinatal asphyxia (PA). Maternal microbiome and fetal brain interplay emerge as a critical link between maternal health and offspring neurodevelopment. This study aims to generate a model to assess the impact of maternal dysbiosis triggered by gestational antibiotic administration and PA on offspring neurodevelopment. Wistar rats were subjected to antibiotics in drinking water from the 11th gestational day until birth. On the 6th postnatal day, pups were subjected to PA/normoxia, resulting in four experimental groups: control-normoxia, antibiotics-normoxia, control- asphyxia, and antibiotics-asphyxia. Early-life behavioral tests were conducted between postnatal days 7 and 9. The initial antimicrobial cocktail (ampicillin, vancomycin, neomycin, clindamycin, amphotericin-B) led to an increased number of miscarriages, poor weight gain during pregnancy, reduced offspring weight, and changes in the maternal gut microbiome compared to control. Offspring presented impaired neurodevelopmental reflexes in both PA and antibiotic groups and increased hippocampal neuroinflammation. Due to these detrimental effects, a more pregnancy-safe antibiotic cocktail was used for a second experiment (ampicillin, vancomycin, neomycin, meropenem). This resulted in no miscarriages or pregnancy-weight loss but was still linked to gut microbiome disruption. PA impaired neurodevelopmental reflexes and increased neuroinflammation, effects amplified by antibiotic administration. These preliminary findings reveal the cumulative potential of maternal dysbiosis and PA on neurodevelopment impairment, emphasizing caution in gestational antimicrobial use. Further investigations should include offspring long-term follow-up and maternal behavior and integrate probiotics to counteract antibiotic effects. Lay summary This study investigates the impact of maternal gut microbiome disruptions caused by gestational antibiotic treatment and low oxygen exposure shortly after birth on the development of the rats' babies. We found that both antibiotic exposure and reduced oxygen levels led to changes in early behavior and increased inflammation of the nervous tissue in the baby rats. Although using a different, potentially safer antibiotic combination reduced pregnancy complications, it still changed the bacteria in the mother's gut and worsened early behavior. These findings show that antibiotics during pregnancy can affect the developing brain of baby rats and careful consideration should be used before prescribing them. Future research will explore longer-term effects and potential medicines.

AB  - Background. Intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) is short-course administration of allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT). This study is aimed at assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of ILIT in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods. MEDLINE, PUBMED, and Cochrane Library were used to conduct electronic searches for clinical trials comparing ILIT and placebo in patients with AR. The final search took place on August 24, 2022. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. The outcomes included combined symptom and medication scores (CSMS), visual analog scale (VAS), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life (RQLQ), Skin-prick test (SPT), and adverse events (AEs). Data were synthesized as mean difference (MD)/standard mean difference (SMD) or risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results. Thirteen studies (454 participants) were included in this study. The ILIT group had better clinical improvement on the CSMS (random effects model, SMD-0.85, 95% CI [-1.58,-0.11], P = 0.02) and RQLQ (fixed-effects model, MD-0.42, 95% CI [0.69, 0.15], P = 0.003) than the placebo group. The booster injection was beneficial for CSMS (P < 0.0001), and the 4-week injection interval was superior to the 2-week injection period for improving VAS (P < 0.0001). Local swelling or erythema was the main AE following injection (random effects model, RD 0.16, 95% CI [0.05, 0.27], P = 0.005). Discussion. For individuals with AR, ILIT is safe and effective. ILIT alleviates clinical symptoms and reduces pharmaceutical consumption without causing severe AEs. However, the validity of this study is compromised by the substantial heterogeneity and risk of bias in the included researches. Registration CRD42022355329.

AB  - Rates of arteriovenous fistula maturation failure are still high, especially when suboptimal size veins are used. During successful maturation, the vein undergoes lumen dilatation and medial thickening, adapting to the increased hemodynamic forces. The vascular extracellular matrix plays an important role in regulating these adaptive changes and may be a target for promoting fistula maturation. In this study, we tested whether a device-enabled photochemical treatment of the vein prior to fistula creation facilitates maturation. Sheep cephalic veins were treated using a balloon catheter coated by a photoactivatable molecule (10-8-10 Dimer) and carrying an internal light fiber. As a result of the photochemical reaction, new covalent bonds were created during light activation among oxidizable amino acids of the vein wall matrix proteins. The treated vein lumen diameter and media area became significantly larger than the contralateral control fistula vein at 1 week (p = 0.035 and p = 0.034, respectively). There was also a higher percentage of proliferating smooth muscle cells in the treated veins than in the control veins (p = 0.029), without noticeable intimal hyperplasia. To prepare for the clinical testing of this treatment, we performed balloon over-dilatation of isolated human veins and found that veins can tolerate up to 66% overstretch without notable histological damage.

AB  - The pesticide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) has neurotoxic effects, but its mechanism is not clear. In this study, a 2,4-D (75 mg/kg. b.w) exposure model was established in SD rats with colostrum. Lipopolysaccharide (1 mg/kg b.w) was used as the positive control, and Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP, 50 mg/kg b.w) was used as an intervention factor to explore the neurotoxic effect of 2,4-D and the neuroprotective effect of LBP. Our research results show that 2,4-D causes a decrease in the number of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells and pyknosis in nuclei with a triangular or irregular shape and that rats show signs of anxiety or depression. In rat serum, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activity decreased, while malondialdehyde content increased. Protein and mRNA levels of TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-18, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1 beta, IL-18, and p62 increased, while those of LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 decreased in hippocampal tissues. In conclusion, 2,4-D increased the oxidative stress level, induced neuroinflammatory response, and decreased the autophagy level in experimental rats. LBP may have upregulated the autophagy level in the body by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus playing a neuroprotective role.

AB  - Simple Summary The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the main part of the animal digestive system and the morphological and histological traits of the GIT enable species to perform specific functions that enhance the species' adaptability to their environments. The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) is the subterranean herbivorous rodent in the alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The species spends most of their life in closed, underground tunnel systems with lower levels of oxygen, and mainly forage the plants' roots. This study used comparative anatomy methods to compare the morphological and histological traits of the GIT of both the plateau zokor and the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae), a small, fossorial lagomorph which forages aboveground plant parts, in order to clarify the traits of the plateau zokor's GIT and to understand its adaptations to high-fiber foods. Our results showed that the plateau zokor eats abundant, high-fiber foods in the underground tunnel environments, and the specialized morphology and histological structure of the plateau zokor's GIT provides a favorable guarantee for it to adapt to the energy pressures of high-fiber digestion in harsh environments. The morphological and histological traits of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) enable the animal to perform some specific functions that enhance the species' adaptability to environments. The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) is a subterranean rodent that mainly forages on plant roots in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but little is known about the mechanism by which the plateau zokor digests roots that have high fiber contents. In this study, we used comparative anatomy methods to compare the morphological and histological traits of the GIT of both the plateau zokor and the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae), a small, fossorial lagomorph that forages aboveground plant parts, in order to clarify the traits of the plateau zokor's GIT and to understand its adaptations to high-fiber foods. The results showed that the foods which plateau zokors eat have a higher fiber content than those which the plateau pikas eat. The plateau zokor has a double-chambered and hemi-glandular stomach (the tubular glands are only in the gastric corpus II, and the gastric fundus is keratinized), whereas the plateau pika has a simple, wholly glandular stomach. The gross morphological indicators (organ index and relative length) of the GIT were significantly lower in the plateau zokor than they were in the plateau pika (p < 0.001). However, the thickness of the gastric corpus II mucosal layer and the gastric fundus muscle layer are significantly higher in the plateau zokor than they are in the plateau pika (p < 0.001), and the thickness of each layer of intestinal tissue is higher in the plateau zokor than it is in the plateau pika. Additionally, the small intestinal villi also are higher and wider in the plateau zokor than they are in the plateau pika. Our results suggest that instead of adapting to digest the high-fiber diet by expanding the size of the GIT, the plateau zokor has evolved a complex stomach and a well-developed gastrointestinal histological structure, and that these specialized GIT structures are consistent with an optimal energy-economy evolutionary adaptation strategy.

AB  - The sigma-1 receptor (sigma 1R) is a stress-activated chaperone protein that has emerged as a significant therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders. Developing effective positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes targeting sigma 1R is crucial for visualizing its distribution and function in the brain, as well as facilitating related drug development. In this study, two novel C-11-labeled PET probes based on the structure of a potent sigma 1R ligand Lan-0101 are designed and synthesized. PET imaging studies in mice reveal that [C-11]CNY-01 exhibits good brain uptake and binding specificity. Subsequent evaluation in non-human primates further demonstrates that [C-11]CNY-01 displays favorable brain penetration, slow clearance kinetics, and characteristics of irreversible binding to its target in blockage experiments. To assess the clinical potential of the probe, both in vitro experiments and in vivo PET imaging using [C-11]CNY-01 are conducted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mouse models. These studies reveal a significant decrease in sigma 1R expression in the brain under conditions of AD amyloid pathology and microglial activation, highlighting the probe's sensitivity to disease-related receptor changes.

AB  - Exercise provides a range of cognitive benefits, including improved memory performance. Previously, we demonstrated that 14 days of continuous voluntary wheel-running exercise enables learning in a hippocampusdependent Object Location Memory (OLM) task under insufficient, subthreshold training conditions in adult mice. Whether similar exercise benefits can be obtained from consistent intermittent exercise as continuous exercise is unknown. Here, we examine whether intermittent exercise (the weekend warrior effect: 2 days of exercise a week for 7 weeks) displays similar or distinct cognitive benefits as previously examined with 14 days of continuous exercise. We find that both continuous and intermittent exercise parameters similarly enable hippocampus-dependent OLM compared to the 2-day exercise control group. Mice receiving intermittent exercise maintained cognitive benefits following a 7-day sedentary delay, whereas mice that underwent 14 continuous days of exercise showed diminished cognitive benefits as previously reported. Further, compared to continuous exercise, intermittent exercise mice exhibited persistently elevated levels of the genes Acvr1c and Bdnf which we know to be critically involved in hippocampus-dependent long-term memory in the dorsal hippocampus. Together findings suggest that consistent intermittent exercise persistently enables hippocampal-dependent longterm memory. Understanding the optimal parameters for persistent cognitive function and the mechanisms mediating persistent effects will aid in therapeutic pursuits investigating the mitigation of cognitive ailments.

AB  - Simple Summary The abuse of antibiotics leads to the drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria, which greatly threatens the safety of humans and animals. Novel immunoregulatory approaches with safety and effectiveness that promote antimicrobial function and enhance immune response, thus, should be developed as replacements for antibiotics. A recombinant yeast that can express two functional molecules (pig IL-17 and IL-22) was constructed and designated as Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22. To evaluate the immunoregulatory activities of the recombinant yeast, Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22 was orally fed to 4-week-old female BALB/c mice and then challenged with virulent Salmonella typhimurium. Mucosal, cellular, and humoral immunity were determined by measuring immunoglobulin levels, concentration of cytokines, and the counts of T lymphocytes. The results showed that Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22 treated mice had stronger immune responses and resistance to bacterial infection. The subsequent oral inoculation of piglets with Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22 confirmed that Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22 obviously improved the growth performance and systemic immunity of piglets. The results above indicated that Po1h-pINA1297-IL17/22 could be developed as a promising immunopotentiator to prevent bacterial infections by promotion of immune responses. Drug resistance in economic animals to pathogens is a matter of widespread concern due to abuse of antibiotics. In order to develop a safe and economical immunopotentiator to raise the immunity and antibacterial response as a replacement for antibiotics, a recombinant yeast co-expressing pig interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22 was constructed and designated as Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22. To evaluate the immunoregulator activities of Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22, two experiment groups (oral inoculation with Po1h-pINA1297 or Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22) and a negative control group (PBS) were set up using 4-week-old female BALB/c mice (10/group). The level of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma, were detected by ELISA, and the circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry. The IgG and secretory IgA (SIgA) levels in both small intestine and fecal matter were also measured by ELISA. The results indicated that the IgG antibody titer and SIgA concentration increased significantly in the Po1h-pINA1297-IL17/22 group in comparison with the controls (p < 0.05) and so did the cytokine levels in the serum (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma). In addition, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also obviously elevated in the Po1h-pINA1297-IL17/22 group on 35th day (p < 0.05). After challenge with pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium, the Po1h-pINA1297-IL17/22 group showed a relatively higher survival rate without obvious infectious symptoms. On the contrary, the mortality of control group reached 80% due to bacterial infection. As for the piglet experiment, 30 healthy 7-day piglets were similarly attributed into three groups. The oral inoculation of piglets with Po1h-pINA1297-IL17/22 also markedly improved the growth performance and systemic immunity (up-regulations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-15, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23). Overall, the results indicated that Po1h-pINA1297-IL17/22 effectively promoted the humoral and cellular immunity against bacterial infection. These proved the promising potential of Po1h-pINA1297-IL-17/22 to be a potent immunopotentiator for the prevention of microbial pathogen infections.

AB  - Glioma is one of the most common primary intracranial carcinomas and typically associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life. The identification of novel oncogenes is clinically valuable for early screening and prevention. Recently, the studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of cancers including glioma. The expression of lncRNA FAM66C is reduced in glioma cell lines and clinical samples compared to non-tumor samples. Knockdown of FAM66C in U87 and U251 cells significantly promoted cell proliferation and migration, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation between FAM66C and Hippo pathway regulators YAP1 and LATS1, along with the alteration of their protein expression level indicated that FAM66C regulated cell growth through this pathway. Moreover, luciferase assay demonstrated that another two noncoding RNAs, miR15a/miR15b, directly bonded to the 3 ' UTR of LATS1 to facilitated its transcriptional expression and inhibited cell growth. In addition, the luciferase activity of FAM66C was block by miR15a/miR15b, and the promotion of cell growth effects caused by FAM66C deficiency was attenuated by miR15a/miR15b mimics, further proved that FAM66C functioned as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate glioma growth via the miRNA/LATS1 signaling pathway.

AB  - The Q fever is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by an obligate intra-cellular bacterium, Coxiella burnetii. Members of the Canidae family (Mammalia), including dogs and foxes, are potential reservoirs of C. burnetii, which has a wide host range from mammals and birds to arthropods (primarily ticks). Infected dogs can transmit the disease to other animals and humans. This study aimed to investigate the presence of C. burnetii in dogs and ticks collected from infested dogs in the Kars, Ardahan, and I & gbreve;dir provinces of T & uuml;rkiye by serological and molecular methods. Three hundred canine serum samples were analyzed for phase I and phase II C. burnetii antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whole blood samples (n = 300) from the dogs sampled for sera and 184 ticks randomly collected from these dogs were also analyzed for C. burnetii with touchdown polymerase chain reaction. The ticks were classified according to the taxonomic characteristics. In result, 107 tick DNA samples collected from individual females and pooled males were evaluated. The C. burnetii was detected in 3.73% (of the tick samples. However, C. burnetii was not detected in any of the canine blood samples by polymerase chain reaction. Out of the 300 dogs, 18.33% presented antibodies against C. burnetii in their blood serum. When assessed for location, C. burnetii seropositivity was found to be significantly high especially in the Northeastern Anatolia region (18.33%). Study data highlighted the zoonotic risk of ticks, demonstrating that ticks on dogs can carry C. burnetii. (c) 2025 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant-based co-production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and seed oil has the potential to create a viable domestic source of feedstocks for renewable fuels and plastics. PHAs, a class of biodegradable polyesters, can replace conventional plastics in many applications while providing full degradation in all biologically active environments. Here we report the production of the PHA poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) in the seed cytosol of the emerging bioenergy crop Camelina sativa engineered with a bacterial PHB biosynthetic pathway. Two approaches were used: cytosolic localization of all three enzymes of the PHB pathway in the seed, or localization of the first two enzymes of the pathway in the cytosol and anchoring of the third enzyme required for polymerization to the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER-targeted approach was found to provide more stable polymer production with PHB levels up to 10.2% of the mature seed weight achieved in seeds with good viability. These results mark a significant step forward towards engineering lines for commercial use. Plant-based PHA production would enable a direct link between low-cost large-scale agricultural production of biodegradable polymers and seed oil with the global plastics and renewable fuels markets.

AB  - Alcohol has been demonstrated to disrupt intestinal barrier integrity. Some flavonoid compounds that exert antioxidant activity have a protective effect on intestinal barrier function. As an important medicinal and edible plant, sea buckthorn (Hippophae) seeds are rich in flavonoids, but their protective effect on the intestinal barrier has not been reported. In our research, 76 kinds of flavonoids were identified in Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. sinensis seed residue flavonoids (HRSF) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-O-robinoside-7-O-rhamnoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-2G-rhamnosylrutinoside, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, (-)-epigallocatechin, and B type of procyanidin were the most abundant substances, accounting for 15.276%, 15.128%, 18.328%, 10.904%, 4.596%, 5.082%, and 10.079% of all identified flavonoids, respectively. Meanwhile, pre-treatment with HRSF was able to prevent alcohol-induced disruption of intestinal barrier integrity through elevating the transepithelial monolayer resistance value, inhibiting the flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, and upregulating the mRNA and protein level of TJs (occludin and ZO-1). Furthermore, it was also able to reverse alcohol-induced oxidative stress through suppressing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, improving the glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity. Finally, the results showed that HRSF pre-treatment effectively elevated the erythroid-related factor 2 mRNA and protein level compared with the alcohol-alone treatment group. Our research was the first to demonstrate that HRSF could prevent alcohol-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction through regulating the Nrf2-mediated pathway in order to attenuate oxidative stress and enhance TJ expression.

AB  - The ability to apply findings from animal studies efficiently and effectively is predicated on an understanding of biology and pathobiology, how that biology relates to the human systems being modeled, and how the studies are conducted and reported. This overview discusses various factors in research within the animal environment (referred to as extrinsic factors) that the NIH now expects to be documented to foster replicability in science and expand interpretations of study outcomes. Specifically, an important extrinsic factor in research with animals is that of individual personnel who perform handling practices, participate in research interactions, and share an overall presence in the housing facility with animals, all of which can confound reproducibility efforts in biomedical science. An improved understanding of the influences and behaviors of animal research personnel on animal responses is critical with regard to research results and the interpretation of data collected from animal models of biomedical disease.

AB  - We investigated the effects of heat shock protein 10 (HSP10) protein on memory function, hippocampal neurogenesis, and other related genes/proteins in adult and aged mice. To translocate the HSP10 protein into the hippocampus, the Tat-HSP10 fusion protein was synthesized, and Tat-HSP10, not HSP10, was successfully delivered into the hippocampus based on immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Tat-HSP10 (0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg) or HSP10 (control protein, 2.0 mg/kg) was administered daily to 3-and 21-month-old mice for 3 months, and observed the senescence maker P16 was significantly increased in aged mice and the treatment with Tat-HSP10 significantly decreased P16 expression in the hippocampus of aged mice. In novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests, aged mice demonstrated decreases in exploratory preferences, exploration time, distance moved, number of object contacts, and escape latency compared to adult mice. Treatment with Tat-HSP10 significantly improved exploratory preferences, the number of object contacts, and the time spent swimming in the target quadrant in aged mice but not adults. Administration of Tat-HSP10 increased the number of proliferating cells and differentiated neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus of adult and aged mice compared to controls, as determined by immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 and doublecortin, respectively. Additionally, Tat-HSP10 treatment significantly mitigated the reduction in sirtuin 1 mRNA level, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1, and postsynaptic density 95 protein levels in the hippocampus of aged mice. In contrast, Tat-HSP10 treatment significantly increased sirtuin 3 protein levels in both adult and aged mouse hippocampus. These suggest that Tat-HSP10 can potentially reduce hippocampus-related aging phenotypes.

AB  - Hair follicle neural crest stem cells reside in the bulge region of the outer root sheath of hair follicles, originate from the ectoderm, and have multidirectional differentiation potential, making them ideal candidates for tissue engineering applications. These cells mainly reside in a hypoxic microenvironment that favors the maintenance of stemness. Recently, many studies have elucidated the involvement of the Hippo pathway in the regulation of stem cell fate. However, few studies have investigated whether the Hippo signaling pathway regulates the growth of hair follicle neural crest stem cells in hypoxic environments. In the present study, we investigated the role of the Hippo pathway in the regulation of hair follicle neural crest stem cells under hypoxic conditions. We identified neural crest-derived stem cells from single-cell RNA-seq data of skin organoids in a public database, and reported that the Hippo pathway was activated in the cell population. Hair follicle neural crest stem cells were isolated from rat hair follicles and cultured under hypoxic (3% oxygen) and normoxic (20% oxygen) conditions. Cell viability was assessed via the CCK8 assay. The expression levels of several key genes, including Hif2 alpha, Nestin, Sox10, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Klf4, were evaluated via quantitative real-time PCR, after which we treated the cells with verteporfin, a small molecule inhibitor of the Hippo pathway. Changes in the subcellular localization of the hair follicle neural crest stem cell-specific marker SOX10 were assessed via immunofluorescence. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression levels of proteins associated with stemness and hypoxia responses, including HIF2 alpha, SOX10, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4. The results showed that hypoxic conditions facilitated the maintenance of stemness in hair follicle neural crest stem cells, including the promotion of proliferation and the expression of multipotential markers. Inhibition of the Hippo pathway results in a significant decrease in cell proliferation. The protein expression of HIF2 alpha, SOX10, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4 was also reduced under hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Phoenixin-14 (PNX-14) regulates energy metabolism via the G protein-coupled receptor 173 (GPR173); elevated plasma levels have been described in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. The aims were to investigate the ovarian expression of PNX-14/GPR173 and the in vitro effect of PNX-14 on granulosa cells (Gc) function. Transcript and protein levels of PNX-14/GRP173 were analysed by real-time PCR, western blot and immuno-histochemistry in the porcine ovarian follicles at days 2-3, 10-12 and 16-18 of the oestrous. For in vitro ex-periments, Gc were isolated from follicles at days 10-12 of the oestrous (4-6 mm) and PNX-14 at doses 1-1000 nM was added for 24-72 h to determine Gc proliferation. Cell cycle progression, E2 secretion, expression of proliferating cells nuclear antigen, cyclins, mitogen-activated kinase (MAP3/1; ERK1/2), protein kinase B (AKT) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were studied. The involvement of these kinases in PNX-14 action on Gc proliferation was analysed using pharmacological inhibitors. Levels of GPR173 were increased in the ovarian follicles with oestrous progression, while only PNX-14 protein was the highest at days 10-12 of the oestrous. Immuno-signal of PNX-14 was detected in Gc and theca cells and oocyte, while GPR173 was mostly in theca. Interestingly, PNX-14 stimulated Gc proliferation, E2 secretion, cell cycle progression and cyclins expression and had a modulatory effect on MAP3/1, AKT and STAT3 activation. Our study suggests that PNX-14 could be an important factor for porcine reproduction by influencing ovarian follicle growth through direct action on Gc function.

AB  - Supplemental dietary amino acids (AAs) need to be provided in a form that prevents their degradation along the gastrointestinal tract to guarantee their high bioavailability and bioactivity. In this study, methionine (Met) protected via organo-clay intercalation (natural carriers) has been developed as a sustainable alternative to polymeric coating. Specifically, two different bentonite-zeolite-based mineral clays were tested, Adsorbene (ADS) and BioKi (BIO). Briefly, 1 g of the carrier (ADS or BIO) was contacted with 50 mL of an aqueous solution at a pH of 3.0, 5.8, and 8.9. Solid-liquid separation was conducted. The released Met in the liquid phase was analysed by Chemical Oxygen Demand, while residual Met in the solid phase was analysed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The effect of Met-ADS complex on cell viability was tested on IPEC-J2 cells incubated 3 h with Met-ADS 2.5 mM. Jejunum segments obtained by entire male pigs (Swiss Large White, body weight 100 +/- 5 kg) were used as ex vivo models to compare the absorption of 2.5 mM Met released by ADS with 2.5 mM free Met and its influence on epithelial integrity in perfusion Ussing chambers. The carriers released a very low amount of Met and Met-BIO interaction was stronger than Met-ADS. The maximum release of Met was at pH 3, with 3% and 6% of Met release from Met-BIO and Met-ADS, respectively. Cell viability experiments revealed that Met-ADS did not alter cell metabolic activity. No differences in Met absorption and intestinal epithelial integrity were observed ex vivo between free Met and Met-ADS. This study provided new insights into the release of Met from natural clays such as ADS and BIO, the safety of its use in the porcine intestine and the ability of ADS-released Met to absorb to the same extent as the free Met in porcine jejunum.

AB  - Cattle were the most important livestock in Iron Age Scandinavia and have been utilised in multiple ways. This paper aims to investigate the kill-off patterns of cattle in the first millennium (third-eleventh century) AD at four complex and multifunctional sites in Sweden, namely Helgo, Gamla Uppsala, Uppakra and Stanstorp. The mortality profiles are derived from data on tooth development and wear, with a focus on the dp4 and M3. The results support the notion of regional differences in the selection of animals between eastern central and southern Sweden. The kill-off patterns at Uppakra and Stanstorp, with a large proportion of adult animals, resemble the pattern observed in early urban centres, such as Birka and Sigtuna. The mortality profiles both at Helgo and Gamla Uppsala exhibit a kill-off pattern with a large proportion of calves and young adults. The patterns are linked to the climatic and ecological preconditions, as well as to food preferences and ritual activities. There does not seem to be a specific age group selected for ritual depositions. However, a recurring kill-off pattern with a high proportion of either juveniles or adult cattle may be linked to a specific selection for communal consumption and feasting events.

AB  - BackgroundsInsertion of Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) to produce magnesium-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-PPIX) was the first step toward chlorophyll biosynthesis, which not only imparts plants green pigmentation but underpins photosynthesis. Plants that blocked the conversion of PPIX to Mg-PPIX displayed yellowish or albino-lethal phenotypes. However, the lack of systematic study of the detection method and the metabolic difference between species have caused the research on chloroplast retrograde signaling controversial for a long time.ResultsAn advanced and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS strategy for determining PPIX and Mg-PPIX was established in two metabolic different plants, Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) and Camellia sinensis var. sinensis. Two metabolites could be extracted by 80% acetone (v/v) and 20% 0.1 M NH4OH (v/v) without hexane washing. Since the Mg-PPIX could be substantially de-metalized into PPIX in acidic conditions, analysis was carried out by UPLC-MS/MS with 0.1% ammonia (v/v) and 0.1% ammonium acetonitrile (v/v) as mobile phases using negative ion multiple reaction monitoring modes. Interestingly, it could be easier to monitor these two compounds in dehydrated samples rather than in fresh samples. Validation was performed in spiked samples and mean recoveries ranged from 70.5 to 916%, and the intra-day and inter-day variations were less than 7.5 and 10.9%, respectively. The limit of detection was 0.01 mg center dot kg(- 1) and the limit of quantification was 0.05 mg center dot kg(- 1). The contents of PPIX (1.67 +/- 0.12 mg center dot kg(- 1)) and Mg-PPIX (3.37 +/- 0.10 mg center dot kg(- 1)) in tea were significantly higher than in Arabidopsis (PPIX: 0.05 +/- 0.02 mg center dot kg(- 1); Mg-PPIX: 0.08 +/- 0.01 mg center dot kg(- 1)) and they were only detected in the leaf.ConclusionsOur study establishes a universal and reliable method for determining PPIX and Mg-PPIX in two plants using UPLC-MS/MS. This procedure will facilitate studying chlorophyll metabolism and natural chlorophyll production.

AB  - The ketogenic diet (KD) has been shown to reduce anxiety and enhance cognitive functions in neurological diseases. However, the sex -specific effects of KD on anxiety -like behavior in healthy individuals and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these effects, including neuroinflammation, are unelucidated. This study investigated the sex -specific effects of KD on anxiety -like behavior and the neuroimmune response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of healthy C57BL/6J male and female mice. Animals were fed either a control diet (CD- 17% fat, 65% carb, 18% protein) or a KD (80% fat, 5% carb, 15% protein) for 4 weeks. KD increased the levels of circulating beta -hydroxybutyrate (BHB) both in males and females. However, PFC BHB levels were found to be elevated only in KD males. Moreover, KD did not affect the behavior of females but improved motor abilities and reduced anxiety levels in males. KD suppressed the mRNA expression of the pan microglial markers ( Cd68, P2ry12 ) and induced morphological changes in the male PFC microglia. A sex -specific decrease in IL1 beta and an increase in IL -10 levels was found in the PFC of KD males. A similar trend was observed in the hippocampus of males where KD reduced the mRNA expression of P2ry12, Il1 beta , and cFos . Additionally, BHB increased the production of IL -10 whereas it decreased the production of IL1 beta from human microglia in in -vitro conditions. In summary, these results demonstrate that the anxiolytic and motor function enhancement abilities of KD are male -specific. Reduced pro -inflammatory and improved anti-inflammatory factors in the male PFC and hippocampus may underlie these effects. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wounds in harsh environments can face long-term inflammation and persistent infection, which can slow healing. Wound spray is a product that can be rapidly applied to large and irregularly dynamic wounds, and can quickly form a protective film in situ to inhibit external environmental infection. In this study, a biodegradable A and B combined multi-functional spray hydrogel is developed with methacrylate-modified chitosan (CSMA1st) and ferulic acid (FA) as type A raw materials and oxidized Bletilla striata polysaccharide (OBSP) as type B raw materials. The precursor CSMA1st-FA/OBSP (CSOB-FA1st) hydrogel is formed by the self-cross-linking of dynamic Schiff base bonds, the CSMA-FA/OBSP (CSOB-FA) hydrogel is formed quickly after UV-vis light, so that the hydrogel fits with the wound. Rapid spraying and curing provide sufficient flexibility and rapidity for wounds and the hydrogel has good injectability, adhesive, and mechanical strength. In rats and miniature pigs, the A and B combined spray hydrogel can shrink wounds and promote healing of infected wounds, and promote the enrichment of fibrocyte populations. Therefore, the multifunctional spray hydrogel combined with A and B can protect irregular dynamic wounds, prevent wound infection and secondary injury, and be used for safe and effective wound treatment, which has a good prospect for development.
   Biodegradable A and B compound multi-functional spray hydrogel composed of CS, FA, and BSP natural materials. Spray hydrogels can be instantly sprayed and secured to the wound. Spray hydrogels can shrink wounds, be anti-inflammatory, and promote the healing of the irregular, dynamic infectious wounds. Spray hydrogel has a good healing effect on small and large animal wounds. image

AB  - Bovine enteroviruses (BEVs) are emerging pathogens with poorly understood evolutionary dynamics and zoonotic potential. Here, we report the discovery of a novel recombinant BEV strain, HeN-2022, isolated from cattle in China. Genomic analysis revealed that HeN-2022 is a primary hybrid of BEV-E1 (VG527, Ireland) and BEV-E4 (GX1901, China), with recombination breakpoints in the VP1 gene and 5 ' UTR. Divergence dating traced its origin to 1991, predating closely related strains. Experimental infection in sheep demonstrated asymptomatic viral shedding (peak at 5 dpi) and robust neutralizing antibody responses, highlighting the potential cross-species adaptability. These findings underscore recombination as a potential key driver of BEV evolution and emphasize the need for global surveillance to address emerging livestock pathogens.

AB  - Our current knowledge regarding the development of the human brain mostly derives from experimental studies on non-human primates, sheep, and rodents. However, these studies may not completely simulate all the features of human brain development as a result of species differences and variations in pre- and postnatal brain maturation. Therefore, it is important to supplement the in vivo animal models to increase the possibility that preclinical studies have appropriate relevance for potential future human trials. Three-dimensional brain organoid culture technology could complement in vivo animal studies to enhance the translatability of the preclinical animal studies and the understanding of brain-related disorders. In this review, we focus on the development of a model of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury using human brain organoids to complement the translation from animal experiments to human pathophysiology. We also discuss how the development of these tools provides potential opportunities to study fundamental aspects of the pathophysiology of HI-related brain injury including differences in the responses between males and females.

AB  - Environmental and occupational low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure may be harmful for health but the previous reports regarding effect of LDR on cognition are contradictory. Here we investigated the effect of long-term LDR exposure on cognition. In this study, male Balb/c mice' cognitive functions were tested at 15 weeks after being exposed to 0.5 Gy LDR in 10 fractions at each dose of 0.05 Gy. The results demonstrated that long-term LDR exposure increases escape latency and the time spent in finding exits in mice compared with non LDR exposure. Meanwhile, the inflammation-related proteins including NF kappa B and p38 also increased. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels decreased following long term LDR exposure. Treatment with microbiota-derived LPS and SCFAs reversed these effects in mice. Furthermore, the gut barrier integrity was damaged in a time-dependent manner with the decreased expression of intestinal epithelial-related biomarkers such as ZO-1 and occludin. Mechanistically, long after exposure to LDR, increased LPS levels may cause cognitive impairment through the regulation of Akt/mTOR signaling in the mouse hippocampus. These findings provide new insight into the clinical applications of LDR and suggest that the gut microbiota-plasma LPS and SCFAs--brain axis may underlie long-term LDR-induced cognition effects.

AB  - Fish ageing is a vital component of fisheries management as it enables the evaluation of fish population status and supports the development of sustainable management strategies. However, traditional methods of age determination through otolith analysis by experts are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a growing demand for more cost-effective and automated techniques to accurately determine fish age. In accordance with this purpose, we proposed a multistage framework for fish age prediction using otolith images. First, otoliths in the images were detected using the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) model, which includes 8 convolution layers, and the detected otoliths were clipped. Subsequently, using a pretrained neural network based on the transfer learning approach, deep features were extracted separately from the right and left otolith images, and all the obtained features were combined. Finally, these combined features are given as input to the Gaussian process regression model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, 4109 images of right and left otoliths belonging to Greenland halibut (flatfish, Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) were used. The proposed architecture produced 1.83 MSE, 0.98 R-squared, 1.35 RMSE, and 10.29 MAPE scores in the experimental studies. As a result, the proposed model achieved superior performance compared with previous studies. Our findings show that our FishAgePredictioNet system could help experts predict fish age based on otolith images.

AB  - Understanding spawning behavior of commercial fish populations provides a basis for making management decisions related to these stocks. Archival tags can be used to define spawning behavior when depth-specific movements are involved. Spawning behavior of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the eastern Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands was inferred from archival tag data. The predominant period of identified spawning activity, based on abrupt vertical rises of females, occurred in January and February, and females reached apexes in their upward movement (spawning rises) at depths of approximately 200-350 m below the surface, indicating that the release of eggs could occur at depths shallower than previously assumed. Females had a single spawning rise annually, a result supporting the notion that this species is a total (single-batch) spawner. Male Greenland halibut exhibited spawning behavior, rises to shallower depths one or more times, for an average of 20 d. For large female Greenland halibut (>80 cm in fork length), spawning rises occurred in consecutive years, indicating that, despite oocyte development taking more than 1 year, spawning occurs annually. Inferring spawning behavior by using data collected with archival tags can aid in understanding the maturity of Greenland halibut.

AB  - Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) is a glycoprotein hormone involved in calcium/phosphorus metabolism and direct inhibition of bone and muscle growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the STC-1 gene with respect to the regulatory mechanisms of porcine growth metabolic pathways involving autophagy. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of autophagy and mitochondrial function-related proteins, and flow cytometry was used to detect mitochondrial function-related. Changes in the autophagosome and mitochondrial were observed by electron microscopy. The expression of the autophagy-related proteins was detected by confocal microscopy. The results showed that Pink1, Parkin and LC3B expression was increased; SQSTM1/P62 expression was reduced. Electron microscopy revealed that the cells in the serum starvation group all produced autophagosomes. The fluorescence intensity of GFP-LC3B and GFP-Parkin increased. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, Pink1 and Parkin protein levels were profoundly reduced in the STC-KO. In addition, the increase in Mfn2, OPA1, DRP1 and LC3B proteins was attenuated; the increase in the apoptosis rate and amount of active oxygen was attenuated; the decrease in membrane potential; the decrease in ATP was reversed; the fluorescence intensity of GFP-LC3B and GFP-Parkin was increased. These results indicate that autophagy can be caused by serum starvation. Knocking out the porcine STC-1 gene had an obvious antiapoptotic effect on cells, the inhibition of serum starvation-induced autophagy. This is the first study to show that the porcine STC-1 gene confers self-protection in the absence of nutrients. To provide a theoretical basis for studying the effect of STC-1 on pig growth and development.

AB  - Otodectes cynotis (Acari: Psoroptidae) constitutes an obligate, non-burrowing ectoparasite and causes otodectic mange primarily in domestic and wild carnivores. Only few studies have described this parasite in herbivore hosts so far. In the current study, we report O. cynotis infestations in Southern pudus (Pudu puda), categorized in the IUCN red list as near threatened. Otodectes cynotis was detected in free-ranging animals in Chile (in situ), as well as in zoo-housed pudus at the Zoo Wuppertal, Germany (ex situ). During clinical work, two free-ranging pudus temporarily rehabilitated at the Centro de Rehabilitacio<acute accent>n de Fauna Silvestre (CEREFAS), Valdivia, Chile, were observed with low to moderate yellowish-brown secretions and encrustations inside the pinna and external auditory canal accompanied by an inflammatory Otitis externa. Analysis via light microscopy exhibited the presence of mange mites, which were identified as O. cynotis via morphological characteristics and molecular analysis. At the Zoo Wuppertal, ear mites were detected in 15 pudus between 2015 and 2024, however, a definite species identification (O. cynotis) was carried out in 4 animals within the current study between 2023 and 2024. Some affected pudus showed bald spots around the ears and the head and exhibited headshaking behavior, whilst others were asymptomatic. In some cases, mites were found as a secondary finding when clinical examination under general anesthesia was performed for other reasons. To the best of our knowledge, this signifies the first report of O. cynotis infestations in pudus by combining morphological and molecular identification. We here present clinical in situ and ex situ data and show that zoological gardens and widlife rehabilitation centers play an important role in research and monitoring of neglected wildlife diseases.

AB  - Assisted reproduction is a key aspect of modern animal breeding, providing valuable assistance in improving breeding programs. In this field, the administration of exogenous hormones, such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), plays a crucial role in the induction of multiple ovulations. However, commercial FSH used in veterinary practice has been derived primarily from pituitary glands, obtained mostly from pigs for nearly four decades. Although these hormones have contributed significantly to the advancement of assisted reproductive techniques, they have certain limitations that warrant further improvements. These limitations include contamination with luteinizing hormone (LH), the potential risk of pathogen contamination, the potential to trigger an immune response in non-pig species, and the short half-life in circulation, requiring the implementation of complex 8dose superovulation schedules. Our research team has developed and characterized a new variant of bovine follicle-stimulating hormone (bscrFSH) to address these limitations. The new hormone is produced recombinantly in CHO cell cultures, with a specific productivity of about 30 pg/cell/day. The bscrFSH can be purified to a high purity of 97 % using a single step of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). N-glycan analysis of bscrFSH showed that approximately 74 % of the glycans corresponded to charged structures, including mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-sialylated glycans. Superovulation trials conducted in cattle revealed that bscrFSH, administered at a total dose of about 0.5 mu g per kg of body weight, using a decrescent schedule of 4 doses with 24-h intervals, resulted in an average yield of 8-12 transferable embryos per animal. Further research is required; however, the preliminary findings indicate that bscrFSH, currently packaged under the provisional brand name of Cebitropin B, holds potential as a commercial product for assisted reproduction in ruminants.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Quyu Shengxin capsule (QSC) is an herbal compound commonly used to treat blood stasis syndrome in China, and blood stasis syndrome is considered to be the root of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the potential molecular mechanism of QSC is still unknown.
   Aim of study: To study the therapeutic effect of QSC on the abnormal proliferation of VSMCs induced by Ang-II, and to explore its possible mechanism of action.
   Materials and methods: Qualitative analysis and quality control of QSC through UPLC-MS/MS and UPLC. The rat thoracic aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were cultured in vitro, and then stimulated with Angiotensin II (Ang-II) (10-7 mol/L) for 24 h to establish a cardiovascular cell model. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of QSC drug-containing serum or normal goat serum. MTT assay was used to detect the viability of VSMCs and abnormal cell proliferation. In order to analyze the possible signal transduction pathways, the content of various factors in the supernatant of VSMCs was screened and determined by means of the Luminex liquid suspension chip detection platform, and the phosphoprotein profile in VSMCs was screened by Phospho Explorer antibody array.
   Results: Compared with the model group, serum cell viability and inflammatory factor levels with QSC were significantly decreased (P < 0.001). In addition, the expression levels of TGF-beta, VEGF, mTOR and JAK-STAT in the QSC-containing serum treatment group were significantly lower than those in the model group. QSC may regulate the pathological process of CVD by reducing the levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, and protecting VSMCs from the abnormal proliferation induced by Ang-II.
   Conclusion: QSC inhibits Ang-II-induced abnormal proliferation of VSMCs, which is related to the downregulation of TGF-beta, VEGF, mTOR and JAK-STAT pathways.

AB  - The role of myelination for axonal conduction is well-established in projection neurons but little is known about its significance in GABAergic interneurons. Myelination is discontinuous along interneuron axons and the mechanisms controlling myelin patterning and segregation of ion channels at the nodes of Ranvier have not been elucidated. Protein 4.1B is implicated in the organization of the nodes of Ranvier as a linker between paranodal and juxtaparanodal membrane proteins to the spectrin cytoskeleton. In the present study, 4.1B KO mice are used as a genetic model to analyze the functional role of myelin in Lhx6-positive parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) neurons, two major classes of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus. We show that 4.1B-deficiency induces disruption of juxtaparanodal K+ channel clustering and mislocalization of nodal or heminodal Na+ channels. Strikingly, 4.1B-deficiency causes loss of myelin in GABAergic axons in the hippocampus. In particular, stratum oriens SST cells display severe axonal dysmyelination and a reduced excitability. This reduced excitability is associated with a decrease in occurrence probability of small amplitude synaptic inhibitory events on pyramidal cells. In contrast, stratum pyramidale fast-spiking PV cells do not appear affected. In conclusion, our results indicate a class-specific effect of dysmyelination on the excitability of hippocampal interneurons associated with a functional alteration of inhibitory drive.

AB  - The copepod Apocyclops royi tolerates very low salinity while being highly capable of synthesizing n-3 fatty acids based on PUFA-poor diets. The feasibility of culturing A. royi in freshwater fed with baker's yeast was evaluated. The copepods were adjusted for 8 days by decreasing stepwise from salinity 20 to freshwater diluting with deionized water. Initially, the cultures exhibited adequate survival and reproduction. However, after 10 days in freshwater, they stopped reproducing presumably due to the lack of vital ions in the medium. Therefore, before continuing the freshwater cultures, we tested the survival of a batch of salinity 1 pre-acclimated adults and copepodites in various types of freshwater: deionized, bottled 'mineral' and tap water for 48 h. All copepods died in deionized water, but a significantly higher survival, 29% +/- 11%, was found in mineral water versus 11% +/- 8% in tap water. Hence, we continued culturing the copepods in freshwater using 'Maglekilde spring' water as diluter. The copepods regained and kept reproducing until day 71 where the experiment was terminated. After a 48 h freshwater versus salinity 20 exposure, nauplii survival was significantly less in freshwater 25 +/- 12 versus 79 +/- 20 (+/- STD) at salinity 20 but not different in mean body length. For the first time, we conducted NMR metabolomics revealing a large decrease in glycine betaine and a large increase in lactate in the copepods when challenged by freshwater versus salinity 20. There is obviously a 'price to pay' when culturing not only the copepods in freshwater, but also perspectives in developing a 'universal' A. royi live-feed product.

AB  - Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector mediated expression of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is an alternative strategy to traditional vaccination to generate immunity in immunosuppressed or immunosenescent individuals. In this study, we vectorized a human monoclonal antibody (31C2) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and determined the safety profile of this AAV vector in mice and sheep as a large animal model. In both studies, plasma biochemical parameters and hematology were comparable to untreated controls. Except for mild myositis at the site of injection, none of the major organs revealed any signs of toxicity. AAV-mediated human IgG expression increased steadily throughout the 28-day study in sheep, resulting in peak concentrations of 21.4-46.7 mu g/mL, demonstrating practical scale up from rodent to large animal models. This alternative approach to immunity is worth further exploration after this demonstration of safety, tolerability, and scalability in a large animal model.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity underlying long-term memory is associated with the generation of saturated free fatty acids (sFFAs) -particularly myristic acid- from membrane phospholipids by the phospholipase A1 isoform DDHD2. However, the mechanism through which myristic acid contributes to synaptic plasticity remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that DDHD2-derived myristic acid is rapidly converted to myristoyl CoA, which serves as the substrate for N-myristoyl transferases (NMT1/2), to promote post-translational lysine myristoylation of synaptic proteins. Chemically-induced long-term potentiation (cLTP) in cortical neurons increases both sFFAs and their CoA-conjugates, predominantly myristoyl CoA, and this response is blocked by the DDHD2 inhibitor KLH-45. KLH-45-mediated inhibition of DDHD2 or IMP-1088-mediated inhibition of NMT1/2 also disrupts cLTP-induced proteomic changes, impairs dendritic spine remodeling, and prevents LTP in hippocampal slices. Instrumental conditioning further induces proteomic changes in the hippocampus, which are abolished in learning-deficient DDHD2-/- knockout mice. In these mice, key synaptic proteins such as NMDA receptor subunit GluN1, MAP2, and GAS7 fail to undergo learning-induced changes, effectively linking DDHD2 function to learning-dependent proteome remodeling. Our findings reveal that de novo lysine myristoylation promotes synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

AB  - Pectin is a complex polysaccharide that forms a substantial proportion of the plant's middle lamella of forage ingested by grazing ruminants. Methanol in the rumen is derived mainly from methoxy groups released from pectin by the action of pectin methylesterase (PME) and is subsequently used by rumen methylotrophic methanogens that reduce methanol to produce methane (CH4). Members of the genus Butyrivibrio are key pectin-degrading rumen bacteria that contribute to methanol formation and have important roles in fibre breakdown, protein digestion, and the biohydrogenation of fatty acids. Therefore, methanol release from pectin degradation in the rumen is a potential target for CH4 mitigation technologies. Here, we present the crystal structures of PMEs belonging to the carbohydrate esterase family 8 (CE8) from Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, determined to a resolution of 2.30 angstrom. These enzymes, like other PMEs, are right-handed fi-helical proteins with a well-defined catalytic site and reaction mechanisms previously defined in insect, plant, and other bacterial pectin methylesterases. Potential substrate binding domains are also defined for the enzymes.

AB  - Green tea has many health benefits and is the most consumed type in China. However, the heavy metals and contaminants in tea can also pose a great risk to human health. In this study, mercury (Hg) concentration in green tea collected from 11 provinces in China was examined. The leaching characteristics of Hg during brewing and the associated exposure to drinkers were also evaluated. Results indicated a low potential of Hg accumulation in green tea. The Hg content of green tea from Wanshan District, Guizhou Province-which has the largest Hg mine in China and is severely contaminated by Hg-could be limited by controlling the harvest time of tea leaves. The average Hg content of green tea from 43 tea production sites in China was only 6.3 +/- 6.4 mu g/kg dry weight. The brewing experiments of green tea showed that the leaching ratio of Hg was 22.61 +/- 7.58% for 40 min of a single brew, and increased to 32.83 +/- 12.37% after four rounds (3 min/ round) of brewing. The leaching of Hg from tea leaves was significantly affected by leaching time, temperature, and solid-liquid ratio but not by water hardness. The risk of Hg exposure from green tea intake was found to be very low, with an average hazard quotient (HQ) value of only 1.82 +/- 1.85% for a single brew in 40 min and 2.64 +/- 2.68% after four rounds of brewing. However, in some highly contaminated areas, with HQ values as high as 43.12 +/- 2.41%, green tea intake may still pose a high risk of Hg exposure, and this risk should not be ignored.

AB  - Adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) are the source for the continuous production of new neurons throughout life. This so-called adult neurogenesis has been extensively studied; the intermediate cellular stages are well documented. Recent discoveries have raised new controversies in the field, such as the notion that progenitor cells hold similar self-renewal potential as stem cells, or whether different types of aNSCs exist. Here, we discuss evidence for heterogeneity of aNSCs, including short-term and long-term self-renewing aNSCs, regional and temporal differences in aNSC function, and single cell transcriptomics. Reviewing various genetic mouse models used for targeting aNSCs and lineage tracing, we consider potential lineage relationships between Ascl1-, Gli1-, and Nestin-targeted aNSCs. We present a multidimensional model of adult neurogenesis that incorporates recent findings and conclude that stemness is a phenotype, a state of properties that can change with time, rather than a cell property, which is static and immutable. We argue that singular aNSCs do not exist.

AB  - It is important to note that seasonality could affect ram reproductive parameters, and therefore, fertility results after artificial insemination. In this work, 1) we assessed fertility rates after cervical artificial insemination of 11,805 ewes at the beginning (June 21st to July 20th) and at the end (November 20th to December 21st) of the reproductive season in the Assaf breed for the last four years, and 2) we aimed to identify male factors infiuencing the different reproductive success obtained depending on the time at the mating season in which ovine artificial insemination was performed. For this purpose, we evaluated certain ram reproductive and ultrasonographical parameters as well as we performed a multiparametric and proteomic sperm analysis of 6-19 rams at two very distant points in the mating season (July as Early Breeding Season -EBS-and November as Late Breeding Season -LBS-). Rutinary assessments carried out in the ovine reproduction centers (testicular volume, libido, sperm production and mass motility) showed non-significant differences (P & GE; 0.05) between both studied times, as well as the ram ultraso-nographic evaluation (Resistive and Pulsatility Index as Doppler parameters; and pixels mean gray level, and hypoechoic areas percentage and density as echotexture parameters). However, at level of sperm functionality, although sperm quality appeared non-significantly lower (P & GE; 0.05) in the EBS, we iden-tified a significantly different (P < 0.05) sperm proteomic profile between the seasonality points. The following proteins were identified with the lowest abundance in the EBS with a fold change > 4, a P = 2.40e-07, and a q = 2.23e-06: Fibrous Sheath-Interacting Protein 2, Disintegrin and Metal-loproteinase Domain-Containing Protein 20-like, Phosphoinositide-Specific Phospholipase C, Tektin 5, Armadillo Repeat-Containing Protein 12 Isoform X3, Solute Carrier Family 9B1, Radial Spoke Head Protein 3 Homolog, Pro-Interleukin-16, NADH Dehydrogenase [Ubiquinone] 1 Alpha Subcomplex Subunit 8, Testis, Prostate and Placenta-Expressed Protein, and Acyl Carrier Protein Mitochondrial. In conclusion, while our basic analyses on male and sperm quality showed similar results between the beginning and the end of the breeding season, on a proteomic level we detected a lower expression of sperm proteins linked to the energy metabolism, sperm-oocyte interactions, and fiagellum structure in the EBS. Prob-ably, this different protein expression could be related to the lower fertility rate of Assaf ewes after cervical artificial insemination at this time. More importantly, sperm proteins can be used as highly effective molecular markers in predicting sperm fertilization ability related to intraseasonal variations.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background/Objective: Burn injuries are among the most common causes of trauma globally, affecting millions annually. Current treatments often rely on topical agents, but alternatives to synthetic formulations are increasingly sought due to safety and efficacy concerns. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a cream containing Camellia sinensis (white tea) extract on third-degree burn-induced skin lesions in a rat model. Methods: Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups: control, Burn only, Burn + Camellia sinensis extract, and Burn + Camellia sinensis cream. Skin biopsies were evaluated using histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical methods. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured to assess oxidative stress, while histological damage and immunoreactivity for collagen I, collagen III, NF-k beta/p65, TNF-alfa, 8-OhDG, and caspase-3 were analyzed. Results: The Camellia sinensis cream significantly reduced MDA levels and increased GSH levels compared to the burn-only group (p < 0.001). Histological analysis revealed enhanced epidermal regeneration and reduced dermal damage. The immunohistochemical findings demonstrated reduced NF-k beta/p65, TNF-alfa, 8-OhDG, caspase-3, collagen I, and collagen III immunopositivity in the cream-treated group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Camellia sinensis cream demonstrated significant protective and reparative effects on burn-induced skin damage, suggesting its potential as a natural, effective, and safe alternative for burn management.

AB  - Background: Tooth loss results in hard- and soft-tissue volume loss over time. We compared the handling of three different soft tissue substitutes (STS) to the subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) for soft tissue volume augmentation in a pig ex vivo model. Methods: Five dentists simultaneously shaped, placed and sutured randomized four graft types in single-tooth soft tissue defects created in pig mandibles. The STS, produced from slightly crosslinked collagen fibres (VCMX), were either 3 mm or 6 mm thick blocks or a newly developed pre-customized saddle-shape. Each graft type was handled 20 times. The time required for shaping, placement, and suturing was recorded. Dentists reported outcomes on the grafts' handling were evaluated with a visual-analogue-scale (VAS). Statistical analysis included calculating means and medians and testing significance. Results: The mean time of 0.72 min for shaping the pre-customized saddle-shape STS was significantly lower than 1.31 min for SCTG, 1.73 min for 3 mm STS and 2.17 min for 6 mm STS. Placement/suturing time was similar for all grafts. The dentists mainly preferred the saddle-shape STS and the SCTG. Conclusions: The saddle-shape STS required less time for graft-shaping and, therefore, reduced the overall treatment time, suggesting a more efficient and less invasive workflow for soft tissue augmentation.

AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m 6 A) critically regulates RNA dynamics in various biological processes. The m 6 A demethylase ALKBH5 promotes tumorigenesis of glioblastoma, while the intricate web that orchestrates its regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we discover that cell density affects ALKBH5 subcellular localization and m 6 A dynamics. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 is phosphorylated by the large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2), preventing its nuclear export and enhancing protein stability. Furthermore, phosphorylated ALKBH5 reciprocally erases m 6 A from LATS2 mRNA, thereby stabilizing this transcript. Unexpectedly, LATS2 depletion suppresses glioblastoma stem cell self -renewal independent of yes -associated protein activation. Additionally, deficiency in either LATS2 or ALKBH5 phosphorylation impedes tumor progression in mouse xenograft models. Moreover, high levels of LATS2 expression and ALKBH5 phosphorylation are associated with tumor malignancy in patients with gliomas. Collectively, our study unveils an oncogenic positive feedback loop between LATS2 and ALKBH5, revealing a non -canonical branch of the Hippo pathway for RNA processing and suggesting potential anti -cancer interventions.

AB  - Fruit maturity is the main factor affecting the quality and yield of Camellia oil. At present, accurate and efficient detection of the maturity level of Camellia oleifera fruits in orchards and enabling selective picking for harvesting robots is a crucial issue. Aiming at the challenge of low detection efficiency of Camellia oleifera fruit maturity and complex object detection models that are difficult to deploy to Camellia oleifera selective harvesting robots, a modified lightweight You Only Look Once model (YOLO-LM) based on YOLOv7-tiny is proposed. Specifically, three Criss-Cross Attention (CCA) modules are introduced to the backbone network to reduce the influence of leaves and branches occlusion as well as mutual occlusion between fruits. Then, the Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) module is applied as the head to solve the limitation of inconsistency across different feature scales on the feature pyramid. Furthermore, the GSConv is introduced to replace the standard convolution of the Neck network to enable the model to simultaneously preserve model accuracy and reduce model complexity. Experiment results demonstrate that the precision, recall, mAP@0.5, parameters, FLOPs, and model size of YOLO-LM reached 93.96 %, 93.32 %, 93.18 %, 10.17 million, 19.46 G, and 19.82 MB, which outperformed YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN (VGG16), Faster R-CNN (ResNet50), YOLOv4, and YOLOv5m. Compared to YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5s, YOLOv7-tiny, and YOLOv8s, the mAP@0.5 of YOLO-LM increased by 6.24 %, 6.11 %, 2.52 %, 2.45 %, and 0.57 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the parameters and model size of YOLO-LM are slightly higher than that of YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5s and YOLOv7-tiny, and significantly lower than that of YOLOv8s. In addition, the detection heatmaps of YOLOv7-tiny and YOLO-LM demonstrate these optimization operations contribute to the enhanced performance of maturity detection for Camellia oleifera fruits within natural orchard environments. Overall, the YOLO-LM model can be used for the maturity detection of Camellia oleifera fruits in orchards, which is expected to provide theoretical reference for orchard yield estimation, growth monitoring, planting management optimization and the development of Camellia oleifera selective harvesting robots.

AB  - Ramified, polarized protoplasmic astrocytes interact with synapses via perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAPs) to form tripartite synapses. These astrocyte-synapse interactions mutually regulate their structures and functions. However, molecular mechanisms for tripartite synapse formation remain elusive. We developed an in vitro co-culture system for mouse astrocytes and neurons that induced astrocyte ramifications and PAP formation. Co-cultured neurons were required for astrocyte ramifications in a neuronal activity-dependent manner, and synaptically-released glutamate and activation of astrocytic mGluR5 metabotropic glutamate receptor were likely involved in astrocyte ramifications. Astrocytic Necl2 trans-interacted with axonal Necl3, inducing astrocyte-synapse interactions and astrocyte functional polarization by recruiting EAAT1/2 glutamate transporters and Kir4.1 K+ channel to the PAPs, without affecting astrocyte ramifications. This Necl2/3 trans-interaction increased functional synapse number. Thus, astrocytic Necl2, synaptically -released glutamate and axonal Necl3 cooperatively formed tripartite glutamatergic synapses in vitro. Studies on hippocampal mossy fiber synapses in Necl3 knockout and Necl2/3 double knockout mice confirmed these previously unreported mechanisms for astrocyte-synapse interactions and astrocyte functional polarization in vivo.

AB  - This study investigated the antioxidant activity DPPH, ABTS, and Folin-Ciocalteu methods of betulin (compound 1) and its derivatives (compounds 2-11). Skin permeability and accumulation associated with compounds 1 and 8 were also examined. Identification of the obtained products (compound 2-11) and betulin isolated from plant material was based on the analysis of H-1- NMR and C-13-NMR spectra. The partition coefficient was calculated to determine the lipophilicity of all compounds. In the next stage, the penetration through pig skin and its accumulation in the skin were evaluated of ethanol vehicles containing compound 8 (at a concentration of 0.226 mmol/dm(3)), which was characterized by the highest antioxidant activity. For comparison, penetration studies of betulin itself were also carried out. Poor solubility and the bioavailability of pure compounds are major constraints in combination therapy. However, we observed that the ethanol vehicle was an enhancer of skin permeation for both the initial betulin and compound 8. The betulin 8 derivative showed increased permeability through biological membranes compared to the parent betulin. The paper presents the transformation of polycyclic compounds to produce novel derivatives with marked antioxidant activities and as valuable intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, the compounds contained in the vehicles, due to their mechanism of action, can have a beneficial effect on the balance between oxidants and antioxidants in the body, minimizing the effects of oxidative stress. The results of this work may contribute to knowledge regarding vehicles with antioxidant potential. The use of vehicles for this type of research is therefore justified.

AB  - Genetic variation accounts for much of the risk for developing a substance use disorder, but the underlying genetic factors and their genetic effector mechanisms are mostly unknown. Inbred mouse strains exhibit substantial and heritable differences in the extent of voluntary cocaine self-administration. Computational genetic analysis of cocaine self-administration data obtained from twenty-one inbred strains identified Nav1, a member of the neuron navigator family that regulates dendrite formation and axonal guidance, as a candidate gene. To test this genetic hypothesis, we generated and characterized Nav1 knockout mice. Consistent with the genetic prediction, Nav1 knockout mice exhibited increased voluntary cocaine intake and had increased motivation for cocaine consumption. Immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, and transcriptomic studies were performed as a starting point for investigating the mechanism for the Nav1 knockout effect. Nav1 knockout mice had a reduced inhibitory synapse density in their cortex, increased excitatory synaptic transmission in their cortex and hippocampus, and increased excitatory neurons in a deep cortical layer. Collectively, our results indicate that Nav1 regulates the response to cocaine, and we identified Nav1 knockout induced changes in the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic balance in the cortex and hippocampus that could contribute to this effect.

AB  - Background: Liver fibrosis is a common scarring response and may ultimately lead to liver cancer, unfortunately, there is currently no effective antifibrotic drug approved for human use. Limonoids exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities; however, the potential role of limonoids against fibrosis is largely unknown.
   Purpose: This study investigates the antifibrotic activities and potential mechanisms of TKF (3-tigloyl-khasene-gasin F), a natural mexicanolide-type limonoid derivative.
   Study design/methods: Two well-established mouse models (CCl4 challenge and bile duct ligation) were used to assess anti-fibrotic effects of TKF in vivo. Human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line LX-2 and mouse primary hepatic stellate cells (pHSCs) also served as in vitro liver fibrosis models.
   Result: TKF administration significantly attenuated hepatic histopathological injury and collagen accumulation and suppressed fibrogenesis-associated gene expression including Col1a1, Acta2, and Timp1. In LX-2 cells and mouse pHSCs, TKF dose-dependently suppressed HSC activation and the expression levels of fibrogenic markers. Mechanistic studies showed that TKF inhibited Notch3-Hes1 and YAP signalings in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, YAP inhibition or knockdown downregulated the Notch3 expression; however, Notch3 inhibition or knockdown did not affect the level of YAP in activated HSC. We revealed that TKF inhibited Notch3-Hes1 activation and downregulated hepatic fibrogenic gene expression via inhibiting YAP.
   Conclusion: The therapeutic benefit of TKF against liver fibrosis results from inhibition of YAP and Notch3-Hes1 pathways, indicating that TKF may be a novel therapeutic candidate for liver fibrosis.

AB  - Although there has been an increase in research studying the impact of housing on zoo animal welfare, there is still a lack of literature regarding the impact of seasonal housing differences on animal welfare. In northern American zoos, animals native to warmer climates inhabit an outdoor habitat during the summer and an indoor habitat during the winter. These habitats usually vary in size, in the amount of naturalistic habitat features and in the provision of diet. This study utilised a multi-faceted approach of behavioural observations, hormone monitoring and recumbency rates to assess giraffe welfare comparing outdoor, summer habitats and indoor, winter habitats at multiple institutions. A total of 13 giraffe were examined at four zoological institutions. Active non-forage behaviour was significantly higher in the outdoor habitat versus the indoor habitat (Z=-2.34, P=0.02), and active forage behaviour was significantly higher in the indoor habitat versus the outdoor habitat (Z=-2.27, P=0.02). In addition, higher levels of recumbency were exhibited in the indoor habitat than in the outdoor habitat. No significant differences were found for the other behavioural categories (inactive, abnormal) or for faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations between the two seasons. With positive welfare implications displayed in both indoor and outdoor habitats, these results suggest that housing giraffe indoors likely does not compromise their welfare. Future research should continue utilising multifaceted approaches across multiple institutions that will help in the management of species that could be impacted by differing seasonal habitats.

AB  - In this paper, we described the incidence of early pregnancy loss (EPL) both after natural mating and embryo transfer, evaluated risk factors, and summarized the outcome of twin pregnancies throughout gestation in dromedaries under reproductive care. Data were collected over seven breeding seasons at the world's largest camel dairy farm (study 1). In addition, we determined the timing of EPL and monitored serum progesterone (P4) concentration between Days 13-70 of gestation during one breeding season (study 2). In the first study, out of 2970 pregnancies, 507 cases (17.1%) of EPL were diagnosed with transrectal ultrasonography. The rate of EPL after natural mating and embryo transfer was 16.1% (n = 422 out of 2616) and 24.0% (n = 85 out of 354), respectively. Twin pregnancies were detected in 215 cases (7.2% of all gestations), and 57 of those (26.5%) underwent complete EPL. Almost half of the early losses (n = 243; 47.9%) occurred before 30 d of gestation. Another 43.2% (n = 219) of EPL was diagnosed during the next month, and 8.9% (n = 45) occurred after 60 d of gestation. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models revealed that the breeding season (year) and twin pregnancy were the most important exposure variables affecting the rate of EPL (P < 0.001). The effect of some male camels was also demonstrated while other factors, such as type of breeding, age category, month of mating, breed/ecotype and reproductive history did not prove to have a significant influence. In the second study, the overall rate of EPL was 24.5% (n = 34 of 139). There was no difference in the incidence of EPL between ET recipient (24.2%, n = 23 of 95) and mated (25%, n = 11 of 44) camels. Weekly rate of EPL ranged from 0.9% to 4.8% with a decreasing tendency, and approx. 41% of the animals (n = 14 of 34) had some ultrasonographic signs of impending EPL 1 week before the final diagnosis. Mean serum P4 concentration in camels with subsequent EPL was 5.3 +/- 0.1 ng/ml compared to 5.6 +/- 0.04 ng/ml in normal pregnant dromedaries. Day of gestation and future EPL influenced serum P4 levels (P < 0.001) with an interaction between the two fixed factors (P < 0.05). At the time of the final diagnosis of EPL, mean serum P4 concentration was 2.8 +/- 0.44 ng/ml. Although twinning had an unfavorable prognosis with a total pregnancy loss of 36.7%, it was not entirely detrimental for the final outcome of gestation as two-thirds of twin pregnancies (n = 136 out of 212) resulted in the birth of a live calf.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder is discussed in the context of altered neural oscillations and imbalanced cortical excitation-inhibition of cortical origin. We studied here whether developmental changes in peripheral auditory processing, while preserving basic hearing function, lead to altered cortical oscillations. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from auditory, visual, and prefrontal cortices and the hippocampus of BdnfPax2 KO mice. These mice develop an autism-like behavioral phenotype through deletion of BDNF in Pax2+ interneuron precursors, affecting lower brainstem functions, but not frontal brain regions directly. Evoked LFP responses to behaviorally relevant auditory stimuli were weaker in the auditory cortex of BdnfPax2 KOs, connected to maturation deficits of high-spontaneous rate auditory nerve fibers. This was correlated with enhanced spontaneous and induced LFP power, excitation-inhibition imbalance, and dendritic spine immaturity, mirroring autistic phenotypes. Thus, impairments in peripheral high-spontaneous rate fibers alter spike synchrony and subsequently cortical processing relevant for normal communication and behavior.
   Scheme for high-spontaneous low-threshold fiber loss resulting in unsharp auditory processing and disturbed cortical network dynamics. (i) Developmental changes due to BDNF deletion in Pax2-positive inhibitory interneurons result in partly dysfunctional high-SR fibers in the cochlea. (ii) Spike synchronization of ANFs fails, impairing spectral and temporal resolution. (iii) The missing drive for cortical excitatory input to pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons leads to altered intracortical network dynamics within AC and across areas (PFC/HC). Increased spontaneous but reduced evoked responsiveness in oscillatory frequency bands doesn't allow for the necessary context- and stimulus-specific pattern segregation of sensory inputs.image

AB  - Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) recurrence and metastasis are the major causes of failure in TNBC therapy. The difficulties in treating TNBCs may be because of increased cancer cell plasticity that involves the fine-tuning of cellular redox homeostasis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, metabolic characteristics, and the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Purpose: To investigate the effects and the underlying mechanisms of the phytosesquiterpene lactone deoxyelephantopin (DET) and its semi-synthesized derivative (DETD-35) in suppressing different phenotypic TNBC cell populations that contribute to tumor metastasis. Methods: A timelapse microfluidic-based system was established to analyze the effects of DETD-35 and DET on cell migration behavior in an oxygen gradient. Seahorse real-time cell metabolic analyzer and gas chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/Q-TOF MS) were utilized to analyze the effects of the compounds on mitochondrial bioenergetics in TNBC cells. A miRNA knockout technique and miRNA sponges were employed to evaluate the miR-4284 involvement in the anti-TNBC cell effect of either compound. Results: DETD-35 and DET attenuated TNBC cell migration toward hypoxic regions under a 2-19 % oxygen gradient in a timelapse microfluidic-based system. DETD-35 and DET also suppressed CSC-like phenotypes, including the expression of Sox2, Oct4, and CD44 in TNBC cells under hypoxic conditions. DETD-35 and DET affected mitochondrial basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, and primary metabolism, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and amino acid metabolism in the lung-metastatic TNBC cells. Furthermore, the expression of mitophagy markers PARKIN, BNIP3, PINK1, LC3-II, and apoptotic markers Bax, cleaved caspase 7, and cleaved PARP in hypoxic and lung-metastatic TNBC cells was also regulated by treatment with either compound. In miR-4284 knockout cells or miR-4284 inhibitor co-treated TNBC cells, DET- and DETD-35-induced over-expression of mitophagic and apoptotic markers was partially reversed, indicating miR-4284 involved with the compounds caused programmed cell death. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the novel activities of DETD-35 and DET in suppressing CSC-like phenotypes and metastatic TNBC cells through the de-regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics.

AB  - Glyphosate residues can tremendously impact the physiological mechanisms of tea plants, thus threatening tea security and human health. Herein, integrated physiological, metabolite, and proteomic analyses were performed to reveal the glyphosate stress response mechanism in tea plant. After exposure to glyphosate (>= 1.25 kg ae/ha), the leaf ultrastructure was damaged, and chlorophyll content and relative fluorescence intensity decreased significantly. The characteristic metabolites catechins and theanine decreased significantly, and the 18 volatile compounds content varied significantly under glyphosate treatments. Subsequently, tandem mass tags (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics was employed to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and to validate their biological functions at the proteome level. A total of 6287 proteins were identified and 326 DEPs were screened. These DEPs were mainly catalytic, binding, transporter and antioxidant active proteins, involved in photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, sugar and energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and stress/defense/detoxification pathway, etc. A total of 22 DEPs were validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), demonstrating that the protein abundances were consistent between TMT and PRM data. These findings contribute to our understanding of the damage of glyphosate to tea leaves and molecular mechanism underlying the response of tea plants to glyphosate.

AB  - The expansion of VapBC TA systems in M. tuberculosis has been linked with its fitness and survival upon exposure to stress conditions. Here, we have functionally characterized VapBC13 and VapBC26 TA modules of M. tuberculosis. We report that overexpression of VapC13 and VapC26 toxins in M. tuberculosis results in growth inhibition and transcriptional reprogramming. We have also identified various regulatory proteins as hub nodes in the top response network of VapC13 and VapC26 overexpression strains. Further, analysis of RNA protection ratios revealed potential tRNA targets for VapC13 and VapC26. Using in vitro ribonuclease assays, we demonstrate that VapC13 and VapC26 degrade serT and leuW tRNA, respectively. However, no significant changes in rRNA cleavage profiles were observed upon overexpression of VapC13 and VapC26 in M. tuberculosis. In order to delineate the role of these TA systems in M. tuberculosis physiology, various mutant strains were constructed. We show that in comparison to the parental strain, Delta vapBC13 and Delta vapBC26 strains were mildly susceptible to oxidative stress. Surprisingly, the growth patterns of parental and mutant strains were comparable in aerosol-infected guinea pigs. These observations imply that significant functional redundancy exists for some TA systems from M. tuberculosis.
   The ectopic expression of VapC13 and VapC26 results in transcriptional reprogramming of M. tuberculosis. Both, VapBC13 and VapBC26 TA systems are dispensable for infection in guinea pigs, suggesting a degree of functional redundancy in M. tuberculosis.

AB  - Oxidative stress and inflammation damage play pivotal roles in vascular dementia (VaD). Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), an intestinal microbiota-stemming metabolite, was reported to promote inflammation and oxidative stress, involved in the etiology of several diseases. Still, these effects have not been investigated in VaD. Here, we tested whether pre-existing, circulating, high levels of TMAO could affect VaD-induced cognitive decline. TMAO (120 mg/kg) was given to rats for a total of 8 weeks, and these rats underwent a sham operation or bilateral common carotid artery (2VO) surgery after 4 weeks of treatment. Four weeks after surgery, the 2VO rats exhibited hippocampal-dependent cognitive function declines and synaptic plasticity dysfunction, accompanied by an increase in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. TMAO administration, which increased plasma and hippocampal TMAO at 4 weeks postoperatively, further aggravated these effects, resulting in exaggerated cognitive and synaptic plasticity impairment, though not within the Sham group. Moreover, TMAO treatment activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and decreased SIRT1 protein expression within the hippocampus. However, these effects of TMAO were significantly attenuated by the overexpression of SIRT1. Our findings suggest that TMAO increases oxidative stress-induced neuroinflammation and apoptosis by inhibiting the SIRT1 pathway, thereby exacerbating cognitive dysfunction and neuropathological changes in VaD rats.

AB  - Background Anthracnose of Camellia oleifera is a very destructive disease that commonly occurs in the Camellia oleifera industry, which severely restricts the development of the Camellia oleifera industry. In the early stage of the Camellia oleifera suffering from anthracnose, only the diseased parts of the tree need to be repaired in time. With the aggravation of the disease, the diseased branches need to be eradicated, and severely diseased plants should be cut down in time. At present, aiming at the problems of complex experiments and low accuracy in detecting the degree of anthracnose of Camellia oleifera, a method is proposed to detect the degree of anthracnose of Camellia oleifera leaves by using terahertz spectroscopy (THz) combined with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), so as to realize the rapid, efficient, non-destructive and high-precision determination of the degree of anthracnose of Camellia oleifera. Results Mn, Ca, Ca II, Fe and other elements in the LIBS spectrum of healthy and infected Camellia oleifera leaves with different degrees of anthracnose are significantly different, and the Terahertz absorption spectra of healthy Camellia oleifera leaves, and Camellia oleifera leaves with different degrees of anthracnose there are also significant differences. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are used to establish the fusion spectrum anthracnose classification model of Camellia oleifera. Among them, the Root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and the prediction determination coefficient R(2)p of THz-LIBS-CARS-PLS-DA of prediction set are 0.110 and 0.995 respectively, and the misjudgment rate is 1.03%; The accuracy of the modeling set of THz (CARS)-LIBS (CARS)-SVM is 100%, and the accuracy of prediction set is 100%, after preprocessing of the multivariate scattering correction (MSC), the accuracy of the THz-LIBS-MSC-CARS modeling set is 100%, and the accuracy of prediction set is 100%; The accuracy rate of THz-LIBS-MSC-CARS-LDA of modeling set is 98.98%, and the accuracy rate of the prediction set is 96.87%. Conclusion The experimental results show that: the SVM model has higher qualitative analysis accuracy and is more stable than the PLS-DA and LDA models. The results showed that: the THz spectrum combined with the LIBS spectrum could be used to separate healthy Camellia oleifera leaves from various grades of anthracnose Camellia oleifera leaves non-destructively, quickly and accurately.

AB  - The growing prevalence of aged sleep-deprived nations is turning into a pandemic state. Acute sleep deprivation (SD) accompanies aging, changing the hippocampal cellular pattern, neurogenesis pathway expression, and aggravating cognitive deterioration. The present study investigated the ability of Near Infra Red (NIR) light laser to ameliorate cognitive impairment induced by SD in young and senile rats. Wistar rats <= 2 months (young) and >= 14 months (senile) were sleep-deprived for 72 h with or without transcranial administration of NIR laser of 830 nm. Our results showed that NIR photobiomodulation (PBM) attenuated cognitive deterioration made by SD in young, but not senile rats, while both sleep-deprived young and senile rats exhibited decreased anxiety (mania)-like behavior in response to PBM. NIR PBM had an inhibitory effect on AChE, enhanced the production of ACh, attenuated ROS, and regulated cell apoptosis factors such as Bax and Bcl-2. NIR increased mRNA expression of BDNF and GLP-1 in senile rats, thus facilitating neuronal survival and differentiation. The present findings also revealed that age exerts an additive factor to the cellular assaults produced by SD where hippocampal damages made in 2-month rats were less severe than those of the aged one. In conclusion, NIR PBM seems to promote cellular longevity of senile hippocampal cells by combating ROS, elevating neurotrophic factors, thus improving cognitive performance. The present findings provide NIR as a possible candidate for hippocampal neuronal insults accompanying aging and SD.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) toxicity severely restricts the growth and productivity of elephant grass in acidic soils around the world. However, the molecular mechanisms of Al response have not been investigated in elephant grass. In this study, we conducted phenotype, physiology, and transcriptome analysis of elephant grass roots in response to Al stress. Phenotypic analysis revealed that a low concentration of Al stress improved root growth while higher Al concentrations inhibit root growth. Al stress significantly increased the citrate (CA) content in roots, while the expression levels of genes related to citrate synthesis were substantially changed. The multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family were identified as hub genes in the co-expression network of Al response in elephant grass roots. Phylogenetic analysis showed that hub genes CpMATE93 and CpMATE158 belonged to the same clade as other MATE genes reported to be involved in citrate transport. Additionally, overexpression of CpMATE93 conferred Al resistance in yeast cells. These results provide a theoretical basis for further studies of molecular mechanisms in the elephant grass response to Al stress and could help breeders develop elite cultivars with Al tolerance.

AB  - Menopause is an endocrine shift leading to increased vulnerability for cognitive impairment and dementia risk factors, in part due to loss of neuroprotective circulating estrogens. Systemic replacement of estrogen postmenopause has limitations, including risk for estrogen-sensitive cancers. A promising therapeutic approach therefore might be to deliver estrogen only to the brain. We examined whether we could enhance cognitive performance by delivering estrogen exclusively to the brain in ovariectomized mice (a surgical menopause model). We treated mice with the prodrug 108,178-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED), which can be administered systemically but is converted to 178-estradiol only in the brain. Young and middle-aged C57BL/6 J mice received ovariectomy and subcutaneous implant containing vehicle or DHED and underwent cognitive testing to assess memory after 1-3.5 months of treatment. Low and medium doses of DHED did not alter metabolic status in middle-aged mice. In both age groups, DHED treatment improved spatial memory in ovariectomized mice. Additional testing in middle-aged mice showed that DHED treatment improved working and recognition memory in ovariectomized mice. These results lay the foundation for future studies determining if this intervention is as efficacious in models of dementia with comorbid risk factors.

AB  - Novelty detection, crucial to episodic memory formation, is impaired in epileptic patients with mesial temporal lobe resection. Mismatch novelty detection, that activates the hippocampal CA1 area in humans and is vital for memory reformulation and reconsolidation, is also impaired in patients with hippocampal lesions. In this work, we investigated the response to mismatch novelty, as occurs with the new location of known objects in a familiar environment, in the Li2+-pilocarpine rat model of TLE and its correlation with hippocampal monoaminergic markers. Animals showing spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) for at least 4 weeks at the time of behavioural testing showed impaired spatial learning in the radial arm maze, as described. Concurrently, SRS rats displayed impaired exploratory responses to mismatch novelty, yet novel object recognition was not significantly affected in SRS rats. While the levels of serotonin and dopamine transporters were mildly decreased in hippocampal membranes from SRS rats, the levels on the norepinephrine transporter, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase were enhanced, hinting for an augmentation, rather than an impairment in noradrenergic function in SRS animals. Altogether, this reveals that mismatch novelty detection is particularly affected by hippocampal damage associated to the Li2+-pilocarpine model of epilepsy 4-8 weeks after the onset of SRSs and suggests that deficits in mismatch novelty detection may substantially contribute to cognitive impairment in MTLE. As such, behavioural tasks based on these aspects of mismatch novelty may prove useful in the development of cognitive therapy strategies aiming to rescue cognitive deficits observed in epilepsy.

AB  - The trophectoderm (TE) is the first tissue to differentiate during the preimplantation development of the mammalian embryo. It forms the outer layer of the blastocyst and is responsible for generating the blastocoel, a fluid-filled cavity whose expansion is essential for successful hatching and implantation. Here, we investigated the role of the small GTPase RHOA in the morphogenesis of the TE, particularly its relationship with HIPPO signaling, using mouse embryos as a model. Inhibition of RHOA resulted in the failure to form a blastocoel and significantly altered the expression of numerous genes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 330 genes were down-regulated and 168 genes were up-regulated by more than two-fold. Notably, 98.4% of these transcriptional changes were reversed by simultaneous inhibition of LATS kinases, indicating that the transcriptional influence of RHOA is primarily mediated through HIPPO signaling. Many of the down-regulated genes are involved in critical processes of TE morphogenesis, such as apical-basal cell polarization, tight junction formation, and sodium and water transport, suggesting that RHOA supports TE development by enhancing the expression of morphogenesis-related genes through HIPPO signaling, specifically via TEAD transcription factors. However, RHOA inhibition also disrupted apical-basal polarity and tight junctions, effects that were not restored by LATS inhibition, pointing to additional HIPPO signaling-independent mechanisms by which RHOA controls TE morphogenesis. Furthermore, RHOA inhibition impaired cell viability at the late blastocyst stage, with partial rescue observed upon LATS inhibition, suggesting that RHOA maintains cell survival through both HIPPO signaling-dependent and-independent pathways. A deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing TE morphogenesis, including blastocoel expansion and cell viability, could significantly advance assisted reproductive technologies aimed at producing healthy blastocysts.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a secondary metabolite of fungi that is harmful to humans and animals. This study examined the protective effects of natural substances, including resveratrol, quercetin, vitamin E, vitamin C, and microbe-derived antioxidants (MA), on both human gastric mucosal cells (GES-1) and pig small intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-1) when induced by DON. Cells were incubated with active substances for 3 h and then exposed to DON for 24 h. The oxidative stress index, cell cycle, and apoptosis were measured. As compared to cells treated only with DON, pretreatment with active substances improved the balance of the redox status in cells caused by DON. Specifically, quercetin, vitamin E, vitamin C, and MA showed the potential to alleviate the G2 phase cell cycle arrest effect that was induced by DON in both kinds of cells. It was observed that vitamin E and vitamin C can alleviate DON-induced apoptosis and the G2 phase cycle arrest effect mediated via the ATM-Chk 2-Cdc 25C and ATM-P53 signaling pathways in GES-1 cells. In IPEC-1 cells, vitamin C and MA can alleviate both DON-induced apoptosis and the G2 phase cycle arrest effect via the ATM-Chk 2-Cdc 25C signaling pathway. Different bioactive substances utilize different protective mechanisms against DON in interacting with different cells. The proper addition of vitamin E and vitamin C to food can neutralize the toxic effect of DON, while the addition of vitamin C and MA to animal feed can reduce the harm DON does to animals.

AB  - Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a highly contagious and fatal disease of cattle and buffaloes and causes major economic losses to farmers. Though indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test has been used to detect a specific antibody against P. multocida, it has low specificity for sero-diagnosis of HS. Therefore, development of a rapid, highly sensitive and specific serological test is a prerequisite for detection of antibodies against HS. In this context, we explored an in-house ELISA method using recombinant antigens for detection of antibodies against P. multocida in bovines. nanH gene from P. multocida B:2 strain P52 was cloned and the recombinant mature protein with a C-and N-terminal truncation was produced as a fusion protein (& SIM;63 kDa) in Escherichia coli. The immunogenic potential of purified rNanH-Tr was assessed by the Western blot method using specific anti-rNanH-Tr antibody responses in sera collected from immunized rabbits. An indirect-ELISA based on rNanH-Tr was developed and optimized. Furthermore, the rNanH-Tr ELISA was applied to screen bovine serum samples (n=250). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the detection of anti P. multocida specific antibodies indicated a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.2 (CI 73.26-96.80%) and specificity of 80.0 (63.06-91.56%). No cross reactivity was noted with antibodies against other bovine diseases (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease and brucellosis). Screening of random bovine serum samples showed a 22% sero-positivity for anti P. multocida specific antibodies.

AB  - This study explores the antioxidant activity of green tea (Camellia sinensis, GT) and peppermint (Mentha x piperita, PM) infusions, individually and in combination, focusing on how preparation methods affect their efficacy. Antiradical and intracellular antioxidant activity was assessed using DPPH, ABTS, and DCF assays, alongside interaction analysis via combination index (CI) and dose reduction index (DRI). HPLC analysis determined the polyphenolic profiles of GT and PM. GT showed the strongest antioxidant activity, with the lowest IC50 values (4.81 mu g/mL in DPPH, 2.70 mu g/mL in ABTS, 3.71 mu g/mL in DCF), indicating potent radical-scavenging potential. PM exhibited moderate antiradical capacity but similar intracellular activity (IC50 = 3.80 mu g/mL). Co-maceration followed by lyophilization of GT:PM extracts led to nearly additive interactions (CI similar to 1.0) and allowed significant dose reduction (DRI up to 4.44). In contrast, post-mixed extracts showed assay-dependent effects, including antagonism in intracellular ROS inhibition (CI = 1.83). Equimolar mixtures of model polyphenols: EGCG, quercetin, and rosmarinic acid demonstrated enhanced effects, with the strongest synergy in ternary mixtures (CI = 0.67-0.86), potentially achievable in GT:PM combinations. These findings highlight that extract preparation critically influences antioxidant efficacy, supporting co-maceration as a promising strategy for developing effective functional formulations based on plant extract combinations.

AB  - Plants perceive herbivory-induced volatiles and respond to them by upregulating their defenses. To date, the organs responsible for volatile perception remain poorly described. Here, we show that responsiveness to the herbivory-induced green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (HAC) in terms of volatile emission, transcriptional regulation, and jasmonate defense hormone activation is largely constrained to younger maize leaves. Older leaves are much less sensitive to HAC. In a given leaf, responsiveness to HAC is high at immature developmental stages and drops off rapidly during maturation. Responsiveness to the non-volatile elicitor ZmPep3 shows an opposite pattern, demonstrating that this form of hyposmia (i.e., decreased sense of smell) is not due to a general defect in jasmonate defense signaling in mature leaves. Neither stomatal conductance nor leaf cuticle composition explains the unresponsiveness of older leaves to HAC, suggesting perception mechanisms upstream of jasmonate signaling as driving factors. Finally, we show that hyposmia in older leaves is not restricted to HAC and extends to the full blend of herbivory-induced volatiles. In conclusion, our work identifies immature maize leaves as dominant stress volatile-sensing organs. The tight spatiotemporal control of volatile perception may facilitate within plant defense signaling to protect young leaves and may allow plants with complex architectures to explore the dynamic odor landscapes at the outer periphery of their shoots.

AB  - The hippocampus forms unique neural representations for distinct experiences, supporting the formation of different memories.1-6 Hippocampal representations gradually change over time as animals repeatedly visit the same familiar environment ("representational drift").7-12 Such drift has also been observed in other brain areas, such as the parietal,13,14 visual,15-17 auditory,18,19 and olfactory20 cortices. While the underlying mechanisms of representational drift remain unclear, a leading hypothesis suggests that it results from ongoing learning processes.20-22 According to this hypothesis, because the brain uses the same neural substrates to support multiple distinct representations, learning of novel stimuli or environments leads to changes in the neuronal representation of a familiar one. If this is true, we would expect drift in a given environment to increase following new experiences in other, unrelated environments (i.e., off-context experiences). To test this hypothesis, we longitudinally recorded large populations of hippocampal neurons in mice while they repeatedly visited a familiar linear track over weeks. We introduced off-context experiences by placing mice in a novel environment for 1 h after each visit to the familiar track. Contrary to our expectations, these novel episodes decreased place cells' representational drift. Our findings are consistent with a model in which representations of distinct memories occupy different areas within the neuronal activity space, and the drift of each of them within that space is constrained by the area occupied by the others.

AB  - Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a key diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), interacting with Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways related to cancer proliferation. Modulating GPC3 gene expression can induce liver cancer cell death by disrupting growth factor signaling, cell adhesion, and metabolic regulation. This study presents the development of a non-viral ultralarge porous CRISPR-Cas9 silica nano-depot to perform targeted GPC3 genome editing for the treatment of HCC. The synthesized ultralarge porous silica nano-depot (UPSND) encapsulates substantial CRISPR-Cas9-ribonucleoprotein complexes with a remarkable 98.3% loading efficiency. The UPSND-mediated GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 therapy significantly suppresses cancer cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways. The efficiency of GPC3 gene deletion is observed to be 5.1-fold higher than that of commercial lipid-based GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 in both human and murine genes, with minimal off-target effects. In vivo systemic administration of GPC3 Cas9-RNP@UPSND resulted in preferential accumulation within hepatic tissues in orthotopic HCC mouse models, leading to complete tumor eradication and enhancing T-cell tumor-infiltration. Furthermore, the GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9@UPSND treatment exhibits superior anti-proliferative efficacy in tumor-growth prevention compared to Codrituzumab, as evidenced by the analysis of Ki67 and GPC3 expression, along with serum GPC3 levels. These findings underscore the translational potential of the non-viral UPSND nanoplatform-based CRISPR GPC3 genome editing, offering a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.
