AB  - The European hedgehog population is declining in Europe. It is therefore important to investigate the causes for the decline and monitor the general health of the species. We investigated the endoparasite occurrence in 299 dead European hedgehogs. Of these, endoparasites were detected in 69% of the individuals tested. We identified Crenosoma striatum, Capillaria aerophila (syn. Eucoleus aerophilus), Capillaria spp., coccidia, Cryptosporidium spp., Brachylaemus spp. and Capillaria hepatica. We also examined the hedgehogs for Giardia spp. and Echinococcus multilocularis but all were negative. Coccidia (n = 7, 2.5%) and Cryptosporidium spp. (n = 14, 5.2%) were only detected in individuals from Zealand, Lolland and Jutland south of the Limfjord. Single cases of Brachylaemus spp. (n = 1, 0.4%) and Capillaria hepatica (n = 1, 1.1%) were exclusively discovered in Jutland south and north of the Limfjord, respectively. These results indicate a regional difference in endoparasite species carried by European hedgehogs in Denmark. This stresses the need for hedgehogs to be cared for locally when admitted to wildlife rehabilitation centres, and to be released within their area of origin, to prevent spread of endoparasite infections among hedgehogs. Additionally, we explored the following possible determinants of parasite infection in the hedgehogs: sex, age, mortality category (in-care, natural and roadkill), infection with MRSA, genetic heterozygosity, month of death, geographical location and habitat type, and found that only age had a statistically significant effect on endoparasite prevalence, as we detected a lower occurrence of endoparasites in juvenile hedgehogs (<1 year) compared to the other age classes. However, pairwise comparisons of geographical regions did show significant differences in endoparasite occurrence: Zealand vs. Jutland south of the Limfjord and Zealand vs. Falster. We conclude that, in line with previous studies of European hedgehogs throughout their range in Western Europe, endoparasite infections are common and a natural part of their ecology.

AB  - Main conclusion A beta-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase II (KAS2) like enzyme and a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAT2) from Consolida ajacis catalyze gondoic acid biosynthesis and incorporation into the sn-2 position of seed TAG in engineered Camelina sativa.
   Gondoic acid (cis-11 eicosenoic acid, 20:1 increment 11) is the predominant very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) in camelina (Camelina sativa) seed oil accounting for 12-15% of total triacylglycerol fatty acids. To explore the feasibility of engineering increased levels of this fatty acid in camelina seed, oils from a range of plant species were analyzed to identify those producing 20-Carbon (C20) fatty acids as the only VLCFAs in their seed oil. Seeds of Consolida and Delphinium species (Ranunculaceae) were found to contain moderate levels (0.2% to 25.5%) of C20 fatty acids without accompanying longer chain fatty acids. The C20 fatty acids were abundant in both sn-2 and sn-1/3 positions of seed TAG in Consolida, but were largely absent from the sn-2 position in Delphinium seed TAG. Through generation of a developing seed transcriptome, sequences were identified and cDNAs amplified from Consolida ajacis encoding a beta-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase II like protein (CaKAS2B) that lacked a predicted chloroplast transit peptide, and two homologues of Arabidopsis thaliana lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 2 (CaLPAT2a and CaLPAT2b). Expression of CaKAS2B in conventional (WT) camelina and a line previously engineered for high seed oleic acid content (HO) resulted in increased seed VLCFA content. Total VLCFA levels were raised from 24 to 35% and from 7 to 23% in T3 seed from representative transformants in the WT and HO backgrounds, respectively. Gondoic acid was the predominant VLCFA in transformed HO lines with low endogenous cytoplasmic fatty acid elongation activity, suggesting limited capacity of CaKAS2B to elongate beyond C20. Expression in camelina of CaLPAT2b resulted in significantly increased C20-VLCFA esterification at the sn-2 position of seed TAG with VLCFA levels of 33.8% in this position in one transformed line compared to 0.3% at sn-2 in the corresponding control line. Only small changes in total seed VLCFA content were observed in transformed lines implying that increased VLCFA esterification capacity in camelina results in positional redistribution of VLCFAs but does not significantly enhance flux through the fatty acid elongation pathway. The full potential of CaKAS2B and CaLPAT2a for the engineering of high gondoic acid levels in camelina remains to be determined. Seed fatty acid composition of Consolida and Delphinium also provides information that may be of value in the systematics of the Ranunculaceae.

AB  - Substance addiction causes anxiety, which in turn reinforces the maintaining of substance use, resulting in a vicious circle. And this circle is one of the reasons why addiction is so hard to cure. However, there is no treatment involved in addiction-induced anxiety at present. We tested whether VNS (vagus nerve stimulation) can improve heroin-induced anxiety, and made a comparison between nVNS (transcervical vagus nerve stimulation) and taVNS (transauricular vagus nerve stimulation) on therapeutic effect. Mice were subjected to nVNS or taVNS before heroin administration. By observing c-Fos expression in the NTS (nucleus of the solitary tract), we assessed vagal fiber activation. Using the OFT (open field test) and the EPM (elevated cross maze test), we evaluated the anxiety-like behaviors of the mice. Using immuno-fluorescence, we observed the proliferation and activation of microglia in the hippocampus. And ELISA was used to measure the levels of proinflammatory factors in the hippocampus. Both nVNS and taVNS significantly increased the expression of c-Fos in the nucleus of solitary tract, suggesting the feasibility of nVNS and taVNS. The anxiety level of heroin-treated mice was significantly increased, microglia in the hippocampus was significantly proliferated and activated, and the proinflammatory factors (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a) in the hippocampus were significantly up-regulated. Crucially, both nVNS and taVNS reversed the above changes caused by heroin addiction.Significance: It was confirmed that the therapeutic effect of VNS on heroin-induced anxiety may be an effective treatment method to break the "addiction-anxiety" cycle and provides some insights for sub-sequent treatment of addiction.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The range of Babesia microti (Franca, 1910)-infected ticks is expanding, resulting in locally acquired human babesiosis cases occurring in new areas: Maryland (2009), the District of Columbia (2013), Virginia (2016), and West Virginia (2017). We collected host-seeking ticks from old fields, ecotones, forested habitats and animal hosts in Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, 2010 to 2024. Ixodes scapularis Say, the tick vector of babesiosis, was captured in all 3 states. PCR revealed B. microti in 2.7% (36/1310) of I. scapularis, with site prevalence ranging from <1% to 12.5% infected. The first B. microti-positive I. scapularis was collected in Northampton County, Virginia, 2012. Of the B. microti-infected ticks, 50% (18/36) were coinfected with Borrelia burgdorferi and one was triple-infected with B. microti, B. burgdorferi, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. We collected Ixodes keiransi Beati, Nava, Venzal, and Guglielmone ticks from Delaware and Virginia. We found B. microti and B. burgdorferi in those from Virginia, and B. burgdorferi in ticks from a shrew in Delaware. To our knowledge, this is the first report of B. microti and B. burgdorferi-positive I. keiransi from Virginia, and the first report of B. burgdorferi-positive I. keiransi from Delaware. Ixodes keiransi ticks rarely bite humans but are involved in the maintenance and spread of pathogens when sympatric with I. scapularis. We tested a subset of both tick species for Babesia duncani; none were positive. Jurisdictions in the southern mid-Atlantic region should expect babesiosis cases, and Lyme disease and anaplasmosis coinfections, and healthcare providers should consider these tick-borne infections as part of the differential diagnosis.

AB  - Context memory formation is a complex process that requires transcription in many subregions of the brain including the dorsal hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. One critical gene necessary for memory formation is the circadian gene Period1 (Per1), which has been shown to function in the dorsal hippocampus to modulate spatial memory in addition to its well-documented role in regulating the diurnal clock within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). We recently found that alterations in Per1 expression in the dorsal hippocampus can modulate spatial memory formation, with reduced hippocampal Per1 impairing memory and overexpression of Per1 ameliorating age-related impairments in spatial memory. Whether Per1 similarly functions within other memory-relevant brain regions is currently unknown. Here, to test whether Per1 is a general mechanism that modulates memory across the brain, we tested the role of Per1 in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a brain region necessary for context memory formation. First, we demonstrate that context fear conditioning drives a transient increase in Per1 mRNA expression within the anterior RSC that peaks 60 m after training. Next, using HSVCRISPRi-mediated knockdown of Per1, we show that reducing Per1 within the anterior RSC before context fear acquisition impairs memory in both male and female mice. In contrast, overexpressing Per1 with either HSVCRISPRa or HSV-Per1 before context fear acquisition drives a sex-specific memory impairment; males show impaired context fear memory whereas females are not affected by Per1 overexpression. Finally, as Per1 levels are known to rhythmically oscillate across the day/night cycle, we tested the possibility that Per1 overexpression might have different effects on memory depending on the time of day. In contrast to the impairment in memory we observed during the daytime, Per1 overexpression has no effect on context fear memory during the night in either male or female mice. Together, our results indicate that Per1 modulates memory in the anterior retrosplenial cortex in addition to its documented role in regulating memory within the dorsal hippocampus, although this role may differ between males and females.

AB  - Simple Summary In South Africa, African lions (Panthera leo) are bred on farms for commercial purposes such as tourism, trophy hunting, and the international traditional medicine market. Despite its legal status, South Africa's growing lion farming industry is a contentious issue. In 2020, a high-level panel was appointed to review the policies, legislation, and management of breeding, hunting, trade, and handling of four wildlife species, namely rhino, elephant, leopard, and lions. In May 2021, it was announced that the government will stop issuing permits to new entrants into this industry as well as the issuance of hunting permits and will start amending permit conditions to prohibit breeding and exclude tourism interactions with captive lions, effectively ending the lion farming industry. In order to follow this line of action, a comprehensive, well-managed plan will be required to ensure a responsible transition away from the current industry. Here, using a "gap analysis" management tool, we outline some of the key considerations necessary for a responsible, well-managed exit from the lion farming industry in South Africa. We compiled key background information about the current state of the industry and use this information to identify desired management states and specific steps that could facilitate a successful phase out of lion farming. African lions (Panthera leo) are commercially farmed across South Africa for sport hunting, tourism, and the international bone trade, primarily in Southeast Asia. Despite its legal status, South Africa's growing lion farming industry is a contentious issue. In 2020 a high-level panel was initiated to review the policies, legislation, and management regarding the breeding, hunting, trade, and handling of four wildlife species, including lions. In May 2021, it was announced that the government intends to amend existing permit conditions to prohibit lion breeding and tourism interactions with captive lions, as well as to stop issuing permits to new entrants into the industry, effectively ending lion farming. In order to follow this line of action, a comprehensive, well-managed plan will be necessary to execute a responsible exit from the industry as it currently stands. Using a "gap analysis" management tool, we aim to: (1) outline some of the key considerations regarding the current state of the lion farming industry in South Africa; and (2) propose specific action steps that could be taken within five key areas (regulation, animal welfare, health and safety, equitability, and conservation) to help inform a responsible transition away from this type of wildlife farming in the biodiversity economy. For our gap analysis, we conducted a semi-systematic literature search to compile key background information about the current state of the industry. This information was then used to identify corresponding desired management states, and steps that could facilitate a successful phase out of lion farming in South Africa. We hope our approach helps identify key considerations for a responsible transition and can help aid decisions during the management of this process.

AB  - Tagging proliferating cells with thymidine analogs is an indispensable research tool; however, the issue of the potential in vivo cytotoxicity of these compounds remains unresolved. Here, we address these concerns by examining the effects of BrdU and EdU on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and EdU on the perinatal somatic development of mice. We show that, in a wide range of doses, EdU and BrdU label similar numbers of cells in the dentate gyrus shortly after administration. Furthermore, whereas the administration of EdU does not affect the division and survival of neural progenitor within 48 h after injection, it does affect cell survival, as evaluated 6 weeks later. We also show that a single injection of various doses of EdU on the first postnatal day does not lead to noticeable changes in a panel of morphometric criteria within the first week; however, higher doses of EdU adversely affect the subsequent somatic maturation and brain growth of the mouse pups. Our results indicate the potential caveats in labeling the replicating DNA using thymidine analogs and suggest guidelines for applying this approach.

AB  - Aboveground and belowground herbivory can alter host quality and trophic interactions. However, little research has explored the impacts of belowground herbivory on plant virus epidemiology. To understand this interaction in sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas L. (Lam), we studied the impact of herbivory by sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius elegantulus (Summers), to storage roots on vector herbivore, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), the green peach aphid, and Aphis gossypii Glover, the cotton aphid, feeding behavior (M. persicae and A. gossypii) and population dynamics (M. persicae only as A. gossypii does not colonize sweetpotato). In addition, a nonvector herbivore, Chrysodeixis includens (Walker), the soybean looper, weight gain was included for comparison. Infestations of sweetpotato weevil in storage roots reduced C. includens weight gain and M. persicae intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-o), and finite rate of increase (lambda) on aboveground portions of the plant. In probing behaviors related to nonpersistent virus spread (30 min trials), M. persicae probed less often, took longer to reach the first pd (potential drop), had shorter II-3 (intracellular subphase sap ingestion) durations, and had fewer archlets on plants infested with C. formicarius elegantulus. Total phloem duration did not differ between treatments, indicating that the lowered performance of M. persicae on infested plants was not due to discrepancies in probing duration. Results were less clear for A. gossypii. Thus, in sweetpotato, belowground herbivory can alter plant virus vector abundance and behavior. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these changes in behavior could improve plant virus vector integrated pest management.

AB  - Simple Summary To elucidate the cotton plant's defense mechanism against Apolygus lucorum, the transcriptomic and metabolomic differences in cotton plants after infestation with A. lucorum were investigated. The results showed that A. lucorum feeding elicits a rapid and strong defense response involved in many primary and secondary metabolic processes during the whole infestation process. The jasmonic acid pathway was shown to mediate the defense mechanisms in cotton plants, and the salicylic acid pathway was attenuated after damage from A. lucorum. The accumulation of condensed tannins was also promoted in cotton plants as a defense mechanism against A. lucorum. These results provided comprehensive insights into the defense system and will help us to discover unknown defensive genes and improve the integrated pest management of A. lucorum. With the wide-scale adoption of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, Apolygus lucorum (Meyer-Dur) has become the most serious pest and has caused extensive yield loss in cotton production. However, little is known about the defense responses of cotton at the seedling stage to A. lucorum feeding. In this study, to elucidate the cotton defense mechanism, cotton leaves were damaged by A. lucorum for 0, 4, 12 and 24 h. The transcriptomic results showed that A. lucorum feeding elicits a rapid and strong defense response in gene expression during the whole infestation process in cotton plants. Further analysis revealed that at each assessment time, more differentially expressed genes were up-regulated than down-regulated. The integrated analysis of transcriptomic and metabolic data showed that most of the genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis were initially up-regulated, and this trend continued during an infestation. Meanwhile, the content levels of JA and its intermediate products were also significantly increased throughout the whole infestation process. The similar trend was displayed in condensed tannins biosynthesis. This research proved that, after plants are damaged by A. lucorum, the JA pathway mediates the defense mechanisms in cotton plants by promoting the accumulation of condensed tannins as a defense mechanism against A. lucorum. These results will help us to discover unknown defensive genes and improve the integrated pest management of A. lucorum.

AB  - This review evaluates the effect of HCG and LH supplementation during ovarian stimulation. Controlled trials were divided into four groups comparing the treatment effect of recombinant FSH (r-FSH) with urinary FSH (u-FSH), with human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG), with r-FSH + recombinant LH (r-LH) and with rFSH + recombinant HCG (r-HCG). First r-FSH seemed to be more potent than u-FSH in downregulated women, which translated into more follicles and oocytes. In line, numerous trials comparing HMG (containing u-FSH + u-HCG) with r-FSH demonstrated that HMG recruited fewer follicles, thus providing fewer oocytes but resulted in slightly higher pregnancy rates after a first fresh embryo transfer. The latter may be explained by the higher potency of r-FSH resulting in more and higher premature progesterone rises. Prospective trials addressing r-FSH + r-LH compared with r-FSH could not demonstrate any difference in pregnancy rates in normal or poor responders. A placebo-controlled trial of r-HCG added to a fixed daily r-FSH dose revealed that r-HCG inhibited the growth of intermediate follicles, resulting in fewer oocytes, fewer embryos and lower pregnancy rates. In conclusion, the beneficial effect of HCG and LH supplementation on clinical outcome has never been definitely proven for any of the combined gonadotrophin products.

AB  - The present study was conducted to determine the effect of freeze drying (FD), vacuum drying (VD), sun drying (SD) and hot air oven/tray drying (HD) drying on antioxidant activity, antimicrobial activity and color of Camellia assamica (two samples) collected from Kokrajhar area, Assam. The objective of this study is to observe effect of different drying methods on antioxidant, antimicrobial activity and color of Camellia assamica. In the experiment, to determine the antioxidant activity DPPH assay was used. Color of the tea samples are measured with Haunter Lab colorimeter and antimicrobial activity is done by disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli. Experimental evidence has shown that freeze drying exhibit rich source of polyphenol content and flavoind content than the vacuum drying, normal drying and hot air oven drying present in tea. The maximum TPC calculated was 194.5 +/- 9.72, TFC of 58.7 +/- 2.93 (mg of QAE/gm tea extract), with an antioxidant activity of 87.22% amongst both the samples at - 40 degrees C, 72 h in FD. The color analysis for the FD sample was found to be lighter than other drying method at - 40 degrees C, 72 h with Delta L* = 41.3 CIE units, Delta E = 47.8 CIE units, Delta C = 25.6 CIE units and Delta H = 70.06 degrees and analytically chlorophyll was found to be Ch-a = 2.23 (mg/gm), Ch-b = 1.88 (mg/gm), in comparison of both the samples. The maximum inhibition zone was formed of 4.3 cm for FD and against 3 cm for VD sample.

AB  - A new microbothriid monogenean Dermopristis pterophilus n. sp. is described from the skin of the Critically Endangered green sawfish Pristis zijsron Bleeker, 1851 in the Ashburton River delta, northern Western Australia. Analyses of the 285 ribosomal DNA marker and the molecular barcoding markers Histone 3 and Elongation Factor 1 alpha confirmed position among the Microbothriidae, with close affinity to the only other sequenced representative of Dermopristis Kearn, Whittington and Evans-Gming, 2010. The new species is morphologically consistent with the concept of Dermopristis; it has two testes, lacks a male copulatory organ and has a simple haptor. It is smaller than its two congeners D. paradoxus Kearn, Whittington and Evans-Gowing, 2010 and D. cairae Whittington and Kearn, 2011 and is most similar to the former, distinguished only in that it lacks the strong, transverse, parallel ridges on the ventral body surface that characterise that species. It is more easily distinguished from D. cairae, differing in body shape, possession of a seminal receptacle, and relative position and size of the haptor. It may further differ from both species by fine details of the gut diverticula, although these details are difficult to ascertain. Spermatophores were observed in the new species, similar to those previously reported for D. cairae. The new species exhibits site attachment preference: infections were greatest on and immediately adjacent to the host pelvic fins (including male reproductive organs, i.e. claspers), moderate in proximity to the dorsal and pectoral fins, few on the caudal fin and peduncle, and infrequently, isolated worms occurred elsewhere on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body. There was no incidence of infection on the head (including rostrum). We presume D. pterophilus is restricted to P. zijsron and thus likely faces the same threat of extinction.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulates many aspects of RNA metabolism and is involved in learning and memory processes. Yet, the impact of a dysregulation of post-transcriptional m6A editing on synaptic impairments in neurodegenerative disorders remains unknown. Here we investigated the m6A methylation pattern in the hippocampus of Huntington's disease (HD) mice and the potential role of the m6A RNA modification in HD cognitive symptomatology. m6A modifications were evaluated in HD mice subjected to a hippocampal cognitive training task through m6A immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and the relative levels of m6A-modifying proteins (FTO and METTL14) by subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis. Stereotaxic CA1 hippocampal delivery of AAV-shFTO was performed to investigate the effect of RNA m6A dysregulation in HD memory deficits. Our results reveal a m6A hypermethylation in relevant HD and synaptic related genes in the hippocampal transcriptome of Hdh(+/Q111) mice. Conversely, m6A is aberrantly regulated in an experience-dependent manner in the HD hippocampus leading to demethylation of important components of synapse organization. Notably, the levels of RNA demethylase (FTO) and methyltransferase (METTL14) were modulated after training in the hippocampus of WT mice but not in Hdh(+/Q111) mice. Finally, inhibition of FTO expression in the hippocampal CA1 region restored memory disturbances in symptomatic Hdh(+/Q111) mice. Altogether, our results suggest that a differential RNA methylation landscape contributes to HD cognitive symptoms and uncover a role of m6A as a novel hallmark of HD.

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of unilateral axotomy of urinary bladder trigone (UBT)-projecting nerve fibers from the right anterior pelvic ganglion (APG) on changes in the chemical coding of their neuronal bodies. The study was performed using male pigs with immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The animals were divided into a control (C), a morphological (MG) or a molecular biology group (MBG). APG neurons supplying UBT were revealed using the retrograde tracing technique with Fast Blue (FB). Unilateral axotomy resulted in an over 50% decrease in the number of FB+ neurons in both APG ganglia. Immunohistochemistry revealed significant changes in the chemical coding of FB+ cells only in the right ganglion: decreased expression of dopamine-B-hydroxylase (DBH)/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and up-regulation of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT)/choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), galanin (GAL), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and brain nitric oxide synthase (bNOS). The qPCR results partly corresponded with immunofluorescence findings. In the APGs, genes for VAChT and ChAT, TH and DBH, VIP, and NOS were distinctly down-regulated, while the expression of GAL was up-regulated. Such data may be the basis for further studies concerning the plasticity of these ganglia under experimental or pathological conditions.

AB  - This study integrates denudation analysis with morphotectonic characteristics, facies associations and drainage analysis to investigate the landscape evolution of SW Anatolia. Age-Elevation Relationship (AER) plots of published thermochronological data from drainage divides, valleys and preserved paleo-geomorphological landscape remnants provide insight into the region's drainage evolution. Cooling and denudation events identify the timing of divide formation, windgap formation and divide breaching, which leads to watergap formation.We have subdivided SW Anatolia into distinct morphotectonic domains. Among these, the Gediz and B & uuml;y & uuml;k Menderes faults and the Selimiye Shear Zone fragmented the Menderes Metamorphic Core Complex into three each of which experienced different cooling histories based on denudation analysis utilizing various low-temperature thermochronometers.Hypsometric integral and channel profile analyses demonstrate significant variation in landscape maturity and drainage basin modifications over time. These analyses, combined with the interpretation and mapping of windgaps, watergaps and stream deflections, as well as the depositional environments of sediments and volcanic sequences, enable the reconstruction of drainage patterns from the early Miocene to Recent.During the middle Miocene, the Sakarya drainage basin dominated central and eastern SW Anatolia, with the Gediz drainage basin being a minor part of the K & uuml;& ccedil;& uuml;k Menderes basin. The B & uuml;y & uuml;k Menderes drainage basin, in contrast, drained the southern portion of SW Anatolia, while the Bak & imath;r & ccedil;ay catchment extended into the northern Gediz basin. By the late Miocene, the Sakarya drainage basin had lost a significant portion of its hinterland to the Gediz basin and several newly isolated basins, while also capturing the Burdur and Bey & scedil;ehir basins, along with the mid- and upstream sections of the B & uuml;y & uuml;k Menderes basin, thereby reducing its area by two-thirds. In the Pliocene, the Gediz drainage basin contracted by approximately 80%, while the B & uuml;y & uuml;k Menderes basin expanded to absorb the Gediz and Tavas basins. During the Quaternary, the B & uuml;y & uuml;k Menderes basin further shrank by around 60% as isolated basins formed in the east. Recent tectonic activity has led to the Gediz basin recapturing parts of its upstream area, while the B & uuml;y & uuml;k Menderes basin regained previously isolated sections of the Gediz basin. The Dalaman and E & scedil;en & ccedil;ay basins also captured upstream isolated basins, while the Burdur basin was captured by the Aksu River, isolating the Bey & scedil;ehir basin from Burdur.These episodes of drainage reorganization are driven by dynamic topography, influenced by slab-edge processes and intensified by the westward escape of the Anatolian Block. The westward motion, combined with slab-tear-driven vertical movements, has led to substantial reconfiguration of the drainage networks in SW Anatolia over time.

AB  - Brassica rapa L., a traditional Tibetan medicine, has been wildly used for treating plateau disease. Polysaccharide is an important chemical component in B. rapa. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of B. rapa polysaccharide (BRP) against acute highaltitude hypoxia (AHH) induced brain injury and its metabolic mechanism. The rats were randomly divided into six groups: control group, AHH group, Hongjingtian oral liquid group, and three BRP groups (38, 75, and 150 mg/kg/d). Serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected by commercial biochemical kits. Hippocampus and cortex histopathological changes were observed by H&E staining and Nissl staining. Neuronal apoptosis was observed by TUNEL staining. The protein and gene expression of Caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, HIF-1a, microRNA 210, ISCU1/2, and COX10 were detected by western blotting and qRT-PCR. Then, a brain metabolomics method based on UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS was performed to discover potential biomarkers and analyze metabolic pathways. It was found that BRP decreased levels of MDA, LDH, and GSSG, increased GSH and SOD, reduced the pathological changes, inhibited apoptosis, and activated the PI3K/Akt/HIF-1a signaling pathway as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, enhanced protein expression of HIF-1a and gene levels of microRNA210, ISCU1/2, and COX10. Furthermore, 15 endogenous potential biomarkers were identified in the brain through metabolomics analysis. BRP can regulate 7 potential biomarkers and the corresponding metabolic pathways were mainly associated with pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Collectively, BRP has a clear protective effect on AHH-induced brain injury and its mechanisms may be related to ameliorate oxidative stress injury, inhibit apoptosis by activating PI3K/Akt/HIF-1a signaling pathway, and reverse metabolic pathway disturbances.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC), a common conflict between human and wildlife, is increasing in occurrence. To mitigate HEC, the typical final option is the translocation of conflict elephants into better-protected areas. This study tracked a sub-adult male elephant, fitted with a satellite collar, to see how it adapted to its new habitat after being translocated over 100 km away from its previous conflict zone. After 90 days, the elephant showed adaptation to its new environment. It spent 48% of its home range and 66% of its time within an ecological corridor near the translocation site. The individual preferred secondary forest, with 78.9% of its home range within secondary forest. Based on its home range, hotspots, habitat use and wildlife corridor usage, we concluded that the elephant had adapted well to its new habitat without causing conflict or exhibiting any homing behaviour. Practical implication: To enhance the success of conflict elephant translocation, we recommend relocating only sub-adult males into selected protected natural habitats to minimize the risk of future conflicts.
   Konflik manusia-gajah (HEC) adalah antara konflik manusia-hidupan liar yang paling kerap berlaku dan meningkat setiap tahun. Untuk mengurangkan HEC, pilihan terakhir yang biasa diambil adalah dengan pemindahan gajah konflik ke kawasan yang lebih baik. Kajian ini menjejak seekor gajah jantan sub-dewasa (Kalai) yang dipasang kolar satelit untuk menilai bagaimana ia menyesuaikan diri di habitat baru selepas dipindahkan lebih 100 km dari kawasan konflik asalnya. Selepas 90 hari, Kalai menunjukkan tanda-tanda penyesuaian terhadap persekitaran baru. Gajah ini menghabiskan 48% daripada kawasan keliarannya dan 66% daripada masanya dalam koridor ekologi berhampiran tapak pemindahan. Individu ini menunjukkan pemilihan habitat yang tertinggi dalam hutan sekunder, dengan 78.9% daripada kawasan keliarannya terletak dalam hutan sekunder. Berdasarkan kawasan keliaran, kawasan titik panas, penggunaan habitat dan penggunaan koridor hidupan liar, dapat disimpulkan bahawa gajah tersebut telah menyesuaikan diri dengan baik di habitat barunya tanpa menyebabkan konflik atau menunjukkan tingkah laku kembali ke kawasan asal. Implikasi praktikal: Bagi meningkatkan kejayaan pemindahan gajah konflik, kami mengesyorkan hanya gajah jantan sub-dewasa dipindahkan ke habitat semula jadi terpilih yangdilindungi bagi mengurangkan risiko konflik pada masa hadapan.

AB  - The number of neurons in the developing brain is greater than typically found in adulthood, and the brain possesses delicate mechanisms to induce the death of excess cells and refine neural circuitry. The correct tuning between the processes of neuronal death and survival generates a mature and functional brain in its complexity and plastic capacity. Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological condition worldwide, including among young individuals. However, exposure to the main treatment approaches, the long-term use of Antiseizure Medication (ASM), during the critical period of development can induce a series of changes in this delicate balance. Acting by various mechanisms of action, ASMs may induce an increase in neuronal death, something that translates into deleterious neuropsychiatric effects in adulthood. Several investigations conducted in recent years have brought to light new aspects related to this dynamic, yet many questions, such as the cellular mechanisms of death and the pathophysiology of late effects, still have unresolved elements. In this review, we aimed to explore the mechanisms of action of the most widely used ASMs in the treatment of neonatal epilepsy, the broad aspects of neuronal death in the developing brain and the repercussions of this death and other effects in adulthood. We review the evidence indicating a relationship between exposure to ASMs and the manifestation of associated psychiatric comorbidities in adulthood and discuss some possible mechanisms underlying the induction of this process by morphological and physiological changes in the related behaviors.

AB  - Brain acid signaling plays important roles in both physiological and disease conditions. One key neuronal metabotropic proton receptor in the brain is GPR68, which contributes to hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and mediates neuroprotection in acidotic and ischemic conditions. Here, to gain greater understanding of GPR68 function in the brain, we performed mRNA-Seq analysis in mice. First, we studied sham-operated animals to determine baseline expression. Compared to wild type (WT), GPR68-/- (KO) brain downregulated genes that are enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms of misfolding protein binding, response to organic cyclic compounds, and endoplasmic reticulum chaperone complex. Next, we examined the expression profile following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). tMCAO-upregulated genes cluster to cytokine/chemokine-related functions and immune responses, while tMCAO-downregulated genes cluster to channel activities and synaptic signaling. For proton-sensitive receptors, tMCAO downregulated ASIC1a and upregulated GPR4 and GPR65, but had no effect on ASIC2, PAC, or GPR68. GPR68 deletion did not alter the expression of these proton receptors, either at baseline or after ischemia. Lastly, we performed GeneVenn analysis of differential genes at baseline and post-tMCAO. Ischemia upregulated the expression of three hemoglobin genes, along with H2-Aa, Ppbp, Siglece, and Tagln, in WT but not in KO. Immunostaining showed that tMCAO-induced hemoglobin localized to neurons. Western blot analysis further showed that hemoglobin induction is GPR68-dependent. Together, these data suggest that GPR68 deletion at baseline disrupts chaperone functions and cellular signaling responses and imply a contribution of hemoglobin-mediated antioxidant mechanism to GPR68-dependent neuroprotection in ischemia.

AB  - Efforts to implement effective assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) for the conservation of the northern white rhinoceros (NWR; Ceratotherium simum cottoni) to prevent its forthcoming extinction, could be supported by research conducted on the closely related southern white rhinoceros (SWR; Ceratotherium simum simum). Within the follicle, extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a fundamental role in the bidirectional communication facilitating the crucial transport of regulatory molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that control follicular growth and oocyte development. This study aimed to elucidate the dynamics of EV-miRNAs in stage-dependent follicular fluid (FF) during SWR ovarian antral follicle development. Three distinct follicular stages were identified based on diameter: Growing (G; 11-17 mm), Dominant (D; 18-29 mm), and Pre-ovulatory (P; 30-34 mm). Isolated EVs from the aspirated FF of segmented follicle stages were used to identify EV-miRNAs previously known via subsequent annotation to all equine (Equus caballus; eca), bovine (Bos taurus; bta), and human (Homo sapiens; hsa) miRNAs. A total of 417 miRNAs were detected, with 231 being mutually expressed across all three stages, including eca-miR-148a and bta-miR-451 as the top highly expressed miRNAs. Distinct expression dynamics in miRNA abundance were observed across the three follicular stages, including 31 differentially expressed miRNAs that target various pathways related to follicular growth and development, with 13 miRNAs commonly appearing amidst two different comparisons. In conclusion, this pioneering study provides a comprehensive understanding of the stage-specific expression dynamics of FF EV-miRNAs in the SWR. These findings provide insights that may lead to novel approaches in enhancing ARTs to catalyze rhinoceros conservation efforts.

AB  - IntroductionAcute stress, as a protective mechanism to respond to an aversive stimulus, can often be accompanied by suppressing pain perception via promoting consistent burst firing of dopamine neurons. Besides, sensitive and advanced research techniques led to the recognition of the mesohippocampal dopaminergic terminals, particularly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Moreover, previous studies have shown that dopamine receptors within the hippocampal DG play a critical role in induced antinociceptive responses by forced swim stress (FSS) in the presence of inflammatory pain. Since different pain states can trigger various mechanisms and transmitter systems, the present experiments aimed to investigate whether dopaminergic receptors within the DG have the same role in the presence of acute thermal pain.MethodsNinety-seven adult male albino Wistar rats underwent stereotaxic surgery, and a stainless steel guide cannula was unilaterally implanted 1 mm above the DG. Different doses of SCH23390 or sulpiride as D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists were microinjected into the DG 5-10 min before exposure to FSS, and 5 min after FSS exposure, the tail-flick test evaluated the effect of stress on the nociceptive response at the time-set intervals.ResultsThe results demonstrated that exposure to FSS could significantly increase the acute pain perception threshold, while intra-DG administration of SCH23390 and sulpiride reduced the antinociceptive effect of FSS in the tail-flick test.DiscussionAdditionally, it seems the D2-like dopamine receptor within the DG plays a more prominent role in FSS-induced analgesia in the acute pain model.

AB  - Neuromorphic electronics, inspired by the functions of neurons, have the potential to enable biomimetic communication with cells. Such systems require operation in aqueous environments, generation of sufficient levels of ionic currents for neurostimulation, and plasticity. However, their implementation requires a combination of separate devices, such as sensors, organic synaptic transistors, and stimulation electrodes. Here, a compact neuromorphic synapse that combines photodetection, memory, and neurostimulation functionalities all-in-one is presented. The artificial photoreception is facilitated by a photovoltaic device based on cell-interfacing InP/ZnS quantum dots, which induces photo-faradaic charge-transfer mediated plasticity. The device sends excitatory post-synaptic currents exhibiting paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation to the hippocampal neurons via the biohybrid synapse. The electrophysiological recordings indicate modulation of the probability of action potential firing due to biomimetic temporal summation of excitatory post-synaptic currents. These results pave the way for the development of novel bioinspired neuroprosthetics and soft robotics, and highlight the potential of quantum dots for achieving versatile neuromorphic functionality in aqueous environments.

AB  - Biochar is widely used as a good soil amendment, while knowledge of modified biochar application in tea garden soils contaminated by fluoride (F) and cadmium (Cd) is insufficient. The tea seedling (Camellia sinensis L.) growth assay was performed to evaluate interaction of soil Cd and F and the improving effect of aluminum trichloride-modified corn stalk biochar (Al-BC) on their speciation, phytoaccumulation and phytotoxicity. Results showed that soil F speciation ratio sequence was as follows: residual > exchangeable > organic-bound > water-soluble > Fe/Mn oxide-bound. Soil exchangeable Cd was the largest Cd speciation (>35.6%), probably due to the low pH values in the acid tea gardens. Root F contents showed a strong significant relationship with soluble F contents (r = 0.92, P < .01) and similarly root Cd highly connected with exchangeable Cd (r = 0.86, P < .01). Seedling height, fresh and dry weight, root surface area, length, and photosynthetic pigment showed different sensitivities to F or Cd oxidative stress and toxicity effects, and only root F contents significantly inversely correlated with them (r = 0.74-0.80, P < .01). The interaction of Cd and F, could influence their speciation distribution and antagonized each other in root accumulation. Meanwhile, joint simulation models showed that antagonistic effects were observed in the F and Cd mixture soils for most cases at Enshi. Biochar application reduced bioavailable F and Cd contents, and thus decreased F and Cd accumulation in tea roots and obviously alleviated toxicity effects. For instance, biochar application significantly reduced root F contents, which had 33.2% to 62.2% declines at Enshi and 39.7% to 77.2% declines at Huanggang. Meanwhile, the soil properties were improved as biochar added, with an increase in soil pH, EC, CEC and organic matter. Overall, Al-modified biochar was beneficial environmental materials for reducing both F and Cd bioavailability.

AB  - Background : Existing animal models for testing therapeutics in the skin are limited. Mouse and rat models lack similarity to human skin in structure and wound healing mechanism. Pigs are regarded as the best model with regards to similarity to human skin; however, these studies are expensive, time-consuming, and only small numbers of biologic replicates can be obtained. In addition, local -regional effects of treating wounds that are closely adjacent to one -another with different treatments make assessment of treatment effectiveness difficult in pig models. Therefore, here, a novel nude mouse model of xenografted porcine hypertrophic scar (HTS) cells was developed. This model system was developed to test if supplying hypo -pigmented cells with exogenous alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone ( alpha -MSH) will reverse pigment loss in vivo . Methods : Dyschromic HTSs were created in red Duroc pigs. Epidermal scar cells (keratinocytes and melanocytes) were derived from regions of hyper-, hypo-, or normally pigmented scar or skin and were cryopreserved. Dermal fibroblasts (DFs) were isolated separately. Excisional wounds were created on nude mice and a grafting dome was placed. DFs were seeded on day 0 and formed a dermis. On day 3, epidermal cells were seeded onto the dermis. The grafting dome was removed on day 7 and hypo -pigmented xenografts were treated with synthetic alpha -MSH delivered with microneedling. On day 10, the xenografts were excised and saved. Sections were stained using hematoxylin and eosin hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess xenograft structure. RNA was isolated and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed for melanogenesis-related genes TYR , TYRP1 , and DCT . Results : The seeding of HTSDFs formed a dermis that is similar in structure and cellularity to HTS dermis from the porcine model. When hyper-, hypo-, and normally -pigmented epidermal cells were seeded, a fully stratified epithelium was formed by day 14. H&E staining and measurement of the epidermis showed the average thickness to be 0.11 +/- 0.07 mu m vs. 0.06 +/- 0.03 mu m in normal pig skin. Hypo -pigmented xenografts that were treated with synthetic alpha -MSH showed increases in pigmentation and had increased gene expression of TYR , TYRP1 , and DCT compared to untreated controls (TYR: 2.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 0.3 +/- 1.1; TYRP1: 2.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.7; DCT 0.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.3 +/- 1 -fold change from control; n = 3). Conclusions : The developed nude mouse skin xenograft model can be used to study treatments for the skin. The cells that can be xenografted can be derived from patient samples or from pig samples and form a robust dual -skin layer containing epidermis and dermis that is responsive to treatment. Specifically, we found that hypo -pigmented of scar can be stimulated to make melanin alpha -MSH in vivo .

AB  - Sea buckthorn, a traditional medicinal plant, has been used for several years in China for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, a practice closely associated with its significant antioxidant activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of sea buckthorn flavonoids on vascular endothelial cells in an oxidative stress environment. We isolated and extracted active compounds from sea buckthorn and investigated their impact on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity through the PI3K/AKT-eNOS signaling pathway through a combination of network pharmacology and cellular experiments, elucidating the regulatory effects of these compounds on endothelial cell functions. Three flavonoids, named Fr.4-2-1, Fr.4-2-2 and Fr.4-2-3, were obtained from sea buckthorn. The results of network pharmacology indicated that they might exert their effects by regulating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. In vitro results showed that all three flavonoids were effective in alleviating the degree of oxidative stress in cells, among which Fr.4-2-1 exerted its antioxidant effects by modulating the PI3K/AKT-eNOS pathway. Flavonoids in sea buckthorn can effectively inhibit oxidative stress-induced cellular damage, preserving the integrity and functionality of endothelial cells, which is crucial for maintaining vascular health and function.

AB  - Arctic migration presents unique challenges to circadian physiology. In addition to the metabolic cost of maintaining a relatively high body temperature (Tb) above ambient temperature, migratory birds are also exposed to rapidly changing light conditions as they transition between light-dark cycles and a 24-hour polar day. A previous study suggested that Arctic-migratory barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) may utilise adaptive heterothermy (i.e., a controlled decrease in core Tb) during and around the autumn migratory period in order to minimise the metabolic cost of migration, but the impact of seasonally changing daylight conditions on other parameters of the circadian profile of Tb in these geese remained obscure. Here, we provide a detailed comparative analysis on the circadian rhythm of Tb and its seasonal development in free-living barnacle geese from three study populations that differ in their migratory behaviour and in the environments they occupy. We recorded abdominal Tb in non-migratory geese from a temperate breeding colony in Netherlands and in migratory geese from a colony in the Russian low Arctic, and analysed these data together with previously published Tb data on geese from a migratory colony in the high Arctic of Svalbard. We found that the circadian Tb profile in the barnacle goose was well aligned with the daily and seasonally changing daylight conditions. In the migratory populations, a fast re-entrainment of the rhythm and its phase was observed when zeitgeber conditions changed during migratory movements. The circadian rhythmicity of Tb was lost once the geese encountered permanent daylight at their northern staging and breeding sites. Circadian Tb rhythmicity was re-established when the period of permanent daylight ended, at rates corresponding to rates of seasonal changes in daylength in the high and low Arctic. Although our data corroborated findings of a decrease in daily mean Tb before autumn migration in both migratory populations in this study, the pre-migratory decrease in Tb was less drastic than previously reported. Moreover, in contrast to previous study, the decrease in Tb stopped at the onset of migration. Overall, our data reveal no evidence that heterothermy in the barnacle goose is functionally linked to migration.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a popular beverage that is consumed globally. However, a better understanding of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) content in tea leaves and infusion is necessary to minimize risk on human health. Therefore, 249 tea samples (grown in different areas) covering six types of tea were collected in China to investigate the PTEs contents, identify their potential source and assess the health risk associated with drinking tea. PTE contents in tea leaves across six tea types were ND-0.900 (Cd), 0.005-2.133 (As), ND-5.679 (Pb), ND-13.86 (Cr), 1.601-22.93 (Ni), ND-2.048 (Se), 0.109-622.4 (F), 13.02-269.9 (Rb), 1.845-50.88 (Sr), and 2.796-53.23 (Ba) mg/kg. The result of tea infusion showed that 14.3 %-44.1 % (green tea), 14.5 %-46.7 % (black tea), 10.5 %-25.3 % (dark tea), 13.6 %-34.2 % (oolong tea), 16.9 %-40.7 % (yellow tea), and 19.9 %-35.1 % (white tea) of F were released. All tea types, except green tea, exhibited comparatively low leachability of Cd, As, Pb and Cr in tea infusion. The source apportionment revealed that PTEs in tea leaves mainly originated from soil parental materials, while industrial activities, fertilizer application, and manufacturing processes may contribute to exogenous Se, Cd, As, and Cr accumulation. Health risk assessment in-dicated that F in tea infusion dominated the health risk. Humans may be exposed to a higher health risk by drinking green tea compared to that of other tea types. Nevertheless, the long-term tea consumption is less likely to contribute to pronounced non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. This study confirmed that tea consumption is an important and direct pathway of PTEs uptake in humans. The health risk associated with drinking tea should be of concern.

AB  - Stimulation of the innate immune system prior to stress exposure is a possible strategy to prevent depression under stressful conditions. Based on the innate immune system stimulating activities of zymosan A, we hypothesize that zymosan A may prevent the development of chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior. Our results showed that a single injection of zymosan A 1 day before stress exposure at a dose of 2 or 4 mg/kg, but not at a dose of 1 mg/kg, prevented the development of depression-like behaviors in mice treated with chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). The prophylactic effect of a single zymosan A injection (2 mg/kg) on CSDS-induced depression-like behaviors disappeared when the time interval between zymosan A and stress exposure was extended from 1 day or 5 days to 10 days, which was rescued by a second zymosan A injection 10 days after the first zymosan A injection and 4 days (4x, once daily) of zymosan A injections 10 days before stress exposure. Further analysis showed that a single zymosan A injection (2 mg/kg) 1 day before stress exposure could prevent the CSDS-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Inhibition of the innate immune system by pretreatment with minocycline (40 mg/kg) abolished the preventive effect of zymosan A on CSDS-induced depression-like behaviors and CSDS-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. These results suggest that activation of the innate immune system triggered by zymosan A prevents the depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammatory responses in the brain induced by chronic stress.

AB  - Neuromorphic electronics, inspired by the functions of neurons, have the potential to enable biomimetic communication with cells. Such systems require operation in aqueous environments, generation of sufficient levels of ionic currents for neurostimulation, and plasticity. However, their implementation requires a combination of separate devices, such as sensors, organic synaptic transistors, and stimulation electrodes. Here, a compact neuromorphic synapse that combines photodetection, memory, and neurostimulation functionalities all-in-one is presented. The artificial photoreception is facilitated by a photovoltaic device based on cell-interfacing InP/ZnS quantum dots, which induces photo-faradaic charge-transfer mediated plasticity. The device sends excitatory post-synaptic currents exhibiting paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation to the hippocampal neurons via the biohybrid synapse. The electrophysiological recordings indicate modulation of the probability of action potential firing due to biomimetic temporal summation of excitatory post-synaptic currents. The results pave the way for the development of novel bioinspired neuroprosthetics and soft robotics and highlight the potential of quantum dots for achieving versatile neuromorphic functionality in aqueous environments.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of preslaughter transport stress on protein S-nitrosylation levels and S-nitrosylated proteome in post-mortem pork longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle. Pigs (N= 16) were randomly divided into 3 h transport (high-stress group, HS) and 3 h transport followed by 3 h resting treatments (low-stress control group, LS). Results demonstrated that high transport stress levels induced nitric oxide (NO) overproduction by promoting NO synthase (NOS) activity and neuronal NOS (nNOS) expression, which thereby notably increased protein S-nitrosylation levels in post-mortem muscle (p < 0.05). Proteomic analysis indicated that 133 S-nitrosylation-modified cysteines belonging to 85 proteins were significantly differential, of which 101 cysteines of 63 proteins were higher in the HS group (p < 0.05). Differential proteins including cytoskeletal and calcium-handling proteins, glycolytic enzymes, and oxidoreductase were mainly involved in the regulation of muscle contraction and energy metabolism that might together mediate meat quality development. Overall, this study provided direct evidence for changes in S-nitrosylation levels and proteome in post-mortem muscle in response to preslaughter transport stress and revealed the potential impact of S-nitrosylated proteins on meat quality.

AB  - Simple SummaryQuantifying the hormones cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in swine hair is of increasing interest to evaluate long-term stress and resilience. Because swine hair is often contaminated with varying amounts of excrement, it needs to be decontaminated with a solvent prior to hair hormone extraction to rid the hair of potential external contaminants. However, it is unknown how contamination influences hair hormone concentrations, and if current wash protocols are effective in removing contamination. The goals of this study were thus, to determine if wash solvents (methanol versus isopropanol), contamination level (none, mild, or severe), and the number of washes (one, three, or five) influenced hair cortisol and DHEA concentrations. This study showed that hair cortisol, but not DHEA concentrations were reduced when external contamination was present, and that methanol was more effective at removing external contamination compared to isopropanol. There were also decreasing concentrations of cortisol and DHEA within the hair and wash solvent with an increasing number of washes. Thus, it is recommended not to use contaminated hair for hormone analysis, and to wash swine hair with a minimum of three 3 min methanol washes prior to analysis.The effect of washing procedure and contamination level on the concentrations of cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in swine hair was explored over two studies. Hair shaved from finisher pigs (n = 8) and sows (n = 8, cortisol study 1 only) was split into two treatments (two hair samples/pig) to receive either three isopropanol or methanol washes, and two paired subsamples of hair were contaminated with feces and urine, mildly or severely. Samples were further subdivided and received one, three, or five methanol washes. Hormone concentrations were quantified from the hair and wash solvent, and the ratio of hormones in the solvent to that in the hair calculated. When grouping sow and grower hair together for analysis, hair cortisol concentrations were 13% greater after three isopropanol washes compared to methanol (22.84 & PLUSMN; 3.12 vs. 19.77 & PLUSMN; 2.64 pg/mg, respectively). When analyzing sow and grower hair separately, sow hair cortisol concentrations were 20% higher following three isopropanol washes compared to methanol washes (22.06 & PLUSMN; 5.21 vs. 27.72 & PLUSMN; 5.65 pg/mg), with no differences in grower pig hair concentrations. The solvent cortisol concentrations did not differ with wash solvent. No differences were seen for DHEA. Contamination level did not influence hormone concentrations. Hair cortisol concentrations were 24% higher after one wash compared to five washes (11.98 & PLUSMN; 1.47 vs. 9.05 & PLUSMN; 0.92 pg/mg), whereas the solvent cortisol concentrations were 80% and 84% higher after one wash compared to three and five washes, respectively (21.09 & PLUSMN; 4.04 vs. 4.21 & PLUSMN; 1.62 vs. 3.36 & PLUSMN; 1.32 pg/mg). The solvent-hair cortisol ratio was 65% and 73% higher following one wash compared to three and five washes (1.36 & PLUSMN; 0.80 vs. 0.47 & PLUSMN; 0.12 vs. 0.37 & PLUSMN; 0.14). Hair DHEA concentrations were 39% higher after one wash compared to five washes (42.39 & PLUSMN; 6.87 vs. 26.02 & PLUSMN; 5.69 pg/mg). The solvent DHEA concentrations, and the solvent-hair ratio for DHEA were 94% and 98% and 92% and 98% higher going from one wash to three and five washes, respectively (solvent: 5.07 & PLUSMN; 0.26 vs. 0.28 & PLUSMN; 0.12 vs. 0.12 & PLUSMN; 0.
   09 pg/mg and solvent-hair ratio: 0.13 & PLUSMN; 0.006 vs. 0.010 & PLUSMN; 0.004 vs. 0.003 & PLUSMN; 0.002).
   Following three methanol washes, the non-contaminated hair had 46% and 48% higher hair (17.47 & PLUSMN; 1.12 vs. 9.35 & PLUSMN; 0.80 vs. 9.05 & PLUSMN; 1.06 pg/mg) and a 76% and 72% higher solvent (16.31 & PLUSMN; 8.07 vs. 3.92 & PLUSMN; 0.50 vs. 4.50 & PLUSMN; 2.31 pg/mg) cortisol concentration compared to mild and severely contaminated hair, respectively. Wash solvent influences cortisol concentrations in swine hair, but not DHEA. Contaminated swine hair should be avoided in analyses when possible.

AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the only adult stem cells capable of passing genetic information to offspring through their ability to both self-renew and differentiate into mature spermatozoa. SSCs can be transplanted to establish donor-derived spermatogenesis in recipient animals, thus offering a novel reproductive tool for multiplication of elite individual animals to benefit livestock production. An optimal SSC culture in vitro can benefit various SSC-based studies and applications, such as mechanistic study of SSC biology, SSC transplantation process and SSC-based transgenesis technique. However, except for some model rodent animals, SSC culture remains an inefficient and unstable process. We here studied a workflow to isolate, purify and in vitro culture porcine SSCs from neonatal pig testes. Pig testicular cells were dissociated by two-step enzymatic digestion with collagenase type IV and trypsin. We enriched the spermatogonia from the testicular cell mix by differential plating for at least 3 times to remove firmly attached non-SSCs. We then tested the optimal culture medium formula by supplementation of different growth factors to the basic medium (DMEM/F12 + 1% FBS) and found that a combination of 20 ng/ml GDNF, 10 ng/ml LIF, 20 ng/ml FGF2 and 20 ng/ml IGF1 had the best effect on SSC growth in our defined experimental system. In the presence of 4 growth factors without specific feeders, the purified SSCs can be cultured in poly-L-lysine- and laminin-coated dishes for 28 days and remain preserving a continuous proliferation without losing the undifferentiated spermatogonial phenotype.

AB  - Autophagy is a self-phagocytic and highly evolutionarily conserved intracellular lysosomal catabolic system, which plays a vital role in a variety of trauma models, including skin wound healing (SWH). However, the roles and potential mechanisms of autophagy in SWH are still controversial. We firstly investigated the role of autophagy in SWH-induced wound closure rate, inflammatory response, and histopathology, utilizing an inhibitor of autophagy 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and its agonist rapamycin (RAP). As expected, we found 3-MA treatment remarkably increased the wound closure rate, combated inflammation response, and mitigated histopathological changes, while RAP delivery aggravated SWH-induced pathological damage. To further exploit the underlying mechanism of autophagy regulating inflammation, the specific inhibitors of yes-associated protein (YAP), Verteporfin, and Anti-IL-33 were applied. Herein, treating with 3-MA markedly suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 beta, and IL-6, promoted that of IL-10, IL-33, and ST2, while RAP administration reverted SWH-induced the up-regulation of these inflammatory cytokines mentioned above. Importantly, Verteporfin administration not only down-regulated the expression levels of YAP, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 but also up-regulated that of IL-33 and IL-10. Unexpectedly, 3-MA or RAP retreatment did not have any impact on the changes in IL-33 among these inflammatory indicators. Furthermore, elevated expression of IL-33 promoted wound closure and alleviated the pathological damage, whereas, its antagonist Anti-IL-33 treatment overtly reversed the above-mentioned effects of IL-33. Moreover, 3-MA in combination with anti-IL-33 treatment reversed the role of 3-MA alone in mitigated pathological changes, but they failed to revert the effect of anti-IL-33 alone on worsening pathological damage. In sum, emerging data support the novel contribution of the YAP/IL-33 pathway in autophagy inhibition against SWH-induced pathological damage, and highlight that the autophagy/YAP/IL-33 signal axis is expected to become a new therapeutic target for SWH.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) is a marijuana compound implicated in epilepsy treatment in animal models and phar-macoresistant patients. However, little is known about chronic CBD administration's effects in chronic models of seizures, especially regarding its potential antiepileptogenic effects. In the present study, we combined a genetic model of epilepsy (the Wistar Audiogenic Rat strain -WARs), a chronic protocol of seizures (the audiogenic kindling -AuK), quantitative and sequential behavioral analysis (neuroethology), and microscopy imaging to analyze the effects of chronic CBD administration in a genetic model of epi-lepsy. The acute audiogenic seizure is characterized by tonic-clonic seizures and intense brainstem activ-ity. However, during the AuK WARs can develop limbic seizures associated with the recruitment of forebrain and limbic structures. Here, chronic CBD administration, twice a day, attenuated brainstem, tonic-clonic seizures, prevented limbic recruitment, and suppressed limbic (kindled) seizures, suggesting CBD antiepileptogenic effects. Additionally, CBD prevented chronic neuronal hyperactivity, suppressing FosB immunostaining in the brainstem (inferior colliculus and periaqueductal gray matter) and forebrain (basolateral amygdala nucleus and piriform cortex), structures associated with tonic-clonic and limbic seizures, respectively. Chronic seizures increased cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1R) immunostaining in the hippocampus and the BLA, while CBD administration prevented changes in CB1R expression induced by the AuK. The neuroethological analysis provided details about CBD's protective effects against brainstem and limbic seizures associated with FosB expression. Our results strongly suggest chronic CBD anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic effects associated with reduced chronic neuronal activity and mod-ulation of CB1R expression. We also support the chronic use of CBD for epilepsies treatments.

AB  - Purpose: We evaluated the association between ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), and predicted the CRSwNP recurrence risk using machine learning algorithms.Methods: In total, 1,086 patients with CRSwNP were recruited from nine hospitals in China during 2014-2019. The average annual concentrations of ambient PMs before surgery were assessed using satellite-based daily concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 for a 1 x 1-km2 area. Linear regression and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations of PM exposure with eosinophilia and risks of eosinophilic CRSwNPs. In addition, mediation effect analysis was used to validate the interrelationships of the aforementioned factors. Finally, machine learning algorithms were used to predict the recurrence risks of CRSwNPs.Results: There was a significantly increased risk of eosinophilic CRSwNPs with each 10 & mu;g/m3 increase in PMs, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.039 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.007-1.073) for PM10 and 1.058 (95% CI = 1.007- 1.112) for PM2.5. Eosinophils had a significant mediation effect, which accounted for 52% and 35% of the relationships of CRSwNP recurrence with PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Finally, we developed a naive Bayesian model to predict the risk of CRSwNP recurrence based on PM exposure, inflammatory data, and patients' demographic factors.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: The water extract of Panax ginseng (GT) and Polygala tenuifolia (YT), the main constituents of the commonly used kai-xin-san formula of traditional Chinese medicine, represents SY. It possesses strong neuroprotective effects. Using behavioural tests, we have previously established that the SY formulation exerts superior antidepressant activity than that of GT or YT.
   Aim: To elucidate the impact of SY treatment on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behaviours and the prospective mechanism related to hippocampal neurogenesis and the BDNF signaling pathway.
   Methods: We exposed Sprague-Dawley rats (male; 180-200 g) to CUMS for 35 days. The rats in the experimental treatment groups were daily treated with either fluoxetine (10 mg kg(-1)d(-1)) or SY (67.5, 135, or 270 mg kg(-1)d(-1))orally until the behavioural tests (tail suspension test [TST], novelty-suppressed feeding test [NSFT], sucrose preference test [SPT], and forced swim test [FST]) were completed. We assessed the modifications in the hippocampal neurogenesis and the BDNF signaling pathway post-treatment with CUMS and SY. Additionally, K252a, a tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor, was utilized to evaluate the antidepressant mechanisms of SY.
   Result: s: The results of SPT, NSFT, FST, and TST in CUMS-exposed rats confirmed the antidepressant actions of SY. Additionally, SY treatment induced the BDNF signaling pathway and reversed the hippocampal neurogenesis caused by CUMS. Moreover, we found that the TrkB antagonist K252a blocked SY effects on behavioural improvement, inhibited the incremental effects of SY on hippocampal neurogenesis, and eliminated the impact of SY on BDNF-TrkB signaling activation. Thus, the impact of SY treatment on BDNF signaling molecules (pAkt, pERK1/2, and pCREB) were significantly inhibited by K252a.
   Conclusions: This study showed that SY acted as an antidepressant in rats exhibiting CUMS-induced depressive like behaviours, and was facilitated by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and the BDNF signaling pathway activation. Thus, SY could act as a potential novel supplement or adjuvant to prevent or treat clinical depressive disorders.

AB  - Background/Objectives: This study explores the biochemical diversity of Hippophae rhamnoides, Viburnum opulus, and Lonicera caerulea subsp. altaica to identify genotypes rich in bioactive compounds for breeding nutritionally valuable cultivars. Methods: Selected forms and cultivars of each species were evaluated for key biochemical traits. Analyses included quantification of vitamins (C, B9, B12), sugars, organic acids, carotenoids, and flavonoids using HPLC and TLC. Results: In H. rhamnoides, vitamin C content ranged widely, with 'Pamyati Baytulina Sh-9-81' reaching 156.0 mg/%, while 'Shetlastinka No. 7' showed the most favorable sugar-to-vitamin C ratio. 'Krasnoplodnaya K-14-81' had the highest carotenoids (55.3 mg/100 g), and 'Dolgozhdannaya No. 5' was notable for flavonoid richness. In V. opulus, considerable variation was observed in vitamin content, sugars, and dry matter; 'Zhemchuzhnoe Ozhele' and 'Shtambovaya' were rich in rutin and robinin. In L. caerulea subsp. altaica, forms No. 5, 7, and 9 stood out for vitamin C, sugar, and flavonoid content. Hyperoside, isorhamnetin, and myricetin were common, while kaempferol and hypolaetin were form-specific. Conclusions: H. rhamnoides demonstrated the highest variability in biochemical composition, while L. caerulea subsp. altaica showed a particularly rich flavonoid profile. These species offer valuable genetic resources for developing biofortified cultivars suited to both nutritional and adaptive breeding goals.

AB  - The results of a study of salt licking features in wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus valentinae) using camera traps on two natural salt licks in Southern and Central Yakutia in 2015-2018 are presented. In Southern Yakutia, the highest number of visits to salt licks was recorded in autumn in September-October and occurred mostly in the morning and afternoon, while in Central Yakutia, salt licking activity was higher in June closer to evening and at dawn. The average number of visits per day by animals was 2.3 in Southern Yakutia and 1.4 in Central Yakutia. The duration of salt licking in wild reindeer in Southern Yakutia averaged 4.7 +/- 1.0 min, and in Central Yakutia, 3.1 +/- 0.4 min. In the snowy season, reindeer licking ice formed on salt licks, as well as gnawing on exposed areas of coastal soil and ice on alas lakes, were observed. The sex and age structure of wild reindeer visiting natural salt licks was as follows: males, 25.6%; females, 74.4%; calves, 17.3%. In Southern Yakutia, females with calves accounted for 20.0% of all visits, in Central Yakutia, 13.6%.

AB  - Eusocial insects have a diverse mechanism of reproduction to know the termite genealogy, and we examined the Reticulitermes aculabialis breeding mechanism. This well-known species was reared in an artificial environment under darkness at Northwest University, Xian, China, from May 2018 to June 2019. After the inaugural colonies foundation, imagoes started egg-laying during 30-40 days. The hatching ratio increased gradually during the time. The femal+male (FM) worker reproductive (ergatoids) colonies were reported significantly (p<0.005) in egg-laying and chambers making than primary reproductives (imagoes). The morphological measurement shows that the swarmer alates were significantly (p<0.005) extended along with wings, mean live weight of the queen was significantly heavier (p<0.005) than workers but not statistically different mature reproductive queen. The sex ratio of workers was found significantly dominant (p<0.005) among individuals in the colony and busy to find food sources, caring for young termites and eggs, constructing galleries, and helping the soldiers to defend the colony from predators, increases the efficiency of the effectiveness, protection from pathogens and parasites.

AB  - BackgroundClinical prevalence of major depression is higher in women than men, while the psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms underlying the differences between the two sexes are not fully understood. MethodsThe present study explored sex differences in the behaviors and depressive pathological mechanisms induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Depression- and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed by the sucrose preference test (SPT), force swimming test (FST), open field test (OFT), and elevated plus-maze (EPM). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure cytokine concentrations, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure monoamine neurotransmitters and metabolite contents, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting (WB) were used to measure glial parameters in the hippocampus. ResultsUnder control conditions, female rats exhibited shorter immobility times in the FST, lower interferon (IFN)-gamma, and interleukin (IL)-4 levels in the hippocampus, lower norepinephrine (NE) and homovanillic acid (HVA), and higher p75 and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression than male rats. CUMS markedly reduced rat body weight gain, sucrose preference, locomotor activity, number of entries into the central zone and rearing in the OFT, as well as the number of entries into and time spent in open arms of the EPM; however, CUMS increased the immobility times of the rats of both sexes in the FST. Interestingly, more pronounced changes in sucrose preference and locomotor activity were observed in female rats than in males. Consistently, CUMS-increased glucocorticoid concentration, M1 microglial marker CD11b, and peripheral IL-1 beta and IL-4, while decreased hippocampal IL-10, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were more significant in females than in males. ConclusionThese data revealed possible mechanisms by which females suffer more depression than males at least in a stressful environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of letrozole and its effect on FSH and LH concentrations after single (IV, IM, SC) and repeated IV doses in anestrous ewes. This study was conducted in experiments 1 and 2 by randomly dividing 24 healthy Akkaraman ewes in anestrus into two equal groups. In experiment 1, the pharmacokinetics of letrozole following single IV, IM, and SC administration at 1 mg/kg dose and its effect of a single IV dose on plasma FSH and LH concentration were determined. In experiment 2, the effect of repeated IV doses of letrozole on FSH and LH concentrations was established. Plasma concentration of letrozole was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis. FSH and LH concentrations were quantified using ELISA. The elimination half-life (t(1/2 lambda z)) for IV, IM, and SC routes were 9.94, 37.29, and 41.07 h, respectively. The IV route for letrozole had a total clearance of 0.11 L/h/kg and a volume of distribution at a steady state of 1.50 L/kg. The peak plasma concentration was 0.11 mu g/mL for the IM route and 0.14 mu g/mL for the SC routes. The bioavailability was 55.18% for the IM route and 75.34% for the SC route. Letrozole following single and repeated (every 24 h for 3 days) IV administrations at 1 mg/kg dose did not affect LH concentration in anestrous ewes but caused an increase in the FSH concentration. This increase in FSH concentration may create a potential for the use of letrozole in ovarian superstimulation protocols. Favorable pharmacokinetic properties (long t(1/2 lambda z) and good bioavailability) of letrozole for IM and SC routes require further investigation before use in estrus induction or estrus synchronization protocols in sheep.

AB  - The most notable progress in renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in the past decades is the introduction of drugs targeting the VHL-HIF signaling pathway-associated angiogenesis. However, mechanisms underlying the development of VHL mutation-independent ccRCC are unclear. Here we provide evidence that the disrupted Hippo-YAP signaling contributes to the development of ccRCC independent of VHL alteration. We found that YAP1 and its primary target genes are frequently upregulated in ccRCC and the upregulation of these genes is associated with unfavorable patient outcomes. Research results derived from our in vitro and in vivo experimental models demonstrated that, under normoxic conditions, hyperactivated YAP1 drives the expression of FGFs to stimulate the proliferation of tumor and tumor-associated endothelial cells in an autocrine/paracrine manner. When rapidly growing cancer cells create a hypoxic environment, hyperactivated YAP1 in cancer cells induces the production of VEGF, which promotes the angiogenesis of tumor-associated endothelial cells, leading to improved tumor microenvironment and continuous tumor growth. Our study indicates that hyperactivated YAP1 is essential for maintaining ccRCC progression, and targeting the dual role of hyperactivated YAP1 represents a novel strategy to improve renal carcinoma therapy.

AB  - The golden snub-nosed monkey (GSNM), Rhinopithecus roxellana, is an endangered species on the IUCN Red List, and the Yuhe National Nature Reserve in Gansu is one of its principal habitats. The GSNM's protection and management rely heavily on predicting its probable suitable habitat. The Maxent model was used to examine the habitat suitability of GSNM in the Yuhe Nature Reserve and surrounding areas. Infrared cameras used to monitor GSNM in 2019-2020 provided the model with data. Through analysis and screening, 23 distribution sites of GSNM and five environmental variables were included in the final model. The findings revealed that the Yuhe Nature Reserve's area of appropriate habitat for GSNM was 248.43 km(2), accounting for 52.79 percent of the reserve's total area and that this was concentrated in the core zone. The Maxent model was optimized using the Kuenm package, and the resulting value reached an exceptional level of 0.948. A Jackknife test revealed that the mean diurnal range was the most important environmental factor affecting the distribution of GSNM (45.84%). Finally, the planning of the reserve was generally in line with the predictions, and the functional zoning could be altered accordingly. We advised extending the reserve southward based on the study's findings, while strengthening the supervision of marginal areas of the reserve.

AB  - Anthracnose of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), caused by Colletotrichum spp., poses a significant threat to both the yield and quality of tea production. To address this challenge, researchers have looked to the application of endophytic bacteria as a natural alternative to the use chemical pesticides, offering potential for enhancing disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance in tea plants. This study focused on identifying effective microbial agents to combat tea anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum fructicola. A total of 38 Bacillus-like strains were isolated from the tea rhizosphere, with 8 isolates showing substantial inhibitory effects against the mycelial growth of C. fructicola, achieving an average inhibition rate of 60.68%. Among these, strain T3 was particularly effective, with a 69.86% inhibition rate. Through morphological, physiological, and biochemical characterization, along with 16S rRNA gene phylogenetics analysis, these strains were identified as B. inaquosorum (T1 and T2), B. tequilensis (T3, T5, T7, T8, and T19), and B. spizizenii (T6). Biological and molecular assays confirmed that these strains could induce the expression of genes associated with antimicrobial compounds like iturin, fengycin, subtilosin, and alkaline protease, which effectively reduced the disease index of tea anthracnose and enhanced tea plant growth. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that B. inaquosorum, B. tequilensis, and B. spizizenii strains are promising biocontrol agents for managing tea anthracnose.

AB  - To To investigate the role of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the perception and response mechanisms to light in unicellular microalgae, the genetically encoded ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Yellow Cameleon (YC3.6) was expressed in the model organism for green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, targeted to cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondria. <bold> </bold> Through in vivo single-cell confocal microscopy imaging, light-induced Ca2+ signaling was investigated in different conditions and different genotypes, including the photoreceptors mutants phot and acry. A genetically encoded H2O2 sensor was also adopted to investigate the possible role of H2O2 formation in light-dependent Ca2+ signaling. <bold> </bold> Light-dependent Ca2+ response was observed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells only in the chloroplast as an organelle-autonomous response, influenced by light intensity and photosynthetic electron transport. The absence of blue and red-light photoreceptor aCRY strongly reduced the light-dependent chloroplast Ca2+ response, while the absence of the blue photoreceptor PHOT had no significant effects. A correlation between high light-induced chloroplast H2O2 gradients and Ca2+ transients was drawn, supported by H2O2-induced chloroplast Ca2+ transients in the dark. <bold> </bold> In conclusion, different triggers are involved in the light-induced chloroplast Ca2+ signaling as saturation of the photosynthetic electron transport, H2O2 formation, and aCRY-dependent light perception.

AB  - Glutamate transporters preserve the spatial specificity of synaptic transmission by limiting glutamate diffusion away from the synaptic cleft, and prevent excitotoxicity by keeping the extracellular concentration of glutamate at low nanomolar levels. Glutamate transporters are abundantly expressed in astrocytes, and previous estimates have been obtained about their surface expression in astrocytes of the rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Analogous estimates for the mouse hippocampus are currently not available. In this work, we derive the surface density of astrocytic glutamate transporters in mice of different ages via quantitative dot blot. We find that the surface density of glial glutamate transporters is similar in 7-8 week old mice and rats. In mice, the levels of glutamate transporters increase until about 6 months of age and then begin to decline slowly. Our data, obtained from a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, point to the existence of stark differences in the density of expression of glutamate transporters across different sub-cellular compartments, indicating that the extent to which astrocytes limit extrasynaptic glutamate diffusion depends not only on their level of synaptic coverage, but also on the identity of the astrocyte compartment in contact with the synapse. Together, these findings provide information on how heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of glutamate transporters in the plasma membrane of hippocampal astrocytes my alter glutamate receptor activation out of the synaptic cleft.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two commercial phenolic phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) on sows under heat stress conditions of high summer temperatures for seven days before and seven days after the farrowing. The PFA-1 product was a mixture based on the plants Emblica officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, Citrus sinensis and nut fiber, while the PFA-2 product was a mixture based on plants Andrographis paniculata, Glycyrrhizia glabra, Tinospora cordifolia and nut fiber. A total of 48 primiparous sows were divided into three groups: T1-control group: regular gestation (GF) and lactation feed (LF); T2 group: regular GF and LF supplemented with PFA-1; T3 group: regular GF and LF supplemented with PFA-2. Each sow in the T2 and T3 groups received 5 g daily of the PFA-1 and PFA-2 product, respectively, for seven days before and seven days after the farrowing. Blood samples were collected from all groups 24 h after farrowing. Thiobarbituric acid--reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyl (CARB) concentrations were determined in the sow plasma. The body condition scoring (BCS) and the backfat of sows on the farrowing and weaning days along with reproductive parameters and litter characteristics were recorded. The highest number of stillborn piglets and the largest interval from weaning to estrus were observed in the T1 group. The lowest number of alive 24 h after birth and weaning piglets and the lowest BCS and backfat at weaning were also recorded in the T1 group. TBARS and CARB concentrations were significant higher in the T1 group compared to all other groups. In conclusion, the use of phenolic PFAs seems to reduce oxidative damage caused by heat stress and ameliorate performance in primiparous sows.

The blastocysts production rate significantly improved (p < .01) after treating embryos independently with 5 nM AzadC and 5 nM zebularine compared with 2 and 10 nM AzadC or zebularine groups, respectively. The highest cleavage rates were obtained for 5 nM treatment of AzadC and zebularine compared with other treatments and untreated control group. Quality of blastocysts were evaluated using total cell number (TCN) and the ratio of number of inner cell mass (ICM) cells/total cell number (ICM/TCN). Zebularine treatments (2/5/10 nM) significantly improved both TCN and ICM/TCN ratio compared with AzadC treatments (2/5/10 nM); however, control group TCN and ICM/TCN ratio was found lower. The methylation percentage of pDS4.1 and B. bubalis satellite DNA were comparatively more attenuated with 5 nM zebularine than 5 nM AzadC treatment. The increased in vitro development rates of the treated embryos were correlated with the decreased level of DNA methylation and the improved blastocyst quality. Following transfer of 5 nM zebularine treated embryos to 6 recipients, 4 were found to be pregnant, though the pregnancies were not carried to full term.

AB  - Exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been associated with lower bone density and the occurrence of osteoporosis in human studies, but the effects and mechanisms of PFOS induces bone loss is not well understood. Our research is aimed at examining the effects of PFOS on osteoblastic activity and investigating the toxicological mechanisms of PFOS-induced bone loss. Cell proliferation, ALP activity, bone nodule formation, ROS levels, and cell apoptosis were assessed after treating osteoblasts with different concentrations of PFOS. Through transcriptome analysis, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and the biofunctions were elucidated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Vation of important genes and protein expression was accomplished using RT-PCR and Western blot methods, respectively. The results show that PFOS can reduce bone formation markers and improve oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. The DEGs in PFOS-treated groups were involved in multiple pathways, including FoxO, HIF-1, Rap1, Hippo, and sphingolipid signaling. FoxO1 was validated as the key gene which regulates osteogenic differentiation and redox status. Our findings suggest that PFOS reduces bone formation through FoxO1-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis, as well as inhibition of the OPG/RANKL and FoxO1/beta-catenin pathways. It will be beneficial for early intervention or treatment of PFOS-induced bone loss, highlighting the importance of regulatory measures to limit human exposure to PFOS.

AB  - The present study aims to monitor and assess the occurrence of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) in animal manure, compost, and fertilized soil, originating from different large-scale feedlots. The corresponding concentrations of 39 types of VAs in 8 large-scale feedlots of pig, dairy cow, and poultry were sampled in different seasons and analyzed using LC-MS. The results indicated that 17 types, 16 types, and 5 types of VAs were detected in the swine manure, compost, and fertilized soil with the concentrations of 0.003-17.82, 0.002-9.59, and 0.004-0.007 mg kg(-1) (dry matter), respectively; 3 types, 2 types, and 1 type of VAs were detected in the dairy manure, compost, and fertilized soil with the concentrations of 0.003-1.94, 0.014-0.044, and 0.025 mg kg(-1) (dry matter), respectively; 7 types, 5 types, and 1 type of VAs were detected in the poultry manure, compost, and fertilized soil with the concentrations of 0.035-1.06, 0.018-0.049, and 0.019 mg kg(-1) (dry matter), respectively. The main antibiotic classes persisted in the animal manure and their composting product and fertilized soil were sulfonamides (SAs), macrolides (MAs), and tetracyclines (TCs). Thus, this study would help to adopt strategies in pollution control of VAs and environmental protection of agriculture.

AB  - The term "Agriculture 4.0" emerged from the term "Industry 4.0" like amany other "4.0" terms. However, are Industry 4.0 technologies and concepts really applicable to agriculture? Are the benefits that Industry 4.0 brings to industrial use cases transferable to livestock farming? This paper tries to answer this question for the three dominant sectors of livestock farming in Central Europe and Germany: Poultry, pig fattening, and dairy farming. These sectors are analyzed along with the eight most relevant Industry 4.0 benefits. The results show that only part of the Industry 4.0 benefits are relevant for livestock farming in a similar manner as in industrial production. Due to basic differences between industrial and livestock farming use cases, some of the benefits must be adapted. The presence of individual living animals and the strong environmental impact of livestock farming affect the role of digital individualization and demand orientation. The position of livestock farming within the value chain minimizes the need for flexibilization. The introduction and adoption of Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies may contribute significantly to transforming agriculture into something that may be called Agriculture 4.0. Technologies are indispensable for this development step, but vocational education and open-mindedness of farmers towards Industry 4.0 is essential as well.

AB  - The Asian subterranean termite, Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), is a major pest of wooden structures. Native to Southeast Asia, it has successfully invaded various regions worldwide. Developing a molecular technique for colony delineation is critical to evaluate the efficacy of subterranean termite baiting systems against C. gestroi. This study has assessed the robustness of 19 newly developed microsatellite loci for colony delineation of the invasive C. gestroi in both South Florida and Taiwan. Our results suggest that at least nine microsatellite markers, each with two alleles per locus, can accurately distinguish all C. gestroi colonies with little genetic variation in South Florida. Conversely, only five microsatellite loci are needed to delineate C. gestroi colonies in Taiwan. Additionally, differences in colony breeding systems may affect genetic differentiation among C. gestroi colonies. Our study provides a practical genetic method to accurately identify colony affiliation of foragers, which will help in the field evaluation of baiting systems in areas invaded by C. gestroi.

AB  - Depression is a common mental disorder that can adversely affect psychosocial function and quality of life. However, the exact aetiology and pathogenesis of depression are still unclear. Stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of depression. The use of currently prescribed antidepressants has many side effects. Centella asi-atica (C. asiatica) has shown promising antidepressant activity in rodent models. Here, we developed a reserpine-induced zebrafish stress-like model and performed behavioural analysis, cortisol measurement and 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolomics analysis to test the anti-stress activity of ethanolic extract of C. asiatica (RECA). A significant increase in total distance travelled (F(8,8) = 8.905, p = 0.0054) and a reduction in freezing duration (F(9, 9) =10.38, p = 0.0018) were found in the open field test (OFT). Asiaticoside, one of tested C.asiatica's triterpenoid gives a significant increase in contact duration (F(5,5) = 142.3, (p = 0.0330) at 2.5 mg/kg). Eight biomarkers were found, i.e. ss-hydroxyisovaleric acid, leucine, threonine, scylloinositol, lactate, betaine, valine, choline and L-fucose, to be responsible for the class separation between stress and RECA-treated groups. Metabolic pathway alteration in zebrafish brain upon treatment with RECA was identified as valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, while alanine, aspartate, glutamate and glycer-ophospholipid metabolism was involved after fluoxetine treatment.

AB  - In Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the number of pets and pet owners has been increasing in recent years. The experiences people have with pets might impact their relationships with animals in general and espe-cially attitudes towards animal protection and use. However, research on the impact of pet ownership on values and attitudes towards animals is relatively scarce. We analyse associations of pet ownership with different values and attitudes towards animals. We derived seven attitude constructs towards animals from three different datasets using Principal Component Analyses. Data were collected using standardised online surveys with German residents (dataset 1 = 1,049 respondents; dataset 2 = 414 respondents; dataset 3 = 1,048 respondents). All three samples are non-probability quota samples. The seven attitudinal constructs represent values and attitudes towards animals ranging from general values and attitudes towards, eg animal protection, to more specific attitudes towards, eg eating animals. We analysed the relationship of pet ownership, sex, and age with these constructs using ANOVA. Our results show that effect sizes are small to medium. Pet ownership has the strongest association with more general values and attitudes towards animals, with pet owners being, eg more involved in animal protection and more in favour of awarding fundamental rights to animals. In contrast, we found that more specific attitudes, such as the evaluation of current pig farming systems or attitudes towards eating meat, were more related to sex than pet ownership. Our findings indicate that having pets relates to their owners' attitudes towards animals, but that this association varies depending on the specificity of attitudes.

AB  - Reptiles are increasingly faced with conservation challenges and ecoimmunological techniques would be a beneficial tool in monitoring and evaluating populations that are at-risk. However, the reptilian immune system is poorly understood, and few studies have made intraspecies comparisons, making generalizations difficult. To help address this gap, innate immune function across three conspecific freshwater turtle species was evaluated. Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), Mississippi mud (Kinosternon subrubrum hippocrepis), and musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), are found throughout the Southeastern USA and represent different ecological microhabitats and life histories. In spring 2024, male aquatic turtles were caught using hoop nets, and blood samples were taken to assess immune characteristics. Microbial killing assays were conducted using multiple blood serum and buffy layer (hereafter referred as "serum + BL") manipulations (fresh, frozen, and frozen + heat manipulated serum + BL) as well as three microbes that activate specific immunological responses: Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a fungus (Candida albicans). By using this suite of microbial assays, differences in immune prioritization can be observed across species. This study revealed that there are differences in immunocompetence in each species of freshwater turtle that varied by microbe and serum + BL manipulation. We determined that because of the contribution of complement proteins when challenged against Gram-negative bacteria, frozen manipulated serum + BL appears to be a reliable way to assess immunocompetence in individuals across turtle species. Conducting intraspecies comparisons in immune function using integrative approaches can provide valuable insight into the underlying patterns of physiological variability within wild organisms, especially those that are of conservation concern.

AB  - Limited available land for livestock farming and increasing land-use costs have forced some large animal feeding operations to build animal barns from conventional one-floor to multi-floor in China recently because multi-floor animal building (MFAB) has a great advantage in saving land utilization. The ventilation system is an important part of animal building determining the indoor environmental condition. The difference in ventilation rate be-tween MFAB and conventional barn might exist, because of the difference in building structure, especially due to the confined space outside of exhaust fans in the MFAB. However, a limited number of studies have accumulated information on the ventilation performance of this novel multi-floor animal barn. This work aims to acquire such information relating to the ventilation performance of a novel MFAB with a different number of floors (6, 7, 8, 9, and10 floors building) and different width of the yard using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique. A field measurement was carried out in a six-floor pig barn, and the measured air velocities were used for the CFD model validation. The validated CFD model was then extended to explore the difference of airflow patterns and ventilation rates on different floors under a different number of floors and the width of the yard. The simulation results showed that the difference in airflow pattern among each floor was limited, but the ventilation rate of each floor varied from floor to floor under the studied type of MFAB. The ventilation rate on the first floor was the lowest and increased with the floor increasing. Hence, more focus on the ventilation rate of the first floor should be paid during the design procedure. The increase of the floor number negatively affected the perfor-mance of the ventilation system because of the pressure profile in the yard of the building. Increasing the width of the yard could mitigate the negative effect of the floor number on the ventilation rates. Therefore, to perform the desired ventilation rate for animals in a multi-floor animal building required a more detailed design of the ventilation system of each floor by considering either the space available after exhaust openings or additional fans.

AB  - Background Herbivores may influence each other directly and through plant mediated inter-specific interactions. The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) and citrus aphids are key pests that can co-exist on citrus, but their plant-mediated interaction between them is unknown. Here we investigated plant-mediated effect of two citrus aphid species, the polyphagous Aphis spiraecola Patch and the oligophagous Aphis (Toxoptera) citricidus (Kirkaldy) on the feeding behavior and reproduction of Diaphorina citri, and explored the underlying mechanisms. Results In comparison with those on aphid free plants, Diaphorina citri had decreased reproduction and reduced phloem feeding on Aphis spiraecola pre-infested plants, while the reproduction and feeding efficiency were increased on Aphis citricidus pre-infested plants. Jasmonic acid (JA) dependent defense was significantly activated by Diaphorina citri feeding on Aphis spiraecola pre-infested plants, but was suppressed by Diaphorina citri feeding on Aphis citricidus pre-infested plants compared with that on aphid free plant. By contrast, only one tested marker gene in salicylic acid (SA) signaling was activated by Diaphorina citri feeding on Aphis spiraecola pre-infested plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of methyl jasmonate, but not SA, conferred resistance against Diaphorina citri in our citrus trials. Conclusion Our results indicate that pre-infestation by two citrus aphid species differentially altered Diaphorina citri induced citrus JA dependent defense, which resulted in different effect on subsequent Diaphorina citri performance.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the neuropathological mechanisms responsible for the deficits in cognition and neuronal function in Down syndrome (DS). The Ts65Dn (TS) mouse replicates multiple DS phenotypes including hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits and similar brain oxidative status. To better understand the hippocampal oxidative profile in the adult TS mouse, we analyzed cellular OS-associated alterations in hippocampal granule cells (GCs), a neuronal population that plays an important role in memory formation and that is particularly affected in DS. For this purpose, we used biochemical, molecular, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopy techniques. Our results indicate that TS GCs show important OS-associated alterations in the systems essential for neuronal homeostasis: DNA damage response and proteostasis, particularly of the proteasome and lysosomal system. Specifically, TS GCs showed: (i) increased DNA damage, (ii) reorganization of nuclear proteolytic factories accompanied by a decline in proteasome activity and cytoplasmic aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, (iii) formation of lysosomal-related structures containing lipid droplets of cytotoxic peroxidation products, and (iv) mitochondrial ultrastructural defects. These alterations could be implicated in enhanced cellular senescence, accelerated aging and neurodegeneration, and the early development of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology present in TS mice and the DS population.

AB  - Due to its unique properties, nano fibrillated cellulose (NFC) has been a popular topic of research in recent years. Nevertheless, literature assessing environmental impacts of NFC production is scarce, especially for using other starting materials than wood pulp. Hence, in this study, a new approach of cascaded use of manure to produce biogas and subsequently use the cellulose containing digestate for NFC production (manure scenario) is compared to the production from Kraft pulp from hardwood chips (wood chips scenario) via life cycle assessment (LCA). To produce comparable outputs (NFC and biogas) in both scenarios a typical Austrian biogas plant with maize silage and pig slurry as input material is included in the wood chips scenario. A proxy approach is used to upscale the manure scenario from laboratory to an industrial scale (except for the pulp to NFC step) to ensure comparability of both scenarios. The impact categories global warming potential (GWP), fossil resource scarcity, freshwater eutrophication, human toxicity, terrestrial acidification (TAP) and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential are analysed referring to the functional unit of 1 kg NFC. Results show that the manure scenario has at least 45% lower impacts in all assessed categories. GWP is 4.41 kg CO2 eq./kg NFC in the manure and 9.74 kg CO2 eq./kg NFC in the wood chips scenario. The transformation step from pulp to NFC is identified as environmental hotspot due to the high electricity demand in both scenarios. Results are additionally assessed only for the industrial scale part (includes biogas and pulp production). In the latter the main difference can be found in the substrate production. While it plays a subordinate role in the manure scenario (up to 8%) as manure is seen as a waste stream with no upstream environmental impacts attached, the production of maize silage is one of the hotspots in the industrial part in the wood chips scenario. This difference is especially prominent in TAP, where the substrate production is responsible for 91% of the 0.06 kg SO2 eq. impact, which is tenfold the impact of the manure scenario. This underlines the issue of using energy crops as substrate in biogas plants. It also highlights the importance of further research of using waste streams as inputs for the electricity production and subsequent use in the pulp and paper industry. This LCA demonstrates that NFC production from manure is a sustainable alternative to the production from hardwood Kraft pulp.

AB  - BackgroundThe CREB1 gene encodes the cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB1), a leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates cellular gene expression in response to elevated levels of intracellular cAMP. When activated by phosphorylation, CREB1 binds to the cAMP response element (CRE) of the promoters of its target genes. CREB1 is an essential component in many physiological processes, and its function is correlated to neurodevelopment, plasticity and cell survival, and learning and memory. The NFATC2 gene codes for the nuclear factor of activated T-cells 2 protein. The NFATC2 protein is a DNA-binding protein that functions as an inducer of gene transcription during immune response.Methods and resultsThe aim of the present study was to examine the developmental expression of porcine CREB1 and NFACT2 transcripts. The expression of CREB1 and NFACT2 mRNA was examined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. For the CREB1 transcript, we found significant reduction in transcript levels in the brain stem and basal ganglia during porcine embryo development, determined from day 60 to day 115 of gestation. In contrast, a significant increase in CREB1 mRNA was detected in the lungs during embryo development. No significant changes in the NFATC2 transcript were detected in porcine brain tissue during embryo development.ConclusionsDifferential CREB1 mRNA expression was found in pig brain tissues during embryo development.

AB  - Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with cognitive dysfunction. Because the hypothalamus is implicated in energy balance control and memory disorders, we hypothesized that specific neurons in this brain region are at the interface of metabolism and cognition. Acute obesogenic diet administration in mice impaired recognition memory due to defective production of the neurosteroid precursor pregnenolone in the hypothalamus. Genetic interference with pregnenolone synthesis by Star deletion in hypothalamic POMC, but not AgRP neurons, deteriorated recognition memory independently of metabolic disturbances. Our data suggest that pregnenolone's effects on cognitive function were mediated via an autocrine mechanism on POMC neurons, influencing hippocampal long-term potentiation. The relevance of central pregnenolone on cognition was also confirmed in metabolically unhealthy patients with obesity. Our data reveal an unsuspected role for POMC neuron-derived neurosteroids in cognition. These results provide the basis for a framework to investigate new facets of POMC neuron biology with implications for cognitive disorders.

AB  - This study assesses the protective effects of astaxanthin (AST) against vitrification/warming-induced cryoinjuries of ovarian tissue slices in sheep. Cortical slices of slaughterhouse acquired-ovine ovaries were randomly distributed in different groups: fresh, toxicity, and five vitrification groups including vitrification in presence of 0 (control group), 1, 10 and 100 & mu;M astaxanthin or 100 & mu;M vitamin E. After vitrification/warming and 24 h culturing, the samples were subjected to histological studies, antioxidant evaluation by TAC and TBAR assays, and assessment of relative expression of BMP4, BMP15, GDF9 and KITLG genes related to folliculogenesis and follicular growth regulation. According to the results, vitrification reduced the percentage of morphologically intact follicles compared to the fresh and toxicity groups (p < 0.05). In vitrification groups, vitamin E and all three concentrations of AST increased the percentage of intact pre-antral follicles and antioxidant activity relative to the vitrified control (p < 0.05). This enhancement significantly occurred in 10 & mu;M AST group more than vitamin E (p < 0.05). Also, 10 & mu;M concentration of AST enhanced the expression of all the examined genes compared to the control (p < 0.05), while the expression of BMP4, BMP15 and KITLG was higher in the AST than vitamin E (p < 0.05). The latter could increase only the expression of GDF9 compared to the control group (p = 0.011). In conclusion, AST is a highly effective antioxidant for maintaining the survival of pre-antral follicles, retaining cell density, increasing total antioxidant capacity, and increasing the expression of some genes related to follicular development after short-term culture of vitrified/warmed ovarian tissue slices.

AB  - Harnessing the fear animals have of humans has the potential to aid in the conservation of wildlife. Most vertebrates perceive humans as "super predators." While predator cues are an important nonlethal management tool, the use of human cues for management has rarely been implemented or experimentally tested. Extensive poaching is threatening the persistence of white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum), and there is a need to deter them from areas with elevated poaching risks. To investigate the feasibility of harnessing the fear white rhinos have of humans to aid in their conservation, we conducted playback experiments at rhino middens. We broadcasted repeated human (treatment) and bird (control) vocalizations, and measured changes in visitations and antipredator responses. We found that overall rhino visitations did not change in response to controls but decreased by 46% in response to human vocalizations. This pattern appears to be driven by the response of females, who decreased their visitations by 70% in response to human vocalizations, while visitations by males remained unchanged. This difference is likely related to males defending small exclusive territories. Providing evidence that changes in female visitation rates were a function of the perceived fear of white rhinos, we found that both sexes exhibited more vigilance in response to human vocalizations (males 69.5%, females 96%) compared to controls. We also saw a 63% reduction of other herbivores at treatment sites. Our findings provide evidence that the fear of humans can be used to alter the movements and behavior of female white rhinos, critical for population recovery, as well as other large herbivores.

AB  - This study was investigated to determine the faecal volatiles, steroid hormones and their correlation with behavioural signs during oestrous cycle in sheep (Ovis aries). This experiment was monitored from pro-oestrous to met-oestrous phases for correlation of endocrine dependence biochemical constituents in faeces and blood to detection of oestrous biomarkers. Medroxyprogesterone acetate sponges were used for 8 days to bring uniformity of oestrus in sheep. Faeces were collected during different phases of cycle and subjected to determination of fatty acids, minerals, oestrogens and progesterone analysis. Likewise, blood samples were also obtained for enzymatic and no-enzymatic antioxidants. The results revealed that faecal progesterone and oestrogen levels significantly increased during pro-oestrous and oestrous phase, respectively (p < .05). The blood plasma enzymatic levels showed significant demarcation during the oestrous phase than other periods (p < .05). There were also reported marked variations in volatile fatty acids across different phases of the oestrous cycle. Interestingly, methyl octanoate, methyl cis-10 pentadecenoate and methyl heptadecanoate volatiles were found to be specific to oestrus period. In addition, methyl hexanoate, methyl palmitoleate and methyl cis-9 oleate were identified in met-oestrus, indicating their possible role to be an oestrous biomarker. It is concluded that the pattern of volatile compounds and faecal steroids, in association with behavioural patterns, could be measured as a non-invasive method of heat detection in sheep.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Kai-Xin-San (KXS) has been used for centuries in the treatment of depression. However, its antidepressant efficacy and the mechanisms involved in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) are not well understood. Aim of the study: This study aimed to examine whether KXS can improve TRD by restoring tryptophan (TRP) metabolism balance. Materials and methods: Fluoxetine-resistant depression (FRD) rats were identified through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and subsequently treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/d, ip.). Following this, KXS (491 mg/kg/ d, po.) was administered to the FRD rats for a duration of two weeks. The impacts of KXS on depressive-like behaviors, TRP metabolism, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and the proliferations of neurons, microglia and astrocytes were examined in FRD rats. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 conditioned medium (CM) was used to investigate the neuroprotective effects of KXS through the inhibition of the kynurenine pathway (KP) in microglia. Molecular docking was applied to clarify the interactions between the active compounds in KXS and key enzyme in KP. Results: In vivo, KXS improved depression-like behaviors in FRD rats, restoring TRP metabolism in both periphery and hippocampus by reducing indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO 1), tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO 2) and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO). This was evidenced by elevated levels of kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), KYN/TRP and KYNA/quinolinic acid (QA), alongside diminished concentrations of QA and 5-HT in serum, as well as increased KYNA, 5-HT and KYNA/QA, and decreased levels of KYN, QA and KYN/TRP in hippocampus. KXS attenuated neuroinflammation, alleviated BBB impairment by elevating Claudin 5 expressions, promoted neurogenesis, and inhibited microglial proliferation in hippocampus. The in vitro results further confirmed the advantageous effects of KXS on neurons through the inhibition of IDO 1 in microglia, as evidenced by increased viability, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD 95), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurofilament proteins (NF 68/160/200) in BV2 CM-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, molecular docking indicated that ginsenoside Rg3 may be the principal bioactive compound in KXS. Conclusion: KXS may partially alleviate FRD by influencing TRP metabolism and related BBB integrity, neurogenesis and microglial proliferation, with these effects mainly attributed to ginsenoside Rg3.

AB  - The Taihu Lake drainage basin is the birthplace of the Mulberry-dyke and Fish-pond System (MFS), a traditional eco-agricultural system. In 2017, the largest and best-preserved "Zhejiang Huzhou Mulberry-dyke and Fish-pond System" located by the South Bank of Taihu Lake, China was recognized as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and its value has been appreciated. As a dynamic heritage, the sustainable development of MFS is a fundamental requirement of the conservation of GIAHS. In this regard, it is necessary to figure out an approach to evaluating the status of its sustainable development. This paper analyzes and contrasts the emergy embodied in the three patterns of MFS over different periods, then constructs an index system of sustainability evaluation involving the production and consumption processes based on that. Finally, it provides the evaluation and analysis. The three patterns of MFS differ in the system structure. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties (abbreviated as Ming-Qing pattern), MFS was an integrated system compromised of mulberry cultivation, silkworm breeding, fish breeding, and sheep breeding, while other patterns exclude sheep breeding, but increase the input of fertilizer, and add the production of mulberry-leaf tea and other local specialties. The results show that the MFS in the Ming-Qing pattern has the highest integrated evaluation index of sustainable development, followed by the traditional MFS pattern and the new MFS pattern employed nowadays. This indicates that the current capability of sustainable development has decreased compared to that in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The integrated evaluation index regarding the consumption process of the new MFS pattern is higher than the traditional one, suggesting that it needs to promote sustainability in the production process, especially via the utilization rates of renewable resources and wastes.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is one of the essential trace elements and is widespread in the environment. However, excessive exposure will induce toxicity in animals. To investigate the potential mechanisms of Cu-induced porcine spleen toxicity, sixty 30-day-old pigs were randomly divided into three groups. The control group was fed a basal diet and two treatment groups were separately fed the diet with 125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg of Cu for 80 days. The result of immunohistochemical staining showed that the autophagy marker p62 was significantly increased under Cu exposure, and the immunofluorescence results showed the same trend as LC33-. Meanwhile, Cu intensified autophagy by increasing the expression levels of autophagy-related genes and proteins (LC3, p62, ATG5, Beclin1, and PINK1). These results suggested that long-term Cu exposure induced excessive autophagy in the porcine spleen, laying the groundwork for future studies on Cu-induced immunotoxicity in the spleen and increasing the public safety awareness of the excessive Cu-induced contamination in the environment.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii affects both conservation and public health efforts. In the Taipei Zoo, toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in ring-tailed lemurs and a meerkat in 2019 while a freeze-thaw meat strategy had been applied to carnivores before the event. To investigate the possible risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in the Taipei Zoo, 179 veterinary visiting mammals from 2019-2021 and six stray cats were included to detect anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM in their serum via ELISA, and T. gondii in their faeces and blood via PCR. Although the overall T. gondii IgG seroprevalence was 33.5% and PCR positivity was 16.2% in the zoo mammals, the correlation between T. gondii PCR and systemic IgG results was low. An omnivorous diet (adjusted OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-1.0), a herbivorous diet (adjusted OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1-9.6), and animals in the Conservation Area where stray cats appeared (adjusted OR = 18.3; 95% CI: 3.9-85.9) were independent risk factors for T. gondii infection. The low T. gondii-specific IgM positivity (0.6%) suggests that most animals did not have acute T. gondii infection. In conclusion, our findings indirectly support that feeding frozen meat to carnivores, cleaning fresh food, and restricting access to stray cats to prevent faecal contaminants could prevent animals from T. gondii exposure.

AB  - Reproductive traits, such as the number of teats and litter size, are essential for animal breeding pro-grams due to the importance of the production chain, since they influence the maternal ability of the sow and can affect the number of weaned piglets. We aim to identify candidate genes associated with reproductive traits in pigs, using GWAS data from a systematic review combined with sequencing data, to build networks of biological processes and transcription factors (TFs) from the identified genes to highlight the most candidate genes for litter size and the number of teats. In the systematic review, only peer-reviewed articles were used, with descriptors related to the evaluated traits, and selected based on eligibility criteria. Fourteen papers were selected and classified for functional analysis of gene networks with 2077 candidate genes identified. After combining with the list of genes presenting known structural variants in the 50UTR and/or coding region, 306 genes remained to be used to build the gene networks of biological processes and TFs, highlighting processes associated with litter size (e.g., ionotropic glutamate receptor signaling pathway and blastocyte growth) and the number of teats (e.g., growth hormone re-ceptor, regulation of the BMP -Bone Morphogenetic Proteins signaling pathway and blood vessel pro-liferation). Two most candidate genes for litter size trait (GRID2 and PALB2) and six most candidate genes for the number of teats (GHR, IFT80, FSTL3, SKOR1, SMURF1, and AKT3) were prioritized. TFs associated with candidate genes were also identified for litter size (PALB2 and GRID2) and the number of teats (RIN, LTBP2, and COL6A6). Thus, it is suggested that the most candidate genes and TFs presented in this study may play an important role in the traits studied, being important for genetic studies and animal breeding.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mice (Mus musculus) are nocturnal small animals belonging to the rodent family that live in burrows, an environment in which significantly high CO2 levels prevail. It is expected that mouse hemoglobin (Hb) plays an important role in their adaptation to living in such a high-CO2 environment, while many other species cannot. In the present study, mouse Hb was purified and crystallized at a physiological pH of 7 in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1); the crystals diffracted to 2.8 angstrom resolution. The primary amino-acid sequence and crystal structure of mouse Hb were compared with those of mammalian Hbs in order to investigate the structure-function relationship of mouse Hb. Differences were observed from guinea pig Hb in terms of amino-acid sequence and from cat Hb in overall structure (in terms of r.m.s.d.). The difference in r.m.s.d. from cat Hb may be due to the existence of the molecule in a conformation other than the Rstate. Analysis of tertiary- and quaternary-structural features, the alpha 1 beta 2 interface region and the heme environment without any ligands in all four heme groups showed that mouse methemoglobin is in an intermediate state between the Rstate and the T-state that is much closer to the R-state conformation.

AB  - Neural stem cells reside in the subgranular zone, a specialized neurogenic niche of the hippocampus. Throughout adulthood, these cells give rise to neurons in the dentate gyrus, playing an important role in learning and memory. Given that these core cognitive processes are disrupted in numerous disease states, understanding the underlying mechanisms of neural stem cell proliferation in the subgranular zone is of direct practical interest. Here, we report that mature neurons, neural stem cells and neural precursor cells each secrete the neurovascular protein epidermal growth factor-like protein 7 (EGFL7) to shape this hippocampal niche. We further demonstrate that EGFL7 knock-out in a Nestin-CreERT2-based mouse model produces a pronounced upregulation of neurogenesis within the subgranular zone. RNA sequencing identified that the increased expression of the cytokine VEGF-D correlates significantly with the ablation of EGFL7. We substantiate this finding with intraventricular infusion of VEGF-D upregulating neurogenesis in vivo and further show that VEGF-D knock-out produces a downregulation of neurogenesis. Finally, behavioral studies in EGFL7 knock-out mice demonstrate greater maintenance of spatial memory and improved memory consolidation in the hippocampus by modulation of pattern separation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that both EGFL7 and VEGF-D affect neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, with the ablation of EGFL7 upregulating neurogenesis, increasing spatial learning and memory, and correlating with increased VEGF-D expression.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to develop a model for understanding stress-induced sleep disturbances and to explore the potential interactions between sleep disturbances and mood disturbances. Methods: The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) group was established using the CUMS method, while the CUMS+Noise group was subjected to an additional 8-h exposure to noise in conjunction with the CUMS protocol. Each group was tested for anxiety and depressive-like behavior using the open-field, elevated plus maze, tail suspension, and forced swimming tests in male C57BL/6J mice. Subsequently, we assessed sleep status using sleep recordings and a standardized scoring system alongside the pentobarbital sodium-induced sleep test. Results: The mice in both model groups exhibited anxiety-like behavior. Sleep disturbances observed in the CUMS+Noise group were characterized by disruptions in sleep duration and circadian rhythm. This observation was supported by a marked reduction in multiple sleep time intervals and single sleep duration, as well as a significant increase in sleep duration at the final time interval of ZT23-24. To further investigate the potential mechanisms of interaction, we conducted an analysis of hub genes present in the hippocampal sequencing data utilizing weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant association between the hub genes Alb, P2rx1, and Npsr1 and key phenotypic traits. However, PCR experiments indicated that only Alb showed a significant difference, which aligns with the sequencing results. Conclusions: Albumin is a crucial transporter protein for thyroid hormones and plays a vital role in their metabolism. The interaction between sleep disorders and anxiety-like behavior may be closely linked to the dysfunctional transportation of thyroid hormones by albumin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low rumen pH is proposed to be a major mechanism for low methane (CH4) emissions from sheep fed forage rape. However, it is difficult to separate this from other in vivo factors, such as rumen passage rate. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of pH alone on CH4 production in vitro using different pH buffers. Ryegrass, white clover and forage rape were incubated in vitro using three different incubation buffers with starting pH values of 5.5, 6.2 and 6.8.
   RESULTS: Decreasing pH reduced overall in vitro CH4 emission relative to fermented hexoses (CH4/FHex) by up to 54% and overall fermentation by 40%. pH also changed fermentation profiles where the acetate + butyrate to propionate + valerate ratio decreased when pH decreased. Within the three forages, forage rape led to the lowest CH4/FHex, but only in pH5.5 and 6.2 buffer, and this was enhanced when the pH fell below 6.
   CONCLUSION: Reducing pH in vitro decreased CH4 production and overall fermentation across all forages. The lower pH reached by forage rape compared to ryegrass and white clover appears to drive the lower CH4 production relative to the extent of fermentation from forage rape compared to the other forages.

AB  - Object: A large number of studies have suggested that stemness is an essential mechanism for drug resistance, metastasis and relapse in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to determine the impact of MCM2 on stemness and identify potential mechanisms that complement the stemness regulatory network in HCC. Methods: MCM2 expression features and prognostic significance were analyzed in multiple cohorts, including TCGA LIHC dataset, GSE14520 dataset, Guangxi cohort, and GSE76427 dataset. Stemness-related molecules and phenotypes were examined to evaluate the impact of MCM2 on stemness. The expression levels of key molecules of the hippo signaling pathway together with downstream target genes were examined to evaluate the effect of MCM2 on hippo signaling. This was further demonstrated by rescue experiments with hippo signaling pathway inhibitors (super-TDU). Sorafenib-resistant cells were constructed to assess the effect of MCM2 on drug resistance. A xenotransplantation model of nude mice was constructed to validate the role of MCM2 in vivo. Results: MCM2, which is expressed at higher levels in HCC tissue than in normal liver tissues, is a good indicator for distinguishing tumor tissues from normal liver tissues and can help differentiate HCC patients at different BCLC stages. The annotation of the differentially expressed genes in the MCM2 high and low expression groups indicated that MCM2 may be associated with the hippo signaling pathway. In addition, the expression of MCM2 in HCC tissues was correlated with the expression of YAP1/TAZ, which are key molecules of the hippo signaling pathway. It indicated that manipulation of MCM2 expression affects hippo signaling and stemness, while the inhibition of hippo signaling significantly reversed the effect of MCM2 on stemness. Disruption of MCM2 expression significantly elevated the sensitivity of sorafenib-resistant cells to sorafenib, as evidenced by the decrease in IC50 and diminished sphere-forming capacity. The in vivo assays showed that MCM2 effectively enhanced the efficacy of sorafenib. Conclusion: MCM2 is a good prognostic marker. MCM2 enhances the stemness of HCC cells by affecting the Hippo signaling pathway, while the downregulation of MCM2 inhibits resistance towards sorafenib.

AB  - I examined 107 shining cuckoos that died accidentally in the northern North Island, New Zealand, during 39 years. Birds arriving on migration in spring were all in adult plumage. Juveniles occurred mainly from January to March. The sex-ratio of adults was 1:1. In several measurements, females were slightly larger than males on average, and adults slightly larger than juveniles. Gonad size suggested readiness for breeding from September to January (inclusive). Ninety-one gizzards held a total of 3754 arthropod food items. Insects (10 orders) made up around 94% of items and just two orders accounted for 79% of food items: caterpillars (larval Lepidoptera, 55%) and beetles (Coleoptera, 24%). 'Spiny' caterpillars made up roughly 8% of total caterpillars. Ladybirds (Coccinellidae) made up 21% of beetles. Shining cuckoos ate small prey, mostly 1-10 mm long (44%) and 11-20 mm long (43%). By eating hairy caterpillars and ladybirds, shining cuckoos exert predatory control on insects that other birds avoid. By gorging (up to 258 insects per stomach) the cuckoo might dampen the impact of herbivorous insects (e.g. caterpillar infestations) on plants.

AB  - Novel interactions between introduced oaks and their natural enemies across different continents provide an opportunity to test the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) at local and global scales. Based on the ERH, we assessed the impacts of native seed-feeding insects on introduced and native oaks within and among continents. We combined a common-garden experiment in China and biogeographic literature surveys to measure seed predation by insects and the proportion of acorn embryos surviving after insect infestation among 4 oak species with different geographical origins: Quercus mongolica origin from China, Q. robur and Q. petraea from Europe, and Q. rubra from North America. Mostly supporting the ERH, oaks in introduced continents escaped seed predation compared to those in native continents and compared to other native oaks in introduced continents. Common-garden comparisons showed that total acorn infestation rate of introduced Q. rubra (section Lobatae) was considerably lower than that of native oaks (section Quercus) in China and Europe, likely because of the differences in seed traits associated with different oak sections. Literature surveys showed that seed predation of introduced oaks was lower in the introduced continent than in the native continent. Embryo survival was higher in introduced Q. rubra than native oaks in China and Poland. However, insect seed predation of recently introduced Q. rubra in China was similar to that in Europe, which is not consistent with the ERH. Our results suggest that reduced acorn attack by native insects and higher embryo survival after acorn damage could increase the establishment success or invasion risk of introduced oaks in non-native continents.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large DNA virus that is highly contagious and pathogenic in domestic pigs with a mortality rate up to 100%. However, how ASFV suppresses JAK-STAT1 signaling to evade the immune response remains unclear. In this study, we found that the ASFV-encoded protein MGF-505-7R inhibited proinflammatory IFN-gamma-mediated JAK-STAT1 signaling. Mechanistically, MGF-505-7R was found to interact with JAK1 and JAK2 and mediate their degradation. Further study indicated that MGF-505-7R promoted degradation of JAK1 and JAK2 by upregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF125 expression and inhibiting expression of Hes5, respectively. Consistently, MGF-505-7R-deficient ASFV induced high levels of IRF1 expression and displayed compromised replication both in primary porcine alveolar macrophages and pigs compared with wild-type ASFV. Furthermore, MGF-505-7R deficiency attenuated the virulence of the ASFV and pathogenesis of ASF in pigs. These findings suggest that the JAK-STAT1 axis mediates the innate immune response to the ASFV and that MGF-505-7R plays a critical role in the virulence of the ASFV and pathogenesis of ASF by antagonizing this axis. Thus, we conclude that deletion of MGF-505-7R may serve as a strategy to develop attenuated vaccines against the ASFV.

AB  - Increasing the efficiency of farm animal reproduction is necessary to reduce the environmental impact of food production systems. One approach is to increase the number of healthy eggs (oocytes) produced per female for fertilization, thus it is important to understand factors that decrease oocyte health. One paracrine factor that decreases ovarian follicle growth is fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) secreted by cells in the theca layer of the ovarian follicle, however the factors that regulate FGF18 secretion are unknown. In this study we hypothesized that FGF18 secretion is controled by intrafollicular factors and is linked to fertility, which we tested by using cell culture and sheep genetic models in vivo. Separation of theca cell populations revealed that FGF18 messenger RNA (mRNA) is located mainly in thecal endothelial rather than endocrine cells, and immunohistochemistry localized FGF18 protein to microvessels in the theca layer in situ. Culture of ovine theca-derived endothelial cells was used to demonstrate stimulation of FGF18 mRNA and protein abundance by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), a growth factor derived from theca endocrine cells. Taking advantage of a sheep genetic model, we demonstrate reduced ovarian and peripheral FGF18 concentrations in the hyperprolific Booroola ewe harboring the FecB(B) mutation in BMPR1B. These data suggest a novel control of fertility by follicular endothelial cells, in which theca endocrine cells secrete BMP4 that stimulates the secretion of FGF18 from thecal endothelial cells, which in turn diffuses into the granulosa cell layer and promotes apoptosis.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Norway spruce ointments on wound healing of castration wounds in piglets. This study included 95 male pigs randomly divided into five treatment groups: Norway spruce balm (Vulpuran), Norway spruce resin (Abilar), pork lard (ointment base of Vulpuran), no treatment (negative control) and antibiotic blue spray (Cyclo spray, positive control). Wound healing parameters (such as healing time, wound size, reddening of wound edges and surrounding, swelling, secretion and wound contamination), microbiological status and the haptoglobin level as an inflammation parameter were investigated. In the Norway spruce groups, some positive effects on wound healing parameters were found. In the first 6 days of treatment, Abilar or Vulpuran showed the smallest means of wound areas, and at the end of the study (day 15+17), the highest rates of completely closed wounds compared to the other groups. Vulpuran treatment led to significantly lower wound secretion (p=0.003) and wound contamination (p=0.015) than the untreated control did. Furthermore, the microbiological status was determined using MALDI-TOF-MS and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing at different days of treatment. A comparison of the five treatment groups on day 3 revealed that Norway spruce led to the lowest rate of wounds colonised with fungi, mainly classified into genus Candida, (Abilar 77%, Vulpuran 70%) in comparison with blue spray (89%), lard (100%) and untreated control (100%). Fungi could only be detected in one of the 13 samples treated with Vulpuran on day 8, which nearly reached significance (p=0.055).

AB  - We investigated the feeding ecology of the crested porcupine Hystrix cristata in a semi-arid area of its northwestern Algerian native range over 8 months (September to April). Our results from micro-histological analysis based on faecal pellets revealed that this strict herbivore ate only 10 plant species, 8 wild and 2 cultivated, belonging to 9 families including Lamiaceae, Palmaceae, Poaceae, Ramnaceae and Fabaceae. The autumn diet was dominated by Thymus algeriensis, Ziziphus lotus, Chamaerops humilis and Triticum aestivum, the winter diet by T. algeriensis and C. humilis, and the spring diet by Muscari comosum, with a large amount of Vicia faba and T. aestivum. We confirm the role of this rodent species as a generalist herbivore which barely feeds on cultivated plants when wild resources are diverse and abundant.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the current study was to investigate the beneficial effects of rosiglitazone (Rosi) on amyloid beta(A & beta;) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the hippocampus and neuroinflammation-associated learning and memory impairments in rats. Materials and methods: The rats were grouped and treated as follows: (1) Control in which saline and vehicle were administered instead of LPS and Rosi respectively. (2) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group in which LPS was dissolved in saline and injected (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Vehicle was administered instead of Rosi in this group. (3-5) LPS+ Rosi 1, LPS+ Rosi 3, and LPS+ Rosi 5 groups in them 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg of Rosi respectively was administered 30 min before LPS. The treatments were done for two weeks. In the first week, Rosi or its vehicle was injected 30 min before LPS. In the second week, the treatments were the same as the first week and behavioral tests were also carried out in the second week. The hippocampal tissues were finally detached for biochemical assessment. Results: The results showed that Rosi reversed increased levels of A & beta;, GFAP, interleukin (IL)- 6, tumor necrosis factor-& alpha; (TNF-& alpha;), nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, and malondialdehyde (MDA) due to LPS injection. Rosi also reversed attenuating effects of LPS on IL-10 and thiol concentration and activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In the Morris water maze test, the LPS group had a longer latency to find the platform while spent a shorter time spent in the target quadrant in the probe trial than the control group. In the passive avoidance test, the animals of the LPS group had a shorter delay to enter the dark chamber than the animals of the control group. Treatment with Rosi reversed these parameters. Conclusion: The findings showed Rosi attenuated A & beta;, GFAP, and oxidative stress in the hippocampus and neuroinflammation-associated learning and memory impairments in rats.

AB  - Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) distribution in the brain has been associated with different reproductive and social strategies of species. Rhabdomys pumilio (R. pumilio) and Rhabdomys dilectus (R. dilectus) are two sister rodent species that live in large/medium (but flexible) or small (mostly solitary) social groups respectively. In this study, we describe and compare the distribution of OXTR in these two species. OXTR binding in the brain of R. pumilio (8 females and 5 males) and R. dilectus (8 females and 5 males) adults was determined using autoradiography. Our results revealed significant differences in the nucleus accumbens, diagonal band, medial preoptic area, lateral habenula, superior colliculus, periaqueductal area and anterior paraventricular nucleus (higher in R. dilectus), and the dorsal lateral septum and anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (higher in R. pumilio). OXTR density in other brain regions, such as the amygdala nuclei and hippocampus, did not differ between the two species. Sex differences were found in the medial preoptic area and ventral region of the lateral septum in R. pumilio (OXTR density higher in males) and in the anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and basolateral amygdala of R. dilectus (OXTR density higher in females). A sex difference in the density of OXTR was also found in the posterior region of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, where it was higher in males than in females of both species. This study shows species-specific brain distribution of OXTR in R. pumilio and R. dilectus that are unique, but with similarities with other polygynous or promiscuous rodent species that live in variable size groups, such as R. norvergicus, C. sociabilis, S. teguina and M. musculus.

AB  - We hypothesized that nutrient restriction from day 50-90 of gestation decreases umbilical blood flow and that umbilical blood flow would recover to control values upon realimentation during late gestation (d 90 to 130) or remain reduced in ewes that continued to be nutrient restricted. On d 50 of gestation, young nulliparous whiteface ewes (6-8 mo; n = 41) carrying singletons were randomly assigned to two dietary treatments: 100% of NRC recommendations (CON) or 60% of CON (RES). On d 90 of gestation, ewes either remained on CON or RES until d 130, or CON ewes were RES from d 90 to 130, or RES ewes were realimented to CON from d 90 to 130. This resulted in 4 treatment groups on day 130: CON-CON, CON-RES, RES-RES, RES-CON. Umbilical blood flow and fetal and placental measurements were obtained via ultrasonography every 10 days from day 50-110. Non-survival surgeries were performed on days 50, 90, and 130 (n = 6-7 ewes/group) where uterine artery and umbilical blood flows were measured during surgery via ultrasonography. Conceptus weights were recorded and placentomes collected to determine binucleate cell numbers. The study was conducted as a completely randomized design arrangement with repeated measures. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. There was a nutritional treatment by day interaction (P < 0.01) with CON ewes having greater umbilical blood flow compared with RES by d 90. Fetal biparietal distance, abdominal width, and kidney area increased (P < 0.05) in CON-RES with all these measurements increasing during late gestation. We partially accept our hypothesis as nutrient restriction during mid gestation decreased umbilical blood flow. However, blood flow did not return to control levels upon realimentation. By d 130, fetal and placental weights were similar between RES-RES and CON-CON. Binucleate cell numbers in the fetal trophoblast were not influenced by nutritional treatments. Our findings suggest that refeeding previously nutrient restricted pregnant adolescent ewes to control levels does not reestablish umbilical blood flow. Adequate placental development during mid gestation could protect the fetus from a decreased umbilical blood flow later in gestation when nutrients were limited by 40%.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Melophagus ovinus is a hematophagous insect that is distributed worldwide and plays a crucial role in transmitting disease-causing pathogens. From June 2021 to March 2022, a total of 370 M. ovinus were collected from 11 sampling points in southern Xinjiang, China. The specimens were identified using morphological and molecular analyses. Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasma ovis were detected from all the samples using seven Rickettsia-specific genetic markers and the msp-4 gene of A. ovis. Approximately 11% of the M. ovinus specimens were positive for Rickettsia spp., and Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae was the most predominant species (35/41; 85.4%), while R. massiliae was least prevalent (6/41; 14.6%). Approximately 10.5% (39/370) of the M. ovinus specimens were positive for A. ovis of genotype III, which was co-detected with Candidatus R. barbariae in M. ovinus (3/370; 0.8%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of R. massiliae and Candidatus R. barbariae in M. ovinus globally. The detection and control of insect-borne diseases originating from M. ovinus should be strengthened in southern Xinjiang, an area important to animal husbandry and production.

AB  - Animal-derived hyaluronidase, which hydrolyzes the polysaccharide hyaluronic acid, has been used in medical applications despite its limited purity. Additionally, the N-glycan characterization of sheep testicular hyaluronidase (STH) and its structural role remain poorly understood. In this study, STH was purified from the commercially available STH preparation (containing at least 14 impurity proteins) using heparin-affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The structure and quantity of N-glycans of STH were investigated using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-high energy collision dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry. Two isoforms, H3S1 and H3S2, of STH were obtained (purity >98 %) with a yield of 3.4 % and 5.1 %, respectively. Fourteen N-glycans, including nine core-fucosylated N-glycans (important for the stability and function of glycoproteins), were identified in both H3S1 and H3S2, with similar quantities of each N-glycan. The amino acid sequences of the proteolytic peptides of H3S1 and H3S2 were compared with those reported in STH. The hyaluronic acid-degrading activity of deglycosylated H3S1 and H3S2 was reduced to 70.8 % and 71.1 % compared to that (100 %) of H3S1 and H3S2, respectively. This is the first report of N-glycan characterization of two highly purified isoforms of STH. These H3S1 and H3S2 will be useful for medical use without unwanted effects of partially purified STH.

AB  - Chronic hypercapnia (CH) is a hallmark of respiratory-related diseases, and the level of hypercapnia can acutely or progressively become more severe. Previously, we have shown time-dependent adaptations in steady-state physiology during mild (arterial Pco(2) similar to 55 mmHg) and moderate (similar to 60 mmHg) CH in adult goats, including transient (mild CH) or sustained (moderate CH) suppression of acute chemosensitivity suggesting limitations in adaptive respiratory control mechanisms as the level of CH increases. Changes in specific markers of glutamate receptor plasticity, interleukin-1 beta, and serotonergic modulation within key nodes of cardiorespiratory control do not fully account for the physiological adaptations to CH. Here, we used an unbiased approach (bulk tissue RNA sequencing) to test the hypothesis that mild or moderate CH elicits distinct gene expression profiles in important brain stem regions of cardiorespiratory control, which may explain the contrasting responses to CH. Gene expression profiles from the brain regions validated the accuracy of tissue biopsy methodology. Differential gene expression analyses revealed greater effects of CH on brain stem sites compared with the medial prefrontal cortex. Mild CH elicited an upregulation of predominantly immune-related genes and predicted activation of immune-related pathways and functions. In contrast, moderate CH broadly led to downregulation of genes and predicted inactivation of cellular pathways related to the immune response and vascular function. These data suggest that mild CH leads to a steady-state activation of neuroinflammatory pathways within the brain stem, whereas moderate CH drives the opposite response. Transcriptional shifts in immune-related functions may underlie the cardiorespiratory network's capability to respond to acute, more severe hypercapnia when in a state of progressively increased CH.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mild chronic hypercapnia (CH) broadly upregulated immune-related genes and a predicted activation of biological pathways related to immune cell activity and the overall immune response. In contrast, moderate CH primarily downregulated genes related to major histocompatibility complex signaling and vasculature function that led to a predicted inactivation of pathways involving the immune response and vascular endothelial function. The severity-dependent effect on immune responses suggests that neuroinflammation has an important role in CH and may be important in the maintenance of proper ventilatory responses to acute and chronic hypercapnia.

AB  - Rodent models in rats, mice, and guinea pigs have been extremely helpful to gain insight into pregnancy physiology and pathologies-related. Moreover, they have allowed understanding the mechanism that links an adverse intrauterine environment with the origin of adult disease. In this regard, the effects of diverse maternal conditions, such as undernutrition, obesity, hypoxia, and hyperandrogenism on placental function and its long-term consequences for the offspring, have been widely analyzed through rodents models involving dietary manipulations, modifications in environmental oxygen, surgical and pharmacological procedures that reduce uteroplacental blood flow and administrations of exogenous testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) mimicking maternal androgen excess. Both in human and in rodent models, these interventions induce modifications of placental morphology, transport of glucose, amino acid, and fatty acids, steroid synthesis, and signaling pathways control placental function. These changes are associated with the increase of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. For its part, offspring exhibit alterations in organs involved in metabolic control such as the hypothalamus, adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas altering the intake and preferences for certain foods, the metabolism of glucose and lipid, and hormonal function leading to fat accumulation, insulin resistance, fatty liver, dyslipidemia, and elevated glucose levels. Therefore, the present review discusses the evidence emerging from rodent models that relate maternal nutrition, hypoxia, and androgen exposure to the maternal mechanisms that lead to fetal programming and their metabolic consequences in postnatal life.

AB  - In briefTranscription factors are crucial for lineage specification in the preimplantation development of mammals. This research shows that TEAD3 and TEAD4 play important and overlapping functions in directing trophectoderm fate decisions during this developmental stage in cattle.AbstractDuring mammalian preimplantation development, the transition from morula to blastocyst is a critical biological event. This process involves polarization and initial specification of lineages, regulated by various transcription factors that have been extensively studied in mice. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that TEAD3 is specifically expressed in the trophectoderm cells of bovine preimplantation embryos, unlike in mice. The objective of this study is to determine the functional role of TEAD3 in bovine preimplantation development. While TEAD3 knockdown does not affect blastocyst formation in cattle, embryos fail to progress to the blastocyst stage when both TEAD3 and TEAD4, another member of the TEAD family, are disrupted using RNA interference and base editing techniques, respectively. This finding suggests a redundant role for TEAD3 and TEAD4 during preimplantation development in cattle. RNA sequencing analysis identified dysregulation of 215 genes, with 53 genes upregulated and 162 genes downregulated. Notably, we observed a reduction in the expression of trophectoderm lineage-specific genes KRT8, KRT18 and EZR and HIPPO signaling pathway components. Immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that the protein expression levels of KRT8 and EZR were significantly decreased. Importantly, the initial expression of trophectoderm lineage-specific genes, such as TFAP2C and GATA3, and the inner cell mass lineage-specific genes, such as OCT4, remained unaffected. This contrasts with the role of TEAD4 in directly regulating the trophectoderm lineage specification in mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate that TEAD3 and TEAD4 play essential and redundant roles upstream of trophectoderm fate decisions during preimplantation development in cattle.

Recent six collections made with the assistance of Bangladesh Navy revealed 8 seaweeds species which are Pterocladiella maribagoensis Boo and Geraldino, Hypnea spinella (C. Agardh) Kutzing, Peyssonnelia polymorpha (Zanar.) Schmitz, Jania pumila Lam., J. ungulata f. brevior (Yendo) Yendo (Rhodophyta); Caulerpa racemosa var. clavifera (Turner) Bosse, Bryopsis plumosa (Huds.) C. Ag. and Halimeda tuna (Ellis & Solander) Lam. (Chlorophyta). Of these six seaweeds such as Pterocladiella maribagoensis Boo et Geraldino, Hypnea spinella (C. Agardh) Kutzing, Jania pumila Lamx., J. ungulata f. brevior (Yendo) Yendo, Bryopsis plumosa (Huds.) C. Ag. and Halimeda tuna (Ellis & Solander) Lam. have been newly recorded and described from the SMR in Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh territory). Presence of Peyssonnelia polymorpha and Bryopsis plumosa in the collections and physical and chemical water environments recorded indicated it as a true newly forming reef. The present illustrated account is however may be considered as base-line information on seaweed flora of the new SMR in the North-east Bangladesh coast. A total of six seaweeds have been newly recorded making the total seaweeds to 216 mostly from the SMI and nearby SMR.

AB  - Thus far, the potential short- and long-term detrimental effects of a variety of environmental chemicals designated as endocrine-active compounds (EACs) have been found to interfere with histo- and anatomo-physiological functions of the reproductive system in humans and wildlife species. For those reasons, this study sought to examine whether selected EACs, which encompass the fungicide vinclozolin (Vnz), the androgenic anabolic steroid nandrolone (Ndn) and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA), affect the developmental competence and molecular quality (MQ) of porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) subjected to in vitro maturation (IVM) under 3D culture conditions. The COCs underwent 3D-IVM in the presence of Vnz, Ndn or CsA for 48 h. To explore whether the selected EACs induce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in cumulus cells (CCs), TUNEL-assisted detection of late apoptotic cells was performed. Additionally, for the detailed evaluation of pro- and antiapoptotic pathways in COCs, apoptosis proteome profiler arrays were used. To determine changes in intracellular metabolism in COCs, comprehensive assessments of mitochondrial ultrastructure and activity were carried out. Moreover, the relative abundances (RAs) of mRNAs transcribed from genes that are involved in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as SIRT3 and FOXO3, and intramitochondrial bioenergetic balance, such as ATP synthase subunit (ATP5A1), were ascertained. Finally, to investigate the extent of progression of oocyte maturation, the intraooplasmic levels of cAMP and the RAs of mRNA transcripts encoding regulatory and biocatalytic subunits of a heterodimeric meiosis-promoting factor, termed cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDC2), were also estimated. The obtained results provide, for the first time, strong evidence that both Vnz and Ndn decrease the developmental competence of oocytes and stimulate apoptosis processes in CCs. The present study is also the first to highlight that Vnz accelerates the maturation process in immature oocytes due to both increased ROS production and the augmented RA of the CCNB1 gene. Furthermore, Vnz was proven to trigger proapoptotic events in CCs by prompting the activity of the FOXO3 transcription factor, which regulates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In turn, Ndn was shown to inhibit oocyte maturation by inducing molecular events that ultimately lead to an increase in the intraooplasmic cAMP concentration. However, due to the simultaneous enhancement of the expression of TNF-beta and HSP27 proteins in CCs, Ndn might be responsible for the onset of their neoplastic transformation. Finally, our current investigation is the first to clearly demonstrate that although CsA did not interfere with the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes, by inducing mitophagy in CCs, it disrupted oocyte metabolism, consequently attenuating the parameters related to the MQ of COCs. Summing up, Vnz, Ndn and CsA reduced not only the processes of growth and IVM but also the MQ of porcine COCs, which might make them unsuitable for assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) such as in vitro fertilization by either gamete co-incubation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT).

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae are widespread pathogens which cause a negative health impact on swine and thus lead to important economic losses in farms. Vaccination is the main preventive measure for both infections and, since the recommended vaccination programs against both pathogens are very similar, bivalent vaccines are commercially available. However, the immune status of the sows against these infections could interfere in the efficacy of these products. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of two ready-to-use vaccines against PCV2 and M. hyopneumoniae in a herd positive to both infections under field conditions, considering the sow parity of the studied piglets. Both vaccines were efficient in preventing the development of PCV2 viremia, M. hyopneumoniae lung lesions and improving pig growth. Nevertheless, only one of them showed a significant improvement in the average daily weight gain and in the reduction of lung lesions when compared to the unvaccinated group. Sow parity did not interfere in the obtained outcomes. Considering the used vaccine, the anti-PCV2 antibody response was slightly different in pigs from primiparous sows than in those from sows with a higher parity number. Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae are economically important pathogens in swine farms. Vaccination is the main preventive measure for both infections. In order to test two ready-to-use bivalent vaccines, 646 piglets from a herd actively infected with both pathogens were stratified according to the sow parity number and randomly assigned to three groups: A and B were vaccinated with two different vaccines, respectively, while C remained as the unvaccinated control. Vaccine efficacy was assessed based on the weight, average daily weight gain (ADWG), degree of lung lesions, presence of PCV2 viremia by qPCR and presence of PCV2 and M. hyopneumoniae antibody levels by ELISA. Our data revealed that the sow parity did not influence the vaccine outcomes. Good results for most of the analyzed parameters were observed in both vaccinated groups. ADGW and final weight were higher and lung lesions were less evident in both vaccinated groups than in the control one, but only Group A showed a significant improvement. PCV2 viremia was not detected in Group A, but it did appear in Group B coinciding with its peak in Group C. Finally, both the PCV2 and M. hyopneumoniae serological patterns differed depending on the employed vaccine.

AB  - In order to increase the fertility rate of ewes throughout the year, expensive assisted reproduction programs are used during the spring-summer season despite the hot conditions in the tropics that can negatively affect them. Due to the photoperiod, ewes tend to mate only during the autumn-winter months, when daylight hours are reduced. Merino Socorro Island Merino ewes and their crosses with Pelibuey under warm conditions can significantly help sheep production units located in the tropics of cancer because they show reproductive activity during the spring and autumn seasons in the tropics. In addition, the reproductive efficiency of flocks could be improved by using oestrus synchronization protocols based on timed artificial insemination programs or natural mating. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of spring and autumn seasons on the reproductive activity of Merino Socorro Island ewes and their crosses with Pelibuey under heat stress (HS) conditions in the tropics. All ewes (n = 80) were randomly assigned to one of two breeds during the first and second periods, respectively: (1) Twenty Socorro Island Merino ewes (SIM) and (2) 20 Pelibuey Crossbred ewes (PBC). Animals were fed the same diet and given water ad libitum. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software 9.12 procedures. In both seasons, a mean of more than 80 U of maximum THI was obtained, while in spring and autumn, the minimum THI exceeded 30 and 40 U, respectively. All animals were in oestrus and ovulated in both seasons. The frequency of animals in spring during the first 48 h of oestrus expression was greater (p < 0.05) than 48-55 h but similar (p > 0.05) than 55-65 h; in autumn during the first 48 h and 48-55 h were similar (p > 0.05), but different (p < 0.05) than 55-65 h. The duration of oestrus expression was longer in the spring than in the autumn (p < 0.05). The frequency of animals was higher (p < 0.05) in SIM than in PBC ewes during the first oestrus cycle (1-17 d) and was also higher (p < 0.05) in PBC than in SIM ewes during the second oestrus cycle (18-35 d). The SIM ewes produced more (p < 0.05) progesterone (P4) than the PBC ewes. During the sampling days of the oestrus cycle, more P4 was created in autumn than in spring (p < 0.05). Both breeds showed severe HS. In the future, ewes treated under assisted reproductive programs in the tropics may improve reproductive efficiency.

AB  - A study of the male vibrational calling signals, host plants, and morphological characters of Pseudophlepsius binotatus sensu lato showed that in Russia and adjacent countries this taxon includes three biological species. P. binotatus is distributed in the semi-deserts and deserts of the Lower Volga region and Central Asia and feeds on camel thorn (Alhagi spp.). P. abdykulovi sp. nov. described from southeastern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan was collected from Glycyrrhiza spp., Caragana sp., and Halimodendron halodendron. P. septentrionalis stat. nov. inhabits the mixed-grass steppes of southern Russia and Kazakhstan and penetrates into the low mountains and forest zone; it was found on Hamaecytisus ruthenicus and Calophaca soongorica. P. binotatus and P. abdykulovi sp. nov. are indistinguishable by the shape of the male genitalia and differ from each other only by the shape of the teeth on the 2nd valvulae of the ovipositor. P. septentrionalis stat. nov. differs from the other two species by the shape of aedeagus and subgenital plates.

AB  - steoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disorder, causing physical impairments among the elderly. Core binding factor subunit beta (Cbf beta) has a critical role in bone homeostasis and cartilage development. However, the function and mechanism of Cbf beta in articular cartilage and OA remains unclear. We found that Cbf beta(f/f)Aggrecan-CreER(T) mice with Cbf beta-deficiency in articular cartilage developed a spontaneous osteoarthritis-like phenotype with articular cartilage degradation. Immunofluorescence staining showed that Cbf beta(f/f)Aggrecan-CreER(T) mice exhibited a significant increase in the expression of articular cartilage degradation markers and inflammatory markers in the knee joints. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated that Cbf beta orchestrated Hippo/Yap, TGF beta/Smad, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in articular cartilage, and Cbf beta deficiency resulted in the abnormal expression of downstream genes involved in maintaining articular cartilage homeostasis. Immunofluorescence staining results showed Cbf beta deficiency significantly increased active beta-catenin and TCF4 expression while reducing Yap, TGF beta 1, and p-Smad 2/3 expression. Western blot and qPCR validated gene expression changes in hip articular cartilage of Cbf beta-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that deficiency of Cbf beta in articular cartilage leads to an OA-like phenotype via affecting Hippo/Yap, TGF beta, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways, disrupting articular cartilage homeostasis and leading to the pathological process of OA in mice. Our results indicate that targeting Cbf beta may be a potential therapeutic target for the design of novel and effective treatments for OA.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the inclusion of chromium propionate or calcium salts of palm oil in ewes' diet during the final third of gestation and lactation on progeny performance, carcass characteristics, non-carcass components, and bone density. Forty-three ewe, Santa Ines and Dorper breed, three +/- one-year-old, and body weight 57 +/- 10 kg were used. The experimental design was in casual blocks in three treatments, CTL treatment (n = 15) with starch from corn; CR (n = 15) diet CTL plus chromium propionate; PF (n = 13) diet CTL plus calcium salts of palm oil. After weaning, 23 male lambs from these ewes were confined in individual stalls, with the same diet for 60 days, slaughtered. The data were analyzed using the SAS program, PROC GLM, and compared the means using Tukey's test at 5% probability. The maternal diet did not alter the dry matter intake, feeding efficiency, and average daily weight gain. Therefore, weights (weaning and slaughter) and carcass yield were higher for CR and PF groups than for CTL (P < 0.05). The treatment did not influence the loin eye area and fat thickness (P > 0.05). The spleen and the respiratory tract were smaller for PF and larger for CTL (P < 0.05). Leg weight was higher for CR. The perimeter and depth of the shank for the CR and PF lambs were higher, indicating an effect of maternal nutrition in this commercial cut. The CR group had a smaller epiphysis measurement and femur length than the CTL group. We concluded that the fetal programming effect in ewes fed with Cr propionate and Ca salts of palm oil benefited the progeny by increasing their body weight, better carcass yield, and a higher proportion of prime cuts.

AB  - Egg yolk, commonly employed as a cryoprotectant in semen cryopreservation, contains large particle matter that can diminish semen quality post thaw and complicate its quality assessment. For this reason, we designed a centrifugal treatment of chicken egg yolk to evaluate its effect on the cryopreservation of porcine semen. The control group (CG) was prepared with a dilution of chicken egg yolk by conventional mixing treatment, and the experimental group (EG) used a dilution of centrifugally treated chicken egg yolk for the ultra-low-temperature cryopreservation of porcine semen. The freezing process was carried out by conventional freezing methods. The spermatozoa were subsequently assessed for various parameters, including motility, acrosome integrity rate, plasma membrane integrity rate, antioxidant indexes, apoptosis rate, and the expression of apoptosis-related genes. The results showed that, post freeze-thawing, the motility, viability, VSL, and VCL of the spermatozoa in the EG were significantly higher than those observed in the CG (p < 0.05). Additionally, the acrosome integrity and plasma membrane integrity of the spermatozoa in the EG were significantly enhanced compared to the CG (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the EG exhibited significantly lower MDA content and sperm apoptosis rate (p < 0.05), while demonstrating significantly higher T-AOC and CAT levels (p < 0.05) relative to the CG. In comparison to the CG, the EG exhibited a significant reduction in the gene expression of TNF-a and Bax in the spermatozoa (p < 0.05), whereas the expression levels of CAT and Bcl-2 were significantly elevated (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the dilution solution formulated through the centrifugal processing of chicken egg yolk demonstrated efficacy in enhancing the quality of porcine spermatozoa following cryopreservation and subsequent thawing.

AB  - Gall cytological, metabolic, and structural traits are established due to the feeding habits of the associated galling herbivores, and sometimes are influenced by other organisms involved in the interaction. We tested this assumption on three gall morphotypes, the globoid, the lenticular, and the fusiform, induced by Cecidomyiidae on leaflets of Inga ingoides (Rich.) Willd. (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae). Taking for granted that the three Cecidomyiidae galls are induced on the same host plant and organ, we assume that the cytological and histochemical traits of their nutritive cells may be similar, but under the fungi influence, the ambrosia gall cytological profile may be peculiar and reflect on the accumulation of primary metabolites. The ambrosia globoid galls involve three organisms (host plant, gall inducer, and fungi), while the fusiform and the lenticular galls involve two organisms (host plant and gall inducer). The accumulation of primary metabolites is similar among the three gall morphotypes, except for the non-detection of reducing sugars in the fusiform galls. The fungi presence can impact the system but does not define exclusive features for the ambrosia globoid galls when compared to the lenticular and fusiform morphotypes. In fact, the cytological traits have revealed three different cytological mechanisms for food resources availability to the three galling Cecidomyiidae: (a) cell wall destructuring and cell death by fungi intermediation in the ambrosia globoid galls, (b) necrosis-type cell death in the fusiform galls, and (c) maintenance of continuous metabolic activity in the lenticular galls.

AB  - In brief: Proper early embryonic development in mammals relies on precise cellular signaling pathways. This study reveals that NSUN5 is crucial for the regulation of the Hippo pathway, ensuring normal proliferation and differentiation in mouse preimplantation embryos. NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family, member 5 (NSUN5) is an enzyme belonging to the 5-methylcytosine (m5C) writer family that modifies rRNA and mRNA. Our data revealed an upregulation of Nsun5 at the two-cell stage of mouse preimplantation development, suggesting its significance in early embryonic development. Given m5C's important role in stabilizing rRNA and mRNA and the Hippo signaling pathway's critical function in lineage segregation during embryogenesis, we hypothesized that NSUN5 controls cell differentiation by regulating the expression of components of the Hippo signaling pathway in mouse early embryos. To examine this hypothesis, we employed Nsun5-specific small interfering RNAs for targeted gene silencing in mouse preimplantation embryos. Nsun5 knockdown resulted in significant developmental impairments including reduced blastocyst formation, smaller size of blastocysts, and impaired hatching from the zona pellucida. Nsun5 knockdown also led to decreased cell numbers and increased apoptosis in embryos. We also observed diminished nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in Nsun5 knockdown embryos at the morula stage, indicating disrupted cell differentiation. This disruption was further evidenced by an altered ratio of CDX2-positive to OCT4-positive cells. Furthermore, Nsun5 depletion was found to upregulate the Hippo signaling-related key genes, Lats1 and Lats2 at the morula stage. Our findings underscore the essential role of Nsun5 in early embryonic development by affecting cell proliferation, YAP1 nuclear translocation, and the Hippo pathway.

AB  - Excitatory and inhibitory synapses are the two major fundamental units of neuronal communication in the brain. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses (E/I imbalance) is a leading mechanism underlying mental illness. Heparan sulfate (HS), a complex polysaccharide frequently implicated in mental disorders, is an emergent player in synaptic function. Yet, it remains unclear whether and how HS plays a preferential role in excitatory versus inhibitory synapses. This question is further complicated by the structural complexity of HS and the combined effects of both HS glycans and their attached proteoglycans. To address this challenge, we developed a platform that combines synthetic chemistry and synaptic biology to dissect the role of pure HS glycans in synapse development. As proof of principle, we assessed the effects of a synthetic dodecasaccharide (12-mer-19) and its non-sulfated counterpart (12-mer-NAc) on excitatory and inhibitory synapses in primary rat hippocampal neuron cultures. Unexpectedly, we found that 12-mer-19 selectively impaired the morphology and function of excitatory but not inhibitory synapses. Mechanistically, 12-mer-19 interferes with the interaction between neurexin1 and its partners at excitatory synapses, but has little effect on neurexin1's partner at inhibitory synapses. Moreover, 12-mer-NAc didn't have such effects, highlighting the importance of sulfated groups. Our results suggest that extracellular complex glycans may have a selective yet underappreciated role in excitatory synapses, perhaps contributing to the E/I imbalance. Moreover, current studies lay a foundation for future work to dissect the contribution of specific heparan sulfate structures to synaptic morphology and function.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Gallic acid (GA) has been demonstrated to have antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and health-promoting properties. In pigs, GA supplementation has been shown to decrease di-arrhea incidence of weaned piglets and improve their intestinal integrity. The present experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that growth performance and diarrhea after weaning could be improved by supplementing the diet with 400 mg/kg GA to weaned piglets, especially for low weaning weight piglets.<br>This study evaluated the effects of dietary gallic acid (GA) on growth performance, diarrhea incidence and plasma antioxidant status of weaned piglets regardless of whether weaning weight was high or low. A total of 120 weaned piglets were randomly allocated to four treatments in a 42-day experiment with a 2 x 2 factorial treatment arrangement comparing different weaning weights (high weight (HW) or low weight (LW), 8.49 & PLUSMN; 0.18 kg vs. 5.45 & PLUSMN; 0.13 kg) and dietary treatment (without supplementation (CT) or with supplementation of 400 mg/kg of GA). The results showed that HW piglets exhibited better growth performance and plasma antioxidant capacity. Piglets supplemented with GA had higher body weight (BW) on day 42 and average daily gain (ADG) from day 0 to 42 compared to the control piglets, which is mainly attributed to the specific improvement on BW and ADG of LW piglets by the supplementation of GA. The decreased values of diarrhea incidence were seen in piglets fed GA, more particularly in LW piglets. In addition, dietary GA numerically reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content in plasma of LW piglets. In conclusion, our study suggests that dietary GA may especially improve the growth and health in LW weaned piglets.

AB  - Higher engagement in moderate-intensity physical activity (PA) is related to better cognitive functioning in neurotypical adults; however, little is known about the effect of PA on cognitive aging in adults with Down syndrome (DS). Individuals with DS have three copies of chromosome 21, which includes the gene involved in the production of the amyloid precursor protein, resulting in an increased risk for an earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to understand the relationship between engagement in moderate PA, memory, and hippocampal volume in adults with DS. Adults with DS participated in an ancillary Lifestyle study linked to the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium for DS (ABC- DS; N = 71). A within-sample z-score memory composite was created from performance on the Cued Recall Test (CRT) and the Rivermead Picture Recognition Test. Participants wore a wrist-worn accelerometer (GT9X) to measure PA. Variables of interest included the average percentage of time spent in moderate PA and average daily steps. Structural MRI data were acquired within 18 months of actigraphy/cognitive data collection for a subset of participants (n = 54). Hippocampal volume was extracted using Freesurfer v5.3. Associations between moderate PA engagement, memory, and hippocampal volume were evaluated with hierarchical linear regressions controlling for relevant covariates [age, body mass index, intellectual disability level, sex, and intracranial volume]. Participants were 37.77 years old (SD = 8.21) and were 55.6% female. They spent 11.1% of their time engaged in moderate PA (SD = 7.5%) and took an average of 12,096.51 daily steps (SD = 4,315.66). After controlling for relevant covariates, higher memory composite score was associated with greater moderate PA engagement (beta = 0.232, p = 0.027) and more daily steps (beta = 0.209, p = 0.037). In a subset of participants, after controlling for relevant covariates, PA variables were not significantly associated with the hippocampal volume (all p-values >= 0.42). Greater hippocampal volume was associated with higher memory composite score after controlling for relevant covariates (beta = 0.316, p = 0.017). More PA engagement was related to better memory function in adults with DS. While greater hippocampal volume was related to better memory performance, it was not associated with PA. Greater PA engagement may be a promising lifestyle behavior to preserve memory in adults with DS.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare neurodevelopmental disease caused by mutations in the X-linked CDKL5 gene. CDD is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including early-onset refractory epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, hypotonia, visual disturbances, and autism-like features. The Cdkl5 knockout (KO) mouse recapitulates several features of CDD, including autistic-like behavior, impaired learning and memory, and motor stereotypies. These behavioral alterations are accompanied by diminished neuronal maturation and survival, reduced dendritic branching and spine maturation, and marked microglia activation. There is currently no cure or effective treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. Aerobic exercise is known to exert multiple beneficial effects in the brain, not only by increasing neurogenesis, but also by improving motor and cognitive tasks. To date, no studies have analyzed the effect of physical exercise on the phenotype of a CDD mouse model. In view of the positive effects of voluntary running on the brain of mouse models of various human neurodevelopmental disorders, we sought to determine whether voluntary daily running, sustained over a month, could improve brain development and behavioral defects in Cdkl5 KO mice. Our study showed that long-term voluntary running improved the hyperlocomotion and impulsivity behaviors and memory performance of Cdkl5 KO mice. This is correlated with increased hippocampal neurogenesis, neuronal survival, spine maturation, and inhibition of microglia activation. These behavioral and structural improvements were associated with increased BDNF levels. Given the positive effects of BDNF on brain development and function, the present findings support the positive benefits of exercise as an adjuvant therapy for CDD.

AB  - The effects of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) on the developing brain remain largely elusive. Here we investigated potential hippocampal injury and learning deficits following one or two episodes of NCSE in periadolescent rats. Non-convulsive status epilepticus was induced with subconvulsive doses of intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) under continuous EEG monitoring in postnatal day 43 (P43) rats. The RKA group (repeated KA) received intrahippocampal KA at P43 and P44, the SKA group (single KA injection) received KA at P43 and an intrahippocampal saline injection at P44. Controls were sham treated with saline. The modified two-way active avoidance (MAAV) test was conducted between P45 and P52 to assess learning of context-cued and tone-signaled electrical foot-shock avoidance. Histological analyses were performed at P52 to assess hippocampal neuronal densities, as well as potential reactive astrocytosis and synaptic dysfunction with GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and synaptophysin (Syp) staining, respectively. Kainic acid injections resulted in electroclinical seizures characterized by behavioral arrest, oromotor automatisms and salivation, without tonic-clonic activity. Compared to controls, both the SKA and RKA groups had lower rates of tone-signaled shock avoidance (p 0.05). In contextual testing, SKA rats were comparable to controls (p 0.05), which were comparable (p 0.05). We show that hippocampal NCSE in periadolescent rats results in a seizure burden dependent hippocampal injury accompanied by cognitive deficits. Our data suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE should be prompt. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxidative stress is involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous evidences showed that plasmalogens could improve neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the function of phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens enriched with EPA (EPA-pPE) and phosphatidylethanolamine enriched with EPA (EPA-PE) on oxidative damage prevention after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) challenge in primary hippocampal neurons. Results showed that neurons pretreated with EPA-pPE and EPA-PE demonstrated the ability to alleviate oxidative damage, which was proved by the increased cell viability. Moreover, the shape and number of neurons were more similar to those of the control group. Antioxidant activity, apoptosis, as well as TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway were investigated to explore the mechanisms. The results suggested that EPA-PE was superior to EPA-pPE in regulating mitochondrial apoptosis. EPA-pPE was more prominent than EPA-PE in upregulating TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway. Phospholipids with EPA exerted neuroprotective effects via inhibiting oxidative stress, suppressing apoptosis, and regulating TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway. Therefore, the results provide a scientific basis for utilization of phospholipids enriched with EPA on the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

Methods:<bold> </bold>IS model was established using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-modeled male rats and oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated mice hippocampal cells HT22, followed by the silencing of HIF-1 alpha and the overexpression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Following the surgery, Garcia's grading scale was applied for neurological evaluation. Cerebral infarcts and injuries were visualized using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and hematoxylin-eosin staining. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, malondialdehyde, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, were calculated via ELISA. MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit were adopted to determine the viability and cytotoxicity of OGD/R-modeled cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was evaluated using a 2'-7'dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. The levels of HIF-1 alpha, CXCR4, and NF-kappa B p65 were quantified via Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. Results:<bold> </bold>HIF-1 alpha knockdown improved Garcia's score, attenuated the cerebral infarct, inflammation, and ROS generation, and alleviated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and CXCR4/NF-kappa B p65 in MCAO-modeled rats. Such effects were reversed following the overexpression of CXCR4 and NF-kappa B. Also, in OGD/R-treated HT22 cells, HIF-1 alpha silencing diminished the cytotoxicity and ROS production and reduced the expressions of CXCR4/NF-kappa B p65, while promoting viability. However, CXCR4/NF-kappa B p65 overexpression did the opposite. Conclusion: HIF-1 alpha knockdown alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress in IS through the CXCR4/NF-kappa B pathway. se deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) mice hippocampal cells via the CXCR4/NF-kappa B pathway. image

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and severe clinical feature of sepsis; however, therapeutic approaches are limited because of the unclear pathogenesis. Adiponectin receptor agonist (AdipoRon) is a smallmolecule agonist of the adiponectin receptor that exhibits anti-inflammatory and memory-improving effects in various diseases. In the present study, we established lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice models of SAE and found that Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) was significantly decreased in the hippocampus. Administration of AdipoRon improves memory impairment, mitigates synaptic damage, and alleviates neuronal death. Furthermore, AdipoRon reduces the number of microglia. More importantly, AdipoRon promotes the phosphorylation of adenosine 5 '-monophosphate activated protein kinase (pAMPK). In conclusion, AdipoRon is protective against SAE-induced memory decline and brain injury in the SAE models via activating the hippocampal adenosine 5 '-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK).

AB  - Coral seeding is a restoration technique developed to replenish degraded reefs; however, grazing by herbivorous fish can impede coral survival post deployment. To investigate the impacts of hydrodynamics and fish grazing on seeded-coral survival, we deployed aquaria-reared Acropora digitifera spat on engineered-seeding devices across 10 sites spanning a wave-energy gradient at Moore Reef (Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Two devices were used to investigate the role of grazing: a fish-exclusion device and a featureless control. After 1 year, over 60% of devices had live corals. High-energy sites had 83-91% yield (i.e., device-level survival) and three times more survivors than low-energy sites. Exclusion devices significantly improved survival at moderate-to-low flow sites where excavating parrotfish were abundant. Survival was also influenced by the biological characteristics of the site, with more survivors at sites with Labrids (Thalassoma, Gomphosus), Acanthurids (Acanthurus, Zebrasoma), Blennids (Cirripectes), encrusting non-Acropora Scleractinian corals, coralline algae, and ascidians. Our study demonstrates that wave energy, fish activity, and benthic constituents all impact coral survival after seeding. Assessing potential sites for positive drivers of survival prior to deployment could improve the efficacy of coral seeding.

AB  - Herbivores that sequester toxins are thought to have cracked the code of plant defences. Nonetheless, coevolutionary theory predicts that plants should evolve toxic variants that also negatively impact specialists. We propose and test the selective sequestration hypothesis, that specialists preferentially sequester compounds that are less toxic to themselves while maintaining toxicity to enemies. Using chemically distinct plants, we show that monarch butterflies sequester only a subset of cardenolides from milkweed leaves that are less potent against their target enzyme (Na+/K+-ATPase) compared to several dominant cardenolides from leaves. However, sequestered compounds remain highly potent against sensitive Na+/K+-ATPases found in most predators. We confirmed this differential toxicity with mixtures of purified cardenolides from leaves and butterflies. The genetic basis of monarch adaptation to sequestered cardenolides was also confirmed with transgenic Drosophila that were CRISPR-edited with the monarch's Na+/K+-ATPase. Thus, the monarch's selective sequestration appears to reduce self-harm while maintaining protection from enemies.

AB  - The mechanism underlying the mediation of the behavior and fitness of non-vector herbivores by fungal pathogen-infected host plants is still unclear. In this study, we experimentally assessed the effects of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) plant infection status on non-vector herbivores using tomato powdery mildew disease fungus (Oidium lycopersici) and the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum as a model multitrophic plant-pathogen, non-vector herbivore interaction. In behavioral bioassays, powdery mildew-infected plants (PM) and plants damaged by combined attack of powdery mildew and whiteflies (PMWF) attracted significantly more whiteflies (32.6% and 58.1% for PM and PMWF, respectively) than control (Con) plants (16.5%) or plants damaged only by whiteflies (WF) (24.2%). Whiteflies feeding on PM or PMWF plants secreted almost twice as much honeydew as on the Con or WF plants. This indicated that whiteflies fed more on diseased plants than healthy plants. However, the preferences and increased feeding did not increase the fitness and immature growth of T. vaporariorum, but significantly prolonged their immature developmental durations, compared with those of whiteflies that developed on Con plants or WF plants. The results showed that powdery mildew infestation attracted more whiteflies but reduced their development and fitness.

AB  - IntroductionAlzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that alters learning and memory processes. Kalanchoe crenata (Crassulaceae) has long been used in Cameroonian traditional medicine to treat hypertension, malaria, and dementia. The present study aims to evaluate the anti-amnesic effect of an aqueous extract of K. crenata in D-galactose-treated rats and possible mechanisms of action.MethodsMemory impairment was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of D-galactose (350 mg/kg) once daily for 30 days. At the end of the procedure, the animals were assessed for memory impairment using Morris water maze and object recognition tasks. Animals with memory impairment were divided into six groups of eight rats each and treated once daily for 24 days as follows: the negative control group received per os distilled water (10 mL/kg); the positive control group received donepezil (2 mg/kg, p.o.); and three test groups received the extract of K. crenata (62, 124, and 248 mg/kg, p.o.). A group of eight rats was added and served as a control group. After completion of the procedure, the memory deficit in rats was reassessed by the object recognition test on Day 15 of the treatment, the Morris water maze test on Day 18, and the open-field test on Day 24. At the end of behavioral experiments, the animals were sacrificed and some biochemical parameters in the hippocampus were estimated. In addition, histological analysis of the hippocampus was performed.ResultsK. crenata significantly decreased the time to reach the platform and increased the time spent in the target quadrant of the Morris water maze. It also increased the discrimination index during the object recognition test. The extract significantly reversed D-galactose-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. This was confirmed by the attenuation of neuronal loss.ConclusionThese findings suggest that K. crenata extract possesses an anti-amnesic-like effect probably mediated by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

AB  - Spermatozoa go through diverse changes to achieve their fertilizing potential (capacitation) and develop a specific motility pattern (hyperactivation). However, to ensure a greater reproductive success, not all the spermatozoa present in an ejaculate react equally or at the same time. Therefore, a comparative analysis was performed in the present study to improve our current understanding about how cryopreservation may affect the heterogeneous nature of fresh ejaculates during these two events. Among the four motile sperm subpopulations identified in fresh and frozen-thawed ram semen, one of them developed a hyperactivated-like movement and was the main group involve in those changes associated with sperm capacitation based on the marked increase and the positive correlation with mitochondrial activity and tyrosine phosphorylation, two relevant parameters that usually increase during capacitation. In addition, cryopreservation altered the distribution of the motile sperm subpopulations. Although the subpopulation with hyperactivated-like movement increased at the beginning of incubation in frozen-thawed samples, this subpopulation together with the subpopulation of rapid and progressive spermatozoa were replaced after a prolonged incubation by the subpopulation of slow spermatozoa with the lowest mitochondrial activity, which clearly indicate the reduction in sperm quality. These findings will aid to optimize the current cryopreservation and in vitro fertilization protocols.
   The heterogeneous nature of ejaculates highlights the relevance of studying the behavior of different sperm subpopulations. Changes in sperm motility and the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation are key events that usually occur during capacitation and can be modified by the cryopreservation process. However, the relationship between both events remains poorly defined throughout capacitation in the different sperm subpopulations. Fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa were incubated in capacitating (CAP) and non-capacitating (NC) media up to 240 min. Sperm kinematics, tyrosine phosphorylation and mitochondrial activity were measured by the CASA system and imaging flow cytometry. Four motile sperm subpopulations (SP) were identified in fresh and frozen-thawed ram semen after the cluster analysis. Incubation under CAP conditions over time led to greater changes in the percentage of spermatozoa included in each subpopulation compared to NC conditions, being different between fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa. The SP1, characterized by slow spermatozoa, progressively increased after 15 min in frozen-thawed samples incubated in both media but not in fresh ones. The SP4, characterized by fast and non-linear spermatozoa, showed a marked increase during CAP, but not under NC conditions, occurring more rapidly in frozen-thawed spermatozoa. This subpopulation (SP4) was also the only one positively and strongly correlated with mitochondrial activity and all phosphorylated sperm regions during capacitation, either in fresh or frozen-thawed samples. Our results indicated that in vitro capacitation induced significant changes in the distribution of motile sperm subpopulations, being affected by cryopreservation. Notwithstanding, the subpopulation which probably represents hyperactivated-like spermatozoa (SP4) also increased in frozen-thawed samples, occurring faster and simultaneously to the increment of mitochondrial activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of different sperm regions.

AB  - As an emulsifier and bioactive substance, bile acids (BAs) participate in the absorption of nutrients and in various physiological processes. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of non-12 alpha-hydroxylated BAs (including hyocholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, from now on referred to as NBAs) on growth performance, BAs metabolism and the intestinal flora of piglets. The experiment included four groups, with eight piglets per group. The four groups of pigs were fed 0, 60, 120 and 180 mg/kg of NBAs, respectively. The results show that adding NBAs significantly increased the final weight (FW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), and digestibility of crude fat (EE) and organic matter (OM) in piglets (p < 0.05). Adding NBAs significantly increased the villus height (VH) of the jejunum and ileum (p < 0.05). In addition, NBAs supplementation increased the content of urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CREA) as well as the ratio of urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/CREA) in serum (p < 0.05). Adding NBAs can affect the genes related to BAs enterohepatic circulation. Specifically, adding NBAs significantly decreased the relative mRNA abundance of FXR in the liver (p < 0.05), significantly increased the relative mRNA abundance of CYP27A1 (p < 0.05), and significantly increased the relative mRNA abundance of NTCP (p < 0.05). Adding NBAs also significantly decreased the relative mRNA abundance of FXR in the ileum (p < 0.05). In the full-length 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, ten biomarkers were found from the gate to the species level. NBAs mainly enriched Lactobacillus_Johnsonii and decreased the abundance of Streptococcus_alactolyticus. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content in the colon was significantly increased (p < 0.05). These results indicate that NBAs supplementation can improve the growth performance of piglets, promote the development of the bile acid replacement pathway and improve intestinal flora.

AB  - Theanine, a unique and the most abundant non-proteinogenic amino acid in tea plants, endows tea infusion with the umami taste and anti-stress effects. Its content in tea correlates highly with green tea quality. Theanine content in new shoots of tea plants is high in mid-spring and greatly decreases in late spring. However, how the decrease is regulated is largely unknown. In a genetic screening, we observed that a yeast mutant, glutamate dehydrolase 2 (gdh2), was hypersensitive to 40 mM theanine and accumulated more theanine. This result implied a role of CsGDH2s in theanine accumulation in tea plants. Therefore, we identified the two homologs of GDH2, CsGDH2.1 and CsGDH2.2, in tea plants. Yeast complementation assay showed that the expression of CsGDH2.1 in yeast gdh2 mutant rescued the theanine hypersensitivity and hyperaccumulation of this mutant. Subcellular localization and tissue-specific expression showed CsGDH2.1 localized in the mitochondria and highly expressed in young tissues. Importantly, CsGDH2.1 expression was low in early spring, and increased significantly in late spring, in the new shoots of tea plants. These results all support the idea that CsGDH2.1 regulates theanine accumulation in the new shoots. Moreover, the in vitro enzyme assay showed that CsGDH2.1 had glutamate catabolic activity, and knockdown of CsGDH2.1 expression increased glutamate and theanine accumulation in the new shoots of tea plants. These findings suggested that CsGDH2.1-mediated glutamate catabolism negatively regulates theanine accumulation in the new shoots in late spring, and provides a functional gene for improving late-spring green tea quality.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sodium salicylate (SS) on the preservation and metabolic regulation of sheep sperm. Under 4 degrees C low-temperature conditions, SS (at 10 mu M, 20 mu M, 30 mu M, and 50 mu M) was added to the semen diluent to detect sperm motility, plasma membrane, and acrosome integrity. Based on the selected optimal concentration of SS (20 mu M), the effects of 20 mu M of SS on sperms' antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated, and metabolomics analysis was conducted. The results showed that on the 20th day of low-temperature storage, the sperm motility of the 20 mu M SS group was 62.80%, and the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.01). The content of Ca2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.01), and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05); mitochondrial activity and the total cholesterol (TC) content were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.01). An ultrastructural examination showed that in the SS group, the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome were intact, the fibrous sheath and axoneme morphology of the outer dense fibers were normal, and the mitochondria were arranged neatly. In the control group, there was significant swelling of the sperm plasma membrane, rupture of the acrosome, and vacuolization of mitochondria. Using metabolomics analysis, 20 of the most significant differential metabolic markers were screened, mainly involving 6 metabolic pathways, with the amino acid biosynthesis pathway being the most abundant. In summary, 20 mu M of SS significantly improved the preservation quality of sheep sperm under low-temperature conditions of 4 degrees C.

AB  - Emerging evidence highlights the regulatory role of paired -like (PRD-like) homeobox transcription factors (TFs) in embryonic genome activation (EGA). However, the majority of PRD-like genes are lost in rodents, thus prompting an investigation into PRD-like TFs in other mammals. Here, we showed that PRD-like TFs were transiently expressed during EGA in human, monkey, and porcine fertilized embryos, yet they exhibited inadequate expression in their cloned embryos. This study, using pig as the research model, identified LEUTX as a key PRD-like activator of porcine EGA through genomic profiling and found that LEUTX overexpression restored EGA failure and improved preimplantation development and cloning efficiency in porcine cloned embryos. Mechanistically, LEUTX opened EGA -related genomic regions and established histone acetylation via recruiting acetyltransferases p300 and KAT2A. These findings reveal the regulatory mechanism of LEUTX to govern EGA in pigs, which may provide valuable insights into the study of early embryo development for other non -rodent mammals.

AB  - Background The digital transformation in medical education is reshaping how clinical skills, such as point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), are taught. In nephrology fellowship programs, POCUS is essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, guiding procedures, and optimizing patient management. To address these evolving demands, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven POCUS curriculum using a multiagent approach that integrates human expertise with advanced AI models, thereby elevating educational standards and better preparing fellows for contemporary clinical practice. Methods In April 2024, the Mayo Clinic Minnesota Nephrology Fellowship Program initiated a novel AI-assisted process to design a comprehensive POCUS curriculum. This process integrated multiple advanced AI models-including GPT-4.0, Claude 3.0 Opus, Gemini Advanced, and Meta AI with Llama 3-to generate initial drafts and iteratively refine content. A panel of blinded nephrology POCUS experts subsequently reviewed and modified the AI-generated material to ensure both clinical relevance and educational rigor. Results The curriculum underwent 12 iterative revisions, incorporating feedback from 29 communications across AI models. Key features of the final curriculum included expanded core topics, diversified teaching methods, enhanced assessment tools, and integration into inpatient and outpatient nephrology rotations. The curriculum emphasized quality assurance, POCUS limitations, and essential clinical applications, such as fistula/graft evaluation and software integration. Alignment with certification standards further strengthened its utility. AI models contributed significantly to the curriculum's foundational structure, while human experts provided critical clinical insights. Conclusion This curriculum, enhanced through a multiagent approach that combines AI and human collaboration, exemplifies the transformative potential of digital tools in nephrology education. The innovative framework seamlessly integrates advanced AI models with expert clinical insights, providing a scalable model for medical curriculum development that is responsive to evolving educational demands. The synergy between technological innovation and human expertise holds promising implications for advancing fellowship training. Future studies should evaluate its impact on clinical competencies and patient outcomes across diverse practice environments.

AB  - Biological structural designs in nature, like hoof walls, horns, and antlers, can be used as inspiration for generating structures with excellent mechanical properties. A common theme in these designs is the small percent porosity in the structure, ranging from 1 to 5%. In this work, the sheep horn was used as an inspiration due to its higher toughness when loaded in the radial direction compared to the longitudinal direction. Under dynamic transverse compression, we investigated the structure-property relations in low porosity structures characterized by their two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections. A diverse design space was created by combining polygonal tubules with different numbers of sides placed on a grid with varying numbers of rows and columns. The volume fraction and the orientation angle of the tubules were also varied. The finite element (FE) method was used with a rate-dependent elastoplastic material model to generate the stress-strain curves under plane-strain conditions. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) model was trained to predict the structures' stress-strain response and energy absorption under different strain rates and applied strains. The parameter-based model uses eight discrete parameters to characterize the design space and as inputs to the model. The trained GRU model can efficiently predict the response of a new design in as little as 0.16 ms and allows rapid performance evaluation of 128,000 designs in the design space. The GRU predictions identified highperformance structures, and four design trends that affect the specific energy absorption were extracted and discussed. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Evaporative cooling has been demonstrated as one of the most effective means to reduce a building's energy consumption and achieve homeostasis in buildings without intensive energy demands. In this research, a novel biomimetic inorganic synthetic foam material (BMSF) was developed from reclaimed fly ash cenospheres for building surface cooling. The BMSF material is synthesized from an abundant industrial byproduct (i.e., fly ash cenosphere) through a low-cost and high-yield two-step process. X-ray microtopography (XRM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests revealed that BMSF has a microstructure that resembles that of the keratinous skin of African elephants and certain desert lizards to enable water to be stored and transported effectively through capillary actions. Experiments were carried out to quantify the evaporative behavior and cooling effect of the material and building roofs equipped with the BMSF panels. The experimental results indicate remarkable cooling performance - i.e., BMSF panels with protruded surfaces have higher evaporation rates than that of open water surface and a surface temperature reduction of 15 degrees C-25 degrees C was achieved. Lastly, case studies were carried out on a single-story commercial building in Los Angeles, California, and the results demonstrate that the new evaporative cooling surface material is able to achieve passive cooling for buildings in areas with a mild climate and low relative humidity.

AB  - Insect herbivory activates plant defense mechanisms and releases a blend of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). These volatile compounds may be involved in plant-plant communication and induce defense response in undamaged plants. In this work, we investigated whether the exposure of sweet pepper plants to HIPVs [(Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, hexyl butanoate, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate] activates the sweet pepper immune defense system. For this, healthy sweet pepper plants were individually exposed to the each of the above mentioned HIPVs over 48 h. The expression of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid related genes was quantified. Here, we show that all the tested volatiles induced plant defenses by upregulating the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathway. Additionally, the response of Frankliniella occidentalis, a key sweet pepper pest, and Orius laevigatus, the main natural enemy of F. occidentalis, to HIPV-exposed sweet pepper plants were studied in a Y-tube olfactometer. Only plants exposed to (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate and methyl salicylate repelled F. occidentalis whereas O. laevigatus showed a strong preference to plants exposed to (Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate. Our results show that HIPVs act as elicitors to sweet pepper plant defenses by enhancing defensive signaling pathways. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for integrating HIPVs-based approaches in sweet pepper pest management systems which may provide a sustainable strategy to manage insect pests in horticultural plants.

AB  - Glucosinolates are specialized defensive metabolites characteristic of the Brassicales order. Among them, aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates (IGs) are usually highly abundant in species from the Brassicaceae family. The exceptions this trend are species representing a subclade of the Camelineae tribe, including Capsella and Camelina genera, which have reduced capacity to produce and metabolize IGs. Our study addresses the contribution of specific glucosinolate-related myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factors to this unprecedented backward evolution of IG biosynthesis. To this end, we performed phylogenomic and functional studies of respective MYB proteins. The obtained results revealed weakened conservation of glucosinolate-related MYB transcription factors, including loss of functional MYB34 protein, in the investigated species. We showed that the introduction of functional MYB34 from Arabidopsis thaliana partially restores IG biosynthesis in Capsella rubella, indicating that the loss of this transcription factor contributes to the backward evolution of this metabolic pathway. Finally, we performed an analysis of the impact of particular myb mutations on the feedback loop in IG biosynthesis, which drives auxin overproduction, metabolic dysregulation and strong growth retardation caused by mutations in IG biosynthetic genes. This uncovered the unique function of MYB34 among IG-related MYBs in this feedback regulation and consequently in IG conservation in Brassicaceae plants.

AB  - Background Annona muricata L. (Annonaceae) (AM)'s remarkable anti-inflammatoryand anti-cancer activities make it a targeted plant to be explored for its immunomodulatory properties.Traditional practitioners have employed various components of AM to cure a variety of ailments,including cancer, diabetes, and inflammation. Objective The present study evaluated the immunosuppressive effects of 80% ethanol extract of ofAM leaves in male Wistar rats on different parameters of humoral and cellular immune responses.Methods: AM leaf extract (AMLE) was analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS to profile its secondarymetabolites. AMLE was rich in polyphenols which include (epi)catechin-(epi)catechin-(epi) catechin,caffeic acid, coumaroylquinic acid, hyperin, kaempferol, quinic acid and rutin. The rats wereadministered 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg bw of the extract daily for 14 days. The effects of AMLE oninnate immune responses were determined by evaluating phagocytosis, neutrophils migration, reactiveoxygen species (ROS) release, CD11b/CD18 integrin expression, and ceruloplasmin, lysozymeand myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. The adaptive immune parameters were evaluated by immunizingthe rats with sheep red blood cells (sRBC) on day 0 and administered orally with AMLE for 14days. Results AMLE established significant immunosuppressive effects on the innate immune parametersby inhibiting the neutrophil migration, ROS production, phagocytic activity and expression ofCD11b/CD18 integrin in a dose-dependent pattern. AMLE also suppressed ceruloplasmin, MPOand lysozyme expressions in the rat plasma dose-dependently. AMLE dose-dependently inhibited Tand B lymphocytes proliferation, Th1 and Th2 cytokine production, CD4+ and CD8+ co-expressionin splenocytes, immunoglobulins (IgM and IgG) expression and the sRBC-induced swelling rate ofrat paw in delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Conclusion The strong inhibitory effects on the different parameters of humoral and cellularresponses indicate that AMLE has potential to be an important source of effective immunosuppressiveagents.

AB  - Plants have evolved a diverse arsenal of defensive secondary metabolites in their evolutionary arms race with insect herbivores. In addition to the bottom-up forces created by plant chemicals, herbivores face top-down pressure from natural enemies, such as predators, parasitoids and parasites. This has led to the evolution of specialist herbivores that do not only tolerate plant secondary metabolites but even use them to fight natural enemies. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are known for their use of milkweed chemicals (cardenolides) as protection against vertebrate predators. Recent studies have shown that milkweeds with high cardenolide concentrations can also provide protection against a virulent protozoan parasite. However, whether cardenolides are directly responsible for these effects, and whether individual cardenolides or mixtures of these chemicals are needed to reduce infection, remains unknown. We fed monarch larvae the four most abundant cardenolides found in the anti-parasitic-milkweed Asclepias curassavica at varying concentrations and compositions to determine which provided the highest resistance to parasite infection. Measuring infection rates and infection intensities, we found that resistance is dependent on both concentration and composition of cardenolides, with mixtures of cardenolides performing significantly better than individual compounds, even when mixtures included lower concentrations of individual compounds. These results suggest that cardenolides function synergistically to provide resistance against parasite infection and help explain why only milkweed species that produce diverse cardenolide compounds provide measurable parasite resistance. More broadly, our results suggest that herbivores can benefit from consuming plants with diverse defensive chemical compounds through release from parasitism.

AB  - Genetic improvement of pork quality is one of the hot topics in pig germplasm innovation. Backfat thickness and intramuscular fat content are important indexes of meat quality. MiRNAs are becoming recognized as a crucial regulator of adipose development. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how miR-23b regulates fat metabolism at the molecular level. In the present study, Oil Red O staining, and Western blot were used to evaluate the effect of miR-23b on the differentiation of porcine preadipocytes. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, pulldown, and RIP were used to reveal the mechanism of miR-23b regulating cell differentiation. The findings demonstrated that miR-23b promotes the expression of adipogenic factors and increases the content of lipid droplets, thus promoting the differentiation of preadipocytes. Further research found that miR-23b can directly bind to the 3'UTR of SESN3 to regulate adipogenic differentiation. In addition, it was speculated that miR-23b controls cell differentiation by positively regulating the expression of ACSL4 in other ways. Here, we demonstrate that miR-23b promotes the differentiation of porcine preadipocytes by targeting SESN3 and promoting the expression of ACSL4. The present study is meaningful to the improvement of pork quality and the development of animal husbandry.

AB  - Polypeptide variation encoded by the ovine transmembrane protein 154 gene (TMEM154) is associated with susceptibility to ovine lentivirus, the causative agent of Ovine Progressive Pneumonia (OPP) and Visna/Maedi. Our aim was to compare the four most prevalent TMEM154 haplotypes on the incidence of infection and ewe productivity during natural multiyear virus exposure. Prospective cohort studies were designed to test gene action and estimate effects of TMEM154 haplotypes encoding distinctive variant residues: K35 ("1"), I70 ("2"), ancestral ("3"), and A4del/M44 ("4"). Exposure consisted of co-mingling infected ewes at a rate greater than 30% with serological status evaluated every four months. For ewes with one or two copies of the highly susceptible haplotypes "2" and "3", the infection prevalence steadily increased to nearly 100% at 55 months. Haplotypes "2" and "3" were equally susceptible and dominant to haplotype "1". A difference was not detected (p < 0.53) in the magnitude of effect with haplotype combinations of "1" and "4". The ewe infection prevalence with "1,1"; "1,4"; and "4,4" was 10% to 40% at 55 months. The latter suggested that two copies of the K35 amino acid substitution ("1") were as effective as a homozygous TMEM154 "knockout" with the frame-shift deletion mutation ("4") in reducing infection susceptibility. When considering ewe reproductive performance, a difference was not detected when comparing haplotypes "2", and "3" to each other, or "1" and "4" to each other. Our study indicated that ewes with two copies of the severely truncated versions of TMEM154 ("4,4") had normal lamb productivity. Without complete understanding of the natural function of TMEM154 our recommendations to producers interested in using TMEM154 selection to reduce their flock's genetic predisposition to OPP are encouraged to increase the frequency of TMEM154 haplotype K35 ("1") since it encodes a full-length protein with minimal difference to the ancestral polypeptide.

In order to shortenthe inflammatory period meanwhile promote the proliferative activityof fibroblasts, herein, we synthesized novel camelina-derived carbondots (CDs) decorating on hFGF2-linked camelina lipid droplets (CLD-hFGF2)to form nanobiomaterial CDs-CLD-hFGF2. The CDs-CLD-hFGF2 possessesperoxidase activity and has effective reactive oxygen species radicalscavenging activity while achieving proliferation of NIH/3T3 cellsunder oxidative stress in vitro. In the acute wound model, wound healingafter CDs-CLD-hFGF2 treatment reached nearly 92% on the 10th day,compared with 82% for CLD-hFGF2. Moreover, the wound site showed significantanti-inflammatory effects characterized by the downregulation of pro-inflammatoryfactors and the upregulation of anti-inflammatory factor levels. Overall,this study provided a strategy for the comprehensive utilization ofcamelina oil crops and revealed a promising future that could be consideredan effective method for wound healing on the skin.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the stress-related changes that may occur in sheep following non-surgical cervical line passage. A total of 20 sheep underwent transcervical transition, and their heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and blood samples were collected at specific time points: 1 h prior to the procedure, immediately after the procedure, and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h post-procedure. The study found that there was a statistically significant decrease in body temperature immediately after the procedure (p < .05); however, there were no significant differences in body temperature at other time points (p > .05). Respiratory rate remained similar throughout the study, and no significant differences were observed (p > .05). On the other hand, there was a significant increase in heart rate at the 1-h mark after the procedure (p < .05), which subsequently decreased to a similar level as the control group at the 4-h mark after the procedure (p > .05). The cortisol levels increased significantly after the application (p < .05) but decreased to a level similar to the control after 1 h (p > .05). The level of nitric oxide increased significantly in the first hour (p < .05) and decreased by the 5th hour (p < .05). There was a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and total oxidant capacity (TOC) levels 2 h after the application (p < .05), but this increase ceased at the 4th and 5th hours for MDA (p > .05) and at the 3rd, 4th and 5th hours for TOC (p > .05). The total antioxidant capacity decreased after the 2nd hour of application (p < .05) but remained similar at the fourth and 5th hours (p > .05). In conclusion, based on the cortisol data, transcervical manipulations create short-term stress. Therefore, it may be necessary to use various antioxidants before such procedures to reduce the effects of oxidative stress.

AB  - Among a wide diversity of sexually reproducing species, male ejaculates coagulate to form what has been termed a copulatory plug. A number of functions have been attributed to copulatory plugs, including the inhibition of female remating and the promotion of ejaculate movement. Here we demonstrate that copulatory plugs also influence the likelihood of implantation, which occurs roughly 4 days after copulation in mice. Using a bead transfer method to control for differences in ejaculate retention and fertilization rates, we show that implantation rates significantly drop among females mated to genetically engineered males incapable of forming plugs (because they lack functional transglutaminase 4, the main enzyme responsible for its formation). Surprisingly, this result does not correlate with differences in circulating progesterone levels among females, an important hormone involved in implantation. We discuss three models that connect malederived copulatory plugs to implantation success, including the hypothesis that plugs contribute to a threshold amount of stimulation required for females to become receptive to implantation.

AB  - The type of adventitious root formation of tea softwood cuttings is different from that of single node cuttings. In addition to the callus at the base of cuttings, the adventitious roots are also formed in the upper cortex of softwood cuttings. In order to find out the similarities and differences between the above two types of adventitious roots of softwood cuttings and the influencing factors for the differences, an integrated analysis of plant hormones, untargeted metabolomics, and transcriptomics of the softwood cutting stems at different positions is performed. The phytohormone results show that IAA plays a leading role, and a high ratio of in vivo auxin to GA3 or ABA facilitated root formation. The ratios of IAA/GA3 and IAA/ABA in the upper and base rooting parts of cuttings are both higher than the middle non-rooting transition zone. Differences in metabolites indicate that 73 metabolites are involved in the formation of adventitious roots in cuttings. Compared with the middle non-rooting transition zone, most saccharides are downregulated in the upper and base rooting parts of softwood cuttings, and the saccharides in the base rooting parts of cuttings are more consumed than that in the upper rooting parts. Most organic acids in the callus at the base of cuttings show an upward trend, while those in the upper rooting parts show a downward trend. Furthermore, coniferyl alcohol is the key metabolite for adventitious root formation in the upper and base rooting parts of cuttings. Transcriptome results show 1099 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are obtained, and KEGG enrichment analysis show that these DEGs are significantly enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), two key modules which have a highly positive correlation with IAA are identified. In summary, maintaining the balance of endogenous hormones and sufficient nutritional elements is very important for adventitious root formation in tea plants. Clarifying the material basis of softwood cutting rooting of tea plant is of great significance to improve the cutting survival rate of tea plant (especially difficult rooting varieties) and shorten the breeding cycle.

AB  - Chronic liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) create a state of chronic inflammation that affects the brain via the liver-brain axis leading to an alteration of neurotransmission and cognition. However, little is known about the effects of HCC on the hippocampus, the key brain region for learning and memory. Moreover, radiotherapy used to treat HCC has severe side effects that impair patients' life quality. Thus, designing optimal strategies, such as chronotherapy, to enhance the efficacy and reduce the side effects of HCC treatment is critically important. We addressed the effects of HCC and the timed administration of radiotherapy in mice on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, clock genes, markers for glial activation, oxidative stress, neuronal activity and proliferation in the hippocampal neurogenic niche. Our data showed that HCC induced the upregulation of genes encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines, altered clock gene expressions and reduced proliferation in the hippocampus. Radiotherapy, in particular when applied during the light/inactive phase enhanced all these effects in addition to glial activation, increased oxidative stress, decreased neuronal activity and increased levels of phospho(p)-ERK. Our results suggested an interaction of the circadian molecular clockwork and the brain's innate immune system as key players in liver-brain crosstalk in HCC and that radiotherapy when applied during the light/inactive phase induced the most profound alterations in the hippocampus.

AB  - Forecasting of saltwater intrusion in estuaries is challenging due to its nonlinear and nonstationary features. The efficiency of most existing regressive prediction models decreases exponentially with increasing lead steps. To meet the requirements of accuracy and long lead time, a real-time saltwater intrusion early warning framework based on timeseries clustering was proposed in this study. In the example analysis of the Pearl River Delta, four risk levels of saltwater intrusion were defined based on the salinity duration of a string of salinity gauges along the Modaomen channel. A comprehensive 24-h-forehead prognostic value of saltwater intrusion risk was obtained by clustering previous 48-h observations. Results indicated that the latest supervised clustering model, Cluster bAsed iMportancE Learning fOr Time-series (CAMELOT), achieved better predictive performance than traditional unsupervised clustering models and machine learning classifiers. Then, the temporal diversities of various environmental components, including antecedent chlorinity, upstream discharge, tidal level and wind vector, were investigated in each identified cluster. Notably, the variation of saltwater intrusion length was strongly associated with tidal cycles and upstream discharge. The maximum length of saltwater intrusion mainly occurred during the transition between neap and spring (spring and neap) tides, while the minimum length of saltwater intrusion occurred during spring tides. An average river discharge of 2100 m3/s at Makou station and 600 m3/s at Sanshui station contributed to the cluster with the highest propensity of the longest saltwater intrusion above Nanzhen station.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with myocardial infarction (MI) frequently experience a heightened incidence of depression, thereby increasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Consequently, early detection and intervention in depressive symptoms among patients with MI are imperative. Shexiang Baoxin Pills (SBP), a Chinese patent medicine employed for the treatment of MI, exhibits diverse mechanisms targeting this condition. Nevertheless, its therapeutic efficacy on postmyocardial infarction depressive symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and mechanism of SBP in managing depression during acute myocardial infarction (AMI).MethodsA rat model combining MI and depression was established, and the rats were randomly divided into four groups: the model (MOD) group, SBP group, Fluoxetine (FLX) group, and Sham group. After 28 days of drug intervention, cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography while behavior was evaluated through sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST), and open-field test (OFT). Additionally, levels of inflammatory factors in serum and hippocampus were measured along with NLRP3 inflammasome-related protein expression via Western blotting and immunofluorescence.ResultsSBP can enhance cardiac function in rats with AMI and depression, while significantly ameliorating depressive-like behavior. Compared to the Sham group, levels of IL-1 beta, IL-18, TNF-alpha, and other inflammatory factors were markedly elevated in the MOD group. However, expressions of these inflammatory factors were reduced to varying degrees following treatment with SBP or FLX. Analysis of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins in the hippocampus revealed a significant upregulation of IL-1 beta, IL-18, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and GSDMD in the MOD group; conversely, these measures were significantly attenuated after SBP intervention.ConclusionWe have observed a significant amelioration in depression-like behavior upon SBP administration during the treatment of AMI, suggesting that this effect may be attributed to the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis. (The main findings are summarized in the graphical abstract in the supplementary file.)

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to provide an improved in vitro model of porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) based on reduced-serum culture. The partial or complete absence of serum in media is suitable for experimental studies focused on molecules that are naturally present in serum or in cultures used for subsequent protein purification. Moreover, the benefit of serum-free or reduced-serum supplements follows the current trend of reducing FBS use in biological research. In order to confirm that a reduced-serum MDM culture is suitable for in vitro functional studies of porcine macrophages, we assessed their morphology, yield after differentiation, surface marker expression, respiratory burst, and phagocytic activity, as well as the induction of cytokine gene expression. The aim of this study was to establish a cell culture system for the generation of porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) under reduced-serum conditions. Cultures based on either the Nu-Serum (TM) Growth Medium Supplement (NUS) or a conventional fetal bovine serum (FBS) were compared, which included the assessment of FBS from two different providers (FBS1 and FBS2). The data obtained confirmed the significant impact of culture conditions on in vitro-generated MDMs. The MDMs cultured under reduced-serum conditions showed increased levels of IL-1 beta and CD86 mRNA and a proinflammatory cytokine profile, characterized by the increased mRNA expression of IL-23p19, CXCL10, and CCL5. Phagocytic and respiratory burst activities were not adversely affected. Surprisingly, the difference between the two FBSs was much more pronounced than the effect of the reduced-serum supplement. The FBS1 culture conditions gave rise to macrophages with higher surface levels of CD14, CD16, and CD163, a lower CD80 mRNA expression, and an increased induction of IL-10 gene expression. In contrast, none of these trends were observed in macrophage cultures supplemented with FBS2. Instead, the FBS2 culture showed increased levels of IL-1b and CD86 mRNA. In conclusion, reduced-serum culture is a useful tool for in vitro porcine MDM generation, in line with the current research trend of reducing FBS use in biological research.

AB  - The cornea is the transparent tissue in front of the eye that bends light to help the eye focus. More than five million people's vision can be restored by a corneal transplant (keratoplasty), but there is a scarcity of suitable donor tissue. Cryopreservation could potentially increase the on-demand availability of corneas by reducing expiration and contamination during hypothermic storage, and allow equitable distribution. Understanding the transport of water and cryoprotectants across the tissue is important in developing effective cryopreservation protocols. Here, we first measured the shrinking and swelling kinetics at 22 degrees C and 0 degrees C of porcine corneoscleral discs when exposed to phosphate-buffered saline and to a cryoprotectant vehicle solution containing 2.5% chondroitin sulfate and 1% dextran. Other valuable measurements were made including the density and osmolality of the vehicle solution at 0 degrees C, and the water fraction of porcine cornea and sclera. Using the knowledge gained from this first part to minimize background swelling, we then examined permeation kinetics of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in porcine corneoscleral discs at 0 degrees C, the temperature at which cryoprotectant loading typically occurs. The concentration data obtained as a function of time were fitted to a Fick's law model of one-dimensional diffusion to measure an effective diffusion coefficient of Me2SO, which was found to be 5.306x10-11 m2/s. We further quantified permeation kinetics of Me2SO in sclera alone at 0 degrees C to support our hypothesis that our measurements for corneoscleral discs will not be affected by the presence of the sclera. The obtained effective diffusion coefficient can be used in modelling aimed at developing cryopreservation protocols that minimize the exposure time of the corneas during the cryoprotectant loading step.

AB  - The prion protein (PrPC) is subjected to several conserved endoproteolytic events producing bioactive fragments that are of increasing interest for their physiological functions and their implication in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, systematic and compre-hensive investigations on the full spectrum of PrPC proteo-forms have been hampered by the lack of methods able to identify all PrPC-derived proteoforms. Building on previous knowledge of PrPC endoproteolytic processing, we thus developed an optimized Western blot assay able to obtain the maximum information about PrPC constitutive processing and the relative abundance of PrPC proteoforms in a complex biological sample. This approach led to the concurrent iden-tification of the whole spectrum of known endoproteolytic-derived PrPC proteoforms in brain homogenates, including C-terminal, N-terminal and, most importantly, shed PrPC- derived fragments. Endoproteolytic processing of PrPC was remarkably similar in the brain of widely used wild type and transgenic rodent models, with alpha-cleavage-derived C1 repre-senting the most abundant proteoform and ADAM10-medi-ated shedding being an unexpectedly prominent proteolytic event. Interestingly, the relative amount of shed PrPC was higher in WT mice than in most other models. Our results indicate that constitutive endoproteolytic processing of PrPC is not affected by PrPC overexpression or host factors other than PrPC but can be impacted by PrPC primary structure. Finally, this method represents a crucial step in gaining insight into pathophysiological roles, biomarker suitability, and therapeutic potential of shed PrPC and for a comprehensive appraisal of PrPC proteoforms in therapies, drug screening, or in the pro-gression of neurodegenerative diseases.

Consequently, insects with a narrower diet breadth are expected to be more accurate decision-makers, as they cope with a smaller set of relevant stimuli. However, in groups in which larvae and adults have distinct ecological specializations (e.g. Lepidoptera) it remains to be explored whether these constraints on adult female decision-making also occur at the larval stage. Here, we conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to assess the decision-making accuracy of lepidopteran larvae exposed to host-plant olfactory and visual cues. Our meta-analysis showed that caterpillars, irrespective of diet breadth, were consistently accurate in discriminating among their host plants through olfaction. Moreover, our review identified different scenarios in which larval vision plays an important role in host-plant selection, sometimes even as a priority over olfactory information. Our results highlight how caterpillars integrate different sensory modalities to accurately locate their host plants, and indicate that ecological constraints in host-plant selection may vary across insect life stages.

AB  - Ruminant gamma delta T cells were discovered in the mid-1980's shortly after a novel T cell receptor (TCR) gene from murine cells was described in 1984 and the murine TCR. gene locus in 1985. It was possible to identify gamma delta T cell populations early in ruminants because they represent a large proportion of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This null cell population, gamma delta T cells, was designated as such by its non-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against ovine and bovine CD4, CD8 and surface immunoglobulin (Ig). gamma delta T cells are non-conventional T cells known as innate-like cells capable of using both TCR as well as other types of receptor systems including pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and natural killer receptors (NKR). Bovine gamma delta T cells have been shown to respond to stimulation through toll-like receptors, NOD, and NKG2D as well as to cytokines alone, protein and non-protein antigens through their TCR, and to pathogen-infected host cells. The two main populations of gamma delta T cells are distinguished by the presence or absence of the hybrid co-receptor/PRR known as WC1 or T19. These two populations not only differ by their proportional representation in various tissues and organs but also by their migration into inflamed tissues. The WC1(+) cells are found in the blood, skin and spleen while the WC1 gamma delta T cells predominate in the gut, mammary gland and uterus. In ruminants, gamma delta T cells may produce IFN gamma, IL-17, IL-10 and TGF beta, have cytotoxic activity and memory responses. The expression of particular WC1 family members controls the response to particular pathogens and correlates with differences in cytokine responses. The comparison of the WC1 gene families in cattle, sheep and goats is discussed relative to other multigenic arrays that differentiate gamma delta T cells by function in humans and mice.

AB  - Introduction Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication of liver diseases characterized by neuroinflammation. The efficacies of nonabsorbable rifaximin (RIF) and lactulose (LAC) have been well documented in the treatment of HE. [F-18]PBR146 is a translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracer used for in vivo neuroinflammation imaging. This study investigated anti-neuroinflammation effect of RIF or/and LAC in chronic HE rats by [F-18]PBR146 micro-PET/CT. Methods Bile duct ligation (BDL) operation induced chronic HE models, and this study included Sham+normal saline (NS), BDL+NS, BDL+RIF, BDL+LAC, and BDL+RIF+LAC groups. Behavioral assessment was performed to analyze the motor function, and fecal samples were collected after successfully established the chronic HE model (more than 28 days post-surgery). In addition, fecal samples collection and micro-PET/CT scans were performed sequentially. And we also collected the blood plasma, liver, intestinal, and brain samples after sacrificing the rats for further biochemical and pathological analyses. Results The RIF- and/or LAC-treated BDL rats showed similar behavioral results with Sham+NS group, while the treatment could not reverse the biliary obstruction resulting in sustained liver injury. The RIF or/and LAC treatments can inhibit IFN-gamma and IL-10 productions. The global brain uptake values of [F-18]PBR146 in BDL+NS group was significantly higher than other groups (p < .0001). The brain regions analysis showed that the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex had radiotracer uptake differences among groups (all p < .05), which were consistent with the brain immunohistochemistry results. Sham+NS group was mainly enriched in Christensenella, Coprobacillus, and Pseudoflavonifractor. BDL+NS group was mainly enriched in Barnesiella, Alloprevotella, Enterococcus, and Enterorhabdus. BDL+RIF+LAC group was enriched in Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Parasutterella. Conclusions RIF or/and LAC had anti-neuroinflammation in BDL-induced chronic HE rats with gut microbiota alterations. The [F-18]PBR146 could be used for monitoring RIF or/and LAC treatment efficacy of chronic HE rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND Plant protection products (PPPs) are used extensively in agriculture to control crops. These PPPs, which may be found in different types of formulations, are composed of a designated pesticide (active principle) and other inactive ingredients as co-formulants. They perform specific functions in the formulation, as solvents, preservatives or antifreeze agents, among others. RESULTS A research technique based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to a Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass analyzer was successfully applied to characterize the composition of six different PPPs in terms of the presence of co-formulants and types of formulations: emulsifiable concentrate (EC), emulsion in water (EW), suspension concentrate and water-dispersible granule. These PPPs (FLINT MAX, MASSOCUR 12.5 EC, IMPACT EVO, TOPAS, LATINO and IMPALA STAR) had antifungal activity, containing one triazole compound as active principle (tebuconazole, penconazole, myclobutanil, flutriafol or fenbuconazole, respectively). Non-targeted approaches, applying suspect and unknown analysis, were carried out and ten compounds were identified as potential co-formulants. Six (glyceryl monostearate, 1-monopalmitin, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethyldecanamide, hexaethylene glycol and 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one) were confirmed by injecting analytical standards. Finally, these compounds were quantified in the PPPs. CONCLUSION The current study allowed for detecting co-formulants in a wide range of concentrations, between 0.04 (dimethyl sulfoxide) and 19.00 g L-1 (glyceryl monostearate), highlighting the feasibility of the proposed analytical methodology. Moreover, notable differences among the types of formulations of PPPs were achieved, revealing that EC and EW were the formulations that contained the largest number of co-formulants (four out of six detected compounds).

AB  - Skeletal muscle formation is an extremely important step in animal growth and development. Recent studies have found that TMEM8c (also known as Myomaker, MYMK), a muscle-specific transmembrane protein, can promote myoblast fusion and plays a key role in the normal development of skeletal muscle. However, the effect of Myomaker on porcine (Sus scrofa) myoblast fusion and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the role and corresponding regulatory mechanism of the Myomaker gene during skeletal muscle development, cell differentiation, and muscle injury repair in pigs. We obtained the entire 3 ' UTR sequence of porcine Myomaker using the 3 ' RACE approach and found that miR-205 inhibited porcine myoblast fusion by targeting the 3 ' UTR of Myomaker. In addition, based on a constructed porcine acute muscle injury model, we discovered that both the mRNA and protein expression of Myomaker were activated in the injured muscle, while miR-205 expression was significantly inhibited during skeletal muscle regeneration. The negative regulatory relationship between miR-205 and Myomaker was further confirmed in vivo. Taken together, the present study reveals that Myomaker plays a role during porcine myoblast fusion and skeletal muscle regeneration and demonstrates that miR-205 inhibits myoblast fusion through targeted regulation of the expression of Myomaker.

AB  - Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) contains alpha-tomatine, a steroidal glycoalkaloid that contributes to the plant defense against pathogens and herbivores through its bitter taste and toxicity. It accumulates at high levels in all the plant tissues, especially in leaves and immature green fruits, whereas it decreases during fruit ripening through metabolic conversion to the nontoxic esculeoside A, which accumulates in the mature red fruit. This study aimed to identify the gene encoding a C-27 hydroxylase that is a key enzyme in the metabolic conversion of alpha-tomatine to esculeoside A. The E8 gene, encoding a 2-oxoglutalate-dependent dioxygenase, is well known as an inducible gene in response to ethylene during fruit ripening. The recombinant E8 was found to catalyze the C-27 hydroxylation of lycoperoside C to produce prosapogenin A and is designated as Sl27DOX. The ripe fruit of E8/Sl27DOX-silenced transgenic tomato plants accumulated lycoperoside C and exhibited decreased esculeoside A levels compared with the wild-type (WT) plants. Furthermore, E8/Sl27DOX deletion in tomato accessions resulted in higher lycoperoside C levels in ripe fruits than in WT plants. Thus, E8/Sl27DOX functions as a C-27 hydroxylase of lycoperoside C in the metabolic detoxification of alpha-tomatine during tomato fruit ripening, and the efficient detoxification by E8/27DOX may provide an advantage in the domestication of cultivated tomatoes.

KW  - TICKBORNE ENCEPHALITIS
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the commonest arthropod-borne viral diseases in Middle-East Europe and North Asia. The main reservoir of the virus is comprised of small rodents and domestic mammals with the common tick (Ixodes) being the usual vector. The clinical spectrum of TBE ranges from mild meningitis to severe meningoencephalomyelitis. This disease can lead to severe sequelae and has a mortality up to 2% in Europe. Even though the majority of cases are transmitted through bites of infected ticks, infections through ingestion of contaminated milk and dairy products from farms in endemic areas have been reported. We report a family outbreak of a febrile disease, initially suggestive of human-to-human infection, during the early summertime in Austria. Tick-borne encephalitis was diagnosed following consumption of unpasteurised goat's milk and the virus was subsequently detected in frozen milk samples. Although this is a rare manifestation of TBE, this case series shows that TBE should be included in the differential diagnosis of an outbreak of febrile disease, and a careful clinical history with reference to unpasteurized dairy products is crucial in order to prevent further disease spread. The best preventive measure is active immunisation of people living in, or travelling to, endemic areas.

AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the effects of different dietary zinc sources on the diarrhea rate, intestinal morphology, immune indexes and intestinal microbial composition of weaned piglets. A total of 240 weaned piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire), at the age of 21 days, were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments for a four-week feeding trial to determine the effects of different amounts of tetrabasic zinc chloride (TBZC) supplementation on intestinal morphology, intestinal immune indices and intestinal microflora in weaned piglets, compared with the pharmacological dose of ZnO. The dietary treatments included a negative control (CON), (T1) ZnO (ZnO, 1500 mg/kg), (T2) tetrabasic zinc chloride (TBZC, 800 mg/kg), (T3) tetrabasic zinc chloride (TBZC, 1000 mg/kg), and (T4) tetrabasic zinc chloride (TBZC, 1200 mg/kg). Each treatment comprised six replicate pens, with eight pigs (four barrows and four gilts) per pen. Dietary TBZC of 1200 mg/kg improved the duodenum villus height, jejunum villus height and crypt depth of ileum, and increased the ratio of villus height to crypt depth of ileum (p < 0.05). The dietary supplementation of TBZC at a dosage of 1200 mg/kg has the potential to increase the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the duodenal mucosa. Furthermore, it shows a significant increase in the levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the ileum. Compared with CON, TBZC significantly (p < 0.05) decreased pH values of stomach contents. It also increased the number of Firmicutes in intestinal contents. Compared with CON, the abundance of Firmicutes in jejunum contents of other treatments was significantly improved (p < 0.05), while the abundance of Proteobacteria in ileum contents of high-zinc treatments (T2 and T5) was decreased (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary TBZC of 1200 mg/kg improved the digestibility of crude protein in weaned piglets, altered the intestinal morphology of piglets, changed the intestinal microflora of piglets, reduced the diarrhea rate, and significantly improved the development of the small intestine of weaned piglets, and its regulation mechanism on intestinal tract needs further study. In summary, TBZC is likely to be an effective substitute source for the pharmacological dose of ZnO to control diarrhea in weaned piglets.

AB  - Plants are not only used as energy and nutrient resources for herbivores. Plants can be ingested because of their activity against host parasites and other pathogens. This so-called medicinal role of plants is well reported in ethnopharmacology and under-reported in wild animals. More studies on wild animals are needed because any plant in the world contains bioactive compounds, and probably all plants, no matter how toxic they are, experience herbivory. For example, we tested the activity of extracts and essential oils from Papaver rhoeas and Echium plantagineum against a selection of laboratory pathogens because Great bustards Otis tarda preferred these plants during the mating season, with male fecal droppings showing a higher frequency of P. rhoeas particles than the fecal droppings of females. We hypothesized that P. rhoeas could be helpful for males in the mating season if any part of this plant harbors bioactivity against parasites and other pathogens. Males' immune system is weakened during the mating season because of their investment in secondary sexual characters and sexual display. As a first exploration of the bioactivity of these plants, we evaluated extracts of both plants against a sample of laboratory models, including a flagellated protozoon (Trichomonas gallinae), a nematode (Meloidogyne javanica) and a fungus (Aspergillus niger). Non-polar and polar extracts of the aerial parts of P. rhoeas, especially the extracts of flowers and capsules, and the extracts of leaves and flowers of E. plantagineum showed activity against nematodes and trichomonads. The bioactivity of plants against parasites could explain the foraging behavior of stressed animals. The chemical communication underpinning the capacity of fauna to recognize those plants is far less known.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been extensively studied, and their crucial roles in adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and gene expression have been revealed. However, the exact regulatory or other mechanisms by which lncRNAs influence the functioning of mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) remain largely unknown. In this paper, we report the identification of a new lncRNA, named G8110, from the MAT of Bama pigs. The coordinated expression levels of lncRNA G8110 and NFE2L1 were significantly decreased in the MAT of obese Bama pigs compared with those in the MAT of lean pigs. Using a bone mesenchymal stem cell adipogenic differentiation model, we found that lncRNA G8110 played a role in adipocyte differentiation by positively regulating NFE2L1. We also found that lncRNA G8110 inhibited the formation of intracellular lipid synthesis, promoted lipid metabolism, and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings regarding lipid synthesis may further promote the role of lncRNAs in driving adipose tissue remodeling and maintaining metabolic health.

AB  - Silica is crucial to terrestrial plant life and geochemical cycling on Earth. It is also implicated in the evolution of mammalian teeth, but there is debate over which type of siliceous particle has exerted the strongest selective pressure on tooth morphology. Debate revolves around the amorphous silica bodies (phytoliths) present in plants and the various forms of siliceous grit-that is, crystalline quartz (sand, soil, dust)-on plant surfaces. The problem is that conventional measures of silica often quantify both particle types simultaneously. Here we describe a protocol that relies on heavy-liquid flotation to separate and quantify siliceous particulate matter in the diets of herbivores. The method is reproducible and well suited to detecting species- or population-level differences in silica ingestion. In addition, we detected meaningful variation within the digestive tracts of cows, an outcome that supports the premise of ruminal fluid 'washing' of siliceous grit. We used bootstrap resampling to estimate the sample sizes needed to compare species, populations or individuals in space and time. We found that a minimum sample of 12 individuals is necessary if the species is a browser or as many as 55 if the species is a grazer, which are more variable. But a sample size of 20 is adequate for detecting statistical differences. We conclude by suggesting that our protocol for differentiating and quantifying silica holds promise for testing competing hypotheses on the evolution of dental traits.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a multifactorial infection of the nasal cavity and sinuses. In this study, nasal swabs from control donors (N = 128) and patients with CRS (N = 246) were analysed. Culture methods and metagenomics revealed no obvious differences in the composition of the bacterial communities between the two groups. However, at the functional level, several metabolic pathways were significantly enriched in the CRS group compared to the control group. Pathways such as carbohydrate transport metabolism, ATP synthesis, cofactors and vitamins, photosynthesis and transcription were highly enriched in CRS. In contrast, pathways related to lipid metabolism were more representative in the control microbiome. As S. aureus is one of the main species found in the nasal cavity, staphylococcal isolates from control and CRS samples were analysed by microarray and functional assays. Although no significant genetic differences were detected by microarray, S. aureus from CRS induced less cytotoxicity to lung cells and lower rates of glycolysis in host cells than control isolates. These results suggest the differential modulation of staphylococcal virulence by the environment created by other microorganisms and their interactions with host cells in control and CRS samples. These changes were reflected in the differential expression of cytokines and in the expression of Agr, the most important quorum-sensing regulator of virulence in S. aureus. In addition, the CRS isolates remained stable in their cytotoxicity, whereas the cytotoxic activity of S. aureus isolated from control subjects decreased over time during in vitro passage. These results suggest that host factors influence the virulence of S. aureus and promote its adaptation to the nasal environment during CRS.

AB  - Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious disease caused by the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). The live attenuated C-strain vaccine is highly efficacious, initiating protection within several days of delivery. The vaccine strain is detected in the tonsil early after inoculation, yet little is known of the role that tonsillar immune cells might play in initiating protection. Comparing the C-strain vaccine with the pathogenic CSFV Alfort-187 strain, changes in the myeloid cell compartment of the tonsil were observed. CSFV infection led to the emergence of an additional CD163(+)CD14(+) cell population, which showed the highest levels of Alfort-187 and C-strain infection. There was also an increase in both the frequency and activation status (as shown by increased MHC-II expression) of the tonsillar conventional dendritic cells 1 (cDC1) in pigs inoculated with the C-strain. Notably, the activation of cDC1 cells coincided in time with the induction of a local CSFV-specific IFN-gamma(+) CD8 T cell response in C-strain vaccinated pigs, but not in pigs that received Alfort-187. Moreover, the frequency of CSFV-specific IFN-gamma(+) CD8 T cells was inversely correlated to the viral load in the tonsils of individual animals. Accordingly, we hypothesise that the activation of cDC1 is key in initiating local CSFV-specific CD8 T cell responses which curtail early virus replication and dissemination.

AB  - Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) represent the main source of cholinergic innervation to the cortex and hippocampus and degenerate early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Phenotypic maintenance of BFCNs depends on levels of mature nerve growth factor (mNGF) and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF), produced by target neurons and retrogradely transported to the cell body. Whether a reciprocal interaction where BFCN inputs impact neurotrophin availability and affect cortical neuronal markers remains unknown. To address our hypothesis, we immunolesioned the nucleus basalis (nb), a basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei projecting mainly to the cortex, by bilateral stereotaxic injection of 192-IgG-Saporin (the cytotoxin Saporin binds p75ntr receptors expressed exclusively by BFCNs) in 2.5-month-old Wistar rats. At 6 months post-lesion, Saporin-injected rats (SAP) showed an impairment in a modified version of the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-choice task). Postmortem analyses of the brain revealed a reduction of Choline Acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons compared to wild-type controls. A diminished number of cortical vesicular acetylcholine transporter-immunoreactive boutons was accompanied by a reduction in BDNF mRNA, mBDNF protein levels, markers of glutamatergic (vGluT1), and GABAergic (GAD65) neurons in the SAP-group compared to the controls. NGF mRNA, NGF precursor, and mNGF protein levels were not affected. Additionally, cholinergic markers correlated with the attentional deficit and BDNF levels. Our findings demonstrate that while cholinergic nb loss impairs cognition and reduces cortical neuron markers, it produces differential effects on neurotrophin availability, affecting BDNF but not NGF levels.

AB  - Two Lotagnostus -dominated faunas from the Windfall Formation at Ninemile Canyon in the Antelope Range of Nevada, USA, are described: an older Lotagnostus nolani Fauna and younger L. rushtoni Fauna. The former is dominated by two morphs of Lotagnostus, one strongly scrobiculate and the other smooth to weakly scrobiculate. Both morphs fall within the broad concept advocated for L. americanus by Peng et al . (2015). The numerous (>1400 sclerites) specimens of Lotaganostus in collections of the L. nolani Fauna confirm that the two morphs do not intergrade and remain distinct throughout ontogeny. Both display multiple traits that distinguish them from the type material of L. americanus, justifying treatment as separate species. Similarly unique, diagnostic features were identified to restore the Asian species L. punctatus and L. asiaticus to full species status, whereas deficiencies in the type material for L. americanus warrant restriction of the name to the holotype. New species described from the Windfall include five agnostoids ( Lotagnostus nolani, L. clarki, L. morrisoni, L. rushtoni, and Neoagnostus parki ) and one trilobite ( Bienvillia eurekensis ). Plicatolina nyensis Taylor is reassigned to Mendoparabolina on the form of its pygidium. Conodonts from the Catlin Member of the Windfall Formation and overlying informal Caryocaris shale member of the Goodwin Formation at Ninemile Canyon provide a late Sunwaptan ( Eoconodontus Zone) age for the Lotagnostus rushtoni Fauna and assign the entire Caryocaris shale to the early Ordovician Rossodus manitouensis Zone. Combined with published data on trilobite faunas, the conodont faunas confirm strong diachroneity for the top of the Catlin, and a lack of overlap in age between the Caryocaris shale and Bullwhacker Member of the Windfall in ranges to the north and east. Co-occurrence of Lotagnostus nolani and Mendoparabolina nyensis establishes age equivalence of the L. nolani Fauna with the Hedinaspis-Charchaqia ( HC ) Fauna at the base of the Hales Limestone in the Hot Creek Range, and earlier correlations of the latter with the L. punctatus Zone in Asia are supported. However, isolation of the HC Fauna in starved-basin deposits above a major sequence boundary at the base of the Hales, and ecologic restriction of Lotagnostus to lower slope and basinal environments that prevented association with endemic shallow marine taxa, renders correlation into the biostratigraphy of Laurentian upper slope and platform imprecise on the order of 10s, if not 100s of meters.

AB  - Florivory directly affects floral structures, especially petals and anthers. The physical damage to these whorls can alter the characteristics of the flowers, compromise their functions, and consequently impact fertility and reduce the reproductive success of the species. We provide the floral anatomical description of Senna aversiflora (Herb.) H.S. Irwin and Barneby. We measured various anatomical traits of petals and quantified the levels of chemical compounds and the pollen produced by intact and damaged flowers in order to identify characters associated with the plant-florivore interaction. We found that the epidermis (adaxial and abaxial surfaces) and mesophyll of the petals of healthy flowers were thicker when compared to damaged flowers. We infer that the smaller thickness of traits associated with the absence of characters with deterrent effect on herbivores and greater production of attractive/nutritive chemical compounds in relation to defense compounds contribute to making the species highly susceptible to florivory. Pollen production in damaged flowers did not differ between the different stages of floral development. However, florivory has a negative effect on the amount of pollen produced. Damaged flowers had less pollen than healthy flowers. We conclude that florivory in S. aversiflora exerts significant pressure on petal anatomy and resource production by flowers.

AB  - This study aimed to use Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) as subjects to examine the effects of telencephalic lesions on spatial learning. Ten Japanese eels were trained on a Morris-type spatial learning task. Four pipes were placed in a pool; however, the eels could hide in only one of these pipes. The learning task ensured that the eels learned about the position of the open pipe. Subsequently, their telencephalons were damaged. The lesioned eels could not maintain their learning and demonstrated deficits in re-learning as some of them were unable to relearn the task. An analysis of the lesion sizes revealed that while damage to the dorsolateral pallium impaired maintained learning, damage to the dorsomedial pallium impaired re-learning.

AB  - Release from enemies can lead to rapid evolution in invasive plants, including reduced metabolic investment in defence. Conversely, reassociation with enemies leads to renewed evolution of defence, but the potential costs of this evolution are poorly documented. We report increased resistance of the invader Ambrosia artemisiifolia after reassociation with a coevolved specialist herbivore, and that this increase corresponds with reduced abiotic stress tolerance. Herbivore resistance was higher, but drought tolerance was lower in plants from populations with a longer reassociation history, and this corresponded with changes in phenylpropanoids involved in insect resistance and abiotic stress tolerance. These changes were corroborated by shifts in the expression of underlying biosynthetic genes and plant anti-oxidants. Together, our findings suggest rapid evolution of plant traits after reassociation with coevolved enemies, resulting in genetically based shifts in investment between abiotic and biotic stress responses, providing insights into co-evolution, plant invasion and biological control.

AB  - Background: Gastrodiae Rhizoma (GR) and its extract have been widely used in the treatment of depression, but the underlying mechanism of its antidepressant effects is unclear due to its numerous components. Purpose: Revealing the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of GR through a comprehensive pharmacology-based in vivo and in vitro investigation. Methods: A mouse model of depression was established using chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure, and the antidepressant effects of GR were evaluated using systematic behavior. Metabolites in GR decoction and in mouse brain were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS technology. Core components and targets of GR against MDD were screened based on network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking. The mechanism through which GR mitigated MDD was explored using transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry and western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Results: A total of 273 components were identified in the GR decoction, out of which 15 were detected in the brain of depressed mice treated with the GR decoction. We further identified nine key active ingredients, six essential targets, and fifth signaling pathways associated with the therapeutic effects of GR against MDD. We confirmed that the active ingredients of GR can target the neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs) in the hippo-campus of depressed mice to promote neurogenesis, as evidenced by a significant increase in the numbers of DCX+ cells, BrdU+ cells, BrdU+-DCX+ cells, and BrdU+-NeuN+ cells within the hippocampus of GR-treated mice compared to salinetreated mice under CMS exposure. Moreover, we have identified that the key active constituents of GR, namely gastrodin and parishin C, exert a targeted effect on EGFR to activate PI3K-Akt signaling in NSPCs, thereby facilitating proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs. Conclusion: The antidepressant effect of GR involves the facilitation of PI3K/Akt-mediated neurogenesis through gastrodin and parishin C targeting EGFR in NSPCs.

AB  - Viral pathogenesis and therapeutic screening studies that utilize small mammalian models rely on the accurate quantification and interpretation of morbidity measurements, such as weight and body temperature, which can vary depending on the model, agent and/or experimental design used. As a result, morbidity -related data are frequently normalized within and across screening studies to aid with their interpretation. However, such data normalization can be performed in a variety of ways, leading to differences in conclusions drawn and making comparisons between studies challenging. Here, we discuss variability in the normalization, interpretation, and presentation of morbidity measurements for four model species frequently used to study a diverse range of human viral pathogens - mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and ferrets. We also analyze findings aggregated from influenza A virus -infected ferrets to contextualize this discussion. We focus on serially collected weight and temperature data to illustrate how the conclusions drawn from this information can vary depending on how raw data are collected, normalized and measured. Taken together, this work supports continued efforts in understanding how normalization affects the interpretation of morbidity data and highlights best practices to improve the interpretation and utility of these findings for extrapolation to public health contexts.

AB  - Introduction: Animal nutritional strategies have been extensively studied in vertebrates, where generalism at the individual scale is the rule. In insect herbivores, the determinants of the nutritional strategy of individual-scale generalists remain poorly studied, and the focus has been placed mainly on the influence of plant defense. Moreover, the integration of a physiological dimension in such studies remains rare. Here, we investigated the determinants of the nutritional strategy of pre-diapausing pollen beetles, Brassicogethes aeneus, with a focus on the influence of macronutrients. Before their diapause, pollen beetles are known to feed from plants belonging to many different families. This raises three questions: (i) Is the generalism of pollen beetles a populational consequence of individuals specialized on different plant families? (ii) Do individuals feed at random on flowers available or do they have a particular nutritional strategy? and (iii) In case of nonrandom feeding choices, do pollen macronutrients explain this nutritional strategy?
   Methods: To answer these questions, we used a series of laboratory experiments including feeding choice tests on flowers and artificial substrates, quantification of pollen nutrient content, quantification of the insect energetic budget, and performance experiments.
   Results: We show that pollen beetles are generalist at the individual scale, and that clear and stable food preferences are established over a few hours in a multi-choice context. Pollen beetles prefer to feed on flowers with a carbohydrate-rich pollen, and this preference is adaptive since performance correlates positively with the plant carbohydrate content. This better performance may be explained by the fact that individuals feeding on carbohydrate-rich resources accumulate more glycogen and total energetic reserves.
   Discussion: This study represents one of the few evidences of generalism at the individual scale in an herbivorous insect. It provides a better understanding of the nutritional strategy of a non-bee pollen feeder and shows the importance of carbohydrates in this strategy. It highlights the need to combine assessments of the plant macronutrient content and insect energetic budget in an adaptive framework to better understand the nutritional strategies of herbivores.

AB  - One way to eliminate pain during surgical castration is to provide general anesthesia by intramuscular injection. However, its disadvantage is the long recovery phase, during which anesthetized piglets have to be separated from the sow and managed appropriately. In this study, rectal temperatures, respiration rate, soiling and behavior changes were monitored in 119 piglets for 4 h after the intramuscularly administration of a ketamineazaperone-mixture for general anesthesia and castration. The study aimed to identify the least distressing form of separation. For this, different types of separation containers, farm equipment and heat sources were used in 3 individual trials during separation of piglets. Over the course of the recovery period, body temperatures and behaviors of piglets underwent significant alterations. The temperature span was largest after 2 h in all trials (35.0-42.6 degrees C). Rectal temperatures were influenced by the kind of separation, heat provision, and age: Piglets separated in boxes were warmer than piglets separated in crate corners (P = 0.0016). Non-warmed piglets had lower temperatures than fully (P < 0.0001) warmed piglets. Additionally, rectal temperatures of 4-days old piglets were lower than those of 5-days old ones after 2 h (P < 0.0001). Piglets were more soiled after 4 h when they were not warmed compared to piglets in containers fully warmed (P < 0.0001). The kind of container also had an effect on soiling, as scores were higher after 2 h for piglets kept in buckets than those in perforated boxes (P = 0.0522). Warmed piglets breathed more frequently than non-warmed piglets (P = 0.0039). The behaviors pedaling and lying were more prominent in the first 2 h of the recovery period, while moving forward and head bumping occurred more often in the later half. The behavior slipping was only observed in buckets. It was concluded that the recovery phase is a stressful experience, especially for very young piglets. This means that piglets need to be taken care of appropriately to ensure that animal welfare is not reduced past a general anesthesia, which was originally applied to increase welfare during a painful intervention. Anesthetized piglets need to be warmed and possibly dried during the recovery phase to avoid life-threatening cooling.

AB  - Cholesterol levels have been repeatedly linked to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), suggesting that high levels could be detrimental, but this effect is likely attributed to Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. On the other hand, High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol levels have been associated with reduced brain amyloidosis and improved cognitive function. However, recent findings have suggested that HDL-functionality, which depends upon the HDL-cargo proteins associated with HDL, rather than HDL levels, appears to be the key factor, suggesting a quality over quantity status. In this report, we have assessed the HDL-cargo (Cholesterol, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoC-I, ApoC-III, ApoD, ApoE, ApoH, ApoJ, CRP, and SAA) in stable healthy control (HC), healthy controls who will convert to MCI/AD (HC-Conv) and AD patients (AD). Compared to HC we observed an increased cholesterol/ApoA-I ratio in AD and HC-Conv, as well as an increased ApoD/ApoA-I ratio and a decreased ApoA-II/ApoA-I ratio in AD. Higher cholesterol/ApoA-I ratio was also associated with lower cortical grey matter volume and higher ventricular volume, while higher ApoA-II/ApoA-I and ApoJ/ApoA-I ratios were associated with greater cortical grey matter volume (and for ApoA-II also with greater hippocampal volume) and smaller ventricular volume. Additionally, in a clinical status-independent manner, the ApoE/ApoA-I ratio was significantly lower in APOE epsilon 4 carriers and lowest in APOE epsilon 4 homozygous. Together, these data indicate that in AD patients the composition of HDL is altered, which may affect HDL functionality, and such changes are associated with altered regional brain volumetric data.

AB  - Automatic horse gait classification offers insights into training intensity, but direct sensor attachment to horses raises concerns about discomfort, behavioral disruption, and entanglement risks. To address this, our study leverages rider-centric accelerometers for movement classification. The position of a sensor, sampling frequency, and window size of segmented signal data have a major impact on classification accuracy in activity recognition. Yet, there are no studies that have evaluated the effect of all these factors simultaneously using accelerometer data from four distinct rider locations (the knee, backbone, chest, and arm) across five riders and seven horses performing three gaits. A total of eight models were compared, and an LSTM-convolutional network (ConvLSTM2D) achieved the highest accuracy, with an average accuracy of 89.72% considering four movements (halt, walk, trot, and canter). The model performed best with an interval width of four seconds and a sampling frequency of 25 Hz. Additionally, an F1-score of 86.18% was achieved and validated using LOSOCV (Leave One Subject Out Cross-Validation).

AB  - Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors (NOD-like receptors, NLRs) have critical effects on interfaces of the immune and reproductive systems, and the spleen plays a key role in both innate and adaptive immune functions. It is hypothesized that NLR family participates in maternal splenic immune regulation during early pregnancy in sheep. In this study, maternal spleens were collected on day 16 of the estrous cycle, and days 13, 16 and 25 of gestation (n = 6 for each group) in ewes. Expression of NLR family, including NOD1, NOD2, class II transactivator (CIITA), NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine rich repeat and Pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3 and NLRP7, was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. The results revealed that expression levels of NOD1, NOD2, CIITA and NLRP3 were downregulated at days 13 and 16 of pregnancy, but expression of NLRP3 was increased at day 25 of pregnancy. In addition, expression values of NAIP and NLRP7 mRNA and proteins were improved at days 16 and 25 of pregnancy, and NLRP1 was peaked at days 13 and 16 of pregnancy in the maternal spleen. Furthermore, NOD2 and NLRP7 proteins were limited to the capsule, trabeculae and splenic cords. In summary, early pregnancy changes expression of NLR family in the maternal spleen, which may be related with the maternal splenic immunomodulation during early pregnancy in sheep.

AB  - Aging affects virtually all organs of the body, but perhaps it has the most profound effects on the brain and its neurotransmitter systems, which influence a wide range of crucial functions, such as attention, focus, mood, neuroendocrine and autonomic functions, and sleep cycles. All of these essential functions, as well as fundamental cognitive processes such as memory, recall, and processing speed, utilize neuronal circuits that depend on neurotransmitter signaling between neurons. Glutamate (Glu), the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, is involved in most neuronal excitatory functions, including release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE). Previous studies from our lab demonstrated that the age-associated decline in Glu-stimulated NE release in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors, as well as deficits in dendritic spines, and cognitive functions are fully rescued by the CNS stimulant amphetamine. Here we further investigated Glu-stimulated NE release in the cerebral cortex to identify additional novel target sites for restoration of Glu-stimulated NE release. We found that blockade of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors fully restores Glu-stimulated NE release to the levels of young controls. In addition, we investigated the density and responsiveness of NMDA receptors as a potential underlying neuronal mechanism that could account for the observed age-associated decline in Glu-stimulated NE release. In the basal state of the receptor (no added glutamate and glycine) the density of NMDA receptors in the cortex from young and aged rats was similar. However, in contrast, in the presence of 10 mu M added glutamate, which opens the receptor channel and increases the number of available [3H]-MK-801 binding sites within the channel, the density of [3H]-MK-801 binding sites was significantly less in the cortex from aged rats.image

AB  - Wild meat hunting and trade across African savannas is widespread. We interviewed 299 people in rural settlements along the Kenya-Tanzania border to examine impacts of COVID-19 on wild meat consumption and perceptions about wild meat activities associated with zoonotic disease risks. Education level played a key part in understanding COVID-19 transmission. Information about the pandemic was mostly acquired from the media. Nearly all respondents recognized that COVID-19 originated in China. As many as 70% reported no impact of COVID-19 on wild meat consumption; some believed that there was an increase. Over half of the respondents believed that consumption of wild meat leads to food-borne illnesses. Respondents recognized disease risks such as anthrax and brucellosis and accepted that people slaughtering and handling wild meat with open cuts were at greater risk. Ungulates were the most consumed animals, followed by birds, rodents, and shrews. Respondents perceived that hyenas, monkeys, donkeys, and snakes were riskier to eat. More than 90% of the respondents understood that handwashing with soap reduces risks of disease transmission. Country level (11 answers), education and gender (three answers each) and household economy (158 answers) were significant. Country differences were linked to differences in nature legislation; 50% of Kenyan respondents believed that wild meat should not be sold because of conservation concerns. Men were more worried about getting COVID-19 from live animals and perceived that wildlife should not be sold because of conservation reasons. Overall, there was a very strong inclination to stop buying wild meat if other meats were less expensive. Our results allow us to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wild meat-related activities. Differences between countries can frame the attitudes to wild meat since wild meat trade and consumption were found to be country specific.

AB  - Chronic stress is a critical risk factor for developing depression, which can impair cognitive function. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in chronic stress-induced cognitive deficits remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric-related disorders. Thus, the study aims to examine whether CRMPs modulate chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment. We used the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm to mimic stressful life situations in C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we found that CUS-treated mice exhibited cognitive decline and increased hippocampal CRMP2 and CRMP5 expression. In contrast to CRMP2, CRMP5 levels strongly correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment. Decreasing hippocampal CRMP5 levels through shRNA injection rescued CUS-induced cognitive impairment, whereas increasing CRMP5 levels in control mice exacerbated memory decline after subthreshold stress treatment. Mechanistically, hippocampal CRMP5 suppression by regulating glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation alleviates chronic stress-induced synaptic atrophy, disruption of AMPA receptor trafficking, and cytokine storms. Our findings show that hippocampal CRMP5 accumulation through GR activation disrupts synaptic plasticity, impedes AMPAR trafficking, and triggers cytokine release, thus playing a critical role in chronic stress-induced cognitive deficits.

   The morphological characteristics of the soldier caste in termites provide valuable taxonomic information at the species level. Head-shape variation in soldiers was often used as an indicative characteristic in some genera. While species with egg-shaped and waterdrop-shaped head capsule (HC), Coptotermes gestroi and C. curvignathus, respectively, are familiar in Indonesia, neither a measurement nor head index may avoid the subjectivity of shape interpretation. We conducted linear and geometric morphometrics analyses of soldiers' HC of Coptotermes spp. obtained from various locations in Indonesia. Although subtle differences were observed, the posterior parts of the HC laterally expanded in a gradual manner in C. gestroi, C. sepangensis, and C. curvignathus in that order. Furthermore, three extreme head-shape variations of C. gestroi were found to exist in nature. Overall, we explicitly vocalized the complexity of utilizing HC morphometric measurement and shape for species determination in Coptotermes spp.
   Linear and geometric morphometrics approaches were conducted to analyze the head capsule (HC) shape of collected soldier caste specimens of Coptotermes from various locations in Indonesia. The soldiers' morphology was observed and measured. The results of the principal component analysis of the group of all species showed two important groups of variables, i.e., the body size and setae characteristics of the pronotum and head. The multicollinearity of the morphometric variables showed the importance of body measurements as well as important alternative characteristics such as the pronotum setae (PrS) and HC setae. Four trends of HC shape were observed across the species. Interestingly, three extreme shapes were depicted by geometric morphometrics of the C. gestroi HC. The phylogenetic tree inferred from 12S and 16S mitochondrial gene fragments showed high confidence for C. gestroi populations. The lateral expansion of the posterior part of the HC across the species was in accordance with the increasing of the number of hairlike setae on the pronotum and HC. These differences among species might be associated with mandible-force-related defensive labor and sensitivity to environmental stressors.

AB  - In Caras-Severin County, Romania, the integration of sustainable agricultural practices with organic dairy production represents a unique opportunity to promote agro-tourism farms and guesthouses. This study examines the synergy between the chemical composition of pastures from three farms in different alleys and the impact on the chemical composition of dairy products produced on those farms. Thus, the comparative analysis of two types of traditional cow's cheeses (soft and mature) from three different areas of Caras-Severin County was pursued, as well as of the feed given to the animals from which the raw material for obtaining the cheeses originated. Initially, the physicochemical profile of the pastures (fresh grass and grass hay) was analyzed in terms of proximate composition (moisture, lipids, proteins, ash and carbohydrates), and the content of bioactive compounds (total polyphenols, antioxidant activity using the DPPH method). The proximate composition of the cheese samples, including moisture, lipids, proteins, ash and carbohydrates was analysed, and the content of fatty acids. A correlation was also made between the content of bioactive compounds in feed samples and fatty acid profile of the cheese samples. Our findings demonstrate that the geographical area and the chemical composition of the pasture have a considerable influence on the physicochemical characterization and fatty acid composition of the cheese. The cheese from the mountain area had a higher fat, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acid content compared to the samples from the hill and plain areas.

AB  - Benzimidazoles are the most frequently prescribed therapeutic options for treating trichinellosis in clinical settings; however, they have a lot of disadvantages. Therefore, researchers are focusing on the hunt for substitute chemicals. The goal of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of albendazole and the anti-diabetic medication metformin loaded on chitosan nanoparticles in treating mice infected with various stages of T. spiralis infection. 160 mice were included in the present study and divided into 8 groups: 6 experimentally treated groups, and positive and negative control groups. For studying the intestinal and parenteral phase, each group was broken into two more subgroups (a and b) according to the time of drug administration. The effects of albendazole, albendazole-loaded NPs, metformin, metformin-loaded NPs, combined albendazole and metformin, and metformin and albendazole-loaded NPs were assessed using parasitological studies, histopathological examination, and ultrastructural examination using SEM.Statistically significant differences were detected in all studied subgroups compared to the control infected subgroup both in the intestinal and muscular phases. The greatest decrease in recovered adult worm and muscle larvae numbers was achieved by ABZ & MET/ Cs NPs. These findings were confirmed by histopathological examination. SEM examination of the tegument of T. spirals adult worms and muscle larvae showed destruction with multiple degenerative changes.Our results suggested that metformin and its combination with albendazole especially when loaded on chitosan nanoparticles could be potential therapeutic alternative drugs against trichinellosis.

AB  - Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is the causal agent of sclerotinia stem rot in over 400 plant species. In a previous study, the group III histidine kinase gene of S. sclerotiorum (Shk1) revealed its involvement in iprodione and fludioxonil sensitivity and osmotic stress. To further investigate the fungicide sensitivity associated with the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, we functionally characterized SsHog1, which is the downstream kinase of Shk1. To generate knockout mutants, split marker transformation combined with a newly developed repeated protoplasting method and CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery approach were used. The pure SsHog1 and Shk1 knockout mutants showed reduced sensitivity to fungicides and increased sensitivity to osmotic stress. In addition, the SsHog1 knockout mutants demonstrated reduced virulence compared to Shk1 knockout mutants and wild-type. Our results indicate that the repeated protoplasting method and RNP approach can generate genetically pure homokaryotic mutants and SsHog1 is involved in osmotic adaptation, fungicide sensitivity, and virulence in S. sclerotiorum.

AB  - Despite previous investigations elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in endometrial function and reproductive disorders, the precise pathways through which lncRNAs impact endometrial functions and fertility remain unclear. In this study, we performed an expression profile analysis of lncRNAs in the endometrial tissue of Hu sheep with different prolificacy, identifying 13,707 lncRNAs. We discovered a bidirectional lncRNA, designated lncRNA12097.1, exhibiting significant up-regulation exclusively in the endometrium of Hu sheep with high fecundity. Functional analyses revealed lncRNA12097.1 significantly enhanced proliferation and cell cycle progression in both endometrial epithelial cell (EEC) and stromal cells (ESC), while inhibiting apoptosis in these cell types. Mechanistically, we demonstrated a directly interaction between lncRNA12097.1 and miR-145-5p, with YES proto-oncogene 1 (YES1) being identified as a validated target of miR-145-5p. Interference with lncRNA12097.1 resulted in suppressed cell growth through downregulation of YES1 expression, which could be rescued by miR-145-5p. Furthermore, lncRNA12097.1 functions as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-145-5p in ESCs, sequestering miR-145-5p and preventing its binding to the 3 ' UTR of YES1 mRNA. This interaction led to increased expression of YES1 and subsequent activation of downstream beta-catenin signaling, thereby promoting ESC growth in Hu sheep. These findings provide novel molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying prolificacy in sheep.

AB  - Dental morphology is a major aspect of ecological and evolutionary studies of both extant and fossil mammalian species. Mammalian dentitions are diverse feeding systems that can be defined through continuous numerical descriptors of the enamel pattern. We developed a comprehensive toolkit to quantify complex occlusal enamel patterns from two-dimensional images of herbivore mammals, widespread in the scientific literature, in form of three novel enamel complexity descriptors: two-dimensional orientation patch count (2D OPC), enamel folding (EF), and enamel thickness (ET). Previously proposed parameters such as occlusal enamel index or indentation index are implemented as well. The current method is devised for extracting continuous variables of enamel complexity from macro and microherbivore mammalian species with conspicuous wear facets. A general case study is proposed using two clades within the Family Rhinocerotidae containing species regarded as hypsodonts. The results show that antagonist dental adaptations were achieved through disparate evolutionary strategies in both groups. To test the robustness of this tool under different practical scenarios, other mammalian groups have been evaluated as well. Additional sensitivity analyses include the impact of image size, rotation, or differences in dental wear. Our approach differs from previous 2D techniques in its affordability, versatility, and control over individual regions within each tooth while delivering continuous numerical data. Additionally, the 2D reference images required as input are widespread in the literature and easier to process in comparison to 3D data alternatives.

AB  - 1. Organisms at the base of aquatic food webs synthesize essential nutrients, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), which are transferred to consumers at higher trophic levels. Many consumers, requiring n-3 long-chain (LC) PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have limited ability to biosynthesize them from the essential dietary precursor alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and thus rely on dietary provision of LC-PUFA.
   2. We investigated LC-PUFA metabolism in freshwater zooplankton using stable hydrogen isotopes (delta H-2) of fatty acids as tracers. We conducted feeding experiments with the freshwater keystone grazer Daphnia to quantify changes in the delta H-2 value of body FA in response to the FA composition of their food and the delta H-2 value of the ambient water.
   3. The isotopic composition of LC-PUFA changed in Daphnia, depending on the integration of H-2 from ambient water during de novo synthesis or bioconversion from dietary precursors, allowing us to distinguish dietary from bioconverted EPA in body tissue. We tested the applicability of these laboratory findings in a field setting by analysing delta H-2 values of PUFA in primary producers and consumers in eutrophic ponds to track EPA sources of zooplankton.
   4. Multilinear regression models that included conversion of ALA to EPA correlated better with zooplankton delta H-2 EpA than seston delta H-2(EPA) at low dietary EPA supply.
   5. This study provides evidence that zooplankton can compensate for low dietary EPA supply by activating LC-PUFA biosynthesis and shows that herbivorous zooplankton play a crucial role in upgrading FA for higher trophic levels during low dietary EPA supply.

AB  - Genetic modification of porcine donors, combined with optimized immunosuppression, has been shown to improve outcomes of experimental xenotransplant. However, little is known about outcomes in sensitized recipients, a population that could potentially benefit the most from the clinical implementation of xenotransplantation. Here, five highly allosensitized rhesus macaques received a porcine kidney from GGTA1 (alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase) knockout pigs expressing the human CD55 transgene (1KO.1TG) and were maintained on an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based immunosuppressive regimen. These recipients developed de novo xenoreactive antibodies and experienced xenograft rejection with evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). In comparison, three highly allosensitized rhesus macaques receiving a kidney from GGTA1, CMAH (cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase), and b4GNT2/b4GALNT2 (beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 2) knockout pigs expressing seven human transgenes including human CD46, CD55, CD47, THBD (thrombomodulin), PROCR (protein C receptor), TNFAIP3 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3), and HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1) (3KO.7TG) experienced significantly prolonged graft survival and reduced AMR, associated with dampened post-transplant humoral responses, early monocyte and neutrophil activation, and T cell repopulation. After withdrawal of all immunosuppression, recipients who received kidneys from 3KO.7TG pigs rejected the xenografts via AMR. These data suggest that allosensitized recipients may be suitable candidates for xenografts from genetically modified porcine donors and could benefit from an optimized immunosuppression regimen designed to target the post-transplant humoral response, thereby avoiding AMR.

AB  - Laurencia seaweed species synthesize a broad range of secondary metabolites, mainly terpenes (e.g., elatol), exhibiting diverse ecological roles, such as defense against fouling and herbivores. Recently, an intricate cellular machinery was described concerning terpenes biosynthetic pathways, storage inside corps en cerise (CC), and regulated exocytosis in these species. But for seaweeds in general, the proteins involved in transmembrane transport of secondary metabolites remain unknown. Assays with Rhodamine-123 and cyclosporine A (CSA) revealed the presence of ABC transporters in CC membrane of Laurencia dendroidea. In vivo incubation assays with CSA resulted in CC morphological changes, reduced intracellular elatol concentrations, and increased biofouling cover on the seaweed surface. Cultivation assays in the presence of a marine pathogenic bacteria induced the expression of ABC proteins belonging to the subfamilies ABCB, ABCD, ABCF, and ABCG. The latter subfamily is known to be associated with the transport of plant terpenes. Our results shed new light on the role of ABC proteins in key mechanisms of the defensive system in seaweeds against fouling and herbivory.

AB  - Cellular prion protein (PrPC) protects neurons against oxidative stress damage. This role is lost upon its mis- folding into insoluble prions in prion diseases, and correlated with cytoskeletal breakdown and neurophysio- logical deficits. Here we used mouse neuronal models to assess how PrPC protects the neuronal cytoskeleton, and its role in network communication, from oxidative stress damage. Oxidative stress was induced extrinsically by potassium superoxide (KO2) or intrinsically by Mito-Paraquat (MtPQ), targeting the mitochondria. In mouse neural lineage cells, KO2 was damaging to the cytoskeleton, with cells lacking PrPC (PrP-/-) damaged more than wild-type (WT) cells. In hippocampal slices, KO2 acutely inhibited neuronal communication in WT controls without damaging the cytoskeleton. This inhibition was not observed in PrP-/- slices. Neuronal communication and the cytoskeleton of PrP-/- slices became progressively disrupted and degenerated post-recovery, whereas the dysfunction in WT slices recovered in 5 days. This suggests that the acute inhibition of neuronal activity in WT slices in response to KO2 was a neuroprotective role of PrPC , which PrP-/- slices lacked. Heterozygous expression of PrPC was sufficient for this neuroprotection. Further, hippocampal slices from mice expressing PrPC without its GPI anchor (PrPGPI-/-) displayed acute inhibition of neuronal activity by KO2. However, they failed to restore normal activity and cytoskeletal formation post-recovery. This suggests that PrPC facilitates the depressive response to KO2 and its GPI anchoring is required to restore KO2-induced damages. Immuno spin-trapping showed increased radicals formed on the filamentous actin of PrP-/- and PrPGPI-/- slices, but not WT and PrP+/- slices, post-recovery suggesting ongoing dysregulation of redox balance in the slices lacking GPI-anchored PrPC. The MtPQ treatment of hippocampal slices temporarily inhibited neuronal communication independent of PrPC expression. Overall, GPI-anchored PrPC alters synapses and neurotransmission to protect and repair the neuronal cytoskeleton, and neuronal communication, from extrinsically induced oxidative stress damages.

AB  - Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) is vital for signal transduction in many cellular events. Several Ca2+-binding proteins mediate the transduction of intracellular calcium signals. The EF-hand motifs containing neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) proteins are mainly expressed in the nervous system, where they have important roles in the regulation of a variety of neuronal functions. NCS1 has four EF-hand motifs and well-defined neuronal development functions in a variety of eukaryotes. However, NCS2 has only been identified in invertebrates such as insects and nematodes thus far. The functions of NCS2 remain largely unknown. Here, we identified an orthologous NCS2 in the hemipteran Nilaparvata lugens. Based on qRT-PCR, this gene was found to be primarily expressed in the brain. Knockdown of NCS2 in each nymphal instar by RNA interference led to lethality and caused aggradation and disordered arrangement of lipid droplets in the ovaries and testes of adults, which were associated with the absence of mature oocytes in female ovaries and reduction of spermiation in male adults. Our findings revealed a novel function for NCS2 as a regulator in development and reproduction and suggested that this protein had an important role in modulating lipid droplet remodelling in ovary and testis of N. lugens adults.

AB  - Placental nitric oxide (NO) is critical for maintaining perfusion in the maternal-fetal-placental circulation during normal pregnancy. NO and its many metabolites are also increased in pregnancies complicated by maternal inflamma-tion such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, gestational diabetes, and bacterial infection. However, it is unclear how increased levels of NO or its metabolites affect placental function or how the placenta deals with excessive levels of NO or its metabolites. Since there is uncertainty over the direction of change in plasma levels of NO metabolites in preeclampsia, we measured the levels of these metabolites at the placental tissue level. We found that NO metabolites are increased in placentas from patients with preeclampsia compared to healthy controls. We also discovered by ozone-based chem-iluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance that ni-trite is efficiently converted into iron nitrosyl complexes (FeNOs) within the human placenta and also observed the existence of endogenous FeNOs within placentas from sheep and rats. We show these nitrite-derived FeNOs are relatively short-lived, predominantly protein-bound, heme-FeNOs. The efficient formation of FeNOs from nitrite in the human placenta hints toward the importance of both nitrite and FeNOs in placental physiology or pathology. As iron nitro-sylation is an important posttranslational modification that affects the activity of multiple iron-containing proteins such as those in the electron transport chain, or those involved in epigenetic regulation, we conclude that FeNOs merit increased study in pregnancy complications.

AB  - Leydig cells play a critical role in male reproductive physiology, and their dysfunction is usually associated with male infertility. Melatonin has an important protective and regulatory role in these cells. However, the lack of suitable animal models impedes us from addressing the impact of endogenous melatonin on these cells. In the current study, by using arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) overexpression transgenic sheep and AANAT knockout mice, we confirmed the regulatory effects of endogenously occurring melatonin on Leydig cells as well as its beneficial effects on male reproductive performance. The results showed that the endogenously elevated melatonin level was correlated with decreased Leydig cell apoptosis, increased testosterone production, and improved quality of sperm in melatonin-enriched transgenic mammals. Signal transduction analysis indicated that melatonin targeted the mitochondria) apoptotic Bax/Bcl2 pathway and thus suppressed Leydig cell apoptosis. In addition, melatonin upregulated the expression of testosterone synthesis-related genes of Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein (StAR), Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), and Transcription factor GATA-4 (Gata4) in Leydig cells. This action was primarily mediated by the melatonin nuclear receptor RAR-related orphan receptor alpha (ROR alpha) since blockade of this receptor suppressed the effect of melatonin on testosterone synthesis. All of these actions of melatonin cause Leydig cells to generate more testosterone, which is necessary for spermatogenesis in mammals. In contrast, AANAT knockout animals have dysfunctional Leydig cells and reduced reproductive performance.

AB  - The European corn borer (ECB; Ostrinia nubilalis) is an economically damaging insect pest of maize (Zea mays L.), an important cereal crop widely grown globally. Among inbred lines, the maize genotype Mp708 has shown resistance to diverse herbivorous insects, although several aspects of the defense mechanisms of Mp708 plants are yet to be explored. Here, the changes in root physiology arising from short-term feeding by ECB on the shoot tissues of Mp708 plants was evaluated directly using transcriptomics, and indirectly by monitoring changes in growth of western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) larvae. Mp708 defense responses negatively impacted both ECB and WCR larval weights, providing evidence for changes in root physiology in response to ECB feeding on shoot tissues. There was a significant downregulation of genes in the root tissues following short-term ECB feeding, including genes needed for direct defense (e.g., proteinase inhibitors and chitinases). Our transcriptomic analysis also revealed specific regulation of the genes involved in hormonal and metabolite pathways in the roots of Mp708 plants subjected to ECB herbivory. These data provide support for the long-distance signaling-mediated defense in Mp708 plants and suggest that altered metabolite profiles of roots in response to ECB feeding of shoots likely negatively impacted WCR growth.

AB  - Depth data from over 500,000 tagged seal dives on the East Antarctic continental shelf improves the accuracy of seafloor bathymetry maps and reveals features not captured by ship-based mapping, including troughs off the Shackleton Ice Shelf and a deep canyon near the Vanderford Glacier.
   Poor coverage of the Antarctic continental shelf bathymetry impedes understanding the oceanographic processes affecting Antarctica's role in global climate. Continental shelf bathymetry influences warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water movement onto the shelf, making it an important factor promoting ice shelf melting and influencing the flow of ice shelves into the ocean. Building on previous work using seal dives to redefine bathymetry, our longitudinal study of ocean physics and animal behaviour provided new depth information from over 500,000 individual seal dives on the East Antarctic continental shelf. About 25% of these seal dives were 220 m (sometimes over 1000 m) deeper than the interpolated seafloor from IBCSO V2. Focusing on four well-sampled regions, we show that the bathymetry of 22% to 60% of the sampled area was improved by incorporating seal dive data. This revealed new bathymetric features, including troughs off the Shackleton Ice Shelf and Underwood Glacier and a deep canyon near the Vanderford Glacier. This deep canyon, the Mirounga-Nuyina Canyon, was confirmed by a recent multi-beam echo sounder survey. Further acquisitions of seal data will improve our understanding and modelling of Antarctic coastal ocean processes and ice-sheet dynamics.

AB  - Water pollution from dyes is harmful to the environment, plants, animals, and humans and is one of the most widespread problems afflicting people throughout the world. Adsorption is a widely used method to remove contaminants derived from the textile industry, food colorants, printing, and cosmetic manufacturing from water. Here, aiming to develop new low-cost and up-scalable adsorbent materials for anionic dye remediation and water decontamination by electrostatic interactions, two cationic resins (R1 and R2) were prepared. In particular, they were obtained by copolymerizing 4-ammonium methyl and ethyl styrene monomers (M1 and M2) with dimethylacrylamide (DMAA), using N-(2-acryloylamino-ethyl)-acrylamide (AAEA) as cross-linker. Once characterized by several analytical techniques, upon their dispersion in an excess of water, R1 and R2 provided the R1- and R2-based hydrogels (namely R1HG and R2HG) with equilibrium degrees of swelling (EDS) of 900% and 1000% and equilibrium water contents (EWC) of 90 and 91%, respectively. By applying Cross' rheology equation to the data of R1HG and R2HG's viscosity vs. shear rate, it was established that both hydrogels are shear thinning fluids with pseudoplastic/Bingham plastic behavior depending on share rate. The equivalents of -NH3+ groups, essential for the electrostatic-based absorbent activity, were estimated by the method of Gaur and Gupta on R1 and R2 and by potentiometric titrations on R1HG and R2HG. In absorption experiments in bulk, R1HG and R2HG showed high removal efficiency (97-100%) towards methyl orange (MO) azo dye, fluorescein (F), and their mixture (MOF). Using F or MO solutions (pH = 7.5, room temperature), the maximum absorption was 47.8 mg/g in 90 ' (F) and 47.7 mg/g in 120 ' (MO) for R1, while that of R2 was 49.0 mg/g in 20 ' (F) and 48.5 mg/g in 30 ' (MO). Additionally, R1HG and R2HG-based columns, mimicking decontamination systems by filtration, were capable of removing MO, F, and MOF from water with a 100% removal efficiency, in different conditions of use. R1HG and R2HG represent low-cost and up-scalable column packing materials that are promising for application in industrial wastewater treatment.

AB  - In the present study, we examined the effects of Cissus verticillata leaf extracts (CVE) against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)- and ischemia-induced neuronal damage in HT22 cells and gerbil hippocampus. Incubation with CVE produced concentration-dependent toxicity in HT22 cells. Significant cellular toxicity was observed with >75 mu g/mL CVE. CVE treatment at 50 mu g/mL ameliorated H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species formation, DNA fragmentation, and cell death in HT22 cells. In addition, incubation with CVE significantly mitigated the increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 induced by H2O2 treatment in HT22 cells. In an in vivo study, the administration of CVE to gerbils significantly decreased ischemia-induced motor activity 1 d after ischemia, as well as neuronal death and microglial activation 4 d after ischemia, respectively. CVE treatment reduced the release of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha 6 h after ischemia. Furthermore, CVE treatment significantly ameliorated ischemia-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and p38. These results suggest that CVE has the potential to reduce the neuronal damage induced by oxidative and ischemic stress by reducing the inflammatory responses and phosphorylation of MAPKs, suggesting that CVE could be a functional food to prevent neuronal damage induced by ischemia.

AB  - Urban greening can improve cities' air quality by filtering the main gaseous pollutants such as tropospheric ozone (O3). However, the pollutant removal capacity offered by woody species strongly depends on ecophysiological and morphological traits. Woody species with higher stomatal conductance (gs) can remove more gases from the atmosphere, but other species can worsen air quality due to high O3 forming potential (OFP), based on their emitting rates of biogenic volatile organic compounds (bVOCs) and Leaf Mass per Area (LMA). Presently, there is a lack of data on eco-physiological (gs, bVOCs emissions) and foliar traits (LMA) for several ornamental species used in urban greening programs, which does not allow assessment of their O3 removal capacity and OFP. This study aimed to (i) parameterize gs, assess bVOCs emissions and LMA of 14 ornamental woody species commonly used in Mediterranean urban greening, and (ii) model their Net O3 uptake. The gs Jarvis model was parameterized considering various environmental conditions alongside isoprene and monoterpene foliar bVOCs emission rates trapped in the field and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results are helpful for urban planning and landscaping; suggesting that Catalpa bignonioides and Gleditsia triacanthos have excellent O3 removal capacity due to their high maximum gs (gmax) equal to 0.657 and 0.597 mol H2O m- 2 s- 1. Regarding bVOCs, high isoprene (16.75 mu g gdw- 1 h-1) and monoterpene (13.12 mu g gdw- 1 h-1) emission rates were found for Rhamnus alaternus and Cornus mas. In contrast, no bVOCs emissions were detected for Camellia sasanqua and Paulownia tomentosa. In conclusion, 11 species showed a positive Net O3 uptake, while the use of large numbers of R. alaternus, C. mas, and Chamaerops humilis for urban afforestation planning are not recommended due to their potential to induce a deterioration of outdoor air quality.

AB  - Gut dysbiosis is linked to metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases and comprises a plausible link between high-fat diet (HFD) and brain dysfunction. Here we show that gut microbiota modulation by either antibiotic treatment for 5 weeks or a brief 3-day fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) regimen from low-fat (control) diet-fed mice decreased weight gain, adipose tissue hypertrophy, and glucose intolerance induced by HFD in C57BL/6 male mice. Notably, gut microbiota modulation by FMT completely reversed impaired recognition memory induced by HFD, whereas modulation by antibiotics had less pronounced effect. Improvement in recognition memory by FMT was accompanied by decreased HFD-induced astrogliosis in the hippocampal cornu ammonis region. Gut microbiome composition analysis indicated that HFD diminished microbiota diversity compared to control diet, whereas FMT partially restored the phyla diversity. Our findings reinforce the role of the gut microbiota on HFD-induced cognitive impairment and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota may be an effective strategy to prevent metabolic and cognitive dysfunction associated with unfavorable dietary patterns.image
   This study investigated the impact of gut microbiota modulation on memory impairment and metabolic dysfunction induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. We found that antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from low-fat diet-fed donor mice ameliorated metabolic outcomes induced by HFD. Notably, FMT, but not antibiotic treatment, reversed impaired recognition memory induced by HFD. The latter finding was accompanied by diminished HFD-induced astrogliosis in the hippocampal cornu ammonis region and restored fecal microbiota diversity. The findings indicate that targeting gut dysbiosis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for cognitive dysfunction induced by excessive dietary fat (image created with Biorender.com (R)).image

AB  - Microscopic observation is necessary for the treatment of bone tissue microloss. To observe the process of bone tissue maturation is an essential research content in the field of orthopaedics. In many cases, people have to distinguish between new bone and mature bone, sometimes involving software calculation, and IP: 203 8 109 20 On: T e 08 Aug 2023 05:43:56 conventional HE staining obviouslycannot fully meet the rqurements. The quality of imaging directly affects Copyright: American Scientific Publishers the therapeutic effect of medical staff. In ordr to prove theffect of laser scanning confocal microscope Delivered by nge nta (LSCM) on the observation of bone tissue micro damage, a piece of pig iliac bone and a piece of human femoral head were selected. The two kinds of bone tissue were divided into three small pieces respectively, and then stained with calcein green and alizarin red, or added with 5 ml of 1000 ml/L ethanol, and then placed under the LSCM and fluorescein Scanning under light microscope. This article uses silk fibroin as the raw material to prepare high-strength bilayer membranes using rotary evaporation method. Through relevant performance experiments, the results show that the mechanical properties of the double-layer silk fibroin film are about 12.48 MPa, and the tensile strength at break is about 13.66%. With the addition of hydroxyapatite, the mechanical properties of the silk fibroin film are improved. The addition of VEGF has little effect on the mechanical properties, and the addition of growth factor has little effect on the tensile strength of the material. The double-layer silk fibroin membrane was degraded in protease for 2 weeks, with a mass loss of about 19.3%. There was almost no degradation phenomenon in PBS solution; The release of VEGF from the double-layer silk fibroin membrane was about 17.3% after 2 weeks, with a relatively fast release rate in the early stage, and then the rate slowed down. The total release of VEGF decreased compared to the pure SF/VEGF membrane. Through the analysis of the scanning image, it is found that the image signal-to-noise ratio of alizarin red stained human femoral head is 6.956 higher than that of fluorescence microscope. In terms of image error rate, fluorescence microscope is 4.228 higher than laser scanning confocal microscope. The edge definition of laser scanning confocal microscope was 22.17 higher than that of fluorescence microscope, and the image clarity of stained bone tissue was higher than that of bone tissue only added ethanol. Therefore, the imaging effect of bone tissue staining is better, and the image generated by LSCM is higher than that generated by fluorescence microscope.

AB  - The mature mammalian brain connectome emerges during development via the extension and pruning of neuronal connections. Glial cells have been identified as key players in the phagocytic elimination of neuronal synapses and projections. Recently, phosphatidylserine has been identified as neuronal "eat-me" signal that guides elimination of unnecessary input sources, but the associated transduction systems involved in such pruning are yet to be described. Here, we identified Xk-related protein 8 (Xkr8), a phospholipid scramblase, as a key factor for the pruning of axons in the developing mammalian brain. We found that mouse Xkr8 is highly expressed immediately after birth and required for phosphatidylserine exposure in the hippocampus. Mice lacking Xkr8 showed excess excitatory nerve terminals, increased density of cortico-cortical and cortico-spinal projections, aberrant electrophysiological profiles of hippocampal neurons, and global brain hyperconnectivity. These data identify phospholipid scrambling by Xkr8 as a central process in the labeling and discrimination of developing neuronal projections for pruning in the mammalian brain.

AB  - PurposeAcanthamoeba castellanii is an important opportunistic human protozoal pathogen that can cause both skin, ocular and brain infections. Recent studies have established that brews and solvent extract (SE) of green tea (Camellia sinensis) can inhibit the growth and encystation of A. castellanii. Here we characterized those growth and encystation inhibitions.MethodsHerein, we characterize of the morphological and chemical changes that occur in the trophozoites and the encysting stage of A. castellanii after exposure to C. sinensis SE and brew using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and fluorescence-based assays.ResultsTEM showed ultrastructural changes in both A. castellanii stages. FTIR microspectroscopy revealed modifications of amide I and II band peaks in the C. sinensis-treated trophozoites, suggesting an inhibition of protein synthesis. Assessment of the nucleus integrity of trophozoites exposed to SE and brew revealed disruption of the nuclear membrane integrity, nuclear fragmentation, and chromatin degradation, and reduction in the quantity of DNA and RNA, indicating trophozoite death. These results are consistent with C. sinensis acting as a membrane-active anti-acanthamoebic, exhibiting amoebicidal activity against growing and encysting A. castellanii. This work underlines the importance of characterizing the effect of C. sinensis constituents, individually or in combinations, to clarify which ones are the primary components responsible for its action and the observed alterations in the structure and function of A. castellanii.ConclusionThese results demonstrated that exposure to C. sinensis SE or brew alters the synthesis of protein, DNA, RNA and disrupts the cell wall integrity.

AB  - Simple Summary The pork consumer market has restrictions on many products used in production, including ractopamine. Therefore, it is important to search for alternatives so that the animal continues to achieve maximum weight gain with a leaner carcass. We performed an evaluation comparing animals whose diet was supplemented with ractopamine, a diet with a phytogenic compound, and a diet without additives. Animals whose diet was supplemented with ractopamine performed better, and animals whose diet was supplemented with the herbal extract performed intermediately when compared with animals whose did not receive additives in their diet. The animals that were fed the phytogenic compound had improved the sensory attributes of the pork. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of a phytogenic compound for pigs in the growing and finishing phases as a possible substitute for ractopamine. A total of 140 pigs with an average initial weight of 48.8 kg +/- 5.9 kg were used, distributed in a randomized block design, in a 3 x 2 factorial scheme (control diet (CONT), diet with inclusion of 2.5 kg per ton of a phytogenic compound (PC), and diet with 10 ppm of ractopamine (RAC), and two sexes: gilts and barrows), distributed in eight pens per treatment. The performance parameters were measured, and, at the end of the experimental period, the animals were slaughtered for carcass characteristics and pork quality analysis. The animals consuming RAC showed a better feed conversion, 4% improvement in relation to the group with the PC (p < 0.05). For daily weight gain, the animals supplemented with the PC showed 4.46% lower gain compared to RAC, and 3% greater gain compared to the CONT (p < 0.05). The animals that consumed the PC showed 5.6% lower shear force of the pork (p < 0.05) in relation to the CONT group and 29% lower in relation to the RAC group. The TBARS value presented a significant difference (p < 0.05), the CONTT group was 29% higher than the RAC, and the PC was 15.5% higher than the RAC. For chroma, the pork of the RAC group was 14% lower than the CONTT group and 10.3% less than the PC. There was no significant difference for the carcass parameters. It was concluded that the pigs in the ractopamine group presented the best performance; however, the phytogenic compound can be used against ractopamine's restriction because it improves daily weight gain and promotes a softer and less pale meat when compared with ractopamine.

AB  - Arsenic contamination is highly prevalent in food chain, soil and groundwater. Continuous exposure to elevated levels of this environmental toxin is a global concern. Studies have reported enriched accumulation of arsenic in the eyes compared to other body organs leading to various eye diseases. Here, the impact of arsenic exposure on the enzymatic eye zeta-crystallin has been investigated. Arsenic inhibited the activity of the enzyme with an IC50 value of 35 mu M. It decreased the free thiol group content of zeta-crystallin due to protein oxidation. The binding of arsenic with zeta-crystallin was explored using biophysical and computational tools. The enzyme undergoes some conformational changes upon arsenic binding. The binding constant (K-b) was determined to be 1.2 x 10(2) M-1. Thermodynamic parameters were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and the binding energy (Delta G) was calculated to be -3.52 kcal/mol. Molecular docking studies helped in visualizing the amino acid residues (especially Cys165) of the enzyme involved in binding with arsenic. Continuous arsenic exposure is expected to increase the eye crystallin-related abnormalities, elevating the risk of cataractogenesis. Therefore, proper measures need to be taken by authorities to control the contamination of arsenic in the environment and groundwater.

AB  - Underwater adhesives are essential in industry, biomedical field, as well as our daily life. Herein, inspired by the natural plant protein, an eco-friendly, cost-effective and renewable bio-resources gliadin/TA adhesive was developed by a facile and effective strategy. The prepared gliadin/TA adhesive displayed exceptional substrate universality, rapid self-healing ability, instant and long-term underwater adhesion, strong affinity and good environmental adaptability. In the dry environment, the glued woods with a lab-shear bond can lift a weight of 11.62 kg object with a bond area was 2.15 cm2. In the water, the gliadin/TA adhesives can successfully lift 1 kg stainless steel and maintained effective adhesion for up to 50 days without detachment. Meanwhile, the gliadin/ TA adhesives exhibited excellent environmental adaptability, including 1 M NaCl, extreme acidic (pH = 2), alkaline (pH = 14) and high-temperature (48 degrees C) aqueous solutions. Additionally, the potential applications of gliadin/TA adhesives have been proved by repairing porcine skin and bones, bonding wood particles together rapidly to withstand water-flushing, plugging leaky containers and broken pig intestine. This work presents a distinctive and facile strategy for designing and developing the eco-friendly, cost-effective and renewable bioresources underwater adhesives.

AB  - Herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) in saliva enable plants to detect herbivores and activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Piercing-sucking herbivores secrete gel-like saliva that forms salivary sheaths, which aid in feeding. However, the role of proteins within these sheaths in modulating plant defenses remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a thermostable HAMP, actin-related protein 1 (Lsactin), from the salivary sheath of the small brown planthopper (SBPH) Laodelphax striatellus. Lsactin is a widely conserved arthropod protein that serves as an inducer of the BAK1-dependent PTI response in Nicotiana benthamiana, thereby enhancing its resistance to both Bemisia tabaci and Spodoptera frugiperda. Moreover, this HAMP can also induce cell death in plants such as eggplant, cotton, pepper, and corn. Plants were able to specifically recognize the Lsactin 41-amino-acid peptide (LP41), which functions as a minimal immunogenic epitope. Furthermore, LP41 stimulates the production of jasmonic acid and hydrogen peroxide in rice, enhancing rice's resistance to the SBPH. However, silencing Lsactin in SBPH led to the disruption of salivary sheath formation, which reduced insect feeding efficiency. This study demonstrates that Lsactin from the SBPH salivary sheath serves as a crucial HAMP, triggering plants resistance to various insect species.

AB  - Female reproductive capacity is shaped by ovarian reserve and patterns of follicle development. Ovarian reserve depletion occurs by follicle activation and atresia, which are affected by environmental chemicals (ECs). Because humans are simultaneously exposed to hundreds of ECs, real-life exposure models are essential to assess patterns of atresia after EC exposure. Previous findings demonstrate maternal preconceptional and gestational EC exposure via biosolids increases activation rate and reduces primordial follicle pool in juvenile, but not adult sheep. We hypothesized that this shift involves changes in death and proliferative pathways that impact follicle atresia from juvenile to adult life. Ovaries were collected from juvenile (9.5 weeks) and adult (2.5 years) offspring from ewes grazed on biosolids-treated pasture (BTP) or inorganic fertilizer-treated pasture (Control). Follicular atresia was assessed through morphological characteristics and molecular death pathways, including expression of markers for apoptosis (CASP3), autophagy (LC3), ferroptosis (GPX4), and proliferation (Ki67). There were higher levels of apoptosis and autophagy, and lower proliferation, in juvenile BTP offspring compared to controls. In adult BTP offspring, apoptosis and proliferation were similar, autophagy was lower, and ferroptosis was higher compared to controls. Apoptosis was lower and ferroptosis was higher in adults than juveniles, regardless of treatment. Adult BTP offspring had lower autophagy and similar proliferation levels than juvenile BTP offspring. These findings suggest that lower autophagy and lack of decrease in proliferation contribute to normalization of activation rate and ovarian pool in BTP adult offspring and supportive of lasting impacts of gestational EC exposure on offspring follicular health.
   Sentence Preconceptional and gestational exposure to biosolids influenced the health status of developing follicles in offspring in a reproductive life-stage specific manner that involved cell death and cell proliferative pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUNDContact chemoreception plays a crucial role in host-plant recognition and acceptance of herbivorous insects; however, the mechanisms by which peripheral taste inputs regulate insect feeding remain unclear. The aim of this study is to clarify the ecological significance of sugar and bitter gustatory receptors (Grs) in the relationship between Helicoverpa armigera and its hostplants.RESULTSBlocking the positive input via knocking out Gr10 only leads to an increase in palpating frequency, and decreases in both the feeding time and the amounts of larvae on palatable fruit substrates, thereby prolonging the larval stage. Blocking the positive input via knocking out Gr6 only results in a decreased percentage of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) to sucrose and a reduced sucrose intake of adults, thus weakening their ability to detect nectar and decreasing longevity and fecundity. Blocking the negative inputs via knocking out Gr180 decreases palpating frequency and increases both feeding time and amount on unpalatable leaf substrates, leading to early larval mortality and a loss of aversion in adults to coumarin.CONCLUSIONThese results indicate that Gr10 is crucial for larvae and Gr6 for adults in tasting some palatable foods, while Gr180 is important for both larvae and adults in avoiding some unpalatable foods. These findings enhance the understanding of how feeding behavior is controlled by taste neuron input in this polyphagous moth species. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Tea flavor is a comprehensive representation of its aroma and other characteristics. The formation of volatile odor compounds during tea processing depends on a variety of enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities. (Z)-3-hexenol is considered the primary source of the green odor and is also the most important component in tea aroma, significantly affecting the overall aroma. However, the biosynthesis and accumulation of (Z)-3-hexenol during tea processing have not been fully analyzed. In this study, we found that withering treatment at different times and withering plus shaking treatment at different degrees promoted the accumulation of important volatile components of green tea odor, especially (Z)-3-hexenol by GC-MS. The RNA-seq and qRT-PCR results showed that withering and withering plus shaking treatments enhanced the expression of (Z)-3-hexenol-related genes in tea leaves, including synthetic pathway 1 genes (CsLOX3, CsHPL1, CsADH4, and CsAHD1), synthetic pathway 2 genes (CsGLU), and synthetic pathway 3 genes (CsCXEs). Correlation analysis of the key odorants and important genes in the three synthetic pathways revealed that some CsCXEs were positively correlated with green odor compounds. The in vitro enzyme activity results showed that rCsCXE3 (GWHTASIV011658), and rCsCXE6 (GWHTASIV031480) exhibited hydrolytic activity against three tea acetate compounds [hexyl acetate, (E)-2-hexyl acetate, and (Z)-3-hexyl acetate], resulting in the production of corresponding alcohol compounds. In summary, withering and shaking treatment during tea processing promoted the expression of CsCXE3 and CsCXE6, thereby enhancing the production of hexenol compounds. These compounds play a crucial role in increasing the green odor of tea.

AB  - Delineating human cardiac pathologies and their basic molecular mechanisms relies on research conducted in model organisms. Yet translating findings from preclinical models to humans present a significant challenge, in part due to differences in cardiac protein expression between humans and model organisms. Proteins immediately determine cellular function, yet their large-scale investigation in hearts has lagged behind those of genes and transcripts. Here, we set out to bridge this knowledge gap: By analyzing protein profiles in humans and commonly used model organisms across cardiac chambers, we determine their commonalities and regional differences. We analyzed cardiac tissue from each chamber of human, pig, horse, rat, mouse, and zebrafish in biological replicates. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflows, we measured and evaluated the abundance of approximately 7,000 proteins in each species. The resulting knowledgebase of cardiac protein signatures is accessible through an online database: . Our combined analysis allows for quantitative evaluation of protein abundances across cardiac chambers, as well as comparisons of cardiac protein profiles across model organisms. Up to a quarter of proteins with differential abundances between atria and ventricles showed opposite chamber-specific enrichment between species; these included numerous proteins implicated in cardiac disease. The generated proteomics resource facilitates translational prospects of cardiac studies from model organisms to humans by comparisons of disease-linked protein networks across species.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Tryptophan (Trp) plays an important role in piglet growth. However, the effect of dietary Trp on microbial flora is still poorly understood. A total of 40 28-d weaned piglets were fed a corn and soybean meal-based diet with 0.14%, 0.21%, 0.28%, or 0.35% Trp for four weeks. The average daily body weight gain, average daily feed intake, feed conversion ratio, spleen index, pancreas index, longissimus dorsi muscle index, plasma insulin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, kynurenine, and Trp concentrations of weaned piglets increased in a Trp dose-dependent manner. Compared with the 0.14% Trp diet, the adequate-Trp diets (0.21%, 0.28%, or 0.35%) down-regulated the relative abundances of 12 genera including Turicibacter, Prevotella, Mitsuokella, Anaerovibrio, Megasphaera, Succinivibrio, Sutterella, Desulfovibrio, and Methanobrevibacter; up-regulated the abundances of Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillus, and Muribaculaceae in the colon; and augmented the mRNA level and concentration of porcine beta-defensin 2 in the small intestinal mucosa. Moreover, Trp-adequate diets increased the abundances of Trp hydroxylase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, porcine beta-defensin 2, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin, and phosphorylated protein kinase B in the small intestinal mucosa. In summary, a corn and soybean meal-based diet with 0.35% Trp may be a nutritional strategy to improve growth performance, intestinal mucosal barrier integrity, and intestinal microbial ecology in weaned piglets.
   Tryptophan (Trp) plays an important role in piglet growth. However, the effect of dietary Trp on microbial flora is still poorly understood. A total of 40 28-d weaned piglets were allocated to four groups with 10 barrows per group and one pig per replicate. Piglets were fed a corn and soybean meal-based diet with 0.14%, 0.21%, 0.28%, or 0.35% Trp for four weeks. Five piglets from each diet group were euthanized, and blood and tissue samples were collected. The average daily body weight gain, average daily feed intake, feed conversion ratio, spleen index, pancreas index, longissimus dorsi muscle index, plasma insulin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, kynurenine, and Trp concentrations of weaned piglets increased in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Compared with the 0.14% Trp diet, the adequate-Trp diets (0.21%, 0.28%, or 0.35%) down-regulated the relative abundances of 12 genera including Turicibacter, Prevotella, Mitsuokella, Anaerovibrio, Megasphaera, Succinivibrio, Sutterella, Desulfovibrio, and Methanobrevibacter (p < 0.05); up-regulated the abundances of Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillus, and Muribaculaceae in the colon (p < 0.05); and augmented the mRNA level and concentration of porcine beta-defensin 2 in the small intestinal mucosa (p < 0.05). Moreover, Trp-adequate diets increased the abundances of Trp hydroxylase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, porcine beta-defensin 2, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin, and phosphorylated protein kinase B in the small intestinal mucosa (p < 0.05). We noted that a corn and soybean meal-based diet with 0.35% Trp may be a nutritional strategy to improve growth performance, intestinal mucosal barrier integrity, and intestinal microbial ecology in weaned piglets.

AB  - Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger-containing transcription factor that regulates diverse cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Our previous study showed that KLF4 expression is upregulated in skeletal muscle ontogeny during embryonic development in pigs, suggesting its importance for skeletal muscle development and muscle function. We revealed here that KLF4 plays a critical role in skeletal muscle development and regeneration. Specific knockout of KLF4 in skeletal muscle impaired muscle formation further affecting physical activity and also defected skeletal muscle regeneration. In vitro, KLF4 was highly expressed in proliferating myoblasts and early differentiated cells. KLF4 knockdown promoted myoblast proliferation and inhibited myoblast fusion, while its overexpression showed opposite results. Mechanically, in proliferating myoblasts, KLF4 inhibits myoblast proliferation through regulating cell cycle arrest protein P57 by directly targeting its promoter; while in differentiated myoblasts, KLF4 promotes myoblast fusion by transcriptionally activating Myomixer. Our study provides mechanistic information for skeletal muscle development, reduced muscle strength and impaired regeneration after injury and unveiling the mechanism of KLF4 in myogenic regulation.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment is a diagnostic category marked by declines in memory and cognitive function that are less severe than those observed in Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have indicated that individuals with mild cognitive impairment have an elevated risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease. The hippocampus is well known to play pivotal roles in memory and cognitive functions. Scopolamine (Sco) disrupts cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and triggers functional declines in memory and cognition. SHCogTM is a commercially available alpha glycerophosphorylcholine (alpha-GPC) derived from soybean lecithin. The objective of the present study was to examine whether SHCogTM can alleviate memory and cognitive dysfunctions in a mouse model of cognitive impairments induced by Sco. In this study, C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to the passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests to investigate short-term and spatial memory functions, respectively. This study also examined cellular morphology and distribution by cresyl violet staining and investigated changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as cholinergic enzymes through immunohistochemical staining of the hippocampus. Additionally, we examined changes in postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) related to neural plasticity in the hippocampus. Treatment with SHCogTM (125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg) brought functional recovery in short-term and spatial memory against Sco-induced memory and cognitive impairments. Changes in cellular morphology and distribution in the hippocampus were not detected following the administration of Sco and/or SHCogTM. Treatment with SHCogTM reduced AChE elevated by Sco, whereas SHCogTM administration increased ChAT decreased by Sco. Furthermore, SHCogTM restored PSD-95 and BDNF in the mouse hippocampus reduced by Sco. Specifically, SHCogTM modulated cholinergic neurotransmission and enhanced neural plasticity in the hippocampus. Taken together, we suggest that SHCogTM can be a valuable ingredient in functional foods or supplements for improving memory and cognitive functions.

AB  - Veillonella and Lactobacillus species are key regulators of a healthy gut environment through metabolic cross-feeding, influencing lactic acid and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, which are crucial for gut health. This study aims to investigate how Veillonella ratti (V. ratti) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) interact with each other and alleviate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in a mouse model. We assess their metabolic interactions regarding carbon sources through co-culturing in a modified medium. In the in vitro experiments, V. ratti and LA were inoculated in mono-cultures and co-culture, and viable cell counts, OD600, pH, lactic acid, glucose and SCFAs were measured. For the in vivo experiment, 60 C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups and administered V. ratti and LA alone or in combination via oral gavage (1 x 10(9 )CFU mL(-1) per day per mouse) for 14 days. On the seventh day, 2.5% DSS was added to the drinking water to induce colitis. The effects of these probiotics on UC were evaluated by assessing intestinal barrier integrity and intestinal inflammation in the gut microenvironment. In vitro results demonstrated that co-culturing V. ratti with LA significantly increased viable cell numbers, lactic acid production, and SCFA production, while reducing pH and glucose levels in the medium. In vivo findings revealed that intervention with V. ratti, particularly in combination with LA, alleviated symptoms, including weight loss, colon shortening, and tissue damage. These probiotics mitigated intestinal inflammation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory molecules, such as IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-gamma, iNOS, and IFN-gamma, as well as oxidative stress markers, including MDA and MPO. Concurrently, they upregulated the activity of anti-inflammatory enzymes, namely, SOD and GSH, and promoted the production of SCFAs. The combined intervention of V. ratti and LA significantly increased acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and total SCFAs in cecal contents. Furthermore, the intervention of V. ratti and LA increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Akkermansia, while reducing the abundance of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia-Shigella and Desulfovibrio, thereby mitigating excessive inflammation. These findings highlight the enhanced therapeutic effects resulting from the interactions between V. ratti and LA, demonstrating the potential of this combined probiotic approach.

AB  - The impact of transport on weaned piglet welfare has been evaluated under experimental conditions, but data generated from studies conducted under commercial conditions and incorporating variation in time between weaning and transport are lacking. The purpose of this research was to describe the behaviour patterns, changes in weight and signs of injury observed in a subset of piglets from two Canadian commercial swine systems employing different weaning and transport practices. The Western system (W) weaned piglets up to six days prior to long (>30 h) transport, while the Eastern system (E) weaned piglets immediately prior to short (<3 h) transport. Four transport events for both systems were observed under summer conditions. Behaviour of the first pen of piglets placed after transport was recorded at arrival (T1a), while a subset of the transported piglets enrolled prior to transport (E: n = 200, W: n = 240) had weights collected, injury assessments completed, and behaviour video recorded on the day of arrival (T1b) and 3-4 days later (T2). A greater percentage of W piglets were observed feeding at T1a (35.8% vs 0.0%; P < 0.001), and piglets exposed to W system practices had a greater likelihood of being observed feeding compared to piglets exposed to E system practices at T1b (IRR: 9.2, 95% CI: 4.3-19.9, P < 0.001) and T2 (IRR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8-2.4, P < 0.001). Similarly, a greater percentage of W piglets were observed drinking at T1a (13.9% vs 9.2%; P = 0.005) and piglets exposed to W system practices had a greater likelihood of being observed drinking at T1b (IRR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9, P = 0.001). Sitting was performed more by E piglets at T1a (P = 0.01), but piglets exposed to W system practices had a greater likelihood of being observed sitting at T1b (IRR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4-4.6, P = 0.003). Eastern system piglets lay down more at T1a (20.0% vs 0.0%; P < 0.001) and piglets exposed to E system practices had a greater likelihood of being observed lying at T2 (IRR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.4-1.5, P < 0.001). Between T1b and T2, lesion severity (scratches, wounds) increased in E piglets compared to W piglets in the ear, skin and tail regions assessed, likely due to weaning timeline and associated aggression. This study observed impacts of both proximity to weaning and transport duration on piglet welfare indicators and supports further investigation of the interaction between weaning and transport departure times. Piglets undergoing long transport days after weaning may benefit from having access to feed and water during transport.

AB  - Termites have physiological and behavioral immunities that make them highly resistant to pathogen infections, which complicates biocontrol efforts. However, the stimuli that trigger the pathogen-avoidance behaviors of termites are still unclear. Our study shows that workers of Coptotermes formosanus exposed to the conidia of Metarhizium anisopliae exhibited a significantly higher frequency and longer duration of allogrooming behaviors compared with untreated termites. Volatile compounds in the cuticle of control termites and termites previously exposed to a suspension of M. anisopliae conidia were analyzed and compared using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Our results showed that the amount of ergosterol differed between the fungus-exposed and control termites. Choice tests showed that termites significantly preferred to stay on filter paper treated with ergosterol (0.05, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/mL) compared with control filter paper. In addition, termites exposed to ergosterol followed by M. anisopliae conidia were allogroomed at a significantly higher frequency and for a longer duration than termites exposed to alcohol (the solvent used with the ergosterol in the ergosterol trials) alone followed by M. anisopliae conidia. These results showed that ergosterol may enhance the allogrooming behavior of termites in the presence of entomopathogenic fungi.

AB  - One primary focus of skin tissue engineering has been the creation of innovative biomaterials to facilitate rapid wound healing. Extracellular matrix (ECM), an essential biofunctional substance, has recently been discovered to play a crucial role in wound healing. Consequently, we endeavored to decellularize ECM from pig achilles tendon and refine its mechanical and biological properties through modification by utilizing cross -linking agents. Glutaraldehyde (GA), 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS), double aldol starch (DAS), and microbial transglutaminase (MTG) were utilized to produce crosslinked ECM variants (GA -ECM, EDC/NHS-ECM, DAS-ECM, and MTG-ECM). Comprehensive assessments were conducted to evaluate the physical properties, biocompatibility, and wound healing efficacy of each material. The results indicated that MTG-ECM exhibited superior tensile strength, excellent hydrophilicity, minimal cytotoxicity, and the best prohealing impact among the four modified scaffolds. Staining analysis of tissue sections further revealed that MTG-ECM impeded the transition from type III collagen to type I collagen in the wound area, potentially reducing the development of wound scar. Therefore, MTG-ECM is expected to be a potential pro -skin repair scaffold material to prevent scar formation.

AB  - The African weakly electric elephantfish family Mormyridae comprises 22 genera and almost 230 species. Up-to-date cytogenetic information was available for 17 species representing 14 genera. Here we report chromosome number and morphology in Hyperopisus bebe (Lacepede, 1803) and Pollimyrus isidori (Valenciennes, 1847) collected from the White Nile system in southwestern Ethiopia. Both taxa displayed the diploid chromosome number 2n = 40, but they differed in fundamental numbers: FN = 66 in H. bebe and FN = 72 in P. isidori; previously the same diploid chromosome number 2n = 40 was reported in an undescribed species of Pollimyrus Taverne, 1971 (FN = 42) from the same region. Our results demonstrate that not only pericentric inversions, but fusions also played a substantial role in the evolution of the mormyrid karyotype structure. If the hypothesis that the karyotype structure with 2n = 50-52 and prevalence of the uni-armed chromosomes close to the ancestral condition for the family Mormyridae is correct, the most derived karyotype structures are found in the Mormyrus Linnaeus, 1758 species with 2n = 50 and the highest number of bi-armed elements in their compliments compared to all other mormyrids and in Pollimyrus isidori with the highest number of bi-armed elements among the mormyrids with 2n = 40.

AB  - Tea products made from chlorotic or albino leaves are very popular for their unique flavor. Probing into the molecular mechanisms underlying the chlorotic leaf phenotype is required to better understand the formation of these tea cultivars and aid in future practical breeding. In this study, transcriptional alterations of multiple subunit genes of the caseinolytic protease complex (Clp) in the chlorotic tea cultivar 'Yu-Jin-Xiang' (YJX) were found. Cultivar YJX possessed the intron retention variant of ClpP3, named as CsClpP3m, in addition to the non-mutated ClpP3. The mutated variant results in a truncated protein containing only 166 amino acid residues and lacks the catalytic triad S182-H206-D255. Quantitative analysis of two CsClpP3 variants in different leaves with varying degrees of chlorosis in YJX and analyses of different chlorotic tea cultivars revealed that the transcript ratios of CsClpP3m over CsClpP3 were negatively correlated with leaf chlorophyll contents. The chlorotic young leaf phenotype was also generated in the transgenic tobacco by suppressing ClpP3 using the RNAi method; complementation with non-mutated CsClpP3 rescued the wild-type phenotype, whereas CsClpP3m failed to complement. Taken together, CsClpP3m is involved in leaf chlorosis in YJX and some other tea cultivars in a dose-dependent manner, likely resulting from the failure of Clp complex assembly due to the truncated sequence of CsClpP3m. Our data shed light on the mechanisms controlling leaf chlorosis in tea plants.

AB  - Spatial navigation and spatial memory are two important skills for independent living, and are known to be compromised with age. Here, we investigate the neural correlates of successful spatial memory in healthy older adults in order to learn more about the neural underpinnings of maintenance of navigation skill into old age. Healthy older adults watched a video shot by a person navigating a route and were asked to remember objects along the route and then attempted to remember object locations by virtually pointing to the location of hidden objects from several locations along the route. Brain activity during watching and pointing was recorded with functional MRI. Larger activations in temporal and frontal regions during watching, and larger deactivations in superior parietal cortex and intraparietal sulcus during pointing, were associated with smaller location errors. These findings suggest that larger evoked responses during learning of spatial information coupled with larger deactivation of canonical spatial memory regions at retrieval are important for effective spatial memory in late life.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation can be influenced by biological characteristics (e.g., trophic position) and environmental changes (e.g., seasonal flood-pulse), as it can create site conditions conducive to methylation and alter the availability of food to biota. This study aimed to relate total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in fishes of an Amazonian lake (Catalao Lake) to their dietary changes during different hydrological seasons (rising-, high-, falling-, and low-water). Levels of THg, MeHg, and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (delta N-15 and delta C-13) were determined in the muscles of six fish species: Rhytiodus microlepis, Hemiodus sp., Triportheus albus, Anodus elongatus, Pellona flavipinnis and Acestrorhynchus falcirostris. Triportheusalbus, an omnivorous fish, showed a significant relationship between Hg concentrations and delta C-13 signatures (negative regression; THg: p = 0.0001 and MeHg: p = 0.0002), as well as between Hg and delta N-15 signatures (positive regression; THg: p = 0.003 and MeHg: p = 0.021), indicating that changes in feeding habits influenced the Hg concentrations in this species. The herbivorous R. microlepis presented the highest MeHg concentrations during the high-water season, reflecting Hg methylation in its diet (macrophyte roots) during flooded season. The piscivorous A. falcirostris had the lowest THg concentrations during this season because of lower prey availability. Slopes of the regressions between the Hg concentrations and delta N-15 values followed the sequence of rising-< high-< falling-water seasons (THg: 0.06 < 0.11 < 0.15; MeHg: 0.07 < 0.10 < 0.17), indicating that the difference between the THg and MeHg concentrations observed for lower-and higher-trophic-level fish increased during the falling-water season, resulting in trophic biomagnification. The present study shows that feeding habit and the flood-pulse influence mercury concentrations in the muscle of fishes from Catalao Lake.

AB  - This study investigated the interaction between particle size and mixing ratio on the porosity of particleboard and in consequence its effect on the physical and mechanical properties of panels. Tea Oil Camellia Shell (TOCS), which could provide 1.8 million tons of lignocellulose raw material annually, can be a useful resource for particleboard production. In that regard, particleboards with different particle sizes (coarse and fine) and mixing ratios (wood and TOCS) bonded with Polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate (pMDI) were investigated. The results showed that particleboard made with TOCS particles had higher densities than those of commercial wood particles. Furthermore, particleboards made with fine particles had lower porosity. The average values for physical and mechanical properties have shown that except for thickness swelling (TS), most properties were better with coarse particles. In terms of all properties, results showed that adding 50% of commercial wood in conjunction with TOCS particles regardless of particle size can offer acceptable results, which qualified all requirements of EN 312:2010 standard for P2-type particleboard (boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions). In addition, due to the porous structure of the shells, TOCS-based particleboards have better thermal conductivity compared to wood-based particleboards.

AB  - Background: The heme oxygenase (HO) system plays a significant role in neuroprotection and reduction of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The system, via isoforms HO -1 and HO -2, regulates cellular redox balance. HO -1, an antioxidant defense enzyme, is highlighted due to its association with depression, characterized by heightened neuroinflammation and impaired oxidative stress responses. Methodology: We observed the pathophysiology of HO -1 and phytochemicals as its modulator. We explored Science Direct, Scopus, and PubMed for a comprehensive literature review. Bibliometric and temporal trend analysis were done using VOSviewer. Results: Several phytochemicals can potentially alleviate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress-induced depressive symptoms. These effects result from inhibiting the MAPK and NK-kappa B pathways - both implicated in

AB  - Piroplasmosis, a disease of domestic and wild animals, is caused by tick-borne protozoa of the genera Babesia and Theileria, while anaplasmosis is caused by tick-borne bacteria of genera Anaplasma. Hyalomma dromedarii is the most dominant tick species infesting camels in Egypt and act as a vector of piroplasms, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Ehrlichia spp. The available information concerning the detection of these pathogens in H. dromedarii infesting camels is limited. The present study aimed to evaluate the status of these pathogens in H. dromedarii ticks over four seasons of a year, in addition to investigate the infections of piroplasms and Anaplasmataceae besides their genetic diversity starting from June 2021 till April 2022. A total of 275 semi-engorged females of H. dromedarii were collected from different slaughtered camels, Toukh city slaughterhouse then investigated by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect piroplasms (Babesia spp., Theileria spp.) and Anaplasmataceae DNA targeting 18 S rRNA and 16 S rRNA genes, respectively followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Overall, piroplasms were detected in 38 ticks (13.8%), Babesia spp. was detected in 35 ticks (12.7%), while Theileria spp. was detected in one tick (0.4%). Anaplasmataceae was detected in 57 ticks (20.7%). Mixed infections of piroplasms and Anaplasmataceae were detected in 13 ticks (5%). Single infection either with piroplasms or Anaplasmataceae was detected in 25 (9%) and 44 (16%) ticks, respectively. The highest monthly rate of piroplasms was in April (spring) and Anaplasmataceae was in July (summer). Sequence analysis revealed that Babesia bigemina, Wolbachia spp. and Anaplasma marginale are the most dominant species in the examined tick samples. To the best of our knowledge, this study confirms the presence of B. bigemina, Wolbachia spp. and A. marginale in H. dromedarii in Egypt by sequencing.

AB  - Dysfunctions of neural stem cells (NSCs) often lead to a variety of neurological diseases. Thus, therapies based on NSCs have gained increasing attention recently. It has been documented that microRNA (miR)-421 represses the autophagy and apoptosis of mouse hippocampal neurons and confers a role in the repair of ischemic brain injury (IBI). Herein, we aimed to illustrate the effects of miR-421 on NSC self-renewal. The downstream factors of miR-421 were predicted initially, followed by gain- and loss-of-function assays to examine their effects on NSC self-renewal. Immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase assays were conducted to validate the interaction among miR-421, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), HDAC3, and forkhead box O3 (FOXO3). A mouse model with IBI was developed to substantiate the impact of the miR-421/PINK1/HDAC3/FOXO3 axis on NSC self-renewal. The expression of miR-421 was downregulated during differentiation of human embryonic NSCs, and miR-421 overexpression accelerated NSC self-renewal. Besides, miR-421 targeted PINK1 and restricted its expression in NSCs and further suppressed HDAC3 phosphorylation and enhanced FOXO3 acetylation. In conclusion, our data elucidated that miR-421 overexpression may facilitate NSC self-renewal through the PINK1/HDAC3/FOXO3 axis, which may provide potential therapeutic targets for the development of novel therapies for IBI.

AB  - This study investigated the short-term storage of Honamli and Hair buck semen based on the relationships among the biochemical constituents of the seminal plasma. In total, 12 Honamli and Hair goat bucks (six of each breed) were used. Collected individual semen samples were divided into two parts, one placed in short-term storage and the other centrifuged to determine the biochemical constituents of the seminal plasma. Diluted semen samples were cooled to +4 ? the samples were stored at this temperature; the spermatological parameters (i.e., motility, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity [PMAI], viability and high mitochondrial membrane potential) were assessed at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 144 h. A significant positive correlation was determined between the PMAI, motility and viability with globulin, chlorine, alanine aminotransferase (AST) and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT). A positive correlation was detected between the PMAI and viability with total protein. In contrast, a negative correlation was determined between the motility and viability with sodium values in buck semen (p < .05). Also, it was evaluated the Hair buck samples became inviable across all parameters at 72 h, while the Honamli buck samples continued to be viable at 144 h. In conclusion, the seminal plasma biochemical parameters of total protein chlorine, globulin, albumin, sodium, AST and ALT correlated with spermatological parameters in buck semen. The factors of animal (p < .05) and time (p < .001) affected the spermatological parameters, but there was no interaction between the two factors (p > .05) during the short-term storage period. Also, it was determined that Honamli buck semen was more resistant to cold injury than Hair buck semen against cold injury during storage.

AB  - PurposeNo myxosporean species has been fully described from the gill of the western creek chubsucker, Erimyzon claviformis (Girard, 1856). Here, we report from morphometric, histopathological, and DNA sequence data on a new species of Myxobolus B & uuml;tschli, 1882 from the gill arch of E. claviformis from the Red River drainage, Arkansas, USA.MethodsBetween June 2021 and September 2022, 49 E. claviformis were taken with a backpack electrofisher from various watersheds in Calhoun, Columbia, Polk, and Sevier counties, Arkansas, USA, and McCurtain County, Oklahoma, USA, and their gills were examined macroscopically for myxozoan parasites. Gill samples with visible plasmodia were placed in individual vials containing 10% neutral-buffered formalin and 95% molecular grade ethanol. Morphometric analysis and photographic documentation was performed on plasmodia and released myxospores. SSU rRNA gene sequencing was performed on free myxospores, and intact gill tissue was evaluated for associated histopathologic changes.ResultsTwo of seven (29%) E. claviformis from Sevier County, Arkansas, were found to harbor plasmodia on the gill arches which yielded myxospores of a new species of Myxobolus. Myxospores of Myxobolus girardi n. sp. were orbicular to broadly elliptoid, with two ovoid to pyriform polar capsules. Two previous myxozoans found on gill lamellae reported only as Myxobolus sp. "A" and "B" and the new species can readily be distinguished from both of them by size and shape. Myxobolus girardi n. sp. was found to be most genetically similar (99.3%) to Myxobolus stuartae McAllister, Cloutman, Camus, Trauth, Ray, Robison, and Whipps, 2022 which infects the fins of E. claviformis, but at percentages considered to be representative of interspecific variation for the SSU rRNA gene.ConclusionThis is the first gill infecting myxosporean described from E. claviformis and adds to our growing knowledge of these parasites from catostomid fishes.

AB  - In terms of life- menaced contagion, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is known to be one of which and it is truly notable in the contaminated food causing a community health anxiety. However, the occurrence of S. aureus and MRSA in diverse kinds of dairy products have been tested in this study. Samples from: raw milk (unpasteurized) from horse, goat, camel, and cow origins and unpacked cheese were checked for the recovered strains of such bacterium and MRSA. Wholly, MRSA isolates were verified for antimicrobial susceptibility and further characterized by mecA and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. Also, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), Staphylococcus aureus protein A (spa), and Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) were also tested between all positive MRSA isolates in order to discover the virulence factors. Consequently, 70% of the 100 collected dairy products samples were contaminated by S. aureus bacteria and 72.9% of them were defined as MRSA. 9.8% of MRSA isolates contained mecA genes with SCCmec type II (80%) as the most common SCCmec type. Moreover, large number of MRSA isolates were identified as multidrug resistance and 28.6% of MRSA-mecA positive isolates were also carried vancomycin resistance genes (i.e., vanB). Too, spa gene was detected between 9.8% of MRSA isolates but PVL gene was not spotted at all. Additionally, the existing of SEs was variable between MRSA isolates and the most common type was SEH (51%). In general, our results confirmed that raw milk and unpacked cheese in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Riyadh) is a potential vehicle for multidrug resistant MRSA transmission. It is a critical civic health menace and stresses, thus; the need of applying well cleanliness practices is essential. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Nanomaterials design, synthesis, and characterization are ever-expanding approaches toward developing biodevices or neural interfaces to treat neurological diseases. The ability of nanomaterials features to tune neuronal networks ' morphology or functionality is still under study. In this work, we unveil how interfacing mammalian brain cultured neurons and iron oxide nanowires '(NWs) orientation affect neuronal and glial densities and network activity. Iron oxide NWs were synthesized by electrodeposition, fixing the diameter to 100 nm and the length to 1 mu m. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman, and contact angle measurements were performed to characterize the NWs ' morphology, chemical composition, and hydrophilicity. Hippocampal cultures were seeded on NWs devices, and after 14 days, the cell morphology was studied by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Live calcium imaging was performed to study neuronal activity. Using random nanowires (R-NWs), higher neuronal and glial cell densities were obtained compared with the control and vertical nanowires (V-NWs), while using V-NWs, more stellate glial cells were found. R-NWs produced a reduction in neuronal activity, while V-NWs increased the neuronal network activity, possibly due to a higher neuronal maturity and a lower number of GABAergic neurons, respectively. These results highlight the potential of NWs manipulations to design ad hoc regenerative interfaces.

AB  - Exposure to hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insults in newborns can predispose them to severe neurological sequela. The mechanisms underlying HI-related brain injury have not been completely elucidated. The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a composite of structures that protect the brain from the influx of detrimental molecules. Changes in the NVU after HI are important because they could reveal endogenous neuroprotective pathways in the cerebral microvasculature. Furthermore, the time course of changes in the NVU after exposure to HI in the newborn remains to be determined. In this study, we examined the effects of severe HI on the time course of changes in the NVU in neonatal rats. Brains were collected from rats exposed to right carotid artery ligation and 2 h of hypoxia on postnatal day 7 with recovery for 6 or 48 h after exposure to sham treatment (Sham) or HI. The right HI and left hypoxic alone sides of the brains were examined by quantitative immunohistochemistry for vascular density (laminin), pericyte vascular coverage (PDGFR beta), astrocyte vascular coverage (GFAP), and claudin-5 expression in the microvasculature of the cerebral cortex, white matter, and hippocampus. HI-related brain injury in neonatal rats was associated with increases in vascular density in the cortex and hippocampus 48 h after HI as well as neurovascular remodeling, including loss of pericyte coverage in the cortex and increases in claudin-5 in the hippocampus 6 h after HI. Astrocyte coverage was not affected by HI injury. The time course of the responses in the different components of the NVU varied after exposure to HI. There were also differential regional responses in the elements of the NVU in response to HI and hypoxia alone.

AB  - Plant extracts may represent an ecofriendly alternative to chemical fungicides to limit aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination of foods and feeds. Mate (Ilex paraguariensis), rosemary (Romarinus officinalis) and green tea (Camellia sinensis) are well known for their beneficial properties, which are mainly related to their richness in bioactive phenolic compounds. AFB1 production is inhibited, with varying efficiency, by acetone/water extracts from these three plants. At 0.45 mu g dry matter (DM)/mL of culture medium, mate and green tea extracts were able to completely inhibit AFB1 production in Aspergillus flavus, and rosemary extract completely blocked AFB1 biosynthesis at 3.6 mu g DM/mL of culture medium. The anti-AFB1 capacity of the extracts correlated strongly with their phenolic content, but, surprisingly, no such correlation was evident with their antioxidative ability, which is consistent with the ineffectiveness of these extracts against fungal catalase activity. Anti-AFB1 activity correlated more strongly with the radical scavenging capacity of the extracts. This is consistent with the modulation of SOD induced by mate and green tea in Aspergillus flavus. Finally, rutin, a phenolic compound present in the three plants tested in this work, was shown to inhibit AFB1 synthesis and may be responsible for the anti-mycotoxin effect reported herein.

AB  - Background: Current therapeutic agents for AD have limited efficacy and often induce undesirable side effects. Gegen Qinlian tablets (GGQLT) are a well-known clearingheat formula used in clinical treatment of inflammatory diseases. Based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, the strategy of clearing-heat is then compatible with the treatment of AD. However, it remains unknown whether GGQLT can exert neuroprotective effects and alleviate neuroinflammation in AD. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the anti-AD effects of GGQLT and to decipher its intricate mechanism using integrative analyses of network pharmacology, transcriptomic RNA sequencing, and gut microbiota. Methods: The ingredients of GGQLT were analyzed using HPLC-ESI-Q/TOF-MS. The AD model was established by bilateral injection of A beta 1-42 into the intracerebroventricular space of rats. The Morris water maze was used to evaluate the cognitive function of the AD rats. The long-term toxicity of GGQLT in rats was assessed by monitoring their body weights and pathological alterations in the liver and kidney. Reactive astrocytes and microglia were assessed by immunohistochemistry by labeling GFAP and Iba-1. The levels of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were evaluated using ELISA kits, RT-PCR, and Western blot, respectively. The potential anti-AD mechanism was predicted by analyses of RNA-sequencing and network pharmacology. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were utilized to detect the phosphorylation levels of I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa B p65, p38, ERK and JNK. The richness and composition of gut bacterial and fungal microflora were investigated via 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing. Results: Typical ingredients of GGQLT were identified using HPLC-ESI-Q/TOF-MS. GGQLT significantly improved the cognitive function of AD rats by suppressing the activation of microglia and astrocytes, improving glial morphology, and reducing the neuroinflammatory reactions in the hippocampus. RNA-sequencing, network and experimental pharmacological studies demonstrated that GGQLT inhibited the activation of NF-kappa B/MAPK signaling pathways in the hippocampus. GGQLT could also restore abnormal gut bacterial and fungal homeostasis and no longer-term toxicity of GGQLT was observed. Conclusions: Our findings, for the first time, demonstrate GGQLT exhibit anti-AD effects and is worthy of further exploration and development.

AB  - Simple Summary Feed additives based on medicinal plants, such as neem and moringa plant extracts, are used to mitigate rumen methane emissions, but data regarding their effects on lamb meat quality are scarce. This study investigated the effects of oral supplementation of neem and moringa leaf extracts on the carcass quality and meat fatty acid composition of lambs. Neem leaf extracts had no effect on carcass fat and meat fatty acid composition. Whereas, Moringa leaf extract improved the meat fatty acid composition of lambs compared to the monensin treatment. There is an increased interest in the use of medicinal plants as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters and as agents for methane production mitigation. This study investigated the effects of Azadirachta indica and Moringa oleifera feed additives on the carcass and meat quality of lambs. Forty South African Mutton Merino lambs, weighing between 29 and 43 kg, were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (n = 10 lambs/treatment) and fed a basal total mixed ration (TMR) containing soybean meal (17%), yellow maize (28%), Alfalfa hay (20%), Eragrostis curvula hay (22.2%), molasses (6.0%), wheat offal (5%), urea (0.8%) and vitamin premix (0.5%) on a DM basis. The dietary treatments: TMR diet (control); TMR diet with A. indica leaf extract (A. indica leaf extract at a dosage of 50 mg per kg of feed: neem); TMR diet with M. oleifera leaf extract (M. oleifera leaf extract at a dosage of 50 mg per kg DM of feed: moringa); TMR diet with monensin (at a dosage of 50 mg monensin sodium per kg of feed: positive control). After an adaptation period of 10 days to the experimental conditions, the lambs from all treatment groups were fed ad libitum with the experimental diets. The lambs were slaughtered at a live weight of 60-65 kg after a 23 week trial period. The plant extract dietary additives had no significant effects on the carcass characteristics of the lambs. In comparison to monensin, supplementing with moringa leaf extracts resulted in a higher proportion of C18:1n9c (45.0% +/- 0.57 vs. 40.5% +/- 0.80; p < 0.05), total MUFAs (47.3% +/- 0.66 vs. 42.6% +/- 0.87; p < 0.05), and UFA:SFA ratio (1.01 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.03; p < 0.05), which may be beneficial for human health. Our results suggest that natural feed additives, such as A. indica and M. oleifera leaf extracts, can be included in lamb diets without compromising meat fatty acid composition. The negative economic impacts of such technologies on animal production and farm profitability should not be expected.

AB  - Staff of transport companies and abattoirs who handle live cattle and pigs have a high degree of responsibility for animal welfare. However, there are frequent reports of animal welfare concerns regarding the handling of cattle and pigs during transport and slaughter. Continuous training on the correct and proper handling of animals is suitable for strengthening animal welfare. For that purpose, online training modules are developed at the Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany. Experts in this field were asked to rate predetermined action points according to their relevance for animal welfare during transport and slaughter, and their potential for improvement through targeted training in two consecutive survey rounds (=Delphi approach). The rating scale included scores from 0 (='not relevant', respectively 'no possibility of improvement') to 10 (='very relevant', respectively 'very high possibility of improvement'). The experts rated 'Assessment of fitness for transport', 'Unloading at abattoir', 'Handling at stunning' and 'Exsanguination' as the most relevant action points. None of the action points were rated with a median score below 5. The Delphi approach was seen as a valuable method to include external expertise to select the most relevant action points for the online training modules.
   To improve animal welfare for cattle and pigs during transport and at slaughter, online training modules for all staff including employees in the lairage pen, the slaughter line as well as animal welfare officers are developed at Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany. Before starting the development of these modules, an expert elicitation survey using a modified Delphi approach was performed to identify action points considered most relevant for animal welfare during transport and slaughter, and as having the potential for improvement through training. In total, 49 participating experts rated predetermined action points of each step in the transport and slaughter process in two survey rounds. The rating scale included numbers 0 (='not relevant', respectively 'no possibility of improvement') to 10 (='very relevant', respectively 'very high possibility of improvement'). None of the action points were rated with a median score of less than 5. Assessment of fitness for transport, unloading at the abattoir, handling at stunning and exsanguination were amongst the highest rated action points, and were therefore selected to develop online training modules. The Delphi approach was seen as a valuable method to include external expertise to select the most relevant action points for the development of online training modules.

AB  - The direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC) is a new-type energy conversion device that converts chemical energy stored in solid carbon into electricity efficiently with environmental benignity and low cost for abundant carbon resources, which reveals upward impetus recently. To accelerate the practical application of DC-SOFC, here, we report a high-performance La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte-supported tubular DC-SOFC stack for portable applications, in which Ag- Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (Ag-GDC) is used as symmetrical electrodes and camellia oleifera shell char as fuel. The performance of the 3-cell-stack stands out, with an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 3.18 V, an output power of 2.65 W, and a maximum volumetric power density of 605 mW cm-3 at 800 degrees C. In addition, the stack can survive for 5.82 and 1.12 h under the constant discharging currents of 200 and 800 mA, respectively, exhibiting discharge capacities of 3492 and 2688 mA h. Furthermore, adopting the external anode design can sextuple the fuel load and lead to remarkably improved output performance, discharge time, and discharge capacity of the stack (3.71 W, 9.2 h, 22080 mA h). The above results indicate that LSGM electrolyte-supported tubular DC-SOFC stacks show great potential for developing into high-performing, efficient, and environmentally friendly portable power sources for distributed applications.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public and animal health challenge with significant economic consequences. Cartilage degradation plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of degenerative joint diseases, such as OA. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have become increasingly popular in the field of cartilage regeneration due to their promising results. The objective of this preclinical study was to evaluate the regenerative effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the repair of knee cartilage defects using a porcine model. Seven healthy LYD breed white pigs, aged 9-10 weeks and weighing approximately 20 & PLUSMN; 3 kg, were used in the experimental protocol. Full-thickness defects measuring 8 mm in diameter and 5 mm in depth were induced in the lateral femoral condyle of the posterior limbs in both knee joints using a sterile puncture technique while the knee was maximally flexed. Following a 1-week induction phase, the pig treatment groups received a 0.3 million/kg MSC transplant into the damaged knee region, while the placebo group received a control solution as a treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), visual macroscopic examination, histological analysis, and cytokine concentration analysis were used to assess cartilage regeneration. The findings revealed that human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) were more effective in repairing cartilage than pig umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (pUCMSCs). These results suggest that MSC-based treatments hold promise as a treatment option for cartilage repair, which aid in the treatment of OA. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are required to fully demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these therapies in both animals and humans.

AB  - At CA1 & RARR;subiculum synapses, alternatively spliced neurexin-1 (Nrxn1(SS4+)) and neurexin-3 (Nrxn3(SS4+)) enhance NMDA-receptors and suppress AMPA-receptors, respectively, without affecting synapse formation. Nrxn1(SS4+) and Nrxn3(SS4+) act by binding to secreted cerebellin-2 (Cbln2) that in turn activates postsynaptic GluD1 receptors. Whether neurexin-Cbln2-GluD1 signaling has additional functions besides regulating NMDA- and AMPA-receptors, and whether such signaling performs similar roles at other synapses, however, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate using constitutive Cbln2 deletions in mice that at CA1 & RARR;subiculum synapses, Cbln2 performs no additional developmental roles besides regulating AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Moreover, low-level expression of functionally redundant Cbln1 did not compensate for a possible synapse-formation function of Cbln2 at CA1 & RARR;subiculum synapses. In exploring the generality of these findings, we examined the prefrontal cortex where Cbln2 was recently implicated in spinogenesis, and the cerebellum where Cbln1 is known to regulate parallel-fiber synapses. In the prefrontal cortex, Nrxn1(SS4+)-Cbln2 signaling selectively controlled NMDA-receptors without affecting spine or synapse numbers, whereas Nrxn3(SS4+)-Cbln2 signaling had no apparent role. In the cerebellum, conversely, Nrxn3(SS4+)-Cbln1 signaling regulated AMPA-receptors, whereas now Nrxn1(SS4+)-Cbln1 signaling had no manifest effect. Thus, Nrxn1(SS4+)- and Nrxn3(SS4+)-Cbln1/2 signaling complexes differentially control NMDA- and AMPA-receptors in different synapses in diverse neural circuits without regulating synapse or spine formation.

AB  - The chemical composition, antioxidant properties, and sensory aspects of sponge cakes with the addition of flours from edible insects (buffalo worm, cricket, and mealworm) were evaluated. The addition of edible-insect flours increased the protein, fat, and dietary fiber content in all cases. The utilization of edible insects demonstrated a notable augmentation in the phenolic compounds (especially protocatechuic acid and protocatechuic aldehyde, and syringic, ferulic, and sinapic acids). This resulted in an increase in the antioxidant activity measured against the ABTS radical cation, the DPPH radical, and ferric ions. The antioxidant potential, assessed by four different methods, unequivocally confirmed that the aforementioned polyphenolic compounds found in edible insects provide significant radical-scavenging and antioxidant activity in sponge cakes containing them. The polyunsaturated fatty acid contents were significantly lower in cakes with insect flour compared to the standard wheat cakes. Products and raw materials exhibited high values of the n - 6/n - 3 ratio, which may be associated with negative health effects, with a high oleic acid content. The amino acid score (AAS) for the essential amino acids exceeded 100% for all obtained products. The sponge cakes were accepted by consumers and the taste was the most important predictor for overall acceptability, whereas the structure and appearance had less impact.

AB  - Simple Summary: Melatonin is a known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory regime, while in sheep it is broadly used to accelerate the onset of the breeding season. Our recent study showed that melatonin administration during pregnancy in heat-stressed ewes improved fertility rate and number of lambs born per ewe, the redox status of the maternal organism and the produced milk quantity until weaning. In this study, we present the impact of melatonin administration in stressed ewes during pregnancy considering: (a) humoral response of both maternal organism and offspring during the first two days after parturition, (b) chemical composition and antioxidant parameters of colostrum and milk until weaning and (c) redox status of the offspring until weaning. The results indicated that melatonin improved the redox status of the offspring and the quality of colostrum. Moreover, melatonin could be administered as immune-modulatory regime, apart from antioxidant, in prenatally stressed offspring in order to cope with the crucial first days of their life, as the humoral response results suggested.In this study, the effects of melatonin treatment on growth, redox status and immunity in prenatally stressed newborn lambs were evaluated. Thirty-seven newborn lambs were allocated into two groups (melatonin-MEL and control-CON), based on whether their mothers were treated with melatonin implants or not, respectively. All pregnant ewes were exposed to heat stress. The body weight of lambs was recorded at birth (L0), and then on days 15 (L15) and 40 (L40). Redox biomarkers [total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)] were assayed in blood samples collected from lambs on days L0, L1, L2, L5, L10 and L40. Chemical analysis and antioxidant capacity were evaluated in colostrum and milk samples collected at the same time points with blood samples. Cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-?) and immunoglobulin (IgG) were assayed in blood and colostrum samples collected from ewes on days L0 and L1, and in lambs' blood on days L0, L1 and L2. The results revealed that body weight gain of newborn lambs did not differ between the two groups (p > 0.05). Better redox status was found in MEL lambs until L2, as well as higher antioxidant capacity in the colostrum of MEL ewes compared to CON ones on day L0 (p < 0.05). In MEL ewes' colostrum, higher protein content was measured on day L0 and higher fat content on L1 compared to CON group (p < 0.05). The highest level of IL-6 was found in MEL ewes on L1, with a concomitant increase of IL-10 level in MEL lambs in comparison to CON lambs on L2. Moreover, CON colostrum resulted in a higher level of IL-10 within time, coupled with an increased level of IgG found in lambs' plasma on L2 (p = 0.04). This study indicated that melatonin could be administered as antioxidant and immune-modulatory regime in prenatally stressed offspring in order to cope with the crucial first days of their life. This effect of melatonin was also amplified by crosstalk between IL-6, IL-10 and IgG production, resulting in an improved quality of produced milk.

AB  - Background: Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs in 99% of all cases and can be influenced by air pollution such as diesel emissions and more recently, an iron oxide particle, magnetite, detected in the brains of AD patients. However, a mechanistic link between air pollutants and AD development remains elusive. Aim: To study the development of AD -relevant pathological effects induced by air pollutant particle exposures and their mechanistic links, in wild-type and AD-predisposed models. Methods: C57BL/6 (n = 37) and APP/PS1 transgenic (n = 38) mice (age 13 weeks) were exposed to model pollutant iron-based particle (Fe0-Fe3O4, dTEM = 493 +/- 133 nm), hydrocarbon-based diesel combustion particle (43 +/- 9 nm) and magnetite (Fe3O4, 153 +/- 43 nm) particles (66 mu g/20 mu L/third day) for 4 months, and were assessed for behavioural changes, neuronal cell loss, amyloid-beta (A beta) plaque, immune response and oxidative stress-biomarkers. Neuroblastoma SHSY5Y (differentiated) cells were exposed to the particles (100 mu g/ml) for 24 h, with assessments on immune response biomarkers and reactive oxygen species generation. Results: Pollutant particle-exposure led to increased anxiety and stress levels in wild-type mice and short-term memory impairment in AD-prone mice. Neuronal cell loss was shown in the hippocampal and somatosensory cortex, with increased detection of A beta plaque, the latter only in the AD-predisposed mice, with the wild-type not genetically disposed to form the plaque. The particle exposures however, increased AD -relevant immune system responses, including inflammation, in both strains of mice. Exposures also stimulated oxidative stress, although only observed in wild-type mice. The in vitro studies complemented the immune response and oxidative stress observations. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the mechanistic links between inflammation and oxidative stress to pollutant particle-induced AD pathologies, with magnetite apparently inducing the most pathological effects. No exacerbation of the effects was observed in the AD-predisposed model when compared to the wild-type, indicating a particle-induced neurodegeneration that is independent of disease state.

AB  - Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are essential for host-seeking behaviors in herbivorous and predatory insects. However, limited studies have examined differences in the OBP and CSP profiles between herbivores and predators. Mirid bugs, which ancestrally were predatory, provide an ideal model to investigate these differences because some of mirid species have evolved to develop herbivorous capacities. In this study, we compared compared OBP and CSP profiles among transcriptome analysis of one zoophytophagous and four phytozoophagous mirid bugs, identifying a total of 146 OBPs and 69 CSPs. The number of OBPs was similar between phytozoophagous (26 in Adelphocoris fasciaticollis, 29 in Adelphocoris lineolatus, 28 in Apolygus lucorum, and 32 in Adelphocoris suturalis) and zoophytophagous (31 in Nesidiocoris tenuis) species. However, the zoophytophagous specie had more CSPs than the phytozoophagous species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two types of OBPs in mirid bugs, with classic OBPs being more abundant than plus-C OBPs. Transcriptome revealed that the number of OBPs with high expressions was higher in the phytozoophagous species (18) than in the zoophytophagous species (14). By contrast, more CSPs (10) exhibited high expressions in the zoophytophagous mirid bug compared with those in the phytozoophagous species (<= 7). These results suggest that differences in the number and expression levels of OBPs and CSPs between zoophytophagous and phytozoophagous mirid bugs affect host-selection processes. In conclusion, the findings provide a basis for developing novel pest management strategies, including the use of natural enemies or behavioral regulation of mirid bugs through OBP and CSP gene manipulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The western fl ower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a significant pest in horticulture and ornamental agriculture. While exogenous calcium (Ca) has been shown to confer plant immune responses against thrips, the detailed mechanisms of this interaction remain to be elucidated for improved thrips management strategies. This study aimed to assess the impact of exogenous Ca on WFT feeding behavior and to explore its role in enhancing the defense mechanisms of kidney bean plants against WFT attacks. We compared WFT feeding preferences and efficiency on kidney bean plants treated with H2O or Ca, and examined whether exogenous Ca improves plant defense responses to thrips attack. RESULTS: WFT exhibited less preference for feeding on Ca-treated plants over H2O-treated ones. The total duration of WFT's long-ingestion probes was significantly fi cantly reduced on Ca-treated plants, indicating impaired feeding efficiency. Furthermore, WFT infestation activated both jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways in kidney bean plants, and exogenous Ca application led to elevated levels of endogenous Ca2+ and CaM, up-regulation of genes associated with JA and SA pathways (LOX, LOX , AOS, , PAL, and beta-1,3- glucanase ), and increased accumulation of JA, SA, flavonoids, and alkaloids. CONCLUSION: Our fi ndings demonstrate that the application of exogenous Ca enhances endogenous Ca2+, JA, and SA signaling pathways in kidney bean plants. This enhancement results in an up-regulation of the biosynthesis of fl avonoid and alkaloid, thereby equipping the plants with an enhanced defense against WFT infestation.

AB  - This work focused on investigating the effect of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases 12 (ADAM12) on colorectal cancer devel-opment. ADAM12 levels within colorectal cancer samples were analyzed by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, altogether 55 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled to detect ADAM12 expression. ADAM12 overexpression or knock-down was transfected into colorectal cancer cells. Thereafter, this work examined colorectal cancer cell viability through Cell Count -ing Kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell clone forming assays. Meanwhile, nude mice were utilized for in vivo analysis. Transwell assays were conducted for detecting migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. In addition, mRN and protein expression was analyzed through qRT-PCR, Western blotting (WB) together with IHC staining. As a result, ADAM12 and YAP1 expression increased among colorectal cancer cases, and it indicated the dismal prog-nostic outcome of patients. Furthermore, ADAM12 promoted colorectal cancer cell growth, migration, invasion along with in vivo growth. ADAM12 suppressed p-MST1/MST1, p-LATS1/ LATS1 together with p-YAP1 protein levels within colorectal cancer cells. ADAM12 increased YAP1 and TAZ protein levels as well as CTGF, Cyr61, and Birc5 mRNA expression in colorectal cancer cells. YAP1 inhibitor administration counteracted ADAM12's function in promoting colorectal cancer cell growth, migration, invasion, and increasing CTGF, Cyr61, and Birc5 expression. Implications: Our study indicates that ADAM12 facilitates colo-rectal cancer progression through suppressing Hippo pathway activity, and that ADAM12 is the candidate therapeutic target and biomarker for patients with colorectal cancer.

AB  - Enhancers are non-coding DNA regions that facilitate gene transcription, with a specialized subset, super-enhancers, known to exert exceptionally strong transcriptional activation effects. Super-enhancers have been implicated in oncogenesis, and their identification is achievable through histone mark chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing data using existing analytical tools. However, conventional super-enhancer detection methodologies often do not accurately reflect actual gene expression levels, and the large volume of identified super-enhancers complicates comprehensive analysis. To address these limitations, we developed the super-enhancer to gene links (SE-to-gene Links) analysis, a platform named "SEgene" which incorporates the peak-to-gene links approach-a statistical method designed to reveal correlations between genes and peak regions (https://github.com/hamamoto-lab/SEgene). This platform enables a targeted evaluation of super-enhancer regions in relation to gene expression, facilitating the identification of super-enhancers that are functionally linked to transcriptional activity. Here, we demonstrate the application of SE-to-gene Links analysis to public datasets, confirming its efficacy in accurately detecting super-enhancers and identifying functionally associated genes. Additionally, SE-to-gene Links analysis identified ERBB2 as a significant gene of interest in the lung adenocarcinoma dataset from the National Cancer Center Japan cohort, suggesting a potential impact across multiple patient samples. Thus, the SE-to-gene Links analysis provides an analytical tool for evaluating super-enhancers as potential therapeutic targets, supporting the identification of clinically significant super-enhancer regions and their functionally associated genes.

AB  - The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen with various hosts, including pigs, which act as reservoirs. In industrialized countries, sporadic cases caused by genotype 3, contracted by ingesting contaminated uncooked or undercooked meat, have been reported. However, in developing countries, HEV infection is mainly dominated by genotype 2 and often associated with poor hygiene conditions and drinking water supplies. HEV infection and its circulation in domestic fauna in West Africa are poorly documented. This study aimed to assess the presence of HEV in pork sold in Saint-Louis, Senegal. Meat products (250 g samples, n = 74) were purchased in August 2022 from three locations. Then, 2 g/sample was minced to extract total nucleic acids using the Purelink (TM) Viral DNA/RNA kit. RT-PCR reactions were performed using the One-Taq (TM) One-Step RT-PCR kit targeting the HEV ORF2 genomic region. The products obtained were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. Of a total of 74 samples, divided into pork meat (n = 65) and pork liver (n = 9), 5.4% (n = 4) tested positive for HEV. In both cases, two samples were positive, representing a rate of 3.1% and 22.2% for meat and pork liver, respectively. All new viral sequences were obtained from a monophyletic group within HEV genotype 3. This study is the first to report the presence of HEV in pork sold in Senegal and the results reveal a potential circulation of HEV in the pig population. The high proportion of contamination in the pork liver samples highlights a major risk associated with their consumption.

AB  - Background Hair characterization is critical for determining animal individuality throughout life. This study aimed to assess the morphological features of dromedary camel hair in relation to age. Materials and methods Hair samples were obtained from the camel humps of 30 dromedary camels separated into three groups: G1 (n:10) aged one-year, G2 (n:10) aged 3-5 years, and G3 (n:10) at the age of 8-10 years. The hair was examined using light microscopy, SEM, and SEM-EDX. Results The Maghrebi camel had varied medulla patterns and structures across the ages. In the G1 group 75% had continuous medulla patterns and amorphous medulla structures, compared to 70% in G2, and 90% in G3. The medulla index increased with age, rising from 0.3 to 0.77%. The shaft width grew in size from G1 to G2, then fell to approximately one-third of the G2 size at G3. The cortex and cuticle widths were also determined by age, and they increased in the G1 compared to G3 camels. The shape of the cuticle scales in G1 camels was wavy, like mountain tops with irregular edges, within G2 camels the scales were particularly long, oval-shaped scales with smooth, wavy borders. The scales of the older G3 camels were quite long and rectangular. SEM-EDX spectra recognized carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, calcium, aluminum, silicon, and potassium at the medulla and cortex. Sulfur levels were highest in the G2 samples but lowest in the G1 samples. Conclusion The dromedary camel's hair structure and mineral content, particularly carbon and nitrogen, differed as camels aged.

AB  - BACKGROUND Plant defenses activated by European zoophytophagous predators trigger behavioral responses in arthropods, benefiting pest management. However, repellence or attraction of pests and beneficial insects seems to be species-specific. In the neotropical region, the mirid predator Macrolophus basicornis has proved to be a promising biological control agent of important tomato pests; nevertheless, the benefits of its phytophagous behavior have never been explored. Therefore, we investigated if M. basicornis phytophagy activates tomato plant defenses and the consequences for herbivores and natural enemies. RESULTS Regardless of the induction period of M. basicornis on tomato plants, Tuta absoluta females showed no preference for the odors emitted by induced or control plants. However, Tuta absoluta oviposited less on plants induced by M. basicornis for 72 h than on control plants. In contrast, induced plants repelled Bemisia tabaci females, and the number of eggs laid was reduced. Although females of Trichogramma pretiosum showed no preference between mirid-induced or control plants, we observed high attraction of the parasitoid Encarsia inaron and conspecifics to plants induced by M. basicornis. While the mirid-induced plants down-regulated the expression of genes involving the salicylic acid (SA) pathway over time, the genes related to the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway were up-regulated, increasing emissions of fatty-acid derivatives and terpenes, which might have influenced the arthropods' host/prey choices. CONCLUSION Based on both the molecular and behavioral findings, our results indicated that in addition to predation, M. basicornis benefits tomato plant resistance indirectly through its phytophagy. This study is a starting point to pave the way for a novel and sustainable pest-management strategy in the neotropical region. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - PurposeMRI-based whole-brain manual segmentation methods are considered the gold standard for brain volumetric analysis, but are time-consuming and prone to human error. Automated segmentation tools like FreeSurfer can identify differences in brain volumes between healthy and non-healthy individuals. Deep-learning-based segmentation tools, such as FastSurfer, offer faster processing times, but further validation is needed, particularly in pediatric cases. This study aims to compare FastSurfer with FreeSurfer in a pediatric cohort and compare the volume estimates with previously published reference values.MethodsA multicenter cohort of 448 subjects aged 4-18 years from three centers was used to compare FastSurfer with FreeSurfer. Validation metrics, including the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), relative volume differences (RVD), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), were computed. Hemispheric asymmetries were assessed by calculating a hemispheric asymmetry index.FindingsThe segmentation methods demonstrated high agreement, with a mean DSC across subjects and regions of interest of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.79; 0.95), RVD of 0.3% (95% CI: -7.6%; 7.4%), and ICC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.52; 0.94). After a visual inspection, which led to the exclusion of 12 subjects with segmentation errors, growth charts for relative volume estimates of 15 anatomical brain regions were generated, revealing varying growth patterns across ages. A potential clinical application is illustrated by plotting a patient's data on these growth charts, showing a specific atrophy pattern.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the use of FastSurfer in volumetric analysis of a pediatric population. Our findings suggest that FastSurfer is a reliable segmentation tool for pediatric data and is particularly promising for clinical practice due to its high accuracy despite rapid processing times. The morphometric data, growth charts, and code are publicly accessible.

AB  - The sex difference that females are more vulnerable to depression than males has been recently replicated in an animal model of early-life stress (ES) called the limited bedding and nesting material (LBN) paradigm. Adopting this animal model, we have previously examined the effects of ES on monoamine transporter (MATs) expression in stress-related regions in adult female mice, and the reversal effects of a novel multimodal antidepressant, vortioxetine. In this study, replacing vortioxetine with a classical antidepressant, fluoxetine, we aimed to replicate the ES effects in adult female mice and to elucidate the commonality and differences between fluoxetine and vortioxetine. We found that systemic 30-day treatment with fluoxetine successfully reversed ES-induced depression-like behaviors (especially sucrose preference) in adult female mice. At the molecular level, we largely replicated the ES effects, such as reduced serotonin transporter (SERT) expression in the amygdala and increased norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. Similar reversal effects of fluoxetine and vortioxetine were observed, including SERT in the amygdala and NET in the mPFC, whereas different reversal effects were observed for NET in the hippocampus and vesicular monoamine transporters expression in the nucleus accumbens. Overall, these results demonstrate the validity of the LBN paradigm to induce depression-like behaviors in female mice, highlight the involvement of regionspecific MATs in ES-induced depression-like behaviors, and provide insights for further investigation of neurobiological mechanisms, treatment, and prevention associated with depression in women.

AB  - Progesterone (P4) and interferon tau (IFNT) are important for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in ruminants. Agmatine and polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) have important roles in the survival, growth, and development of mammalian conceptuses. This study tested the hypothesis that P4 and/or IFNT stimulate the expression of genes and proteins involved in the metabolism and transport of polyamines in the ovine endometrium. Rambouillet ewes (n = 24) were surgically fitted with intrauterine catheters on Day 7 of the estrous cycle. They received daily intramuscular injections of 50 mg P4 in corn oil vehicle and/or 75-mg progesterone receptor antagonist (RU486) in corn oil vehicle from Days 8-15, and twice daily intrauterine injections (25 mu g/uterine horn/day) of either control serum proteins (CX) or IFNT from Days 11-15, resulting in four treatment groups: (i) P4 + CX; (ii) P4 + IFNT; (iii) RU486 + P4 + CX; or (iv) RU486 + P4 + IFNT. On Day 16, ewes were hysterectomized. The total amounts of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, and putrescine in uterine flushings were affected (P < 0.05) by P4 and/or IFNT. P4 increased endometrial expression of SLC22A2 (P < 0.01) and SLC22A3 (P < 0.05) mRNAs. IFNT affected endometrial expression of MAT2B (P < 0.001), SAT1 (P < 0.01), and SMOX (P < 0.05) mRNAs, independent of P4. IFNT increased the abundance of SRM protein in uterine luminal (LE), superficial glandular (sGE), and glandular epithelia (GE), as well as MAT2B protein in uterine LE and sGE. These results indicate that P4 and IFNT act synergistically to regulate the expression of key genes required for cell-specific metabolism and transport of polyamines in the ovine endometrium during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy.
   Summary Sentence Progesterone and interferon tau regulate expression of mRNAs and proteins involved in the metabolism and transport of polyamines in endometria of sheep during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy.

AB  - Viral infections pose major economic and public health challenges worldwide, with vaccines as a critical tool for prevention. Synonymous recoding of viral genes through codon and codon-pair deoptimization offers a promising approach to design live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) by reducing viral fitness without altering protein sequences. This strategy has been successfully applied to develop vaccines for a range of pathogens affecting human and livestock. To support this approach, we developed CocoVax, the first web server dedicated to codon and codon-pair deoptimization for LAV design. CocoVax features four modules, Virus Database, Gene Recoder, Sequence Evaluator, and Reference Library, guiding users through the entire vaccine development process. With its intuitive interface, CocoVax enables rapid generation of vaccine candidates using only a pathogen's gene sequence, providing a valuable resource for researchers in virology and vaccine development. CocoVax is freely accessible at https://comics.med.sustech.edu.cn/cocovax with no login required.

AB  - The forkhead transcription factor Foxl2 plays a major role in ovarian development and function in mice and fish, and acts as a female sex-determining gene in goat. Its functional role in the sex determination and gonadal dif-ferentiation has not yet been investigated in reptiles. Here, we characterized Foxl2 gene in Chinese soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis, exhibiting ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes. Foxl2 exhibited a female-specific embryonic expression pattern throughout the critical sex determination periods in P. sinensis. The expression of Foxl2 was induced at early stage in ZZ embryonic gonads that were feminized by estrogen treatment. Most importantly, Foxl2 knockdown in ZW embryos by RNA interference resulted in female-to-male sex reversal, characterized by obvious masculinization of gonads, significant up-regulation of testicular markers Dmrt1 and Sox9, and remark-able down-regulation of ovarian regulator Cyp19a1. Conversely, gain-of-function study showed that over -expression of Foxl2 in ZZ embryos led to largely feminized genetic males, production of Cyp19a1, and a decline in Dmrt1 and Sox9. These findings demonstrate that Foxl2 is both necessary and sufficient to initiate ovarian dif-ferentiation in P. sinensis, thereby acting as a key upstream regulator of the female pathway in a reptilian species.

AB  - Tissue engineering is a science that uses the combination of scaffolds, cells, and active biomolecules to make tissue in order to restore or maintain its function and improve the damaged tissue or even an organ in the laboratory. The purpose of this research was to study the characteristics and biocompatibility of decellularized sheep tracheal scaffolds and also to investigate the differentiation of Adipose-derived stem cells (AD-MSCs) into tracheal cells. After the decellularization of sheep tracheas through the detergent-enzyme method, histological evaluations, measurement of biochemical factors, measurement of DNA amount, and photographing the ultra-structure of the samples by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), they were also evaluated mechanically. Further, In order to check the viability and adhesion of stem cells to the decellularized scaffolds, adipose mesenchymal stem cells were cultured on the scaffolds, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-mide (MTT) assay was performed. The expression analysis of the intended genes for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into tracheal cells was evaluated by the real-time PCR method. These results show that the prepared scaffolds are an ideal model for engineering applications, have high biocompatibility, and that the tracheal scaffold provides a suitable environment for the differentiation of ADMSCs. This review provides a basis for future research on tracheal decellularization scaffolds, serves as a suitable model for organ regeneration, and paves the way for their use in clinical medicine.

AB  - The metabolic demands of neuronal activity are both temporally and spatially dynamic, and neurons are particularly sensitive to disruptions in fuel and oxygen supply. Glucose is considered an obligate fuel for supporting brain metabolism. Although alternative fuels are often available, the extent of their contribution to central carbon metabolism remains debated. Differential fuel metabolism likely depends on cell type, location, and activity state, complicating its study. While biosensors provide excellent spatial and temporal information, they are limited to observations of only a few metabolites. On the other hand, mass spectrometry is rich in chemical information, but traditionally relies on cell culture or homogenized tissue samples. Here, we use mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to focus on the fuel metabolism of the dentate granule cell (DGC) layer in murine hippocampal slices. Using stable isotopes, we explore labeling dynamics at baseline, as well as in response to brief stimulation or fuel competition. We find that at rest, glucose is the predominant fuel metabolized through glycolysis, with little to no measurable contribution from glycerol or fructose. However, lactate/pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta HB), octanoate, and glutamine can contribute to TCA metabolism to varying degrees. In response to brief depolarization with 50 mM KCl, glucose metabolism was preferentially increased relative to the metabolism of alternative fuels. With an increased supply of alternative fuels, both lactate/pyruvate and beta HB can outcompete glucose for TCA cycle entry. While lactate/pyruvate modestly reduced glucose contribution to glycolysis, beta HB caused little change in glycolysis. This approach achieves broad metabolite coverage from a spatially defined region of physiological tissue, in which metabolic states are rapidly preserved following experimental manipulation. Using this powerful methodology, we investigated metabolism within the dentate gyrus not only at rest, but also in response to the energetic demand of activation, and in states of fuel competition.

AB  - Fluoride (F), an essential trace element, plays a significant role in the skeletal systems of teeth and bone. However, drinking water with a high level of fluoride (more than 1.5 ppm) would cause fluorosis, seriously damaging the teeth and bone structures. In central Vietnam, there is a village called no smile village, where local people highly drink fluoride-contaminated groundwater. Finding an efficient fluoride removal solution with an acceptable cost is required. In this work, highly porous carbonaceous bone-char (Bc) materials were synthesized by calcination of various sources of bones (fish, chicken, pig, and cow) at 600 degrees C for removing fluoride in drinking water. We investigated the effects of the precursors on synthesized materials' characteristics and their efficiency of fluoride removal. As a result, the Bc materials exhibit interesting characteristics via high specific surface area (up to 211.8 m2/g, and the abundance of micro-mesoporous, and hydroxyapatite structures formed during the calcination process. In addition, Bc materials illustrated an outstanding fluoride adsorption performance with a removal efficiency of more than 98 %. Moreover, the pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were applied to determine the fluoride adsorption behaviors of the prepared Bc. The studied results promoted a potential and sustainability pathway for utilizing low-cost food waste synthesizing green adsorbent to remove fluoride in drinking water without using toxicity chemical approaches.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the functional interaction between the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems of the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), the ventral hippocampus (VH), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in nicotine-induced anxiogenic-like behaviors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level changes were measured in the targeted brain areas following the drug treatments. The percentage of time spent in the open arm (% OAT) and open arm entry (% OAE) were calculated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to measure anxiety-related behaviors in adult male Wistar rats. Systemic administration of nicotine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg induced an anxiogenic-like response associated with decreased BDNF levels in the hippocampus and the PFC. Intra-MD microinjection of apomorphine (0.1-0.3 mu g/rat) induced an anxiogenic-like response, while apomorphine inhibited nicotine-induced anxiogenic-like behaviors associated with increased hippocampal and PFC BDNF expression levels. Interestingly, the blockade of the VH or the PFC NMDA receptors via the microinjection of D-AP5 (0.3-0.5 mu g/rat) into the targeted sites reversed the inhibitory effect of apomorphine (0.5 mu g/rat, intra-MD) on the nicotine response and led to the decrease of BDNF levels in the hippocampus and the PFC. Also, the microinjection of a higher dose of D-AP5 (0.5 mu g/rat, intra-PFC) alone produced an anxiogenic effect. These findings suggest that the functional interaction between the MD dopaminergic D1/D2-like and the VH/PFC glutamatergic NMDA receptors may be partially involved in the anxiogenic-like effects of nicotine, likely via the alteration of BDNF levels in the hippocampus and the PFC.

AB  - Lipids are components of cytomembranes that are involved in various biochemical processes. High-altitude hypoxic environments not only affect the body 's energy metabolism, but these environments can also cause abnormal lipid metabolism involved in the hypoxia-induced cognitive impairment. Thus, comprehensive lipidomic profiling of the brain tissue is an essential step toward understanding the mechanism of cognitive impairment induced by hypoxic exposure. In the present study, mice showed reduced new-object recognition and spatial memory when exposed to hypobaric hypoxia for 1 day. Histomorphological staining revealed significant morphological and structural damage to the hippocampal tissue, along with prolonged exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. Dynamic lipidomics of the mouse hippocampus showed a significant shift in both the type and distribution of phospholipids, as verified by spatial lipid mapping. (sic) Collectively, a diverse and dynamic lipid composition in mice hippocampus was uncovered, which deepens our understanding of biochemical changes during sustained hypoxic exposure and could provide new insights into the cognitive decline induced by high-altitude hypoxia exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary Current protocols for gilts recommend the deposit of two/three semen doses (2-4 x 10(9) sperm/dose) by cervical artificial insemination (CAI), 12-24 h after estrus detection. If ovulation were predictable, gilts could be bred only once using fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). Using a specific catheter makes the postcervical deposition of semen possible (PCAI). This work explored the use of combining FTAI-PCAI with buserelin in gilts. In the control group (C; n = 240), gilts were inseminated twice (8 and 12 h from estrus onset). Gilts in the treatment group (T; n = 226) received buserelin (10 mu g, intramuscular) 120 h after altrenogest treatment (18 d) and one single PCAI 30-33 h after buserelin administration. No significant differences were found in reproductive and production performance between groups (p > 0.05). Piglets' birth weight was greater in the T group (p < 0.001). Estrus duration was significantly shorter in the T group (p < 0.001). Delivery batch length significantly differed depending on the season (p < 0.05); both groups only differed significantly in spring (p = 0.018), with a shorter duration in the T group. This new FTAI-PCAI protocol with buserelin is recommended in gilts, helping with optimization of genetic diffusion, boars, and semen doses. Current protocols for gilts recommend the deposit of multiple semen doses in the cervix each 12-24 h after estrus detection. Our objectives were: (1) to determine the effect of buserelin and a single fixed-time artificial insemination using the new post-cervical artificial insemination technique (FTAI-PCAI) on reproductive and productive performance in gilts, and (2) to compare this protocol with conventional estrus detection and double PCAI without hormonal induction. In the control group (C; n = 240), gilts were inseminated twice (8 and 12 h from estrus onset). Gilts in the treatment group (T; n = 226) received buserelin (10 mu g, intramuscular) 120 h after altrenogest treatment (18 d) and one single PCAI 30-33 h after buserelin administration. The groups did not differ in reproductive and production performance (p > 0.05). The T group showed greater piglet birth weight and shorter estrus duration (p < 0.001). Delivery batch length differed significantly depending on the season (p < 0.05); the shortest length corresponded to autumn. Both groups only differed significantly in spring (p = 0.018), with a shorter length in the T group. This new FTAI-PCAI protocol with buserelin is recommended in gilts, helping with optimization of genetic diffusion, boars, and semen doses.

AB  - The meniscus possesses low self-healing properties. A perfect regenerative technique for this tissue has not yet been developed. This work aims to evaluate the role of hypoxia in meniscal development in vitro. Menisci from neonatal pigs (day 0) were harvested and cultured under two different atmospheric conditions: hypoxia (1% O-2) and normoxia (21% O-2) for up to 14 days. Samples were analysed at 0, 7 and 14 days by histochemical (Safranin-O staining), immunofluorescence and RT-PCR (in both methods for SOX-9, HIF-1 alpha, collagen I and II), and biochemical (DNA, GAGs, DNA/GAGs ratio) techniques to record any possible differences in the maturation of meniscal cells. Safranin-O staining showed increments in matrix deposition and round-shape "fibro-chondrocytic" cells in hypoxia-cultured menisci compared with controls under normal atmospheric conditions. The same maturation shifting was observed by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR analysis: SOX-9 and collagen II increased from day zero up to 14 days under a hypoxic environment. An increment of DNA/GAGs ratio typical of mature meniscal tissue (characterized by fewer cells and more GAGs) was observed by biochemical analysis. This study shows that hypoxia can be considered as a booster to achieve meniscal cell maturation, and opens new opportunities in the field of meniscus tissue engineering.

TI  - Antioxidant Carbon Dots Nanozymes Alleviate Stress-induced Depression by Modulating Gut Microbiota

AB  - Depression is a debilitating mental illness that severely threatens millions of individuals and public health. Because of the multifactorial etiologies, there is currently no cure for depression; thus, it is urgently imperative to find alternative antidepressants and strategies. Growing evidence underscores the prominent role of oxidative stress as key pathological hallmarks of depression, making oxidative stress a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we report a N-doped carbon dot nanozyme (CDzyme) with excellent antioxidant capacity for treating depression by remodeling redox homeostasis and gut microbiota. The CDzymes prepared via microwave-assisted fast polymerization of histidine and glucose exhibit superior biocompatibility. Benefiting from the unique structure, CDzymes can provide abundant electrons, hydrogen atoms, and protons for reducing reactions, as well as catalytic sites to mimic redox enzymes. These mechanisms collaborating endow CDzymes with broad-spectrum antioxidant capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (center dot OH, O-2 -center dot, H2O2, ONOO-), and oxygen/nitrogen centered free radicals. A depression animal model was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CDzymes from the behavioral, physiological, and biochemical index and intestinal flora assessments. CDzymes can remarkably improve depression-like behaviors and key neurotransmitters produced in hippocampus tissues and restore the gut microbiota compositions and the amino acid metabolic functions, proving the potential in treating depression through the intestinal-brain axis system. This study will facilitate the development of intestinal flora dysbiosis nanomedicines and treatment strategies for depression and other oxidative stress related multifactorial diseases.

AB  - Cartilage tissue is comprised of extracellular matrix and chondrocytes, a cell type with very low cellular turnover in adults, providing limited capacity for regeneration. However, in development a significant number of chondrocytes actively proliferate and remodel the surrounding matrix. Uncoupling the microenvironmental influences that determine the balance between clonogenic potential and terminal differentiation of these cells is essential for the development of novel approaches for cartilage regeneration. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are not applicable for the analysis of functional properties of chondrocytes at a single cell resolution. Here we demonstrate that a novel 3D culture method provides a long-term and permissive in vitro niche that selects for highly clonogenic, colony-forming chondrocytes which maintain cartilage-specific matrix production, thus recapitulating the in vivo niche. As a proof of concept, clonogenicity of Sox9(IRES-EGFP) mouse chondrocytes is almost exclusively found in the highest GFP(+) fraction known to be enriched for chondrocyte progenitor cells. Although clonogenic chondrocytes are very rare in adult cartilage, we have optimized this system to support large, single cell-derived chondrogenic organoids with complex zonal architecture and robust chondrogenic phenotype from adult pig and human articular chondrocytes. Moreover, we have demonstrated that growth trajectory and matrix biosynthesis in these organoids respond to a pro-inflammatory environment. This culture method offers a robust, defined and controllable system that can be further used to interrogate the effects of various microenvironmental signals on chondrocytes, providing a high throughput platform to assess genetic and environmental factors in development and disease.

AB  - Alpha-ketoglutaric acid (AKG) is a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and plays a crucial role in energy production and amino acid metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of AKG on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, plasma biochemical parameters, and plasma amino acid profiles in weaned piglets. A total of 72 weaned piglets with an average weight of 7.33 kg (+/- 0.50 kg) and an average age of 28 (+/- 2 days) were randomly assigned to 3 dietary treatments with 6 replicates per group in a 42-day trial. The treatments included a basal diet (CT), a basal diet with 500 g/t AKG (AKG1), and a basal diet with 1000 g/t AKG (AKG2). Blood samples were collected on days 14 and 42, and fecal samples were collected on day 42. The results showed that diets including 500 g/t and 1000 g/t AKG significantly reduced diarrhea incidence in piglets compared to the CT group (p < 0.01). Moreover, diets including 1000 g/t AKG enhanced fecal dry matter digestibility, plasma albumin (ALB), and glucose (GLU) concentrations on day 42 compared to the AKG1 group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, diets including AKG reduced diarrhea incidence in weaned piglets, potentially through improved nutrient digestibility and enhanced systemic health. The 1000 g/t level exhibited greater beneficial effects than 500 g/t.

AB  - Oxidative stress poses a significant challenge in livestock production, impairing intestinal function, nutrient absorption, and overall animal performance. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a mitochondrial regulator known for its protective effects against oxidative damage, but its specific function in porcine intestinal epithelial cells and its regulation by genipin-a natural UCP2 inhibitor with potential therapeutic properties-remains unclear. In this study, we cloned and overexpressed the porcine UCP2 gene in intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), generating a stable UCP2-overexpressing cell line (IPEC-J2-UCP2). Under hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, UCP2 overexpression significantly improved cell viability, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, GPx, and CAT). Additionally, UCP2 upregulated the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and downregulated pro-apoptotic genes (Fas, Caspase-3, and Bax), indicating a protective role against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. We also investigated the regulatory effects of genipin on UCP2. Under non-stress conditions, genipin mildly promoted anti-apoptotic gene expression. However, under oxidative stress, genipin strongly inhibited UCP2 expression, exacerbated ROS accumulation, reduced cell viability, and increased expression of pro-apoptotic markers, particularly Caspase-3 and Bax. These findings reveal that UCP2 plays a critical role in protecting porcine intestinal epithelial cells from oxidative injury and that genipin exerts context-dependent effects on cell fate by modulating UCP2. This study provides a mechanistic basis for targeting UCP2 to manage oxidative stress and improve intestinal health and performance in pigs.

AB  - Background: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the most abundant and important bioactive poly- phenolic compounds in green tea. However, despite its potent antioxidant effects, its neuroprotective effects on chronic high altitude (HA)-induced nerve damage have not been reported. The purpose of this study is to use quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) with pathology to dynamically evaluate the status of brain damage and the effect of EGCG. Methods: A model of HA environments-induced brain injury was established of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in a natural plateau environment for 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 20 weeks. Behavioral alterations were then observed and assessed with the open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. The microglial activation, nissl staining and neural degeneration by Fluoro Jade B in the hippocampus of the rats were observed by immunohistochemistry. In the rats, serum erythropoietin (EPO), hippocampal inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 beta [IL-1 beta], interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), ferritin, oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GSH-Px], catalase [CAT] and malondialdehyde [MDA]) were detected using ELISA kits and biochemical methods. Iron accumulation was observed by QSM and colorimetry. Iron metabolisms (ceruloplasmin [Cp], transferrin [Tf], divalent metal transport1 [DMT1] and hepcidin [Hep]) were detected using qPCR. Neural ultrastructural changes were evaluated with electron microscope. Salidroside treatment was chosen as the positive control group in ELISA, biochemical detection and electron microscopy. Results: The susceptibility values in the left and right hippocampus, the hippocampal ferritin, serum and hippocampal iron content increased significantly after HA exposure. The expression of hippocampal Cp and Hep decreased and the expression of Tf increased. Nissl staining revealed that the neurons of hippocampal CA1 region of h-20w group were small and irregular, atrophied, and nuclear shrinkage. Tissue oxidative stress and inflammatory indicators (MDA, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6) increased while antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px) decreased. EGCG attenuated HA environments-induced cognitive impairment, iron accumulation, microglial activation and neural degeneration. The effects of EGCG in reducing EPO and the metal chelating property with respect to iron were dose-dependent, with effects of EGCG (50 mg/kg) being similar to those of salidroside (50 mg/kg). Conclusions: EGCG can act as a neuroprotective agent against chronic HA environments-mediated neural injuries. QSM provides a potential complementary imaging technique to detect the effect of treating HA diseases.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of high dietary organic copper supplementation on growth performance, mineral metabolism and organ histology in male Awassi lambs. Fifteen lambs with similar body weight (16 +/- 1.53 kg) were assigned to three groups: a control group (T1) receiving a basal diet, and two treatment groups (T2 and T3) supplemented with 0.5 g and 1 g of organic copper per kg DM, respectively. The total dietary copper concentrations were 6.18, 81.68 and 156.75 ppm in T1, T2, and T3 groups, respectively. The basal diet, composed of soybeans, wheat, and barley, provided 2.4 Mcal/kg metabolizable energy and 14% crude protein. High dietary copper supplementation had no significant impact on growth performance and body biometric measurements. Testicular length was increased in T3 lambs. Mineral analysis showed increased hepatic copper concentrations in T2 and T3 lambs. Kidney copper levels remained within normal ranges, while renal zinc concentrations declined in T2 and T3 lambs. Gene expression analysis demonstrated upregulation of ATP7A and ATP7B genes in T3 lambs, indicating a cellular adaptation to elevated copper levels, while IGF1 expression remained unchanged. Histological assessments, however, revealed hepatic and renal changes in T3 lambs. Overall, high dietary organic copper supplementation, particularly at 1 g Cu/kg DM, increases copper retention and may support reproductive health in Awassi lambs. However, excessive intake poses risks of liver and kidney damage, highlighting the need for careful dietary management.

AB  - Pollen as one of the most important supplementary food benefits the generalist predators in many aspects. However, little is known about the performance of generalist predators with type IV lifestyle when they are reared continuously on prey supplemented with pollen for many generations. In this study, the life history traits of the predatory mites Euseius nicholsi (Ehara et Lee) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) were compared when two prey species, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) and Eotetranychus kanktus Ehara (Acari: Tetranychidae) were offered with the presence/absence of camellia pollen. The results showed that the mixed diet of prey and pollen significantly improved the fitness of predatory mites. Predatory mites with pollen as supplementary food developed 1 day faster than their counterparts fed only with prey. They survived much longer and produced almost twice as many eggs as their counterparts. Nevertheless, these benefits were only evident in the first few generations and faded away from Generation 5. This study advanced our understanding by indicating that the beneficial effects of supplementary pollen decreased along with generations and clarifying that T. urticae was a more nutritious prey to E. nicholsi.

AB  - Allergic asthma, a type of chronic airway inflammation, is a global health concern because of its increasing incidence and recurrence rates. Camellia sinensis L. yields a variety type of teas, which are also used as medicinal plants in East Asia and are known to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-potentiating properties. Here, we examined the constituents of C. sinensis L. extract (CSE) and evaluated the protective effects of CSE on allergic asthma by elucidating the underlying mechanism. To induce allergic asthma, we injected the sensitization solution (mixture of ovalbumin (OVA) and aluminum hydroxide) into mice intraperitoneally on days 0 and 14. Then, the mice were exposed to 1% OVA by a nebulizer on days 21 to 23, while intragastric administration of CSE (30 and 100 mg/kg) was performed each day on days 18 to 23. We detected five compounds in CSE, including (-)-epigallocatechin, caffeine, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, and (-)-epicatechin gallate. Treatment with CSE remarkably decreased the airway hyperresponsiveness, OVA-specific immunoglobulin E level, and inflammatory cell and cytokine levels of mice, with a decrease in inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus production in lung tissue. Treatment with CSE also decreased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and the expression of matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in asthmatic mice. Our results demonstrated that CSE reduced allergic airway inflammation caused by OVA through inhibition of phosphorylated NF-kappa B and MMP-9 expression.

AB  - GW117 functions as both an MT1/MT2 receptor agonist and a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist. This study aimed to investigate the anxiolytic effects of GW117 through behavioral assessments, including the open field test and novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) within a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. GW117 was administered via oral gavage for 21 days to evaluate its sustained anxiolytic effects, with behavioral tests including the NSFT, the Vogel-conflict test, and the O-maze test. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed Western blot analyses to assess the expression levels of BCL2-Associated X (Bax), cleaved caspase-3, Bcell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Additionally, BrdU labeling and immunofluorescence staining were used to examine changes in neuronal regeneration and astrocytogenesis. Our results demonstrated that GW117 produced significant anxiolytic effects across all behavioral assays, both in the CUMS model and during long-term administration. Mechanistic studies revealed that GW117 notably increased the expression of BDNF, GFAP, and Bcl-2, while reducing Bax and cleaved caspase-3 levels in the hippocampus of CUMS model rats. Furthermore, the populations of BrdU-positive and GFAP-positive cells were elevated. These findings suggest that GW117 exerts anxiolytic effects, potentially through enhancements in hippocampal function.

AB  - BackgroundThe selection of panellists in dynamic olfactometry traditionally relies on their sensitivity to n-Butanol. The introduction of secondary reference odour mass (SROM), as proposed in the updated standard EN 13725:2022, offers a potential improvement in the selection process and, consequently, in odour quantification accuracy. This study was conducted at the Laboratorio Olfattometrico of Politecnico di Milano, using the new standardized procedure outlined in EN 13725:2022. This study measured and calculated the SROM values for four odorants (dimethyl sulphide, toluene, methanethiol and acetaldehyde), comparing the results with odour thresholds available in the literature.ResultsThe research's findings show that sulphur-containing compounds, such as dimethyl sulphide and methanethiol, have lower SROM values, respectively 0.0015 and 0.000066 mu mol/mol, indicating higher odour potency compared to the other tested substances (SROMtoluene = 0.77 mu mol/mol and SROMacetaldehyde = 0.024 mu mol/mol). Focusing on the examiners' response, a slight correlation between their response to investigated odorants and n-Butanol is found. In addition, the response of examiners to odorants is generally found to be less variable compared to their response to n-Butanol under the test conditions. A different trend emerges when comparing the panellists' responses to n-Butanol and acetaldehyde: the variability between individual responses is higher for acetaldehyde, and there is a slight negative correlation between the responses to the two substances.ConclusionsThis study provides specific SROM values and experimental evidence supporting the integration of odorant-specific reference materials into panel selection procedures, with the aim of enhancing the reliability of dynamic olfactometry.

AB  - Most wild animals follow Bergmann's rule and grow in body size as cold stress increases. However, the underlying thermogenic strategies and their relationship with the gut microbiota have not been comprehensively elucidated. Herein, we used the plateau pikas as a model to investigate body mass, thermogenic capacity, host transcriptome, gut microbiota and metabolites collected from seven sites ranging from 3100 to 4700 m on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) in summer and winter to test the seasonal thermogenesis strategy in small herbivorous mammals. The results showed that the increase in pika body mass with altitude followed Bergmann's rule in summer and an inverted parabolic shape was observed in winter. However, physiological parameters and transcriptome profiles indicated that the thermogenic capacity of pikas increased with altitude in summer and decreased with altitude in winter. The abundance of Firmicutes declined, whereas that of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with altitude in summer. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and proline were enriched in summer, whereas carnitine and succinate were enriched in winter. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between Prevotella, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Alistipes and Akkermansia and metabolites of amino acids, pika physiological parameters, and transcriptome profiles. Moreover, metabolites of amino acids further showed significant positive correlations with pika physiological parameters and transcriptome profiles. Our study highlights that the changes in body mass and thermogenic capacity with altitude distinctly differentiate small herbivorous mammals between summer and winter on the QTP, and that the gut microbiota may regulate host thermogenesis through its metabolites.

AB  - The misuse of anabolic-androgenic steroids by athletes and non-athletes causes harmful effects on the central nervous system. In Ayurvedic medicine, Withania somnifera (WS) as an herbal drug has been reported for several functions including adaptogenic, anticonvulsant, cytoprotective and antioxidant. The present study investigated the neuroprotective functions of WS (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) in nandrolone decanoate (ND)-induced (16 mg/kg body weight) brain injury in male Wistar rats. ND was injected intramuscularly twice weekly for 4 weeks. The water emulsion of WS root powder was administered orally once daily for 30 days to ND-treated rats. At the end of the experiment, anxiety-like behaviour was assessed in rats using the elevated plus maze. Haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained coronal sections of the parietal cortex and hippocampus of ND rats showed severe alterations in brain histology compared with control rats. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the striatum and prodynorphin gene expression in the hippocampus was significantly elevated in the ND group compared with the control group. Treating ND induced rats with various doses of WS significantly reversed the brain damage, anxiety behaviour, increased striatal AChE activity and reduced prodynorphin gene expression in the hippocampus. In conclusion, WS extract can be used as a neuroprotective agent to reduce the effects of anabolic steroids.

AB  - Pain management in neonates continues to be a challenge. Diverse therapies are available that cause loss of pain sensitivity. However, because of side effects, the search for better options remains open. Dexmedetomidine is a promising drug; it has shown high efficacy with a good safety profile in sedation and analgesia in the immature nervous system. Though dexmedetomidine is already in use for pain control in neonates (including premature neonates) and infants as an adjunct to other anesthetics, the question remains whether it affects the neuronal activity patterning that is critical for development of the immature nervous system. In this study, using the neonatal rat as a model, the pharmacodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine on the nervous and cardiorespiratory systems were studied. Our results showed that dexmedetomidine has pronounced analgesic effects in the neonatal rat pups, and also weakly modified both the immature network patterns of cortical and hippocampal activity and the physiology of sleep cycles. Though the respiration and heart rates were slightly reduced after dexmedetomidine administration, it might be considered as the preferential independent short-term therapy for pain management in the immature and developing brain.

AB  - Aims: the study aimed to (i) use adeno-associated virus technology to modulate parvalbumin (PV) gene expression, both through overexpression and silencing, within the hippocampus of male mice and (ii) assess the impact of PV on the metabolic pathway of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Methods: a status epilepticus (SE) mouse model was established by injecting kainic acid into the hippocampus of transgenic mice. When the seizures of mice reached SE, the mice were killed at that time point and 30 min after the onset of SE. Hippocampal tissues were extracted and the mRNA and protein levels of PV and the 65 kDa (GAD65) and 67 kDa (GAD67) isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. The concentrations of glutamate and GABA were detected with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the intracellular calcium concentration was detected using flow cytometry. Results: we demonstrate that the expression of PV is associated with GAD65 and GAD67 and that PV regulates the levels of GAD65 and GAD67. PV was correlated with calcium concentration and GAD expression. Interestingly, PV overexpression resulted in a reduction in calcium ion concentration, upregulation of GAD65 and GAD67, elevation of GABA concentration, reduction in glutamate concentration, and an extension of seizure latency. Conversely, PV silencing induced the opposite effects. Conclusion: parvalbumin may affect the expression of GAD65 and GAD67 by regulating calcium ion concentration, thereby affecting the metabolic pathways associated with glutamate and GABA. In turn, this contributes to the regulation of seizure activity.

AB  - High levels of alcohol intake alter brain gene expression and can produce long-lasting effects. FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) encoded by Fkbp5 is a physical and cellular stress response gene and has been associated with alcohol consumption and withdrawal severity. Fkbp5 has been previously linked to neurite outgrowth and hippocampal morphology, sex differences in stress response, and epigenetic modification. Presently, primary cultured Fkbp5 KO and WT mouse neurons were examined for neurite outgrowth and mitochondrial signal with and without alcohol. We found neurite specification differences between KO and WT; particularly, mesh-like morphology was observed after alcohol treatment and confirmed higher MitoTracker signal in cultured neurons of Fkbp5 KO compared to WT at both naive and alcohol-treated conditions. Brain regions that express FKBP51 protein were identified, and hippocampus was confirmed to possess a high level of expression. RNA-seq profiling was performed using the hippocampus of naive or alcohol-injected (2 mg EtOH/Kg) male and female Fkbp5 KO and WT mice. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between Fkbp5 KO and WT at baseline and following alcohol treatment, with female comparisons possessing a higher number of DEGs than male comparisons. Pathway analysis suggested that genes affecting calcium signaling, lipid metabolism, and axon guidance were differentially expressed at naive condition between KO and WT. Alcohol treatment significantly affected pathways and enzymes involved in biosynthesis (Keto, serine, and glycine) and signaling (dopamine and insulin receptor), and neuroprotective role. Functions related to cell morphology, cell-to-cell signaling, lipid metabolism, injury response, and post-translational modification were significantly altered due to alcohol. In summary, Fkbp5 plays a critical role in the response to acute alcohol treatment by altering metabolism and signaling-related genes.

AB  - Fluoride is capable of inducing developmental neurotoxicity, yet its mechanisms remain elusive. We aimed to explore the possible role and mechanism of autophagic flux blockage caused by abnormal lysosomal pH in fluoride-induced developmental neurotoxicity, focusing on the role of V-ATPase in regulating the neuronal lysosomal pH. Using Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to sodium fluoride (NaF) from gestation through delivery until the neonatal offspring reached six months of age as an in vivo model. The results showed that NaF impaired the cognitive abilities of the offspring rats. In addition, NaF reduced V-ATPase expression, diminished lysosomal degradation capacity and blocked autophagic flux, and increased apoptosis in the hippocampus of offspring. Consistently, these results were validated in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with NaF. Moreover, NaF increased the SHSY5Y lysosomal pH. Mechanistically, V-ATPase B2 overexpression and ATP effectively restored V-ATPase expression, reducing NaF-induced lysosomal alkalinization while increasing lysosomal degradation capacity. Notably, those above pharmacological and molecular interventions diminished NaF-induced apoptosis by restoring autophagic flux. Collectively, the present findings suggested that NaF impairs the lysosomal pH raised by V-ATPase. This leads to reduced lysosomal degradation capacity and triggers autophagic flux blockage and apoptosis, thus contributing to neuronal death. Therefore, V-ATPase might be a promising indicator of developmental fluoride neurotoxicity.

AB  - While the principle definitive host of the zoonotic cestode Echinococcus multilocularis in Europe is the red fox, several rodent species act as main intermediate hosts. Among others, e.g., humans, dogs, and pigs, also horses have been described to act as aberrant hosts in highly endemic regions. Here, a case of an E. multilocularis infection in a kulan (Equus hemionus kulan) is described. The five years old kulan from a zoo in Slovakia was transported to an animal park in Germany. The animal had to be euthanized within a few weeks after the import due to its poor general state of health. The pathological examination revealed a nodular mass in the liver as an incidental finding. By histological examination of the mass, a pyogranulomatous and necrotizing inflammation and intralesional fragments of amorphous eosinophil layers were detected. The suspected diagnosis of E. multilocularis infection was confirmed by PCR addressing parts of the genes 12S rRNA and the NADH dehy-drogenase subunit 2, showing very high identities with isolates from France, Slovakia and the USA.

AB  - Finding ideal oviposition sites is a task of vital importance for all female insects. To ensure optimal conditions for their progeny, females of herbivorous insects detect not only the odors of a relevant host plant but also chemicals released by eggs, named oviposition-deterring pheromones (ODPs). It is reported that such chemicals play critical roles in suppressing female oviposition behavior; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the detection of egg -derived ODPs remains elusive. Here, we have identified three specific fatty acid methyl esters from the surface of eggs of Helicoverpa armigera serving as ODPs-methyl oleate (C18:1ME), methyl palmitate (C16:0ME), and methyl stearate (C18:0ME). We demonstrated that these ODPs are detected by the receptor, HarmOR56, exclusively expressed in sensilla trichodea on female antennae. To assess the significance of this receptor, we disrupted HarmOR56 in H. armigera using CRISPR-Cas9 and found that mutant females did not respond to the ODPs, neither in behavioral nor in electrophysiological tests. We therefore conclude that HarmOR56 is indispensable for identifying the ODPs. This study explores, for the first time, how a female -specific odorant receptor detects chemicals from conspecific eggs. Our data elucidate the intriguing biological phenomenon of repulsion to conspecific eggs during oviposition and contribute new insight into a female -specific olfactory pathway linked to reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary Our comparative study brings new insights regarding the effects of environmental lead exposure on the cardiorespiratory and nervous systems. We show how various kinds of exposure can lead to different toxicities, with various degrees of nefarious effects. The developmental period is of utmost importance to the toxicity of environmental lead; however, we found that the duration of exposure is the prime reason for stronger effects, even though the dual effect of intermittent exposure causes greater molecular neuronal alterations. Lead is a heavy metal whose widespread use has resulted in environmental contamination and significant health problems, particularly if the exposure occurs during developmental stages. It is a cumulative toxicant that affects multiple systems of the body, including the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Chronic lead exposure has been defined as a cause of behavioral changes, inflammation, hypertension, and autonomic dysfunction. However, different environmental lead exposure paradigms can occur, and the different effects of these have not been described in a broad comparative study. In the present study, rats of both sexes were exposed to water containing lead acetate (0.2% w/v), from the fetal period until adulthood. Developmental Pb-exposed (DevPb) pups were exposed to lead until 12 weeks of age (n = 13); intermittent Pb exposure (IntPb) pups drank leaded water until 12 weeks of age, tap water until 20 weeks, and leaded water for a second time from 20 to 28 weeks of age (n = 14); and the permanent (PerPb) exposure group were exposed to lead until 28 weeks of age (n = 14). A control group (without exposure, Ctrl), matched in age and sex was used. After exposure protocols, at 28 weeks of age, behavioral tests were performed for assessment of anxiety (elevated plus maze test), locomotor activity (open-field test), and memory (novel object recognition test). Metabolic parameters were evaluated for 24 h, and the acute experiment was carried out. Blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram, and heart (HR) and respiratory (RF) rates were recorded. Baroreflex gain, chemoreflex sensitivity, and sympathovagal balance were calculated. Immunohistochemistry protocol for NeuN, Syn, Iba-1, and GFAP staining was performed. All Pb-exposed groups showed hypertension, concomitant with a decrease in baroreflex gain and chemoreceptor hypersensitivity, without significant changes in HR and RF. Long-term memory impairment associated with reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, indicating the presence of neuroinflammation, was also observed. However, these alterations seemed to reverse after lead abstinence for a certain period (DevPb) and were enhanced when a second exposure occurred (IntPb), along with a synaptic loss. These results suggest that the duration of Pb exposure is more relevant than the timing of exposure, since the PerPb group presented more pronounced effects and a significant increase in the LF and HF bands and anxiety levels. In summary, this is the first study with the characterization and comparison of physiological, autonomic, behavioral, and molecular changes caused by different low-level environmental lead exposures, from the fetal period to adulthood, where the duration of exposure was the main factor for stronger adverse effects. These kinds of studies are of immense importance, showing the importance of the surrounding environment in health from childhood until adulthood, leading to the creation of new policies for toxicant usage control.

AB  - Sudan grass is a high-quality forage of sorghum. The degree of lignification of Sudan grass is the main factor affecting its digestibility in ruminants such as cattle and sheep. Almost all lignocellulose in Sudan grass is stored in the secondary cell wall, but the mechanism and synthesis of the secondary cell wall in Sudan grass is still unclear. In order to study the mechanism of secondary cell wall synthesis in Sudan grass, we used an in vitro induction system of Sudan grass secondary cell wall. Through transcriptome sequencing, it was found that the NAC transcription factor CcNAC1 gene was related to the synthesis of the Sudan grass secondary cell wall. This study further generated CcNAC1 overexpression lines of Arabidopsis to study CcNAC1 gene function in secondary cell wall synthesis. It was shown that the overexpression of the CcNAC1 gene can significantly increase lignin content in Arabidopsis lines. Through subcellular localization analysis, CcNAC1 genes could be expressed in the nucleus of a plant. In addition, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to find 26 proteins interacting with CcNAC1. GO and KEGG analysis showed that CcNAC1 relates to the metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In summary, the synthesis of secondary cell wall of Sudan grass can be regulated by CcNAC1.

AB  - Prenatal stress is the mechanism through which poor welfare of pregnant sows has detrimental effects on the health and resilience of their piglets. We compared two gestation housing systems (IMPROVED versus [conventional] CONTROL) in terms of sow stress and welfare indicators and sought to determine whether potential benefits to the sows would translate into improved offspring health. Sows were mixed into 12 stable groups (six groups per treatment, 20 sows per group) 29 days post-service in pens with free-access, full-length individual feeding/lying-stalls. CONTROL pens had fully slatted concrete floors, with two blocks of wood and two chains suspended in the group area. IMPROVED pens were the same but with rubber mats and manila rope in each stall, and straw provided in three racks in the group area. Saliva was collected from each sow on day 80 of pregnancy and analysed for haptoglobin. Hair cortisol was measured in late gestation. Sows' right and left eyes were scored for tear staining in mid lactation and at weaning. Numbers of piglets born alive, dead, mummified, and total born were recorded. Piglets were weighed and scored for vitality and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) at birth. Presence of diarrhoea in farrowing pens was scored every second day throughout the suckling period. IMPROVED sows had lower haptoglobin levels and tear-stain scores during lactation. IMPROVED sows produced fewer mummified piglets, and these had significantly lower IUGR scores, and scored lower for diarrhoea than piglets of CONTROL sows. Hence, improving sow welfare during gestation improved the health and performance of their offspring.

AB  - This research aimed to excavate compounds with activity reducing hepatocytes lipid accumulation from Delphinium brunonianum. Four novel diterpenoid alkaloids, brunodelphinine B-E, were isolated from D. brunonianum together with eleven known diterpenoid alkaloids through a phytochemical investigation. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopy methods including HR-ESI-MS, NMR, IR, UV, CD, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The inhibitory effects of a total of 15 diterpenoid alkaloids on hepatocytes lipid accumulation were evaluated using 0.5 mM FFA (oleate/palmitate 2:1 ratio) to induce buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells by measuring the levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and the staining of oil red O. The results show that five diterpenoid alkaloids-brunodelphinine E (4), delbruline (5), lycoctonine (7), delbrunine (8), and sharwuphinine A (12)-exhibited significant inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner and without cytotoxicity. Among them, sharwuphinine A (12) displayed the strongest inhibition of hepatocytes lipid accumulation in vitro. Our research increased the understanding on the chemical composition of D. brunonianum and provided experimental and theoretical evidence for the active ingredients screened from this herbal medicine in the treatment of the diseases related to lipid accumulation, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia.

AB  - Early diagnosis of pregnancy is directly related to cost-effective livestock production. We produced a rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) against synthesized porcine early pregnancy factor (pEPF) using conventional hybridoma technology and used it as a tool for the detection of early pregnancy in Duroc sows. The rat pEPF-mAb showed reactivity to uterine tissues of pregnant sows 20 or 30 days post-mating (day 0 defined as the day of mating) and non-pregnant sows (confirmed signs of estrus) in western blotting. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that pEPF was located in the stromal and grand epithelial tissues of pregnant sows 20 or 30 days postmating. In the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, pEPF expression in urine and blood showed similar results, with the highest expression observed in pregnant sows 20 days post-mating, whereas there was no significant difference in expression levels between non-pregnant sows and pregnant sows 30 days post-mating. The pEPFmAb-based pregnancy diagnostic kit can be applied to pig urine samples non-invasively collected at 20 days post-mating with 70 % accuracy. Further improvements to the kit's diagnostic performance may lead to substantial benefits for the swine industry, facilitating more efficient and accurate reproductive management.

AB  - Approximately 1%-3% of the adult population are treated with synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) for a variety of conditions. Studies have demonstrated that adversities experienced by males prior to conception may lead to abnormal neuroendocrine function and behaviors in offspring and that epigenetic factors including microRNA (miRNA) within sperm may be responsible for driving these effects. However, it remains unclear where in the epididymis sperm miRNA changes are occurring. Here, we hypothesized that sGC exposure will alter the miRNA profile of sperm in the epididymis in a region-specific manner. Adult male guinea pigs were exposed to regular drinking water (Ctrl) or water with the sGC dexamethasone (Dex; 3mg/kg) (n = 6/group) every other day for 48 days. Sperms were collected from epididymal seminal fluid in the caput and cauda regions of the epididymis and total RNA was extracted. miRNAs were assessed by miRNA 4.0 microarray; data were processed by TAC 4.0.1 and R. miRNA analysis revealed one miRNA in the caput that was significantly decreased by Dex in sperm. In the cauda, 31 miRNAs were reduced in sperm following Dex-exposure. The findings of this study demonstrate that Dex-exposure influences miRNA profile of sperm in the cauda but not the caput of the epididymis. This suggests that glucocorticoids target the epididymis to modify sperm miRNA and do not modify the miRNA content during spermiation in the testes.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to study the effects of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze leaves (green tea), Punica granatum (pomegranate-peel), and Quercus persica Jaub. & Spach (oak) at different concentrations on ruminal fermentation, dry matter and organic matter digestibility, methane production and protozoa population using gas production method. Experimental treatments were: control, 50, 100, and 200 mu g/ ml aqueous and methanolic extract of Camellia sinensis, Punica granatum, and Q. persica (19 treatments in total). Cumulative gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h after incubation. Dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), metabolizable energy (ME), pH, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were calculated after 24 h incubation. Gas production at different times, methane production, and protozoa population were also measured. DMD, OMD, and pH were decreased by adding extracts. Microbial mass production (MCP) and microbial mass production efficiency (EMCP) significantly increased at a low level (50 mu g/ ml) and significantly decreased at high levels of extracts containing tannins (100 and 200 mu g/ ml) (P< 0.01). The treatments also increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), reduced methane concentration, and reduced PF and protozoa populations only at the highest levels of extracts (P<0.05).

AB  - Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because of lower costs and being environmentally friendly in comparison to the chemical methods. One of the most considered methods is production of metal NPs using organisms. Among these organisms, plants seem to be the best candidates and suitable for the biosynthesis of large-scale NPs. The produced NPs by plants are more stable and their synthesize are faster than microorganisms. In this research, the green synthesis of iron oxide magnetic NPs (Fe3O4-MNPs) has been performed using aqueous extract of green tea (Camelia sinensis) as a reducing and capping agent. Evaluation of properties and morphology of Fe3O4-MNPs is performed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and vibrational magnetometer. The synthesized NPs were crystalline in nature and spin-shaped with a mean diameter of <= 20 nm and also has super-magnetic properties. The systematic study of the synthesis process was performed using Design Expert 10 software to determine the relationship between the four process variables, namely iron concentration, extract volume, time, and temperature. The square model was significant for the response variables. In the final, synthesized Fe3O4-MNPs were applied for magnetization of activated carbon that then used for efficient removal of phenol (up to 98%) from aqueous media. Various parameters affecting the removal process such as pH, extraction time, and adsorbent amount were optimized by using response surface methodology.

AB  - Smallholder farmers rely on their farm earnings to cover operating costs and generate income. That is not an easy task because of the pests, which reduce yields and generate plant protection costs. The farm yield and plant protection depend on the budget capacity of the farmer. In this work, we want to explore conditions for a sustainable and self-financing cabbage farm. We propose then a non-linear mathematical model for cabbage crops by considering the current account of the plantation as a dynamic variable. We assume that this variable increases due to the sale of cabbages, and provides for the seedling purchase, the plant protection costs, and the grower's income. In the first part, we analyze the model without pest management. We determine how the budget must be spent and we show the existence of a double transcritical bifurcation. We quantify the seasonal yield and income, and estimate the damage due to pest herbivory. In the second part, we analyze a slightly simplified version of our model and obtain the existence of a backward bifurcation. Furthermore, we show that botanical pesticides can be used to prevent pest spread with relatively low plant protection costs.

AB  - Simple Summary Urinary tract infections are associated with features of cognitive decline and memory deficits, where the underlying correlation or mechanism is still not clear. In this study, we investigate the effect of urinary tract infections on cognitive functions in rodents and whether it is associated with adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process that is detrimental for memory formation. We have shown that urinary tract infection affects the time spent exploring a novel arm in the Y-maze test. This was accompanied with a decrease in the proliferation of neural stem cells at an early time point post infection and a persistent decrease in neurogenesis at a later time point (34 days). We also detected decreased levels of neurotrophic factors important for neurogenesis and an elevated expression of interleukin 1 beta in the hippocampus. Treatment with either anti-inflammatory drugs or anti-biotics does not recover proliferation of neural stem cells. Here, we present hippocampal neurogenesis as a possible contributor to cognitive changes associated with urinary tract infections. Given the significant increase in urinary tract infection occurrence, it is important to address some of the detrimental effects that such an infection can have at the level of the brain. Previous studies have suggested a link between urinary tract infections (UTIs) and cognitive impairment. One possible contributing factor for UTI-induced cognitive changes that has not yet been investigated is a potential alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of UTI on brain plasticity by specifically examining alterations in neurogenesis. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received an intra-urethral injection of an Escherichia coli (E. coli) clinical isolate (10(8) CFU/mL). We found that rats with a UTI (CFU/mL >= 10(5)) had reduced proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) at an early time point post infection (day 4) and neurogenesis at a later time point (day 34). This was associated with the decreased expression in mRNA of BDNF, NGF, and FGF2, and elevated expression of IL-1 beta in the hippocampus at 6 h post infection, but with no changes in optical intensity of the microglia and astrocytes. In addition, infected rats spent less time exploring a novel arm in the Y-maze test. Treatment with an anti-inflammatory drug did not revert the effect on NSCs, while treatment with antibiotics further decreased the basal level of their proliferation. This study presents novel findings on the impact of urinary tract infections on hippocampal neurogenesis that could be correlated with cognitive impairment.

AB  - During the sheep breeding season, ovulatory follicles vary widely in age at pessary removal impacting both the timing of oestrus and pregnancy rates following artificial insemination (AI). Ovulatory follicles that emerge between days 7 to 9 of the pessary period are associated with higher fertility whilst those that emerge earlier or later are associated with lower fertility. In this study, two strategies to improve the success of AI by controlling the development of the ovulatory follicle were examined. In the first, ewes were treated with PGF2a at either -12 and/or +6 days (experiment 1) or -27 days (experiment 2) relative to pessary insertion to control the time of emergence of the ovulatory follicle. In the second, ewes were treated with eCG (400 IU per ewe) at either 0 h, -6 h or -12 h relative to pessary removal (experiment 3) to improve the development of young ovulatory follicles. PGF2a administered on day -27 increased the percentage of pregnant ewes by 17.8% and the number of foetuses per 100 ewes inseminated by 33.9%. PGF2a treatment at other times had either no effect or reduced fertility. During the breeding season, treatment with eCG at -12 h improved the synchrony of oestrus, reduced the size of the ovulatory follicle but did not improve pregnancy rate compared with other treatments. Treatment had no effect during the non-breeding season, supporting earlier findings that the quality of young ovulatory follicles differs during the year. In conclusion, PGF2a treatment 27 days before pessary insertion provides a new and cheap strategy to improve the success of fixed-time AI programs.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze.) is an economically important crop extensively grown for harvestable shoots in India. In the present study, 40 tea leaf samples (new leaves/buds) showing brown to black water-soaked expanding lesions collected from different commercial tea gardens of North Bengal and Assam, India, in different seasons were analyzed for the associated factor involved in the disease. A total of 40 isolates of bacteria with similar colony appearance on agar plates were isolated from symptomatic leaves/buds. Among the 40 isolates, six representative isolates from different tea gardens including three each from North Bengal (BBN01, BBP01, and BBJ01) and Assam (BBH01, BBD01, and BBA01) were characterized for gram reactions, biochemical tests, and by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. All the isolates were gram negative, oxidase and catalase positive, and aerobically produced acid from glucose. BLASTn analysis of the obtained sequences revealed that all six isolates were Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae, sharing a similarity greater than 99% with A. avenae subsp. avenae sequences from the GenBank database. Phylogenetic study also displayed the closest resemblance of these isolates to A. avenae subsp. avenae based on maximum likelihood. Further, six A. avenae subsp. avenae isolates were pathogenic on a tea cultivar TV23 in repeated experiments. Koch's postulates were verified by re-isolating the bacterial pathogen from the inoculated plants showing blight symptoms. In conclusion, this study confirms that A. avenae subsp. avenae is the bacterial pathogen responsible for causing symptoms of blight in tea leaves/buds. As far as we know, this is the first record of A. avenae subsp. avenae on Indian tea plants.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short endogenous non-coding RNAs and play important roles in regulating mammary development and activities of ovine mammary epithelial cells (OMECs), which affect the milk yield and milk ingredient contents of ewes. We previously found that miR-21 was highly expressed in ovine mammary tissue, while the regulatory mechanisms of miR-21 underlying mammary development and lactation performance are still unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the functions of miR-21 in the activities of OMECs, and validated the target relationship of miR-21 with a predicted target gene programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, we investigated the regulatory effect of PDCD4 on the viability, proliferation and milk fat synthesis of OMECs. The overexpression of miR-21 significantly increased the viability of OMECs, the number and proportion of Edu-labeled positive OMECs, as well as the contents of triglyceride in OMECs. In fact, miR-21 inhibitor obtained opposite results with miR-21 mimics. The results obtained from the dual luciferase report and RT-qPCR assays confirmed that the seed sequence of miR-21 can complementarily combine with the 3 '-untranslated regions (3 '-UTR) of PDCD4, and miR-21 decreased the luciferase activity of PDCD4. Meanwhile, miR-21 also reduced the expression of PDCD4. These results indicate that PDCD4 is a target gene of miR-21. It was further found that PDCD4 decreased the viability and triglyceride content of OMECs, and the number and proportion of Edu-labeled positive OMECs. These findings suggest that miR-21 promotes the viability, proliferation and milk fat synthesis of OMECs by down-regulating the expression of PDCD4. The results revealed the regulatory mechanism by which miR-21 affected the activities and milk fat synthesis of OMECs in sheep.

AB  - alpha-synuclein is a protein central to neurodegenerative diseases, and its functions are affected by multiple posttranslational modifications. Mass spectrometry is powerful for the characterization of alpha-synuclein forms but requires prior efficient immunoprecipitation conditions. In this study, we refined the immunoprecipitation of alpha-synuclein from human brain tissues by evaluating key parameters that influence recovery and specificity. We assessed the performance of tosyl-activated magnetic beads versus sheep antibody beads, identifying the optimal bead type for enhanced binding efficiency. Various elution conditions were rigorously tested to maximize protein yield. We also evaluated a range of antibodies specific to alpha-synuclein and delineated the effects of antibody amount and bead volume on the recovery of alpha-synuclein. The optimized immunoprecipitation protocol was effectively combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry for characterizing brain-derived alpha-synuclein from Parkinson's disease patients and controls. The assay identified a total of 38 N- or C-terminal truncated alpha-synuclein forms, including 22 novel sites. Our findings provide analytical tools for the reliable enrichment and characterization of alpha-synuclein from complex biological matrices, with potential applications in biomarker discovery and the investigation of pathogenic mechanisms underlying synucleinopathies.

AB  - Simple Summary Sulla forage, containing condensed tannins, is renowned in the Mediterranean area for its excellent chemical composition and agronomic traits, the suitability for grazing or hay production, and favorable impact on ruminants' productivity. Condensed tannins of sulla forage exert various positive effects, because they contribute to reducing methanogenesis in the rumen, protect dietary proteins from rumen degradation, limit the ruminal biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and ensure animal health by anthelmintic action. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of condensed tannins may contribute to improving the antioxidant status of animals, as well as the oxidative stability and antioxidant properties of animal products, with important health benefits for human consumers. The conservation methods of sulla forage, such as dehydration and the hay-making process, can influence the content and bioavailability of condensed tannins. In this research, the performance of dairy ewes fed with pelleted dehydrated sulla forage, in terms of feed intake, digestibility, milk production, and oxidative status, were compared with those of ewes fed diets based on sulla hay and fresh sulla forage. The results confirmed the positive effects of sulla forage, also when fresh sulla forage is replaced with dehydrated forage. On this basis, the storage and use of sulla dehydrated pellets represent a valid opportunity to exploit the potential of sulla forage in periods of low availability of grazing sources. Feeding dairy ewes with fresh sulla forage (FSF), a legume species containing condensed tannins (CT), has been shown to increase feed intake, milk yield, and casein and enhances the oxidative status of animals. Dehydration of FSF could be an alternative to hay-making to preserve the nutritional properties. This research aimed to compare the responses of dairy ewes fed with diets based on sulla hay (SH), pelleted dehydrated sulla forage (DSF), or FSF in terms of efficiency of feed utilization, milk production, and the balance between oxidant (reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs)) and antioxidant (biological antioxidant potential (BAP)) substances at the plasma level. Ten first-lambing (FL) and ten third-lambing (TL) ewes of the Valle del Belice breed at 60 days in milk were allocated into five homogeneous groups fed with different diets in a partial 5 x 2 Latin square design with two phases. The diets differed for the forage basis: SHL = SH ad libitum; DSF2 = 2 kg/day DSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSF2 = 2 kg/day FSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSF4 = 4 kg/day FSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSFL = FSF ad libitum. A commercial concentrate was provided to FL (0.8 kg/day per head) and TL (1.2 kg/day per head) ewes. Dehydration induced slight variations in the content of protein and fiber, showed no loss of vitamin E and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and decreased the level of CT and polyphenols. The DSF2 diet resulted in a higher intake of dry matter, protein, and vitamin E compared to the other diets, whereas, compared to the FSFL diet, its intake was analogous for net energy and was lower in CT and polyphenols. The DSF2 diet was comparable to FSF4 and FSFL diets for milk yield, and to all diets for casein content and the clotting ability of milk. Ewes fed a DSF2 diet exhibited lowest values of ROMs and oxidative stress index (OSI = ROMs/BAP), indicating a better oxidative status, presumably due to the antioxidant protection exerted by the higher vitamin E intake and CT metabolites.
   These results confirmed the positive effects of FSF on milk production, especially due to CT intake, in improving the efficiency of dietary protein utilization, and showed how favorable effects also occur when FSF is replaced by DSF instead of SH.

AB  - Caves play an important role in bat ecology, offering natural roosting and wintering sites. In the reproductive period, bats need to find an effective foraging environment away from the cave entrance, but only few studies have considered the use of foraging habitats in the immediate proximity of the caves. We provide a list of 18 bat species and 5 bat acoustic groups observed in a system of 81 caves in NW Italy. Winter censuses carried out during 17 years showed an increase of the Greater Horseshoe bat, a species of conservation concern. In the summer period this rare species was also observed foraging in nearby areas. Recording of bat calls in the summer period was performed both at cave entrances and in three foraging habitats present in the area surrounding the cave (woods, agricultural mosaic with artificial light, dark mosaic). Light mosaics and woods showed the highest foraging activity (160.3 and 72.0 pass/hour), while woods and cave entrances were accessed by the largest number of bat species. Our survey improves the inventory of bat species in a poorly sampled area, and we recommend a reduced tourism access, thereby promoting preservation of bats.

AB  - Livestock and crop production are the main sources of ammonia (NH3) emissions, which are known to degrade the air quality. Numerous studies have been conducted to explore the mitigation potential of various approaches, although few have examined the systematic NH3 emission mitigation potential when considering both crop and livestock systems based on coherent in situ measurement results. Herein, we design an optimal system wherein coupled crop and layer production systems reveal feasible approaches for significant mitigation potential at each stage of the process. Specifically, these measures involve (i) using a low crude protein (LCP) feed, (ii) composting manure with certain additives, and (iii) substituting manure with optimal fertilization in a summer maize-winter wheat cropping system. The results show that (i) LCP feed leads to a 14 % reduction in NH3 emissions at the housing stage, (ii) introducing additives during the composing stage reduces NH3 emissions by 16 %-46 %, and (iii) the NH3 reduction potential reaches 35 %-44 % at the field application stage. In the overall crop-layer system, the optimal system with the improved management strategy applied at every stage results in a 48 % and 56 % reduction in NH3 emissions for per unit eggs and grain production, respectively, relative to a traditional production system. This study confirms that NH3 emissions can be cut in half by implementing optimal crop-livestock systems with appropriate mitigation approaches. This is a feasible model that can be promoted and extended in various agricultural areas, which together with technological, policy, and economic support can enable significant mitigation potential for sustainable agriculture development.

AB  - Background Functional neuroimaging studies have identified a set of nodes in the occipital-temporal cortex that preferentially respond to faces in comparison with other visual objects. By contrast, the processing of places seems to rely on parahippocampal cortex and structures heavily implicated in memory (e.g., the hippocampus). It has been suggested that human aging leads to decreased neural specialization of core face and place processing areas and impairments in face and place perception. Methods Using mediation analysis, we tested the potential contribution of micro- and macrostructure within the hippocampal and occipitotemporal systems to age-associated effects in face and place category processing (as measured by 1-back working memory tasks) in 55 healthy adults (age range 23-79 years). To test for specific contributions of the studied structures to face/place processing, we also studied a distinct tract (i.e., the anterior thalamic radiation [ATR]) and cognitive performance for other visual object categories (objects, bodies, and verbal material). Constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography was used to reconstruct the fornix, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the ATR. Hippocampal volumetric measures were segmented from FSL-FIRST toolbox. Results It was found that age associates with (a) decreases in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix, in right ILF (but not left ILF), and in the ATR (b) reduced volume in the right and left hippocampus and (c) decline in visual object category processing. Importantly, mediation analysis showed that micro- and macrostructural impairments in the fornix and right hippocampus, respectively, associated with age-dependent decline in place processing. Alternatively, microstructural impairments in right hemispheric ILF associated with age-dependent decline in face processing. There were no other mediator effects of micro- and macrostructural variables on age-cognition relationships. Conclusion Together, the findings support specific contributions of the fornix and right hippocampus in visuospatial scene processing and of the long-range right hemispheric occipitotemporal network in face category processing.

AB  - To deter herbivore attacks, plants employ a diverse array of volatile compounds, particularly during the early developmental stages. The highly expressed genes LaTPS7, LaTPS8, and LaCYP71D582 were identified during the budding phases of Lavandula angustifolia. In vitro studies revealed that LaTPS7 generated nine distinct compounds, including camphene, myrcene, and limonene. LaTPS8 enzymatically converted eight volatiles by utilizing geranyl diphosphate and nerolidyl diphosphate as substrates. Overexpression of plastid-localized LaTPS7 in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in the production of limonene. Furthermore, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated enzyme LaCYP71D582 potentially converted limonene into carveol. In N. benthamiana, LaTPS8 is responsible for the synthesis of alpha-pinene and sylvestrene. Furthermore, leaves transfected with LaTPS7 and leaves cotransfected with LaTPS7 and LaCYP71D582 exhibited a repellent effect on aphids, with an approximate rate of 70%. In comparison, leaves with an empty vector displayed a repellent rate of approximately 20%. Conversely, tobacco leaves expressing LaTPS7 attracted ladybugs at a rate of 48.33%, while leaves coexpressing LaTPS7 and LaCYP71D582 attracted ladybugs at a slightly higher rate of 58.33%. Subsequent authentic standard tests confirmed that limonene and carveol repel Myzus persicae while attracting Harmonia axyridis. The promoter activity of LaTPS7 and LaCYP71D582 was evaluated in Arabidopsis thaliana using GUS staining, and it was observed that wounding stimulated the expression of LaTPS7. The volatile compounds produced by LaTPS7, LaTPS8, and LaCYP71D582 play a crucial role in plant defence mechanisms. In practical applications, employing biological control measures based on plant-based approaches can promote human and environmental health.

AB  - The high symptomatic and biological heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) makes it very difficult to find broadly efficacious treatments that work against all symptoms. Concentrating on single core symptoms that are biologically well understood might consist of a more viable approach. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework is a trans-diagnostic dimensional approach that focuses on symptoms and their underlying neurobiology. Evidence is accumulating that psychedelics may possess antidepressant activity, and this can potentially be explained through a multi-level (psychobiological, circuitry, (sub)cellular and molecular) analysis of the cognitive systems RDoC domain. Cognitive deficits, such as negative emotional processing and negativity bias, often lead to depressive rumination. Psychedelics can increase long-term cognitive flexibility, leading to normalization of negativity bias and reduction in rumination. We propose a theoretical model that explains how psychedelics can reduce the negativity bias in depressed patients. At the psychobiological level, we hypothesize that the negativity bias in MDD is due to impaired pattern separation and that psychedelics such as psilocybin help in depression because they enhance pattern separation and hence reduce negativity bias. Pattern separation is a mnemonic process that relies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, where similar inputs are made more distinct, which is essential for optimal encoding of contextual information. Impairment in this process may underlie the negative cognitive bias in MDD by, for example, increased pattern separation of cues with a negative valence that can lead to excessive deliberation on aversive outcomes. On the (sub) cellular level, psychedelics stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis as well as synaptogenesis, spinogenesis and dendritogenesis in the prefrontal cortex. Together, these effects help restoring resilience to chronic stress and lead to modulation of the major connectivity hubs of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Based on these observations, we propose a new translational framework to guide the development of a novel generation of therapeutics to treat the cognitive symptoms in MDD.

AB  - Introduction Increasing age is the number one risk factor for developing cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. Aged humans and mice exhibit numerous molecular changes that contribute to a decline in cognitive function and increased risk of developing age-associated diseases. Here, we characterize multiple age-associated changes in male C57BL/6J mice to understand the translational utility of mouse aging. Methods Male C57BL/6J mice from various ages between 2 and 24 months of age were used to assess behavioral, as well as, histological and molecular changes across three modalities: neuronal, microgliosis/neuroinflammation, and the neurovascular unit (NVU). Additionally, a cohort of 4- and 22-month-old mice was used to assess blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Mice in this cohort were treated with a high, acute dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg) or saline control 6 h prior to sacrifice followed by tail vein injection of 0.4 kDa sodium fluorescein (100 mg/kg) 2 h later. Results Aged mice showed a decline in cognitive and motor abilities alongside decreased neurogenesis, proliferation, and synapse density. Further, neuroinflammation and circulating proinflammatory cytokines were increased in aged mice. Additionally, we found changes at the BBB, including increased T cell infiltration in multiple brain regions and an exacerbation in BBB leakiness following chemical insult with age. There were also a number of readouts that were unchanged with age and have limited utility as markers of aging in male C57BL/6J mice. Conclusions Here we propose that these changes may be used as molecular and histological readouts that correspond to aging-related behavioral decline. These comprehensive findings, in the context of the published literature, are an important resource toward deepening our understanding of normal aging and provide an important tool for studying aging in mice.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPredicting the host range of biocontrol agents is important for the safe and effective implementation of biocontrol of weeds. In this study, we examined the phylogenetic pattern of host selection and acceptance by the biocontrol beetle, Cassida rubiginosa. The beetle was released in New Zealand for control of Cirsium arvense, its primary host plant, but has potential to attack many Cardueae (thistles and knapweeds) species. We conducted a series of no-choice and choice experiments and modelled the responses of Cassida rubiginosa in relation to phylogenetic distance from Cirsium arvense. RESULTSThe olfactory recognition (single odour) and preference (two odours) of the beetle showed a significant phylogenetic relationship. These relationships showed a high degree of correlation with 66.9% of the variation in olfactory recognition and 82.8% of the variation in olfactory preference explained by phylogeny. Where the beetle could contact plants, under no-choice conditions there was no phylogenetic pattern to host plant acceptance. However, under choice conditions, phylogenetic distance was a strong predictor of feeding and oviposition preference. These relationships showed a high degree of correlation, with 63.4% of the variation in feeding preference, and 89.0% of the variation in oviposition preference, explained by phylogeny. CONCLUSIONSAs far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of an herbivorous insect that exhibits a phylogenetic pattern to olfactory host plant selection. Host plant utilisation by Cassida rubiginosa in New Zealand will be mostly restricted to Cirsium and Carduus species, with minimal potential for impact on other Cardueae weeds. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Plant tissue cultures are considered as potential producers of biologically active plant metabolites, which include various phenolic compounds that can be used to maintain human health. Moreover, in most cases, their accumulation is lower than in the original explants, which requires the search for factors and influences for the intensification of this process. In this case, it is very promising to use the precursors of their biosynthesis as potential "regulators" of the various metabolites' formation. The purpose of our research was to study the effect of L-phenylalanine (PhA, 3 mM), trans-cinnamic acid (CA, 1 mM) and naringenin (NG, 0.5 mM), as components of various stages of phenolic metabolism, on accumulation of various phenolic compound classes, including phenylpropanoids, flavans and proanthocyanidins, as well as the content of malondialdehyde in in vitro callus culture of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.). According to the data obtained, the precursors' influence did not lead to changes in the morphology and water content of the cultures. At the same time, an increase in the total content of phenolic compounds, as well as phenylpropanoids, flavans and proanthocyanidins, was noted in tea callus cultures. Effectiveness of precursor action depends on its characteristics and the exposure duration, and was more pronounced in the treatments with PhA. This compound can be considered as the most effective precursor regulating phenolic metabolism, contributing to a twofold increase in the total content of phenolic compounds, flavanes and proanthocyanidins, and a fourfold increase in phenylpropanoids in tea callus cultures.

AB  - Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs due to inadequate support of female pelvic organs and is often treated with synthetic implants. However, complications like infections, mesh shrinkage, and tissue erosion can arise due to biomechanical incompatibilities with native tissue. This study aimed to optimize the melt electrowriting process using medical-grade biodegradable Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) with a pellet extruder to print meshes that mimic the mechanical properties of vaginal tissue. Square and diagonal mesh designs with filament diameters of 80 mu m, 160 mu m, and 240 mu m were produced and evaluated through mechanical testing, comparing them to a commercial mesh and sheep vaginal tissue. The results showed that when comparing medical-grade with non-medical-grade square meshes, there was a 54% difference in the Secant modulus, with the non-medical-grade meshes falling short of matching the properties of vaginal tissue. The square-shaped medical-grade PCL mesh closely approximated vaginal tissue, showing only a 13.7% higher Secant modulus and a maximum stress of 0.29 MPa, indicating strong performance. Although the diagonal-shaped mesh exhibited a 14% stress difference, its larger Secant modulus discrepancy of 45% rendered it less suitable. In contrast, the commercial mesh was significantly stiffer, measuring 77.5% higher than vaginal tissue. The diagonal-shaped mesh may better match the stress-strain characteristics of vaginal tissue, but the square-shaped mesh offers stronger support due to its higher stress-strain curve. Overall, meshes printed with medical-grade PCL show superior performance compared to non-medical-grade meshes, suggesting that they are a promising avenue for future advancements in the field of POP repair.

AB  - Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) often cause worse neurological outcomes in younger hosts. Throughout childhood, the brain undergoes extensive development and refinement to produce functional neural networks. Network function is maintained partly with the help of neural stem cells (NSCs) that replace neuronal and glia subtypes in the two neurogenic niches of the brain (the hippocampus and subventricular zone). Accumulating evidence suggests that viruses disrupt NSC function in adulthood and infancy, but the in vivo impact of childhood infections on acute and long-term NSC function is unknown. Using a juvenile mouse model of measles virus (MeV) infection, where only mature neurons in the brain are infected, we defined the effects of the antiviral immune response on NSCs from juvenile to adult stages of life. We found that (a) virus persists in the brains of survivors despite an anti-viral immune response; (b) NSC numbers decrease dramatically during early infection, but ultimately stabilize in adult survivors; (c) infection is associated with mild apoptosis throughout the juvenile brain, but NSC proliferation is unchanged; (d) the loss of NSC numbers is dependent upon the stage of NSC differentiation; and (e) immature neurons increase early during infection, concurrent with depletion of NSC pools. Collectively, we show that NSCs are exquisitely sensitive to the inflammatory microenvironment created during neuron-restricted MeV infection in juveniles, responding with an early loss of NSCs but increased neurogenesis. These studies provide insight into potential cellular mechanisms associated with long-term neurological deficits in survivors of childhood CNS infections.

AB  - As many as 17 subspecies are currently recognized for the lesser false vampire, Megaderma spasma along its wide distributional range, from India to Southeast Asia. Cytogenetic studies have been so far restricted to specimens from only four geographical regions, namely Malaysia, Thailand, China and the Philippines. We examined the karyotypes of M. spasma medium from Peninsular Malaysia and M. s. trifolium from Malaysian Borneo with conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques, using whole chromosome painting probes from the vespertilionid Myotis myotis and the hipposiderid Aselliscus stoliczkanus. Both Megaderma subspecies showed the same diploid chromosome number, 2n = 38, but differed concerning interstitial heterochromatic segments and number and shape of heterochromatic B chromosomes. Comparison with published data revealed that the Bornean specimens' karyotype best resembled the chromosomal set of the Chinese specimen. In contrast. a single male specimen from Malaysian Borneo showed a different karyotype (2n = 40) without B chromosomes and interstitial heterochromatin, indicating that it may represent a cryptic, yet unknown Megaderma species.

AB  - Caffeine is a characteristic secondary metabolite in tea plants. It confers tea beverage with unique flavor and excitation effect on human body. The pathway of caffeine biosynthesis has been generally established, but the mechanism of caffeine transport remains unclear. Here, eight members of purine permeases (PUPs) were identified in tea plants. They had diverse expression patterns in different tissues, suggesting their broad roles in caffeine metabolism. In this study, F1 strains of "Longjing43" male x "Baihaozao" female and different tea cultivars were used as materials to explore the correlation between caffeine content and gene expression. The heterologous expression systems of yeast and Arabidopsis were applied to explore the function of CsPUPs. Correlation analysis showed that the expressions of CsPUP1, CsPUP3.1, and CsPUP10.1 were significantly negatively correlated with caffeine content in tea leaves of eight strains and six cultivars. Furthermore, subcellular localization revealed that the three CsPUPs were not only located in plasma membrane but also widely distributed as circular organelles in cells. Functional complementation assays in yeast showed that the three CsPUPs could partly or completely rescue the defective function of fcy2 mutant in caffeine transport. Among them, transgenic yeast of CsPUP10.1 exhibited the strongest transport capacity for caffeine. Consistent phenotypes and functions were further identified in the CsPUP10.1-over-expression Arabidopsis lines. Taken together, it suggested that CsPUPs were involved in caffeine transport in tea plants. Potential roles of CsPUPs in the intracellular transport of caffeine among different subcellular organelles were proposed. This study provides a theoretical basis for further research on the PUP genes and new insights for caffeine metabolism in tea plants.

AB  - In this study, the optimization of additives (polypyrrole magnetite nanocomposites (Ppy/Fe3O4) and antagonists (humic acid and arsenic oxide)) for simultaneous recovery of biomethane and phosphate release from enhanced anaerobic co-digestion of okra waste and pig manure was investigated. The pre-determined dosages of additives from our previous studies were used for the batch anaerobic digestion at different ratios under mesophilic conditions based on the two level-four factors central composite design (CCD) response surface methodology (RSM). After the anaerobic digestion processes, the biomethane yields were recorded and the digestates were characterized to determine the quantity of soluble phosphates. Both the independent variables and the responses were used to model and optimize the biogas yield and phosphate release conditions. The result showed that the maximum biomethane yield and P release were respectively 502.743 mLCH4/gVS and 168.674 mg/L at the optimum conditions of Ppy/Fe3O4 (20.0014 mg/L), HA (5.0018 mg/L), As (1.448 mg/L) and co-digestion (25.0001%). The response models predicted biomethane yield and P release to be 528.635 mLCH4/gVS and 164.405 mg/L respectively. All the response models were highly significant with appropriate goodness of fit and had prediction differences of 4.90% and 2.597% respectively for both biomethane yield and P release. Although both the accelerants and antagonists had influences on the anaerobic digestion processes by achieving enhanced biomethane production and P release, the influence of long exposure of anaerobic digestion processes to these additives on both responses is recommended for further investigation.

AB  - This study addresses the optimization of juice extraction from sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) to meet the growing demand for healthy, natural food products. An upgraded screw press with a self-regulating pressure adjustment mechanism was developed and evaluated. Four spring types (wire diameters, 1-6 mm; maximum forces, 47.5-800 N) and screw rotation speeds ranging from 140 to 200 rpm were investigated for their effects on juice yield, compression density, internal pressure, and power consumption using sea buckthorn fruits. The results indicated that springs with higher maximum forces yielded greater juice outputs. The highest juice yield of 47% was achieved using a spring with a 3 mm wire diameter and 630 N maximum force (Spring 4) at 185 rpm. This configuration also demonstrated an optimal balance between compression density (948 kg/m3) and internal pressure (320 Pa) while maintaining the lowest power consumption (142 W). The internal pressure within the pressing chamber increased with both spring force and rotation speed. While Spring 2 generated the highest internal pressures (up to 570 Pa at 200 rpm), Spring 4 achieved moderate internal pressures, suggesting an effective pressure transmission. Spring 4 exhibited the lowest power consumption despite the high juice yields and compression densities. The study concludes that utilizing Spring 4 at 185 rpm optimizes the juice extraction efficiency while minimizing energy use. Equipment designs allowing the fine-tuning of pressure and rotation speed can significantly enhance the production efficiency in sea buckthorn juice extraction and potentially in other fruit-juice-processing applications.

AB  - Women are at a higher risk of cognitive impairments and Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly after the menopause, when the estrous cycle becomes irregular and diminishes. Numerous studies have shown that estrogen deficiency, especially estradiol (E2) deficiency, plays a key role in this phenomenon. Recently, a novel polymeric drug, hyaluronic acid-17 beta-estradiol conjugate (HA-E2), has been introduced for the delivery of E2 to brain tissues. Studies have indicated that HA-E2 crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and facilitates a prolonged E2 release profile while lowering the risk of estrogen-supplement-related side effects. In this study, we used ovariohysterectomy (OHE) rats, a postmenopausal cognitive deficit model, to explore the effect of a 2-week HA-E2 treatment (210 ng/kg body weight, twice a week) on the cholinergic septo-hippocampal innervation system, synaptic transmission in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cognitive improvements. Our study revealed an 11% rise in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression in both the medial septal nucleus (MS nucleus) and the hippocampus, along with a 14-18% increase in dendritic spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, following HA-E2 treatment in OHE rats. These enhancements prompted the recovery of cognitive functions such as spatial learning and memory. These findings suggest that HA-E2 may prevent and improve estrogen-deficiency-induced cognitive impairment and AD.

AB  - The floating freshwater fern Azolla is the only plant that retains an endocyanobiont, Nostoc azollae (aka Anabaena azollae), during its sexual and asexual reproduction. The increased interest in Azolla as a potential source of food and its unique evolutionary history have raised questions about its cyanotoxin content and genome. Cyanotoxins are potent toxins synthesized by cyanobacteria which have an anti-herbivore effect but have also been linked to neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, liver and kidney failure, muscle paralysis, and other severe health issues. In this study, we investigated 48 accessions of Azolla-Nostoc symbiosis for the presence of genes coding microcystin, nodularin, cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin, and BLAST analysis for anatoxin-a. We also investigated the presence of the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in Azolla and N. azollae through LC-MS/MS. The PCR amplification of saxitoxin, cylindrospermospin, microcystin, and nodularin genes showed that Azolla and its cyanobiont N. azollae do not have the genes to synthesize these cyanotoxins. Additionally, the matching of the anatoxin-a gene to the sequenced N. azollae genome does not indicate the presence of the anatoxin-a gene. The LC-MS/MS analysis showed that BMAA and its isomers AEG and DAB are absent from Azolla and Nostoc azollae. Azolla therefore has the potential to safely feed millions of people due to its rapid growth while free-floating on shallow fresh water without the need for nitrogen fertilizers.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are readily ingested by organisms and tend to accumulate in intestinal tissues, posing potential health risks. However, most existing MP extraction methods are designed for aquatic organisms and are unsuitable for terrestrial organisms with high lipid content. In this study, we developed an efficient Fenton oxidation-based method for extracting MPs from mouse intestinal tissues. Optimal conditions for iron precipitate removal were established at pH 0.8, with incubation at 50 degrees C for 2 h. Key digestion parameters (H2O2 dosage, FeSO4 dosage, maximum reaction temperature, and secondary incubation time) were optimized using response surface analysis. The optimal conditions were: 37 mL of 18.5 % H2O2, 20 mL of 0.024 mol/L FeSO4, a maximum reaction temperature of 60 degrees C, and a secondary incubation time of 35 h. Under these conditions, a digestion rate of 95 % was achieved, with minimal MP degradation. Specifically, mass loss was 2.5 %, size reduction was 2.78 %, the carbonyl index increased by 12.9 %, and infrared spectral similarity remained at 95 %. The method was also successfully applied to intestinal tissues from chickens, ducks, cows, and pigs, achieving digestion rates between 93 % and 95 %. These results demonstrate the method's effectiveness for extracting MPs from terrestrial organisms while minimal degradation, offering a valuable tool for MP research and health risk assessment.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the effects of dietary monoglycerides and tributyrin on performance, blood metabolites, and intestinal health function in nursery piglets. A total of 96 crossbred entire male piglets (7.70 & PLUSMN; 0.49 kg) were allotted for 35 d in a complete block design to one of four treatments: (1) negative control (NC): no feed additive, (2) positive control (PC) containing 60 mg halquinol/kg diet, (3) diet containing 2 g monoglyceride blend/kg diet (MGD), and (4) diet containing 2 g tributyrin/kg diet (TBT). The growth phases were defined as pre-starter (day 0-20), and starter (day 20-35). No treatment effect on performance was observed. Pre-starter piglets fed NC showed higher diarrhoea occurrence (DO) than those fed PC and TBT (p < .05), and a lower DO was observed in starter piglets fed PC, MGD, and TBT compared to NC (p < .001). Pre-starter piglets fed TBT showed lower alkaline phosphatase concentration than in PC, and a lower aspartate aminotransferase concentration compared to PC and MGD (p < .05). Plasma urea concentration was higher in starter piglets fed MGD than in NC and TBT (p < .05). Piglets fed TBT showed higher jejunum villous height:crypt depth ratio than other treatments (p < .05). Piglets on MGD had higher ileum cellular infiltrate than in PC but lower Enterobacteriaceae family in the piglets jejunum compared to other treatments (p < .05). Our results suggest that dietary tributyrin improves intestinal function structures, without affecting the microbial population as exhibited in nursery piglets fed monoglyceride-based diets.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is a common additive in food products, which poses a potential concern to animal and human health when it is in excess. Here, we investigated the relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and pyroptosis in Cu-induced toxicity of jejunum in vivo and in vitro. In in vivo experiments, excess intake of dietary Cu caused ER cavity expansion, elevated fluorescence signals of GRP78 and Caspase-1, and increased the mRNA and protein expression levels related to ER stress and pyroptosis in pig jejunal epithelium. Simultaneously, similar effects were observed in IPEC-J2 cells under excess Cu treatment. Importantly, 4-phenylbutyric acid (ER stress inhibitor) and MKC-3946 (IRE1 alpha inhibitor) significantly inhibited the ER stress-triggered IRE1 alpha-XBP1 pathway, which also alleviated the Cu-induced pyroptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. In general, these results suggested that ER stress participated in regulating Cu-induced pyroptosis in jejunal epithelial cells via the IRE1 alpha-XBP1 pathway, which provided a novel view into the toxicology of Cu.

AB  - Species within the Camellia sect. Theaceae of the genus Camellia, mianly distributed in Southwestern China, including Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan, processes abundant wild germplasm for providing possible commercial cultivars breeding. Anthocyanins are an important functional component in tea and have been widespread attention. Two tea plants with different leaf colors: 'P113'from Camellia tachangensis F. C. Zhang and the buds and leaves are light red, 'C8' from C. sinensis (L.) Kuntze and the buds are green and the leaves purple. However, the molecular mechanism of the purple difference in bud between the C. tachangensis 'P113' and C.sinensis 'C8' has not been revealed. In this study, the anthocyanin components and the corresponding molecular mechanisms in the purple buds of C. tachangensis 'P113' and C. sinensis 'C8' were performed comparative analysis by using the transcriptome and metabolome analysis. The results showed that the relative contents of anthocyanin related metabolites were significantly different in bud between 'P113' and 'C8'. The relative content of pelargonidin, delphinidin and total proanthocyanidins in 'C8' buds was significantly higher than that in 'P113'. The expression level of the homologous genes in CHS, F3'5'H, ANS, LAR and ANR were significant difference between 'P113' and 'C8' in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway, and the expression level of homologous genes in 'C8' was higher than that in 'P113'. These differential genes have different regulatory effects on their related metabolites. The results can help us to understand the physiological metabolism of the purple difference in bud between C.tachangensis and C.sinensis, and help us to choose excellent purple tea plant strains from the different Species within the Sect. Thea.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are commonly at high risk for developing cognitive dysfunction. Antidiabetic agents might be repurposed for targeting cognitive dysfunction in addition to modulation on glucose homeostasis. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) on cognitive function in T2DM.MethodsPubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were systematically searched from inception to September 30, 2023. Weighted mean differences were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) fixed or random effects model based on the degree of heterogeneity among studies. Heterogeneity was evaluated using a Chi-squared test and quantified with Higgins I2. Sensitivity analysis was performed with the leave-one-out method, and publication bias was evaluated according to Begg's and Egger's tests.ResultsSix clinical trials involving 5,178 participants were included in the pooled analysis. Administration of DPP-4i generally correlated with an increase of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (1.09, 95% CI: 0.22 to 1.96). DPP-4i alleviated cognitive impairment in the copying skill subdomain of MMSE (0.26, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.40). Treatment with DPP-4i also resulted in an increase of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scores (0.82, 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.34). However, DPP-4i produced no significant effects on Barthel Activities of Daily Living (BADL) scores (0.37, 95% CI: -1.26 to 1.99) or other test scores.ConclusionsDPP-4i treatment favourably improved cognitive function in patients with T2DM. Further trials with larger samples should be performed to confirm these estimates and investigate the association of different DPP-4i with cognitive function among diabetic patients.Trial registration in PROSPEROCRD42023430873.

AB  - Simple Summary Sows in most breeding herds worldwide have larger litters than several years ago. One of the most important problems when using these genetics is the prolonged duration of farrowing, which can cause postpartum complications in sows and increase the percentage of stillborn piglets per litter. In this retrospective study, we found that the farrowing duration of sows kept in a free farrowing system in a tropical environment was associated with several factors. A high number of piglets born per litter, a high parity number, parturition during working hours, and high temperature and humidity in the 7 days before parturition led to a prolonged farrowing duration. In these sows, farrowing was longer than the acceptable farrowing duration, which may cause a higher number of stillborn piglets. Therefore, management for sows during the perinatal period needs to be considered, especially in hyperprolific and older sows, as well as those that farrow during working hours. The ongoing selection for increased litter size has had significant impacts on sow husbandry practice. The present study investigated factors associated with farrowing duration and the proportion of sows that had prolonged farrowing in modern hyperprolific sows kept in a free farrowing system in a tropical environment. Farrowing data from 2493 Landrace x Yorkshire cross-bred sows in a commercial swine herd in Thailand were included in the study. The time of farrowing, parity number, litter size, and the birth status of each piglet were recorded. Farrowing duration was analysed using multiple analyses of variance. Total number of piglets born per litter (TB), parity, and time onset of farrowing were included in the statistical models. On average, TB, piglets born alive, and farrowing duration were 13.7, 12.1, and 221.0 min, respectively. Of these sows, 26.4% had TB >= 16 and 21.7% had a prolonged farrowing duration (>= 300 min). Farrowing duration was positively correlated with TB (r = 0.141, p < 0.001), percentage of stillborn (SB) piglets per litter (r = 0.259, p < 0.001), percentage of mummified foetuses (MF) per litter (r = 0.049, p = 0.015), piglet birth weight (r = 0.068, p < 0.001), and litter birth weight (r = 0.041, p = 0.043). The proportion of SB per litter was higher and piglet birth weight lower in litters that had >= 16 TB than those with 8-12 TB (p < 0.05). The farrowing duration of sows with parity numbers 5-7 (247.7 +/- 5.1 min) and 8-10 (237.1 +/- 5.1 min) was longer than that of sows with parity numbers 1 (188.3 +/- 5.2 min) and 2-4 (214.3 +/- 3.9 min) (p < 0.05). Sows that had started farrowing during working hours had longer farrowing durations (229.3 +/- 3.6 min) than those that had started farrowing during non-working hours (217.6 +/- 3.4 min, p = 0.017). In multiparous sows, the duration of farrowing was positively correlated with the maximum temperature (r = 0.056, p = 0.012) and the maximum temperature-humidity index (r = 0.059, p = 0.008) in the 7 days before farrowing. The present data confirm that TB, sow parity, and time of onset of farrowing are significant risk factors for a prolonged farrowing.

AB  - Spatial memory declines with age, and this decline is associated with decreased testosterone levels. However, the specific role of the androgen receptor in spatial memory performance in both young and aged rats remains largely unexplored. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic androgen receptor blockade on spatial memory performance in young and aged male rats. Young (3 months old) and aged (21 months old) Wistar rats were assigned to one of three experimental groups: control, vehicle-, or flutamide-treated (10 mg/kg SC for 14 days). Spatial memory was evaluated using the Barnes maze (Days 8-14 of flutamide administration). The phases of spatial memory acquisition (4 daily trials/4 days) and retention (1 trial/day, 3 days after acquisition) were evaluated. The results indicated that older animals took longer to find the goal, traveled greater distances, and moved more slowly than their younger counterparts in the Barnes maze, regardless of treatment. During the acquisition phase, flutamide administration delayed learning in both young and aged animals. Specifically, flutamide-treated animals exhibited delayed learning during the assessment of overnight forgetting (trial 1 on each day of the acquisition phase). During the retention phase, an age-related effect was observed in the flutamide-treated groups. These findings suggest that androgen receptor blockade induces cognitive deficits in both young and aged male rats, supporting the modulatory role of endogenous androgens in memory function.

AB  - Spastin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, is known to be important for neurite outgrowth. However, the role of spastin post-translational modification, particularly its phosphorylation regulation in neuronal outgrowth, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of eliminating spastin phosphorylation on the neu-rite outgrowth of rat hippocampal neurons. To accomplish this, we constructed a spastin mutant with eleven potential phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine. The phosphorylation levels of the wildtype spastin (WT) and the mutant (11A) were then detected using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. The spastin constructs were transfected into COS7 cells for the observation of microtubule severing, and into rat hippocampal neurons for the detection of neuronal outgrowth. The results showed that compared to the spastin WT, the phosphorylation levels were sig-nificantly reduced in the spastin 11A mutant. The spastin mutant 11A impaired its ability to promote neurite length, branching, and complexity in hippocampal neurons, but did not affect its ability to sever microtubules in COS7 cells. In conclusion, the data suggest that mutations at multiple phosphorylation sites of spastin do not impair its microtubule cleavage ability in COS7 cells, but reduce its ability to promote neurite outgrowth in rat hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a major economically significant bacterial respiratory pig pathogen, and whole cell vaccines are used to prevent disease. However, there is little data available on multi-serovar whole cell vaccine protection. Therefore, we determined the protective efficacies of a whole-cell A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 1 and 2 vaccine comprising ApxI-III toxins (C-vaccine, Coglapix (R), Ceva, France) against serovars 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9/11, and 13. The infection doses used induced disease representative of endemic field conditions, and standard protocols were used for all studies. Protection against homologous serovars 1 and 2 significantly reduced lung lesion scores (LLS) compared to positive controls: p = 0.00007 and p = 0.00124, respectively. The protection against heterologous serovars 4, 5, 6, 7, 9/11, and 13 also significantly reduced LLS: range p = 2.9 x 10(-10) to p = 0.00953. As adjudged by the estimated random effect, reproducibility between studies was high. A highly significant serovar-independent reduction of pathological lung lesions by the C-vaccine was found for all the serovars tested (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9/11, and 13). We conclude that the C-vaccine gives high serovar-independent protection against disease and is suitable for this use in the field.

AB  - There are substantial differences in autonomic nervous system activation among heart (cardiac) failure (CF) patients. The effect of acute CF on autonomic function has not been well explored. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of experimental acute CF on heart rate variability (HRV). Twenty-four female pigs with a mean body weight of 45 kg were used. Acute severe CF was induced by global myocardial hypoxia. In each subject, two 5-min electrocardiogram segments were analyzed and compared: before the induction of myocardial hypoxia and >60 min after the development of severe CF. HRV was assessed by time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear analytic methods. The induction of acute CF led to a significant decrease in cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in heart rate. The development of acute CF was associated with a significant reduction in the standard deviation of intervals between normal beats (50.8 [20.5-88.1] ms versus 5.9 [2.4-11.7] ms, p < 0.001). Uniform HRV reduction was also observed in other time-domain and major nonlinear analytic methods. Similarly, frequency-domain HRV parameters were significantly changed. Acute severe CF induced by global myocardial hypoxia is associated with a significant reduction in HRV.

AB  - Avian species are used as model systems in research and have contributed to ground-breaking concepts in developmental biology, immunology, genetics, virology, cancer and cell biology. The chicken in particular is an important research model and an agricultural animal as a major contributor to animal protein resources for the global population. The development of genome editing methods, including CRISPR/Cas9, to mediate germline engineering of the avian genome will have important applications in biomedical, agricultural and biotechnological activities. Notably, these precise genome editing tools have the potential to enhance avian health and productivity by identifying and validating beneficial genetic variants in bird populations. Here, we present a concise description of the existing methods and current applications of the genome editing tools in bird species, focused on chickens, with attention on animal use and welfare issues for each of the techniques presented.

AB  - Chronic neuroinflammation has been shown to exert adverse influences on the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with the release of abundant proinflammatory mediators by excessively activated microglia, causing synaptic dysfunction, neuronal degeneration, and memory deficits. Thus, the prevention of microglial activation-associated neuroinflammation is important target for deterring neurodegenerative disorders. Peony seed oil (PSO) is a new food resource, rich in alpha-linolenic acid, the precursor of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, which exhibit anti-inflammatory properties by altering cell membrane phospholipid fatty acid compositions, disrupting lipid rafts, and inhibiting the activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B. However, few studies have examined the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of PSO in AD, and the relevant molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Presenilinl/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice display obvious AD-like phenotypes, such as neuroinflammatory responses, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive deficits. Here, we assessed the potential neuroprotective effects of PSO against neuroinflammation-mediated cognitive deficits in PS cDKO using behavioral tests and molecular biologic analyses. Our study demonstrated that PSO suppressed microglial activation and neuroinflammation through the down-regulation of proinflammatory mediators, such as inducible NOS, COX-2, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Further, PSO significantly lessened memory impairment by reversing hyperphosphorylated tau and synaptic proteins deficits in PS cDKO mice. Importantly, PSO's therapeutic effects on cognitive deficits were due to inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses mediated by NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Taken together, PSO may represent an effective dietary supplementation to restrain the neurodegenerative processes of AD.

AB  - As mining engineering progresses into the deep excavation phase, the intensification of high pressure, high temperature, strong disturbances, and complex geological conditions becomes increasingly prominent. Researchers perform stability analysis on the excavation area to reduce potential safety hazards during the extraction process. Developing a detailed numerical calculation model that accurately reflects the true geological structure is essential for numerical simulation analysis in mining engineering. Based on the excellent 3D geological modeling capabilities of 3D Mine software, this paper introduces a new 3D geological and numerical unified modeling method (3DMine-Rhino-HyperMesh) involving multi-software coupling and details the specific steps and concepts of this modeling approach. Subsequently, using a certain open-pit mine in Panzhihua as a backdrop, a detailed geological and numerical unified model is established, reflecting the true geological structure of the mining area, and the potential failure mechanisms of the mine slope are analyzed. The results indicate that the modeling method aligns well with the actual geological conditions, enhancing the grid quality of the numerical model and offering a new modeling approach for simulating and analyzing large complex geological entities in mining operations.

AB  - Assisted reproduction technology (ART) procedures are often impacted by post-ovulatory aging (POA), which can lead to reduced fertilization rates and impaired embryo development. This study used RNA sequencing analysis and experimental validation to study the similarities and differences between in vivo- and vitro-matured porcine oocytes before and after POA. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between fresh in vivo-matured oocyte (F_vivo) and aged in vivo-matured oocyte (A_vivo) and DEGs between fresh in vitro-matured oocyte (F_vitro) and aged in vitro-matured oocyte (A_vitro) were intersected to explore the co-effects of POA. It was found that "organelles", especially "mitochondria", were significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The expression of genes related to the "electron transport chain" and "cell redox homeostasis" pathways related to mitochondrial function significantly showed low expression patterns in both A_vivo and A_vitro groups. Weighted correlation network analysis was carried out to explore gene expression modules specific to A_vivo. Trait-module association analysis showed that the red modules were most associated with in vivo aging. There are 959 genes in the red module, mainly enriched in "RNA binding", "mRNA metabolic process", etc., as well as in GO terms, and "spliceosome" and "nucleotide excision repair" pathways. DNAJC7, IK, and DDX18 were at the hub of the gene regulatory network. Subsequently, the functions of DDX18 and DNAJC7 were verified by knocking down their expression at the germinal vesicle (GV) and Metaphase II (MII) stages, respectively. Knockdown at the GV stage caused cell cycle disorders and increase the rate of abnormal spindle. Knockdown at the MII stage resulted in the inefficiency of the antioxidant melatonin, increasing the level of intracellular oxidative stress, and in mitochondrial dysfunction. In summary, POA affects the organelle function of oocytes. A_vivo oocytes have some unique gene expression patterns. These genes may be potential anti-aging targets. This study provides a better understanding of the detailed mechanism of POA and potential strategies for improving the success rates of assisted reproductive technologies in pigs and other mammalian species.

AB  - This study investigates the intriguing link between green bond pricing and ESG performance using a comprehensive dataset of 13,199 monthly green bond observations between 2011 and 2019. The findings reveal a notable negative green bond premium of 11 basis points, which is consistent with prior literature when the sample is divided by issuer type, namely government and corporate. By utilizing country-level ESG scores, the study sheds light on the global relationship between ESG performance and green bond spread, unveiling that countries with strong ESG performance tend to exhibit lower green bond spreads. Additionally, better environmental performance correlates with lower green bond spreads, while countries facing climate risks tend to exhibit higher bond spreads. These results lend support to the proposed hypothesis, and robustness confirmed through additional testing. Overall, green corporate bonds are associated with lower risk levels than non-green corporate bonds, given that the former are issued to finance environmental projects. Conversely, for government-issued bonds, higher green bond costs may suggest the financing of white elephant projects favored by governments.

AB  - Mezoneuron benthamianum (Leguminosae-caesalpinioideae family), is widely used across West Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, and inflammatory diseases. This study is aimed at investigating the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of extracts and isolated compounds from Mezoneuron benthamianum leaf and root. The pulverized leaf (1 kg) was extracted by maceration with dichloromethane and methanol to give the dichloromethane (MBLD) and methanol (MBLM) extracts, while the root (2 kg) samples were extracted using dichloromethane and methanol (1:1) to give the dichloromethane-methanol extract (MBRDM) which was further partitioned to give the hexane (MBRH), ethyl acetate (MBRE) and methanol (MBRM) extracts respectively. The leaf methanol extract (MBLM) was fractionated using column chromatography (70-230 mesh size) which led to the isolation of compound 1. The extracts and isolated compounds were subjected to in- vitro antioxidant assay with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and a- amylase inhibitory assay using porcine pancreatic a- amylase respectively. FT-IR spectroscopic analysis compound 1 showed strong peaks at 1678 and 1612 cm-1 suggesting the presence of a carbonyl and an aromatic group respectively. 1 H NMR spectroscopic analysis of compound 1 showed two peaks at 3.80 (3H, s) and 7.04 ppm (2H, s) indicating methoxy and aromatic protons respectively. 13 C NMR also confirmed the presence of the methoxy peak at 50.8 ppm, four aromatic peaks at 108.76, 120.19, 131.25, 145.14 ppm indicating a para-disubstituted benzene ring, and a carbonyl peak at 167.80 ppm, this led to the elucidation of compound 1 known as methyl gallate. The antioxidant activities of the extracts and compounds showed that MBLM (IC50 50 = 112.0 mu g/ml) and MBRE (IC50 50 = 91.84 mu g/ml) had the highest activity of the leaf and root extracts respectively while methyl gallate (IC50 50 = 91.84 mu g/ml) had lower activity than gallic acid (IC50 50 = 27.4 mu g/ml), ascorbic acid (IC50 50 = 43.94 mu g/ml) and BHT (68.94 mu g/ml). The a- amylase inhibitory activities showed that MBLD (IC50 50 = 27.4 mu g/ml), MBRE (IC50 50 = 72.2 mu g/ml), gallic acid (IC50 50 = 27.4 mu g/ml) and methyl gallate (IC50 50 = 43.9 mu g/ml) had higher activity than the standard drug acarbose (IC50 50 = 378.2 mu g/ml). For the In silico study, methyl gallate was docked into the active site of the targeted diabetic proteins; human pancreatic alpha-amylase, pig pancreatic alpha-amylase, and tetrameric IIB-HSDI. The results showed that methyl gallate had good interactions with the proteins, with binding affinities of-4.8,-4.8 and-6.5 kcal/mol respectively. Furthermore, in silico pharmacokinetics and toxicology properties of methyl gallate using the AdmetSAR and SwissADME software showed that the compound has good pharmacokinetic properties and it is generally non-toixc. This research has revealed detailed chemical and biological studies on Mezoneuron benthamianum and its isolated compound as an antioxidant and antidiabetic. (c) 2024 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Time-related cognitive function refers to the capacity of the brain to store, extract, and process specific information. Previous studies demonstrated that the cerebellar cortex participates in advanced cognitive functions, but the role of the cerebellar cortex in cognitive functions is unclear. We established a behavioral model using classical eyeblink conditioning to study the role of the cerebellar cortex in associative learning and memory and the underlying mechanisms. We performed an investigation to determine whether eyeblink conditioning could be established by placing the stimulating electrode in the middle cerebellar peduncle. Behavior training was performed using a microcurrent pulse as a conditioned stimulus to stimulate the middle cerebellar peduncle and corneal blow as an unconditioned stimulus. After 10 consecutive days of training, a conditioned response was successfully achieved in the Delay, Trace-200-ms, and Trace-300-ms groups of guinea pigs, with acquisition rates of >60%, but the Trace-400-ms and control groups did not achieve a conditioned stimulus-related blink conditioned response. It could be a good model for studying the function of the cerebellum during the establishment of eyeblink conditioning.

AB  - BACKGROUND Tea, second only to water, is one of the most regularly consumed drinks in the world. Its potentially beneficial effects on general health may be enormously important. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) now allows clinicians to examine the acute retinal morphological changes caused by black tea consumption. The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute impacts of a Camellia sinensis fermentation end-product (black tea) on retinal microvasculature in healthy individuals using OCTA.
   RESULTS In this study, 60 healthy people were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 30) received black tea (2 mg/250 mL of water) and group 2 (n = 30) received only 250 mL of water. Following consumption, AngioVue Analytics software automatically analyzed the foveal, parafoveal, perifoveal macular superficial and deep vascular plexus densities, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, FAZ perimeter and foveal vessel density in a 300 mu m wide region around the FAZ (FD-300). Male-to-female ratios were 19:11 and 15:15 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.217). Mean age was 33.27 +/- 7.92 years in group 1 and 31.00 +/- 7.30 years in group 2 (P = 0.254). Changes in foveal, perifoveal and parafoveal macular vessel density between groups 1 and 2 were not statistically significant. In addition, no significant differences regarding FAZ, FAZ perimeter and FD-300 were observed.
   CONCLUSION There were no acute effects of black tea on macular microcirculation in healthy individuals. The authors, however, believe that this study could serve as a model for future research on the relationship between regular tea consumption and general ocular physiology.

AB  - A new subspecies of giant sengi or elephant-shrew, first documented in 2008, is described from northern coastal Kenya. All five currently described species and most known subspecies of Rhynchocyon are compared to this new lineage. Molecular analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear markers from the single DNA sample available for the new lineage show differences from other forms and reveal a close relationship with the allopatric golden-rumped sengi R. chrysopygus (0.43% divergence at the 12S mitochondrial locus). This level of 12S divergence is similar to that between other subspecies pairs within Rhynchocyon. Based on three voucher specimens and 843 images from camera traps, the new lineage is similar to R. chrysopygus in the rufous-maroon sides and shoulders but is distinguished by the lack of the golden rump, the presence of jet-black distal rump and thighs, dark dorsal line, and a pronounced nuchal crest of hairs. Though it also shows superficial pelage similarities to two Tanzania species, R. udzungwensis and the dark coastal form of R. cirnei macrurus, the new form has differences in pelage coloration that are clearly diagnosable from all other taxa. This new lineage has an allopatric distribution to all known Rhynchocyon taxa, with the closest congener being R. chrysopygus located 140 km apart. We estimate a potential range size for the new taxon of similar to 1980 km(2) in the Boni and Dodori National Reserves with habitat consisting of mixed thickets and dry forests. Because of its close genetic relationship with R. chrysopygus, its allopatric distribution, and divergent coloration, the new subspecies is designated Rhynchocyon chrysopygus mandelai. The previously described populations of R. chrysopygus from southern coastal Kenya are now designated R. chrysopygus chrysopygus. As the current severe political insecurity in the area threatens the new taxon, we hope that its description will help establish immediate conservation priorities and action for the subspecies and its habitat.

TI  - Alterations of the gut microbial community structure modulates the Th17 cells response in a rat model of asphyxial cardiac arrest

AB  - Th17 cells triggered inflammation is a critical element in cerebral ischemic injury, and the gut microbiota intricately impacts T lymphocytes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the gut microbiota involves in cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) induced-brain injury through Th17 cells. The present study investigated the interaction between gut microbiota and Th17 cells in a rat model. We observed that CA/CPR induced the alterations of the gut microbial community structure, and elevated the level of IL-17 in the serum, and a slight infiltration of Th17 cells into the brain. The Th17 cells were increased significantly in the pe-ripheral blood, 28.33 +/- 6.18% of these Th17 cells were derived from the Peyer's patches of small intestine. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from rats with CA/CPR induced Th17 cell response, promoting hippocampal cell apoptosis and declining learning ability and memory in recipient rats. Taken together, CA/CPR-induced alterations of the gut microbial community structure stimulated Th17 cell response which aggravated brain injury.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is used in the treatment of degenerative spinal disease and vertebral fractures, spine fusion, dental surgery, and facial surgery. However, high doses are associated with side effects such as inflammation and osteophytes. In this study, we performed spinal fusion surgery on mini-pigs using BMP-2 and a HA/beta-TCP hydrogel carrier, and evaluated the degree of fusion and osteophyte growth according to time and dosage. Increasing the dose of BMP-2 led to a significantly higher fusion rate than was observed in the control group, and there was no significant difference between the 8-week and 16-week samples. We also found that the HA + beta-TCP hydrogel combination helped maintain the rate of BMP-2 release. In conclusion, the BMP-2-loaded HA/beta-TCP hydrogel carrier used in this study overcame the drawback of potentially causing side effects when used at high concentrations by enabling the sustained release of BMP-2. This method is also highly efficient, since it provides mineral matter to accelerate the fusion rate of the spine and improve bone quality.

AB  - B ACKGROUND : Evidence linking gaseous air pollution to late-life brain health is mixed. O BJECTIVE : We explored associations between exposure to gaseous pollutants and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants, with attention to the influence of exposure estimation method and confounding by site. M ETHODS : We considered data from 1,665 eligible ARIC participants recruited from four US sites in the period 1987-1989 with valid brain MRI data from Visit 5 (2011-2013). We estimated 10-y (2001-2010) mean carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), x ), and and 24-h ozone (O3) 3 ) concentrations at participant addresses, using multiple exposure estimation methods. We estimated site-specific associations between pollutant exposures and brain MRI outcomes (total and regional volumes; presence of microhemorrhages, infarcts, lacunes, and severe white matter hyperintensities), using adjusted linear and logistic regression models. We compared meta-analytically combined site-specific associations analyses that did not account for site. R ESULTS : Within-site exposure distributions varied across exposure estimation methods. Meta-analytic associations were generally not statistically significant regardless of exposure, outcome, or exposure estimation method; point estimates often suggested associations between higher NO2 2 and NOx x and smaller temporal lobe, deep gray, hippocampal, frontal lobe, and Alzheimer disease signature region of interest volumes and between higher CO and smaller temporal and frontal lobe volumes. Analyses that did not account for study site more often yielded significant associations and sometimes different direction of associations. D ISCUSSION : Patterns of local variation in estimated air pollution concentrations differ by estimation method. Although we did not find strong evidence supporting impact of gaseous pollutants on brain changes detectable by MRI, point estimates suggested associations between higher exposure to CO, NOx, x , and NO2 2 and smaller regional brain volumes. Analyses of air pollution and dementia-related outcomes that do not adjust for location likely underestimate uncertainty and may be susceptible to confounding bias. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13906

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematological malignancy, which is the most common and severe acute leukemia in adults. Its occurrence, development and prognosis are affected by many factors, and more research is still needed to further guide its treatment. Here, we found that roundabout3 (ROBO3) was associated with poor prognosis in AML through bioinformatics analysis. We then found that overexpression of ROBO3 promoted AML cell proliferation, adhesion and migration while knockdown of ROBO3 had opposite effects. We subsequently found that ROBO3 regulated CD34 expression in AML cells, and this regulatory effect may be achieved through the Hippo-YAP pathway. The inhibitors of this pathway, K-975 and verteporfin, showed an inhibitory effect on AML cells with high ROBO3 expression. ROBO3 was also found to be significantly increased in bone marrow samples from AML patients. Our research indicates that ROBO3 plays an important role in the development of AML, which suggests that ROBO3 can be a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for AML.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Childhood trauma (CT) can have persistent effects on the brain and is one of the major risk factors for neuropsychiatric diseases in adulthood. Recent advances in the field of epigenetics suggest that epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as regulatory processes involving non-coding RNA are associated with the long-term sequelae of CT. This narrative review summarizes current knowledge on the epigenetic basis of CT and describes studies in animal models and human subjects examining how the epigenome and transcriptome are modified by CT in the brain. It discusses psychological and pharmacological interventions that can counteract epigenetic changes induced by CT and the need to establish longitudinal assessment after CT for developing more effective diagnostics and treatment strategies based on epigenetic targets.

AB  - DNA methylation plays important roles in regulating gene expression during development. However, little is known about the influence of DNA methylation on secondary metabolism during leaf development in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). In this study, we combined the methylome, transcriptome, and metabolome to investigate the dynamic changes in DNA methylation and its potential regulatory roles in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In this study, the level of genomic DNA methylation increased as leaf development progressed from tender to old leaf. It additionally exhibited a similar distribution across the genomic background at the two distinct developmental stages studied. Notably, integrated analysis of transcriptomic and methylomic data showed that DNA hypermethylation primarily occurred in genes of the phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. The effect of methylation on transcription of these secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes was dependent on the location of methylation (i.e., in the promoter, gene or intergenic regions) and the sequence context (i.e., CpG, CHG, or CHH). Changes in the content of catechins and terpenoids were consistent with the changes in gene transcription and the methylation state of structural genes, such as serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferases 1A (SCPL1A), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR), and nerolidol synthase (NES). Our study provides valuable information for dissecting the effects of DNA methylation on regulation of genes involved in secondary metabolism during tea leaf development.

AB  - Navigation through space involves learning and representing relationships between past, current, and future locations. In mammals, this might rely on the hippocampal theta phase code, where in each cycle of the theta oscillation, spatial representations provided by neuronal sequences start behind the animal's true location and then sweep forward. However, the exact relationship between theta phase, represented position and true location remains unclear and even paradoxical. Here, we formalize previous notions of 'spatial' or 'temporal' theta sweeps that have appeared in the literature. We analyze single-cell and population variables in unit recordings from rat CA1 place cells and compare them to model simulations based on each of these schemes. We show that neither spatial nor temporal sweeps quantitatively accounts for how all relevant variables change with running speed. To reconcile these schemes with our observations, we introduce 'behavior-dependent' sweeps, in which theta sweep length and place field properties, such as size and phase precession, vary across the environment depending on the running speed characteristic of each location. These behavior-dependent spatial maps provide a structured heterogeneity that is essential for understanding the hippocampal code.

AB  - Aerobic composting is an efficient method to recover nutrients from animal manure. However, there is considerable variability in the management and maturity criteria used across studies, and a systematic meta-analysis focused on compost maturity is currently lacking. This study investigated the optimal range of startup parameters and practical criteria for manure composting maturity, as well as the effectiveness of in situ technologies in enhancing composting maturity. Most maturity indexes were associated with composting GI, making it an ideal tool for evaluating the maturity of manure composts. GI increased with declined final C/N and (Final C/N)/(Initial C/N) (P < 0.01), and therefore a maturity assessment standard for animal manure composting was proposed: a mature compost has a C/N ratio <= 23 and a GI >= 70, while a highly mature compost has a GI >= 90 and preferably (Final C/N)/(Initial C/N) <= 0.8. Meta-analysis demonstrated that C/N ratio regulation, microbial inoculation and adding biochar and magnesium-phosphate salts are effective strategies for improving compost maturity. Specifically, a greater reduction in the C/N ratio during the composting process is beneficial for improving the maturity of compost product. The optimal startup parameters for composting have been determined, recommending an initial C/N ratio of 20-30 and an initial pH of 6.5-8.5. An initial C/N ratio of 26 was identified as the most suitable for promoting compost degradation and microorganism activity. The present results promoted a composting strategy for producing high-quality compost.

AB  - In this paper we look at non-pharmaceutical treatments for intractable epilepsy based on neurophysiological methods especially with EEG analysis. In summary, there are a number of limbic and thalamo-cortical related structures involved in the processing of musical emotion (exposure), including the amygdala (arousal, expression of mood, fear), hippocampus (memory, regulation of HPA axis, stress), parahippocampal gyrus (recognition, memory retrieval), insula (valence), temporal poles (connectivity), ventral striatum (expectation and experience of reward), orbitofrontal cortex (valence) and cingulate cortex (autonomic regulation). One method is to audify (a form of sonification) EEG activity to find music by feedback to entrain abnormal EEG activity. We discuss various methods and our use of X-System (https://www.x-system.co.uk/) which is a computational model of the musical brain capable of predicting the neurophysiological effects of music. It models structures and pathways related to responses to music, including the cochlea, brain stem, auditory and motor cortex, as well as basal ganglia, cerebellum and limbic structures. It can predict autonomic and endocrine activity as well as the substrates of electrical activity to select music which can regularise EEG abnormalities to decrease epileptic activity and seizures, especially in those unresponsive to antiepileptic medication or invasive treatments.

AB  - Sepsis causes overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, organ dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in survivors. In addition to inflammation, metabolic changes occur according to the stage and severity of the disease. Understanding the role and place of metabolic disturbances in the pathophysiology of sepsis is essential to evaluate the framework of septic patients, predict the syndrome progress, and define the treatment strategies. We investigated the effect of simvastatin on the disease time course and on metabolic alterations, especially with respect to their possible consequences in the CNS of surviving rats. The animals of this study were weighed daily and followed for 10 days to determine the survival rate. In the first experiment, control or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-animals were randomized in 24 h, 48 h, and 10 days after septic induction, for bacterial load determination and quantification of cytokines. In the second experiment, control or CLP-animals were treated or not with simvastatin and randomized in the same three time points for cytokines quantification and assessment of their body metabolism and locomotor activity (at 48 h and 10 days), as well as the evaluation of cytoarchitecture and astrogliosis (at 10 days). The CLP-rats treated with simvastatin showed a reduction in plasma cytokines and improvement in metabolic parameters and locomotor activity, followed by minor alterations compatible with apoptosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin plays a crucial role in restoring energy production, maintaining a hypermetabolic state necessary for the recovery and survival of these CLP-rats.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite of veterinary and public health importance. Infection may lead to abortion in susceptible pregnant animals and women, and potentially fatal health complications in immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we aimed to provide an update on the seroprevalence of, and risk factors for, T. gondii antibodies in cattle from Qena, southern Egypt. Additionally, we investigated if raw milk and serum samples from the same animals reacted similarly in a commercial ELISA, thus potentially reducing the invasiveness of future serosurveillance studies. Cattle serum samples (n = 362) from three locations in the Qena governorate (Qena, Qus, and Al Waqf cities), of both sexes and different ages were collected. From most dairy cows, a corresponding milk sample (n = 154) was additionally obtained. We found that the overall seroprevalence in serum samples was 9.1% (33/362). Increasing age was the sole risk factor identified in our study among all tested parameters (location, age, sex, lactating yes or no). Thus, older cattle (more than 3 years old) exhibited significantly higher rates of T. gondii antibodies (11.7%; p = 0.033, odd ratio = 4.3) in comparison to animals younger than 1 year (2.9%). In the corresponding serum and milk samples, the prevalence was 12.3% (19/154) in serum samples, and 9.7% (15/154) in milk samples, respectively. A high correlation was observed between the two sample types with a concordance of 97.4%, a kappa value of 0.87, and a Pearson r correlation coefficient of 0.85. When the serum ELISA was taken as the gold standard, the milk ELISA had the following characteristics: sensitivity (78.9%), specificity (100%), positive predictive value (100%), negative predictive value (97.1%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.6, p = 0.0011). In this study, we confirmed the frequent occurrence of T. gondii antibodies in cattle in southern Egypt and demonstrated that non-invasive milk samples may be used instead of serum samples for seroprevalence studies in dairy cows.

AB  - The extracts from various types of Camelina sativa plant biomass (camelina seedcake, in situ and in vitro plants) and seedcake-derived lignin solution were prepared. Their composition was characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-free or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI/MALDI MS). The antioxidant/antiradical activity of the extracts was studied using Folin-Ciocalteu method and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The ability of the extracts to inhibit the biodiesel oxidation and to affect the processes of dichromate ions reduction was evaluated. HPLC and LDI/MALDI MS results suggest that all the extracts contain such phenolic compounds as flavonoids (mainly rutin and other quercetin glycosides), hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids. The total phenolic content in the extracts decreased in the following row: seedcake > in situ > in vitro > lignin solution, being in correlation with the DPPH radicals scavenging activity. The camelina seedcake extract, which contained the largest amount of phenols (795.5 mg L-1), was found to effectively decelerate the biodiesel oxidation. Despite the low phenolic content (47.0 mg L-1), the extract from camelina in vitro plant showed the highest hole scavenging capacity in dichromate ion photocatalytic reduction processes. Thus, camelina plant biomass is a promising source of phenolic compounds for various applications.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common drug-resistant form of epilepsy, often accompanied by cognitive and emotional disturbances, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Scorpion Venom Heat-Resistant Synthetic Peptide (SVHRSP), isolated and synthetically derived from scorpion venom, has shown anti-epileptic and neuroprotective potential. This study evaluated the anti-epileptic effects of SVHRSP in a kainic acid (KA)-induced TLE rat model. Our results demonstrated that SVHRSP (0.81 mg/kg/day) reduced the frequency and severity of spontaneous seizures. Behavioral tests showed improved cognitive performance in the novel object recognition, object location, and T-maze tasks, as well as reduced anxiety-like behavior in the open-field test. Moreover, SVHRSP mitigated hippocampal neuronal loss and glial activation. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that SVHRSP upregulates genes involved in adhesion molecule-triggered and axon guidance pathways. Western blotting and immunofluorescence further confirmed that SVHRSP restored dendritic (MAP2), axonal (NFL), and synaptic (PSD95) marker expression, elevated the functionally important L1CAM fragment (L1-70), and increased myelin basic protein-induced serine protease activity responsible for L1-70 generation. Blockade of L1CAM expression diminished the neuroprotective effects of SVHRSP, suggesting a critical role for L1CAM-mediated synapse functions. This study is the first to reveal the therapeutic potential of SVHRSP in TLE via L1CAM-associated mechanisms.

AB  - Organophosphoate (OP) chemicals are known to inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Studying OP poisoning is difficult because common small animal research models have serum carboxylesterase, which contributes to animals' resistance to OP poisoning. Historically, guinea pigs have been used for this research; however, a novel genetically modified mouse strain (KIKO) was developed with nonfunctional serum carboxylase (Es1 KO) and an altered acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene, which expresses the amino acid sequence of the human form of the same protein (AChE KI). KIKO mice were injected with 1xLD50 of an OP nerve agent or vehicle control with or without atropine. After one to three minutes, animals were injected with 35 mg/kg of the currently fielded Reactivator countermeasure for OP poisoning. Postmortem brains were imaged on a Bruker RapifleX ToF/ToF instrument. Data confirmed the presence of increased acetylcholine in OP-exposed animals, regardless of treatment or atropine status. More interestingly, we detected a small amount of Reactivator within the brain of both exposed and unexposed animals; it is currently debated if reactivators can cross the blood-brain barrier. Further, we were able to simultaneously image acetylcholine, the primary affected neurotransmitter, as well as determine the location of both Reactivator and acetylcholine in the brain. This study, which utilized sensitive MALDI-MSI methods, characterized KIKO mice as a functional model for OP countermeasure development.

AB  - The reproductive result of commercial flocks is influenced by rams' reproductive performance, including their sexual behavior. Although there are pharmacological strategies for improving their sexual performance, organic production systems require hormone free strategies. Rams can be conditioned to positive stimuli such as food that triggers a response associated with positive affective state that could influence sexual behavior. Thus, a positive affective state could be an alternative strategy to improve sexual behavior in rams. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare rams' sexual behavior toward an estrous ewe after accessing or not (control) a highly motivating food item (fruit). Initially, the rams' preference to consume bananas or apples was determined, and corneal and rectal temperatures, and heart rate were recorded for 12 rams. The rectal and mean corneal temperature increased after the consumption of the fruits (38.8 +/- 0.05 degrees C vs 39.0 +/- 0.05 degrees C, P = 0.006 and 35.2 +/- 0.17 degrees C vs 36.1 +/- 0.16 degrees C, P = 0.0007 respectively), without significant effects on heart rate. Thereafter, a test was designed to confirm whether they were enough motivated to consume the fruit, when offered close to an unknown subject making deterring behaviors. All rams responded positively to the test, approaching the fruit and consuming it for at least 30 s uninterruptedly in all the tests. For 10 days, rams were daily conditioned to the place where their sexual behavior would be evaluated, by entering a pen to which they were conditioned, in which the ram remained for 20 min with two ewes in the luteal phase immediately after consuming their motivational fruit. Finally, the sexual behavior of each ram was tested with a previous known ewe (in estrous) in two conditions: in the pen where they were conditioned with prior availability of the motivational fruit or in a similar pen to which they were not conditioned, without access to food. In this way, each ram was tested in both conditions with a crossover design. Rams only tended to display more flehmen after eating the positive stimulus than when tested without positive stimulus (P = 0.08). The previous consumption of palatable food did not modify the display of any other sexual behavior. It was concluded that the consumption of a highly motivating food as a positive stimulus did not modify the display of rams' sexual behavior.

AB  - Background: Cryptosporidium is a globally distributed zoonotic protozoan parasite in humans and animals. Infection is widespread in dairy cattle, especially in calves, resulting in neonatal enteritis, production losses and high mortality. However, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in pre- and post-weaned calves in Yunnan Province remains unclear. Methods: We collected 498 fecal samples from Holstein calves on 10 different farms in four regions of Yunnan Province. Nested PCR and DNA sequencing were used to determine the infection, species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp. in these animals. Results: The overall occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in Holstein calves was 32.9% (164/498), and the prevalence in pre- and post-weaned calves was 33.5% (106/316) and 31.9% (58/182), respectively. Four Cryptosporidium species were identified in these animals, namely C. bovis (n = 119), C. parvum (n = 23), C. ryanae (n = 20) and C. andersoni (n = 2). Based on sequencing analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein gene of C. bovis, C. parvum and C. ryanae, six subtypes of C. bovis (XXVIe, XXVIb, XXVIf, XXVIa XXVIc and XXVId), two subtypes of C. parvum (IIdA19G1 and IIdA18G1) and four subtypes of C. ryanae (XXIf, XXId, XXIe and XXIg) were identified. Conclusions: These results provide essential information to understand the infection rate, species diversity and genetic structure of Cryptosporidium spp. populations in Holstein pre-weaned and post-weaned calves in Yunnan Province. Further, the presence of IIdA18G1 and IIdA19G1 in C. parvum implies significant animal and public health concerns, which requires greater attention and more preventive measures.

AB  - Simple Summary Through a preliminary analysis of animal remains from the large settlement site of Yucun, located east of the Longshan Mountain and associated with the Zhou people during the first half of the first millennium BC, the authors investigated the subsistence practices in relation to the exploitation of animal resources by the site's residents. The examination of animal species representation and the mortality profiles of major domesticates suggest similarities between Yucun and sites associated with the Qin people, located to the west of the Longshan Mountain. However, differences were observed when comparing Yucun to other contemporaneous sites in the middle and lower Yellow River valley. These patterns in animal use strategies appear to have been influenced by local environmental conditions.Abstract The first millennium BC saw the expansion of the Western Zhou dynasty in its northwestern frontier, alongside the rise and development of the Qin State in the Longshan Mountain region of northern China. Exploring the subsistence practices of these communities is crucial to gaining a better understanding of the social, cultural, and political landscape in this region at the time. While much of the research to date has focused on the Qin people, the subsistence practices of the Zhou people remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed animal remains from Yucun, a large settlement site associated with the Zhou people, located to the east of the Longshan Mountain. These animal remains were recovered in the excavation seasons of 2018-2020. Our results show that pigs, dogs, cattle, caprines, and horses, which were the major domestic animals at Yucun, accounted for over 90.8% of the animal remains examined in terms of the number of identified specimens (NISP) and 72.8% in terms of the minimum number of individuals (MNI), with cattle and caprines playing dominant roles. In terms of the taxonomic composition and the mortality profiles of pigs, caprines, and cattle, Yucun shared similarities with Maojiaping and Xishan, two contemporaneous Qin cultural sites located to the west of the Longshan Mountain, and differ from other farming societies in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River valley. Considering the cultural attributes and topographic conditions of these various sites, these findings imply that environmental conditions may have played a more significant role than cultural factors in shaping the animal-related subsistence practices in northern China during the first millennium BC.

AB  - Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is a neurological emergency where sustaining seizure causes severe neuronal death. Currently, there is no available neuroprotectant effective in RSE. Aminoprocalcitonin (NPCT) is a conserved peptide cleaved from procalcitonin, but its distribution and function in the brain remain enigmatic. Survival of neurons relies on sufficient energy supply. Recently, we found that NPCT was extensively distributed in the brain and had potent modulations on neuronal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), suggesting that NPCT might be involved in neuronal death by regulating energy status. In the present study, combining biochemical and histological methods, high-throughput RNA-sequence, Seahorse XFe analyser, an array of mitochondria function assays, and behavior-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, we investigated the roles and translational values of NPCT in neuronal death after RSE. We found that NPCT was extensively distributed throughout gray matters in rat brain while RSE triggered NPCT overexpression in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. High-throughput RNA-sequence demonstrated that the influences of NPCT on primary hippocampal neurons were enriched in OXPHOS. Further function assays verified that NPCT facilitated ATP production, enhanced the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, IV, V, and increased neuronal maximal respiration capacity. NPCT exerted multiple neurotrophic effects including facilitating synaptogenesis, neuritogenesis, spinogenesis, and suppression of caspase-3. A polyclonal NPCT immunoneutralization antibody was developed to antagonize NPCT. In the in vitro 0-Mg2+ seizure model, immunoneutralization of NPCT caused more neuronal death, while exogenous NPCT supplementation, though did not reverse death outcomes, preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. In rat RSE model, both peripheral and intracerebroventricular immunoneutralization of NPCT exacerbated hippocampal neuronal death and peripheral immunoneutralization increased mortality. Intracerebroventricular immunoneutralization of NPCT further led to more serious hippocampal ATP depletion, and significant EEG power exhaustion. We conclude that NPCT is a neuropeptide regulating neuronal OXPHOS. During RSE, NPCT was overexpressed to protect hippocampal neuronal survival via facilitating energy supply.

AB  - Nitrogen is an important nutrient for the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), which profoundly affects the quality and value of tea. In this study, the variations of biochemical activities, antioxidant systems, and tea quality of two tea varieties under four levels of nitrogen fertilizers were analyzed to explore the responses of tea plants to nitrogen stress. The primary maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII(F-v/F-m), the photochemical quenching coefficient (qP) and the relative electron transport rate (rETR) decreased under nitrogen deficiency (ND) and high nitrogen treatments (HN) in tea plant. Meanwhile, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased significantly under ND/HN treatments, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) increased under HN/ND treatments. The relative expressions of antioxidant biosynthesis enzyme genes (CsSOD, CsPOD, CsCAT and CsAPX) were up-regulated under ND/HN treatments. Furthermore, the change trend of total free amino acid content under ND/HN treatments showed that nitrogen stress was not conducive to the accumulation of free amino acid content in tea, which may be related to the increase in ROS. This study presents a potential approach to improve tea quality by balancing ROS and antioxidant systems.

AB  - Jasmonate restricts accumulation of constitutive and fungus-induced root soluble sugars at flowering stage, and thus reduces root beneficial fungal colonization, but little is known about how these are achieved. To determine whether jasmonate-mediated depletion of soluble sugars is the result of direct phytohormonal cross-talk or indirect induced defensive secondary metabolism, we first profiled soluble sugar and tryptophan (Trp)-derived defensive secondary metabolites in the roots of wild-type and jasmonate signaling-impaired Arabidopsis thaliana at flowering upon a beneficial fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris inoculation. Next, jasmonate and gibberellin signaling were manipulated to determine the relationship between jasmonate and gibberellin, and to quantify the effects of these phytohormones on fungal colonization degree, soluble sugar accumulation, Trp-derived secondary metabolites production, and sugar source-sink transport and metabolism. Gibberellin complementation increased Ph. liquidambaris colonization and rescued jasmonate-dependent root soluble sugar depletion and phloem sugar transport and root invertase activity without influencing jasmonate-induced Trp-derived secondary metabolites production at flowering. Furthermore, jasmonate signaling antagonized gibberellin biosynthesis in Ph. liquidambaris-inoculated roots. Our results suggest a phytohormonal antagonism model that jasmonate signaling restricts root soluble sugar accumulation through antagonizing gibberellin biosynthesis rather than through promoting Trp-derived secondary metabolites production and thus drives beneficial fungal colonization decline at flowering.

AB  - Cartilage defect repair remains a challenge for clinicians due to the limited self-healing capabilities of cartilage. Microenvironment-specific biomimetic hydrogels have shown great potential in cartilage regeneration because of their excellent biological properties. In this study, a hydrogel system consisting of p-hydroxybenzene propanoic acid-modified chitosan (PC), silk fibroin (SF) and decellularized cartilage extracellular matrix (DCM) was prepared. Under the catalysis of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the phenol hydroxyl groups on PC and SF were crosslinked to form a hydrogel. DCM incorporation into the hydrogel facilitated an emulation of the natural cartilage extracellular matrix. The synthesized injectable hydrogels could fill irregular defects and formed network structures that promoted cell adhesion and proliferation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the hydrogels had biocompatibility and promoted chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The DCM-derived hydrogel exhibited low immunogenicity in vivo, and in the treatment of both rabbit trochlear groove cartilage defects and goat femoral condyle cartilage defects, the hydrogel accelerated the cartilage regeneration. In summary, our developed composite hydrogel system in the study offers a potential strategy for the effective repair of cartilage defects.

AB  - In this study, the correlation between microsatellite marker polymorphism and wool fineness of sunite bactrian camel was analyzed. The results show that, the average effective allele number, heterozygosity and polymorphism information content of 17 microsatellite markers in sunite bactrian camel were 2.8913, 0.6205 and 0.5602, respectively. The wool fineness of AB genotype of CMS36 locus was significantly higher than that of BB genotype (P<0.05). The wool fineness of AC genotype at YWLL44 locus was significantly higher than that of BD, BE and CE genotype (P<0.05). The wool fineness of AA and BC genotype at YWLL 29 locus was significantly higher than that of AC genotype (P<0.05). The wool fineness of AB genotype at LCA33 locus was significantly higher than that of AC, AD and BC genotype (P<0.05). Therefore, CMS36, YWLL 44, YWLL 29 and LCA33 microsatellite markers can be used in marker assisted selection of wool fineness of sunite bactrian camel.

AB  - In the northern hemisphere, many species' ranges are shifting northwards with climate change. Here I present evidence, from the first large-scale citizen science study of the Hippoboscidae in the United Kingdom, for the colonisation of the United Kingdom by three species of Diptera in the family Hippoboscidae, which are obligate ectoparasites of birds. The Swallow Louse Fly, Ornithomya biloba; the Nightjar Louse Fly, Pseudolynchia garzettae and the Pigeon Louse Fly, Pseudolynchia canariensis were previously considered to be vagrants from more southerly latitudes but the presence of a pair taken possibly in the act of copulation, gravid females and the increase in numbers of the various species provides good evidence of local breeding activity. I discuss the potential for further northwards range shift and whether the presence of three new species of parasite may have implications for the spread of avian disease within the region. I also include a concise key to the genus Pseudolynchia and images of P. canariensis, P. garzettae and O. biloba to aid further identification of these species in the region.

AB  - Accurate identification and quantification of pollens (e.g., pollen of a flower, airborne pollens) is essential to understand plant pollination and reproductive biology, pollen aerobiology, and plant-insect interactions. Currently, a couple of methods are available for pollen counting, such as manual counting, flow cytometry-based and image software-based counting. However, due to inconsistent results and experimental repeatability, a more accurate, consistent, and high-throughput quantification approach is required. This study evaluated and compared the performance between a proposed Swin-transformer-YOLOv5 (S-T-YOLOv5) and common YOLO models in pollen detection and quantification. The present study demonstrated that the S-T-YOLOv5 outperformed other YOLO models, including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOR, and YOLOv5 for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pollen detection and quantification, with excellent precision (99.6%), recall (99.4%), F1-score (0.995), mAP50 (99.4%), and mAP50-95 (76.2%) values. The mAP50-95 (mAP at an IoU of 0.5-0.95) of S-T-YOLOv5 was 9.9, 58.7, 25.3 and 8.2% higher than those of YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOR, and YOLOv5, respectively. Additionally, the S-T-YOLOv5 showed a good transferability in quantifying pollen with varied sizes and shapes in different plant species, including annual fleabane, camelina, Canadian goldenrod, Indian lettuce, mustard, and oilseed rape. In summary, our results showed that the S-T-YOLOv5 is an accurate, robust, and widely adaptable pollen quantification approach, with minimizing errors and labor expense. We would like to highlight the potential application of S-T-YOLOv5 in quantifying samples of airborne pollens from a known pollen source or insect-dispersed pollens (e.g., alfalfa) in supporting the environmental risk assessment of genetically engineered (GE) plants.

AB  - The performance (development and reproduction) of generalist predators can vary greatly among the prey species that they use, and these differences can influence the ability of predatory insects to suppress pest populations. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of larvae of the green lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris (Burmeister, 1839) by offering 16 species of aphids and by assessing the effects of each species on the survival, larval development time, prey consumption, pupal mass and egg load of adult Chr. rufilabris females taking aphid phylogeny into account. Chrysoperla rufilabris larvae preyed on individuals from all 16 aphid species, but complete development, adult emergence and egg load production were achieved only in seven species. As a general pattern, the best levels of performance were achieved for an aphid clade that includes the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Matsumara, 1917), and for a milkweed-feeding species, Myzocallis asclepiadis (Monell, 1879). We found significant phylogenetic clustering for most of the performance traits indicating the aspects of specialization in the diet breadth of Chr. rufilabris despite the fact that this species is considered a generalist aphid predator. These findings can help us to understand the interactions of this species in agroecological food webs, where it is commonly found, and provide insights into why natural, conservation biological control or augmentative releases may succeed or fail.

AB  - The Fenton reaction has been widely utilized in tumor therapy and ferroptosis immunity in recent years. Therefore, the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), and iron(II) (Fe2+) in serum is urgently in need. A multifunctional combined carbon-CdTe quantum dots (C-CdTeQDs) probe is first established for the quick succession determination of H2O2 and Fe2+ in goat serum and human urine based on the fluorescence and colorimetric method. The double-emission fluorescence detection is performed by breaking the thioglycolic acid bond on the surface of CdTeQDs by H2O2 to quench the fluorescence at 594 nm. After the condition optimization, the fluorescence intensity is linearly related to H2O2 concentration, with a limit of detection of 58 nM. The colorimetric detection of center dot OH and Fe2+ concentrations is then continued by the Fenton reaction and the complexation reaction. Among them, the detection range of center dot OH is 0.01-0.1 mu M with the limit of detection of 8 nM. Several advantages such as versatility, convenience, high selectivity, and sensitivity of the C-CdTeQDs probe indicated that it has great potential for the determination of H2O2 and Fe2+ in serum.

   Previous research demonstrated that seminal plasma, the fluid that together with sperm composes the semen, modulates the interaction between sperm and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within the donkey uterus. This study sought to evaluate whether a specific set of proteins or the entire seminal plasma is involved in that modulation. Seminal plasma was fractioned into six portions: <3, 3-10, 10-30, 30-50, 50-100, and >100 kDa. Sperm incubated with two specific fractions, containing 30-50 kDa and 50-100 kDa proteins, exhibited the highest motility and viability after co-incubation with PMN for 4 h, and the highest sperm-PMN interaction at the beginning of the experiment. These results suggest that proteins of 30-50 and 50-100 kDa, rather than the entire seminal plasma, appear to be involved in the inflammatory reaction within the donkey endometrium.
   While artificial insemination (AI) with frozen-thawed sperm results in low fertility rates in donkeys, the addition of seminal plasma, removed during cryopreservation, partially counteracts that reduction. Related to this, an apparent inflammatory reaction in jennies is induced following AI with frozen-thawed sperm, as a high amount of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are observed within the donkey uterus six hours after AI. While PMN appear to select the sperm that ultimately reach the oviduct, two mechanisms, phagocytosis and NETosis, have been purported to be involved in that clearance. Remarkably, sperm interacts with PMN, but the presence of seminal plasma reduces that binding. As seminal plasma is a complex fluid made up of different molecules, including proteins, this study aimed to evaluate how different seminal plasma fractions, separated by molecular weight (<3, 3-10, 10-30, 30-50, 50-100, and >100 kDa), affect sperm-PMN binding. Sperm motility, viability, and sperm-PMN binding were evaluated after 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h of co-incubation at 38 degrees C. Two seminal plasma fractions, including 30-50 kDa or 50-100 kDa proteins, showed the highest sperm motility and viability. As viability of sperm not bound to PMN after 3 h of incubation was the highest in the presence of 30-50 and 50-100 kDa proteins, we suggest that both fractions are involved in the control of the jenny's post-breeding inflammatory response. In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that specific fractions rather than the entire seminal plasma modulate sperm-PMN binding within the donkey uterus. As several proteins suggested to be involved in the control of post-AI endometritis have a molecular weight between 30 and 100 kDa, further studies aimed at determining the identity of these molecules and evaluating their potential effect in vivo are much warranted.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are predisposed to psychosocial disturbances, such as depression and anxiety. Regrettably, clinical antidepressants exhibit unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy in IBD-associated psychosocial disturbances, primarily attributed to the inherent intestinal disorders and intricate bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain. Herein, we report a metal-polyphenol-based antidepressant to alleviate mental disorders in dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental acute colitis mice via modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The antidepressant, termed CSMTC, comprises a core of melittin-encapsulated natural antioxidant enzymes (i.e., catalase and superoxide dismutase) and a protective shell composed of tannic acid-cerium ion network. Upon oral administration to colitis mice, CSMTC can effectively restore colonic redox balance, reinforce the intestinal barrier, modulate gut microbiota composition, maintain the blood-brain barrier integrity, and regulate systemic immune responses. Notably, behavioral test results reveal that CSMTC significantly alleviates the colitis-associated mental disorder (e.g., depression-like behavior) via the microbiota-gut-brain axis by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing hippocampal neural plasticity, modulating hippocampal immune responses, and restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis. This work may have implications for the development of new nanodrugs for treating inflammation-associated complications.

AB  - Comorbid conditions in persons with epilepsy (PWE) are very common with depression being highly prevalent. Lacosamide (LCM) is used to treat patients with seizures, but the underlying pathways associating the seizures and comorbid depression are still unknown. Kynurenine pathway (KP) has a major role in seizures, inflammation as well as depression, considering which we evaluated the effect of LCM on kynurenine levels in murine model of neuroinflammation-mediated seizures. We then evaluated the effects on the depressive symptoms associated with seizures. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) primed pilocarpine (PILO) is an established model for neuro-inflammation-mediated seizures. The anti-seizure and anti-depressive effects of 21 days of LCM administration were studied in this model. After 24 h of seizure termination, behavioral parameters viz. forced swimming test and sucrose preference test were performed to study its antidepressant effect. Biochemical estimations of levels of kynurenine, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative markers were also evaluated. Lacosamide significantly reduced hippocampal kynurenine levels in LPS and LPS + PILO groups but did not show significant reduction in the PILO alone group. Levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers were also reduced significantly. Lacosamide has shown positive effects against neuroinflammation-mediated model of seizures comorbid with depression by reducing hippocampal kynurenine levels. No reduction in the PILO group is suggestive of the principal contribution of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity in its anti-seizure potential in this model via KP. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has advantages for constructing artificial skin tissues in replicating the structures and functions of native skin. Although many studies have presented improved effect of printing skin substitutes in wound healing, using hydrogel inks to fabricate 3D bioprinting architectures with complicated structures, mimicking mechanical properties, and appropriate cellular environments is still challenging. Inspired by collagen nanofibers withstanding stress and regulating cell behavior, a patterned nanofibrous film was introduced to the printed hydrogel scaffold to fabricate a composite artificial skin substitute (CASS). The artificial dermis was printed using gelatin-hyaluronan hybrid hydrogels containing human dermal fibroblasts with gradient porosity and integrated with patterned nanofibrous films simultaneously, while the artificial epidermis was formed by seeding human keratinocytes upon the dermis. The collagen-mimicking nanofibrous film effectively improved the tensile strength and fracture resistance of the CASS, making it sewable for firm implantation into skin defects. Meanwhile, the patterned nanofibrous film also provided the biological cues to guide cell behavior. Consequently, CASS could effectively accelerate the regeneration of large-area skin defects in mouse and pig models by promoting re-epithelialization and collagen deposition. This research developed an effective strategy to prepare composite bioprinting architectures for enhancing mechanical property and regulating cell behavior, and CASS could be a promising skin substitute for treating large-area skin defects.

AB  - Carbon dots, the carbon nanomaterials, have been greatly developed for several applications including fluo-rescent sensors for metal ion detection, antioxidant activity, and plant growth promotion due to their excellent photophysical properties, non-toxicity, and high quantum yield. Therefore, this research focused on the synthesis of multifunctional carbon dots from elephant manure via green hydrothermal synthesis owing to its chemical composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The as-synthesized carbon dots exhibited blue fluorescence emission under UV light and the excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence enhancement. Carbon dots could be further used as a "turn-off" fluorescence sensor for Hg2+ detection as a part of environmental monitoring. Furthermore, the as-synthesized carbon dots containing high phenolic content showed the antioxidant activity and promoted rice growth with an increase in the characteristic aroma compound (2-acetyl-1-pyrroline), confirmed by GC-MS analysis.

AB  - Deficiency of the placental hormone chorionic somatomammotropin (CSH) can lead to the development of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). To gain insight into the physiological consequences of CSH RNA interference (RNAi), the trophectoderm of hatched blastocysts (nine days of gestational age; dGA) was infected with a lentivirus expressing either a scrambled control or CSH-specific shRNA, prior to transfer into synchronized recipient sheep. At 90 dGA, umbilical hemodynamics and fetal measurements were assessed by Doppler ultrasonography. At 120 dGA, pregnancies were fitted with vascular catheters to undergo steady-state metabolic studies with the (H2O)-H-3 transplacental diffusion technique at 130 dGA. Nutrient uptake rates were determined and tissues were subsequently harvested at necropsy. CSH RNAi reduced (p <= 0.05) both fetal and uterine weights as well as umbilical blood flow (mL/min). This ultimately resulted in reduced (p <= 0.01) umbilical IGF1 concentrations, as well as reduced umbilical nutrient uptakes (p <= 0.05) in CSH RNAi pregnancies. CSH RNAi also reduced (p <= 0.05) uterine nutrient uptakes as well as uteroplacental glucose utilization. These data suggest that CSH is necessary to facilitate adequate blood flow for the uptake of oxygen, oxidative substrates, and hormones essential to support fetal and uterine growth.

AB  - Gut-derived neuroactive metabolites from amino acids perform a broad range of physiological roles in the body. However, the interaction between microbiota and epithelium in the metabolism of amino acids with neuroactive properties remains unclear in the colon of piglets. To investigate the microbial and epithelial metabolism, metagenomics and mucosal metabolomics were performed using colonic samples from 12 ileum-canulated piglets subjected to a 25-day infusion with saline or antibiotics. We categorized 23 metabolites derived from the metabolism of tryptophan, glutamate, and tyrosine, known as precursors of neuroactive metabolites. Microbial enzymes involved in the kynurenine synthesis via arylformamidase, 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis via putrescine aminotransferase, and tyramine synthesis via tyrosine decarboxylase were identified in Clostridiales bacterium, uncultured Blautia sp., and Methanobrevibacter wolinii, respectively. Antibiotics significantly affected the microbiota involved in tryptophan-kynurenine and glutamate-GABA metabolism. An increase in the relative abundance of putrescine aminotransferase and Blautia sp. correlated positively with an increase in luminal GABA concentration. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the microbial ability to metabolize key amino acids that are precursors of neuroactive metabolites.

AB  - L-theanine, an amino acid component of the tea leaves of Camellia sinensis, is sold in Japan as a supplement for good sleep. Although several studies in humans and mice have reported the effects of L-theanine on brain function, only a few reports have comprehensively clarified the disposition of theanine administered to mice and its effects on concentrations of other blood amino acids. In this study, we aimed to determine the changes in the blood levels of L-theanine administered to mice and amino acid composition of the serum. L-theanine were administered to four-week-old Std-ddY male mice orally or via tail vein injection. L-theanine and other amino acids in serum prepared from blood collected at different time points post-dose were labeled with phenylisothiocyanate and quantified. The serum concentration of orally administered L-theanine peaked 15 min after administration. The area under the curve for tail vein injection revealed the bioavailability of L- theanine to be approximately 70%. L-theanine administration did not affect any amino acid levels in the serum, but a significant increase in the peak area overlapping the Glycine (Gly) peak was observed 30 min after administration. L-theanine administered to mice was rapidly absorbed and eliminated, suggesting that taking L-theanine as a supplement is safe without affecting its own levels or serum levels of other amino acids. However, considering that Gly, similar to L-theanine, is used as a dietary supplement for its anxiolytic effects and to improve sleep, determining the effects of L-theanine administration on Gly is important and needs further research.

AB  - Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. It is becoming increasingly evident that peripheral organ-centered inflammatory diseases, including liver diseases, are linked with brain dysfunctions. Therefore, this study aims to unravel the effect of MASLD on brain histology, cognitive functions, and neurotransmitters. For this purpose, mice fed for 48 weeks on standard (SD) or Western diet (WD) were evaluated by behavioral tests, followed by sacrifice and analysis of the liver-brain axis including histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and biochemical analyses. Histological analysis of the liver showed features of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) in the WD-fed mice including lipid droplet accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. This was accompanied by an elevation of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activities, increase in inflammatory cytokine and bile acid concentrations, as well as altered amino acid concentrations in the blood. Interestingly, compromised blood capillary morphology coupled with astrogliosis and microgliosis were observed in brain hippocampus of the WD mice, indicating neuroinflammation or a disrupted neurovascular unit. Moreover, attention was impaired in WD-fed mice along with the observations of impaired motor activity and balance, enhanced anxiety, and stereotyped head-twitch response (HTR) behaviors. Analysis of neurotransmitters and modulators including dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine showed region-specific dysregulation in the brain of the WD-fed mice. In conclusion, the induction of MASH in mice is accompanied by the alteration of cellular morphology and neurotransmitter expression in the brain, associated with compromised cognitive functions.

AB  - Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) has emerged as a promising decentralized management approach to urban stormwater challenges. A lack of data about GSI performance interferes with widespread adoption of GSI. A citizen science program that benefits researchers, lay scientists, and municipalities offers a way to provide these lacking data. We have developed an open-source, transferable green infrastructure rapid assessment (GIRA) protocol for studying the performance of GSI with citizen scientists. This protocol has been tested in six North American cities (New York City, Toronto, Vancouver, Chicago, San Francisco, and Buffalo). In this research we define the performance of GSI in varying geographic, climatic, and maintenance conditions with the intent to create technological, institutional, and management solutions to urban stormwater problems. The GIRA protocol was used by citizen scientists to assess the physical properties and capabilities of bioswales, while small, affordable Green Infrastructure Sensors Boxes (GIBoxes) were used to determine longer-term function across several rain events. Our results indicate that teams of citizen scientists can be effective for collecting and archiving widespread information on the post-installation function of GSI. The effort also showed that citizen scientists had changes in understanding of urban stormwater challenges and the role that GSI can play in solving these problems. We explore the multiple benefits to knowledge, participants, and municipal partners as a result of this research.

AB  - Our previous study found that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) potentiates the slow delayed rectifier K+ current (I-Ks) in sinoatrial node (SAN) pacemaker cells. Recently, oxidative activation of CaMKII has emerged as a major cause of SAN dysfunction; however, its correlation with I-Ks regulation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on I-Ks in SAN cells isolated from guinea pig heart. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed using an EGTA (5 mM) pipette solution to stabilize intracellular Ca2+ levels (pCa 7). The results showed that 5 min of H2O2 (100 mu M) perfusion initiated an increase in I-Ks, which gradually increased to saturation (similar to 60.5 % enhancement from baseline to saturation) after 10 min of H2O2 exposure. In contrast, IKs remained almost unchanged in the presence of catalase (1000 units mL- 1). These observations were replicable in atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. H2O2 failed to stimulate KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents in HEK and CHO cells expressing low CaMKII levels. In SAN cells, H2O2-induced IKs enhancement was strongly attenuated by intracellular dialysis with a lower Ca2+ concentration (pCa 10) or by pretreatment with KN-93 (1 mu M), suggesting that Ca2+/calmodulin binding to CaMKII is a prerequisite for CaMKII activation. Autocamtide-2 inhibitory peptide (AIP, 1 mu M), an inhibitor of the catalytic domain of CaMKII, almost completely abolished the H2O2-induced potentiation of I-Ks. Taken together, these findings imply that H2O2 enhances cardiac I-Ks through the oxidative activation of CaMKII.

AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) hurts the postnatal growth and development of weanling piglets. Equol (Eq), a primary bioactive metabolite of daidzein, derives from intestinal bacterial metabolism and exerts numerous biological benefits. Nevertheless, no evidence is available to discover whether dietary Eq treatment exerts positive influences on the growth performance, redox status, intestinal health and skeletal muscle development of piglets with IUGR. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of Eq supplementation on growth performance, redox status, intestinal health and skeletal muscle development. Here, twenty IUGR piglets and ten normal-birth-weight (NBW) female weanling piglets were used in this study and the results showed that Eq treatment enhanced antioxidant capacity and intestinal health, and facilitated skeletal muscle development, thus promoting the growth performance of IUGR piglets. Our findings provide significant implications for improving the growth performance of IUGR piglets and highlighting feasible applications in pig production.Animals with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) usually undergo injured postnatal growth and development during the early period after birth. Equol (Eq), an isoflavan produced by gut bacteria in response to daidzein intake, has various health benefits. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether Eq supplementation can influence the growth performance, redox status, intestinal health and skeletal muscle development of weanling piglets with IUGR. A total of 10 normal-birth-weight (NBW) newborn female piglets and 20 newborn female piglets with IUGR were selected. After weaning at the age of 21 d, 10 NBW piglets and 10 IUGR piglets were allocated to the NBW group and IUGR group, respectively, and offered a basal diet. The other 10 IUGR piglets were allocated to the IUGR + Eq group and offered a basal diet with 50 mg of Eq per kg of diet. The whole trial lasted for 21 d. At the end of the feeding trial, all piglets were sacrificed for the collection of serum, intestinal tissues and skeletal muscles. Supplementation with Eq increased the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), duodenal villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C), jejunal villus height and V/C, but reduced the duodenal crypt depth in neonatal piglets with IUGR. Meanwhile, Eq supplementation elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the serum and duodenum and the activity of SOD in the jejunum, but lowered malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum, jejunum and ileum of piglets with IUGR. In addition, supplementation with Eq reduced diamine oxidase (DAO) activity and the levels of D-lactate and endotoxin in serum, and the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) level in jejunum and ileum, whereas the concentration of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the mRNA levels of intestinal barrier-related markers in jejunum and ileum of IUGR piglets were increased. Furthermore, supplementation with Eq elevated the percentage of fast-fibers and was accompanied with higher mRNA expression of myosin heavy chain IIb (MyHC IIb) and lower mRNA levels in MyHC I in the longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle of IUGR piglets. In summary, Eq supplementation can promote antioxidant capacity, maintain intestinal health and facilitate skeletal muscle development, thus resulting in the higher growth performance of IUGR piglets.

AB  - Recovery and reuse of high-acidity vegetable oil waste (higher content of free fatty acids) is a major concern for reducing their effect on the environment. Moreover, the conventional deacidification processes are known to show drawbacks, such as oil losses or higher costs of wastewater treatment, for which it requires great attention, especially at the industrial scale. This work presents the design of a highly efficient and sustainable process for Camelina sativa oil deacidification by using an ecofriendly method, namely molecular distillation. Experimental studies were performed to identify operating conditions for removing of free fatty acids (FFA) by molecular distillation which involves the oil evaporation in high vacuum conditions. The experimental studies were supported by statistical analysis and technical-economic analysis. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to formulate and validate second-order models to predict deacidification efficiency, FFA concentration, and triacylglyceride (TAG) concentration in deodorized oil based on three parameters effects, validated by statistical p-value < 0.05. For a desirability function value of 0.9826, the optimal parameters of evaporator temperature at 173.5 degrees C, wiper speed at 350 rpm, and feed flowrate at 2 mL/min were selected. The results for process design at optimal conditions (using conventional and molecular distillation methods) showed an efficiency over 92%, a significant reduction in FFA (up to 1%), and an increase in TAG (up to 93%) in refined oil for both methods. From an economical point of view, the deacidification by molecular distillation of Camelina sativa oil is a sustainable process: no wastewater generation, no solvents and water consumption, and lower production costs, obtaining a valuable by-product (FFA).

AB  - Hearing impairment is one of the most common disorders with a global burden and increasing prevalence in an ever-aging population. Previous research has largely focused on peripheral sensory perception, while the brain circuits of auditory processing and integration remain poorly understood. Mutations in the rdx gene, encoding the F-actin binding protein radixin (Rdx), can induce hearing loss in human patients and homozygous depletion of Rdx causes deafness in mice. However, the precise physiological function of Rdx in hearing and auditory information processing is still ill-defined. Here, we investigated consequences of rdx monoallelic loss in the mouse. Unlike the homozygous (-/-) rdx knockout, which is characterized by the degeneration of actin-based stereocilia and subsequent hearing loss, our analysis of heterozygous (+/-) mutants has revealed a different phenotype. Specifically, monoallelic loss of rdx potentiated the startle reflex in response to acoustic stimulation of increasing intensities, suggesting a gain of function relative to wildtype littermates. The monoallelic loss of the rdx gene also facilitated pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex induced by weak auditory pre-pulse stimuli, indicating a modification to the circuit underlying sensorimotor gating of auditory input. However, the auditory brainstem response (ABR)-based hearing thresholds revealed a mild impairment in peripheral sound perception in rdx (+/-) mice, suggesting minor aberration of stereocilia structural integrity. Taken together, our data suggest a critical role of Rdx in the top-down processing and/or integration of auditory signals, and therefore a novel perspective to uncover further Rdx-mediated mechanisms in central auditory information processing.

AB  - Numerous predators prey on herbivorous arthropods, and some prey species have evolved counterattacks against predators (predator-prey reversal). Counterattacks often entail a lethal cost but increase the fitness of the attacking individuals and their nearby relatives. Spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) live on leaf surfaces, and some live in aggregations with relatives in a web nest. Counterattacks have been studied in Stigmaeopsis species, but have rarely been studied in other web-nesting species. We investigated counterattacks against predatory thrips, Scolothrips takahashii Priesner, by Schizotetranychus brevisetosus Ehara, which inhabits Quercus glauca L. (Fagaceae). Here, thrips nymphs introduced onto a mite-infested piece of leaf quickly entered the nest but were driven out by females using their stylets. However, in another experiment, we could not find a difference between treatments (10 adult females per leaf or none per leaf) in the number of eggs consumed at 48 h, probably because the thrips repeatedly re-entered the nest. Additionally, we did not detect a significant effect of web presence on predation. Although the defensive effect is undetectable, this study shows that S. brevisetosus counterattacks occur both inside and outside the nest, and the latter especially is the first report of such behaviour in Acari.

AB  - Leucine Rich Repeat Transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs) are neuronal cell adhesion molecules involved in synapse development and plasticity. LRRTM2 is the most synaptogenic isoform of the family, and its expression is strongly restricted to excitatory synapses in mature neurons. However, the mechanisms by which LRRTM2 is trafficked and stabilized at synapses remain unknown. Here, we examine the role of LRRTM2 intracellular domain on its membrane expression and stabilization at excitatory synapses, using a knock-down strategy combined to single molecule tracking and super-resolution dSTORM microscopy. We show that LRRTM2 operates an important shift in mobility after synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons. Knock-down of LRRTM2 during synapse formation reduced excitatory synapse density in mature neurons. Deletion of LRRTM2 C-terminal domain abolished the compartmentalization of LRRTM2 in dendrites and disrupted its synaptic enrichment. Furtheremore, we show that LRRTM2 diffusion is increased in the absence of its intracellular domain, and that the protein is more dispersed at synapses. Surprisingly, LRRTM2 confinement at synapses was strongly dependent on a YxxC motif in the C-terminal domain, but was independent of the PDZ-like binding motif ECEV. Finally, the nanoscale organization of LRRTM2 at excitatory synapses depended on its C-terminal domain, with involvement of both the PDZ-binding and YxxC motifs. Altogether, these results demonstrate that LRRTM2 trafficking and enrichment at excitatory synapses are dependent on its intracellular domain.

AB  - In a previous study, heart xenografts from 10-gene-edited pigs transplanted into two human decedents did not show evidence of acute-onset cellular- or antibody-mediated rejection. Here, to better understand the detailed molecular landscape following xenotransplantation, we carried out bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, lipidomics, proteomics and metabolomics on blood samples obtained from the transplanted decedents every 6h, as well as histological and transcriptomic tissue profiling. We observed substantial early immune responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and xenograft tissue obtained from decedent 1 (male), associated with downstream T cell and natural killer cell activity. Longitudinal analyses indicated the presence of ischemia reperfusion injury, exacerbated by inadequate immunosuppression of T cells, consistent with previous findings of perioperative cardiac xenograft dysfunction in pig-to-nonhuman primate studies. Moreover, at 42h after transplantation, substantial alterations in cellular metabolism and liver-damage pathways occurred, correlating with profound organ-wide physiological dysfunction. By contrast, relatively minor changes in RNA, protein, lipid and metabolism profiles were observed in decedent 2 (female) as compared to decedent 1. Overall, these multi-omics analyses delineate distinct responses to cardiac xenotransplantation in the two human decedents and reveal new insights into early molecular and immune responses after xenotransplantation. These findings may aid in the development of targeted therapeutic approaches to limit ischemia reperfusion injury-related phenotypes and improve outcomes.

AB  - Ensuring animal health and well-being requires animal-based measures for early and direct intervention at the point of care. Insight into the pathophysiology of Swine Inflammation and Necrosis Syndrome (SINS) has led to a non-invasive, clinical scoring system that can be used in daily practice. This provides information on the cause of observed lesions for direct intervention in affected herds. The aim of the current study was to re-evaluate the practicality of the SINS scoring system under field conditions. In addition, this is the first study to provide insight into the prevalence of SINS on Dutch farms. This study involved the scoring of 5958 piglets from 20 visits on 13 farms randomly selected by a veterinary practice in the Netherlands. The results showed that up to 64.1% of the piglets had visible inflammatory alterations in different body parts within the first seven days of life. Sow rectal temperature, signs of coprostasis and water intake during pregnancy were significantly (p <= 0.05) correlated with the prevalence of SINS in piglets. In conclusion, the SINS scoring system is an easy-to-use, non-invasive diagnostic tool that summarises animal-based observations at the point of care, providing a valuable communication tool between farmers, nutritionists and veterinarians in their efforts to improve animal health and welfare.

AB  - The oral secretions of herbivorous insects play a pivotal role in insect-plant interactions and the regulation of insect physiology. Unlike the saliva of Hemiptera species, Lepidopteran oral secretions include both saliva and regurgitated gut fluids; yet research on their composition remains limited. This study focuses on yellow peach moth (YPM), Conogethes punctiferalis, a pest increasingly damaging maize. A total of 103 proteins were identified from oral secretions collected from larvae reared on corn and artificial diets, comprising 67 enzymes, 30 non- enzymes, and 6 unknowns. The identified enzyme proteins were primarily trypsin, lipase, and serine protease inhibitors (serpins). Further genomic investigation revealed 36 serpin genes in the YPM genome, distributed in clusters across various chromosomes, with some genes exhibiting partial synteny to homologous sequences in Ostrinia furnacalis. Among the identified serpin genes, the SpI gene (jg17839), which encoded the most abundant protein in YPM oral secretions, was found to exhibit peak expression in fifth-instar larvae and culticle tissues. Silencing of the SpI gene through nanomaterial-mediated RNA interference significantly reduced larval length, weight, pupation rates, and pupal weight, while also increased larval mortality. Moreover, interfering with SpI expression elevated juvenile hormone levels in the larvae. These findings indicate that the abundant SpI protein in YPM oral secretions plays a vital role in larval growth and development by modulating internal hormone levels. This study enriches the database of lepidopteran oral secretion components, fostering a deeper understanding of their physiological roles and informing eco-friendly pest control strategies targeting these proteins in YPM.

AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an established rescue therapy for patients with chronic respiratory failure waiting for lung transplantation (LTx). The therapy inherent immobilization may result in fatigue, consecutive deteriorated prognosis, and even lost eligibility for transplantation. We conducted a feasibility study on a novel system designed for the deployment of a portable ECMO device, enabling the physical exercise of awake patients prior to LTx. The system comprises a novel oxygenator with a directly connected blood pump, a double-lumen cannula, gas blender and supply, as well as control and energy management. In vitro experiments included tests regarding performance, efficiency, and blood damage. A reduced system was tested in vivo for feasibility using a novel large animal model. Six anesthetized pigs were first positioned in supine position, followed by a 45 degrees angle, simulating an upright position of the patients. We monitored performance and vital parameters. All in vitro experiments showed good performance for the respective subsystems and the integrated system. The acute in vivo trials of 8 h duration confirmed the results. The novel portable ECMO-system enables adequate oxygenation and decarboxylation sufficient for, e.g., the physical exercise of designated LTx-recipients. These results are promising and suggest further preclinical studies on safety and efficacy to facilitate translation into clinical application.

AB  - Long-term consumption of tea with high fluoride (F) content has a potential threat to human health. The application of different amounts of biochar to reduce F accumulation in tea leaves has been little studied. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of biochar amounts (0, 0.5%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 8.0%, and 10.0%, w/w) on tea F content during the tea plant growth. Changes in tea quality, soil F fraction, and soil properties caused by biochar and the relationship with tea F accumulation were also considered. The results showed that the application of biochar amendment significantly reduced water-soluble F contents in tea leaves compared to CK (without biochar), especially in the 8.0% treatment (72.55%). Overall, biochar contributed to improving tea polyphenols and caffeine, but had no significant impact on free amino acids and water leachate. Compared with CK, 5.0-10.0% biochar significantly increased soil water-soluble F content due to the substitution of F- with OH- under high pH. Additionally, biochar applied to tea garden soil was effective in decreasing the soil exchangeable aluminum (Ex-Al) content (46.37-91.90%) and increasing the soil exchangeable calcium (Ca2+) content (12.02-129.74%) compared to CK, and correlation analysis showed that this may help reduce F enrichment of tea leaves. In general, the application of 5.0-8.0% biochar can be suggested as an optimal application dose to decrease tea F contents while simultaneously improving tea quality.

AB  - Background Oxidative stress is caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the depletion of free radical scavengers, which is closely related to ferroptosis in diseases. Quercetin, as a natural flavonoid compound, has been reported to have multiple pharmacological effects on the basis of its anti-oxidative and anti-ferroptotic activities. This study was designed to explore the specific mechanism of quercetin against ferroptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Methods The HT22 cells (mouse hippocampal neuronal cells) treated with 40 mu g center dot ml(-1) H2O2 were used to investigate the role of ferroptosis in oxidative stress damage and the regulation of quercetin (7.5, 15, 30 mu mol center dot l(-1)), as evidenced by assessments of cell viability, morphological damage, Fe2+ accumulation, and the expressions of ferroptotic-related proteins. The changes in the expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70), lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a (LAMP-2a), and heat shock protein (HSP90) were assessed by qPCR, western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) assays. Additionally, the interactions of GPX4, HSC70, LAMP-2a, and HSP90 were examined by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay to elucidate the impact of quercetin on the degradation pathway of GPX4 and the CMA pathway. To further explore the regulatory mechanism of quercetin, the si-LAMP-2a and HSP90 mutant cells were conducted. Results Pretreatment with 30 mu mol center dot l(-1) quercetin for 6 h significantly enhanced the survival rate (p < 0.05), maintained cell morphology, and inhibited Fe2+ levels in HT22 cells exposed to H2O2 (40 mu g center dot ml(-1)). HT22 cells under oxidative stress showed lower expressions of GPX4 and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), and a higher level of Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) (p < 0.05). And quercetin significantly reversed the expressions of these ferroptotic proteins (p < 0.05). Moreover, the autophagic lysosomal pathway inhibitor CQ effectively increased the expression of GPX4 in oxidative stress cell model. Further study showed that H2O2 increased the activity of macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), while quercetin notably suppressed the levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 II (LC3 II), LAMP-2a, and the activity of lysosomes (p < 0.01). Additionally, quercetin disrupted the interactions of GPX4, HSC70, and LAMP-2a, reduced cellular levels of CMA by decreasing the cleaved HSP90 (c-HSP90), and these effects were reversed in the R347 mutant HT22 cells. Conclusions Quercetin has a significantly protective effect on oxidative stress cell model through the inhibition on ferroptosis, which is related to the degradation of GPX4 via CMA. And quercetin decreases the level of c-HSP90 induced by H2O2 to reduce the activity of CMA by binding to R347 of HSP90.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections are on the rise, presenting a significant global health challenge. Mass Galla chinesis et camelliae Fermentata (Chinese gall leaven, CGL), a traditional Chinese medicinal product made from the fermentation of Rhus chinensis Mill., is frequently employed to address digestive system ailments. Contemporary pharmacological research reveals that CGL exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-diarrheal, and enzyme-inhibitory activities and holds potential as a treatment for H. pylori infections. However, the precise mechanisms underlying CGL's efficacy against H. pylori remain to be fully elucidated. Aim: The objective of the study is to evaluate CGL's ability to disrupt the H. pylori biofilm and to explore its synergistic potential with antibiotics in targeting the biofilm-efflux pump system, a mechanism implicated in bacterial resistance. Methords: The study determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of CGL and metronidazole against H. pylori and evaluated their effects on H. pylori biofilms using an in vitro model. Structural changes induced by drug interventions were compared to those in untreated and antibiotic-treated models through scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy. The accumulation of H33342 dye in planktonic and biofilm H. pylori before and after drug treatment was assessed to evaluate cell viability and biofilm disruption. The study also involved adding experimental drugs to a biofilm H. pylori medium containing D-glucose, measuring glucose concentrations post-intervention using the glucose oxidase method, and calculating changes in glucose uptake. Finally, the relative expression levels of several genes in planktonic and biofilm H. pylori treated with CGL alone or in combination with antibiotics were measured to understand the impact on the biofilm-efflux pump system. Results: Both CGL alone and in combination with metronidazole demonstrated effective disruption of H. pylori biofilms. The combination therapy was particularly effective in reducing the biofilm transfer-enhancing effect of metronidazole and decreasing SpoT expression in the 'SpoT-(p)ppGpp' pathway, especially in biofilms. It showed a greater inhibition of the 'sigma 54-gluP-sugar uptake' pathway, with significant reductions in rpoN and gluP expression under biofilm conditions compared to CGL or metronidazole alone. The treatment also suppressed H. pylori proliferation and may have altered glucose uptake mechanisms. Moreover, it significantly inhibited the 'hp0939/hp0497/hp0471-RND efflux pump' pathway, with a notable reduction in gene expression compared to the 1/2 MIC metronidazole treatment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that CGL effectively hinders the development of drug resistance in H. pylori by targeting biofilm formation and critical molecular pathways associated with antibiotic resistance. The synergistic effect of combining CGL with metronidazole notably enhances biofilm disruption and inhibits the bacterium's metabolic and reparative mechanisms. Further in vivo studies are needed to confirm these results and to investigate additional mechanisms of CGL's action.

AB  - Reelin is a secretory protein involved in a variety of processes in forebrain development and function, including neuronal migration, dendrite growth, spine formation, and synaptic plasticity. Most of the function of Reelin is focused on excitatory neurons; however, little is known about its effects on inhibitory neurons and inhibitory synapses. In this study, we investigated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway of Reelin in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. Individual neurons were visualized using immunofluorescence to distinguish inhibitory neurons from excitatory neurons. Reelin-rich protein supplementation significantly induced the phosphorylation of Akt and ribosomal S6 protein in excitatory neurons, but not in most inhibitory neurons. In somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons, one of major subtypes of inhibitory neurons, Reelin-rich protein supplementation induced the phosphorylation of S6. Subsequently, we investigated whether or not Reelin-rich protein supplementation affected dendrite development in cultured inhibitory neurons. Reelin-rich protein supplementation did not change the total length of dendrites in inhibitory neurons in vitro. Finally, we examined the development of inhibitory synapses in primary hippocampal neurons and found that Reelin-rich protein supplementation significantly reduced the density of gephyrin-VGAT-positive clusters in the dendritic regions without changing the expression levels of several inhibitory synapse-related proteins. These findings indicate a new role for Reelin in specific groups of inhibitory neurons and the development of inhibitory synapses, which may contribute to the underlying cellular mechanisms of RELN-associated neurological disorders.

AB  - African swine fever, caused by a large icosahedral DNA virus (African swine fever virus, ASFV), is a highly contagious disease in domestic and feral swine, thus posing a significant economic threat to the global swine industry. Currently, there are no effective vaccines or the available methods to control ASFV infection. Attenuated live viruses with deleted virulence factors are considered to be the most promising vaccine candidates; however, the mechanism by which these attenuated viruses confer protection is unclear. Here, we used the Chinese ASFV CN/GS/2018 as a backbone and used homologous recombina-tion to generate a virus in which MGF110-9L and MGF360-9L, two genes antagonize host innate antiviral immune response, were deleted (ASFV-AMGF110/360-9L). This genetically modified virus was highly attenuated in pigs and provided effective protection of pigs against parental ASFV challenge. Importantly, we found ASFV-AMGF110/360-9L infection induced higher expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA compared with parental ASFV as determined by RNA-Seq and RT-PCR analysis. Further immunoblotting results showed that parental ASFV and ASFV-AMGF110/360-9L infection inhibited Pam3CSK4-triggered activating phosphor-ylation of proinflammatory transcription factor NF-KB subunit p65 and phosphorylation of NF-KB inhibitor IKBa levels, although NF-KB activation was higher in ASFV-AMGF110/360-9L-infected cells compared with parental ASFV-infected cells. Additionally, we show overexpression of TLR2 inhibited ASFV replication and the expression of ASFV p72 protein, whereas knockdown of TLR2 had the opposite effect. Our findings suggest that the attenuated virulence of ASFV-AMGF110/360-9L might be mediated by increased NF-KB and TLR2 signaling.

AB  - Tea infusion is the most popular drink in Poland, and the tea bush is the most fluoride-rich among plants. Excessive fluoride intake can adversely affect human health by causing dental or skeletal fluorosis. This study aimed to determine the fluoride content in tea infusion depending on the tea types, the degree of fragmentation of the leaves, brewing time, and conducting a health risk assessment for the consumer in Poland. Infusions of 28 popular teas (green leafy tea, pu-erh leafy tea, white leaf tea, black leaf tea, black granulated tea, and black in bags) available in the Polish market were analyzed concerning a fluoride amount using the potentiometric method. Tea leaf size is an important parameter affecting fluoride's release during tea brewing. An increase in fluoride content in the infusion was also shown with the extension of the brewing time. It was also revealed that significantly higher fluoride content was found in infusions of black tea prepared from tea in bags than from "loose" leaves. The conducted health risk assessment indicates the possibility of adverse health effects caused by fluoride consumption, particularly from infusions of black and green tea purchased in bags.

AB  - Paranasal sinus pathologies, particularly those affecting the maxillary sinuses, pose significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to the complex anatomical structures and diverse disease manifestations. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of deep learning techniques, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for the classification of sinus pathologies in medical imaging data. The dataset is composed of images obtained through computed tomography (CT) scans, covering cases classified into "Moderate", "Severe", and "Normal" classes. The lightweight GAN is applied to augment a dataset by creating synthetic images, which are then used to train and test the ResNet-50 and ResNeXt-50 models. The model performance is optimized using random search to perform hyperparameter tuning, and the evaluation is conducted extensively for various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately classifying sinus pathologies, with the ResNeXt-50 model achieving superior performance with accuracy: 91.154, precision: 0.917, recall: 0.912, and F1-score: 0.913 compared to ResNet-50. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based data augmentation and deep learning techniques in enhancing the diagnosis of maxillary sinus diseases.

AB  - Oviductus ranae (OR) is an animal-based traditional medicine. To explore its mechanism of antidepressant effect, healthy Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) male mice were divided into control, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), fluoxetine (3 mg/kg), OR800 (OR 800 mg/kg) and OR400 (OR 400 mg/kg) dose groups. After the last administration, the content of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) in serum were detected. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was used to observe the hippocampal histomorphological changes. The protein levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), trosine kinase B (TrkB) and cyclic adenosine monophosphatec response element binding protein (CREB) in hippocampus were detected by western blotting. The results showed that, OR could significantly reduce the contents of CRH, ACTH and CORT in serum and improve the damage of hippocampal structure, and increase the expression levels of GR, MR, BDNF, TrkB and CREB in hippocampus. In conclusion, Oviductus ranae can reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperfunction induced by CUMS, increase the expression level of BDNF related signal pathway proteins, improve hippocampal tissue damage, and thus play an antidepressant role by regulating the negative feedback of HPA.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder featuring recurrent, unprovoked seizures, which affect more than 65 million people worldwide. Here, we discover that the PKHD1L1, which is encoded by polycystic kidney and hepatic disease1-like 1 (Pkhd1l1), wildly distributes in neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice. Disruption of PKHD1L1 in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus leads to increased susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice. The disturbance of PKHD1L1 leads to the overactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-Calpain pathway, which is accompanied by remarkable degradation of cytoplasmic potassium chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2) level together with the impaired expression and function of membrane KCC2. However, the reduction of membrane KCC2 is associated with the damaged inhibitory ability of the vital GABA receptors, which ultimately leads to the significantly increased susceptibility to epileptic seizures. Our data, thus, indicate for the first time that Pkhd1l1, a newly discovered polycystic kidney disease (PKD) association gene, is required in neurons to maintain neuronal excitability by regulation of KCC2 expression in CNS. A new mechanism of the clinical association between genetic PKD and seizures has been built, which could be a potential therapeutic target for treating PKD-related seizures.

AB  - Those with diabetes mellitus are at high-risk of developing psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, yet the link between hyperglycemia and altered motivation has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we characterized value-based decision-making behavior of a streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model on Restaurant Row, a naturalistic neuroeconomic foraging paradigm capable of behaviorally capturing multiple decision systems known to depend on dissociable neural circuits. Mice made self-paced choices on a daily limited time-budget, accepting or rejecting reward offers based on cost (delays cued by tone pitch) and subjective value (flavors), in a closed-economy system tested across months. We found streptozocin-treated mice disproportionately undervalued less-preferred flavors and inverted their meal-consumption patterns shifted toward a more costly strategy overprioritizing high-value rewards. These foraging behaviors were driven by impairments in multiple decision-making processes, including the ability to deliberate when engaged in conflict and cache the value of the passage of time as sunk costs. Surprisingly, diabetes-induced changes in motivation depended not only on the type of choice being made, but also on the salience of reward-scarcity in the environment. These findings suggest that complex relationships between metabolic dysfunction and dissociable valuation algorithms underlying unique cognitive heuristics and sensitivity to opportunity costs can disrupt distinct computational processes leading to comorbid psychiatric vulnerabilities.

AB  - During a survey of saprobic fungal niches in Southwestern China, eighteen ascomycetous collections of Nigrograna (Nigrogranaceae, Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes) were found on dead branches of medicinal plants. These taxa were characterized and identified based on morphological and culture characteristics, and phylogenetic analyses of a combined the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA (ITS), nuclear large subunit rDNA (28S, LSU), RNA polymerase second-largest subunit (rpb2), nuclear small subunit rDNA (18S, SSU), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-alpha) sequence dataset also confirmed their placement. As a result, four novel species, namely Nigrograna camelliae, N. guttulata, N. longiorostiolata and N. neriicola were described. Additionally, four new host records of N. acericola, N. magnoliae, N. oleae and N. thymi were introduced. Furthermore, this study addresses the taxonomic status of N. trachycarpi, proposing its synonymy under N. oleae. Detailed illustrations, descriptions and informative notes for each newly identified taxon and novel host record are provided in this study.

AB  - The increasing interest in fibre-enriched and functional bakery products has led to the exploration of novel plant-based ingredients with both technological functionality and consumer acceptance. This study evaluates the effects of incorporating flours derived from apple (Malus domestica cv. Oberl & auml;nder Himbeerapfel), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), and red, sessile, and pedunculate oak (Quercus rubra, Q. petraea, and Q. robur) into wheat bread at 5%, 10%, and 15% substitution levels. The impact on crumb structure, crust colour, textural parameters (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness), and sensory attributes was assessed. The inclusion of apple and sweet chestnut flours resulted in a softer crumb, lower adhesiveness, and higher sensory scores related to flavour, aroma, and crust appearance. In contrast, higher levels of oak- and horse-chestnut-derived flours increased crumb hardness and reduced overall acceptability due to bitterness or excessive density. Apple flour preserved crumb brightness and contributed to warm tones, while oak flours caused more intense crust darkening. These findings suggest that selected non-traditional flours, especially apple and sweet chestnut, can enhance the sensory and physical properties of wheat bread, supporting the development of fibre-rich, clean-label formulations aligned with consumer trends in sustainable and functional baking.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent psychostimulant that disrupts cognitive and neurobiological functions in brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Chronic METH use leads to altered synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). This study investigates gene expression changes following long-access intravenous METH self-administration in a rodent model. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted on PFC and hippocampal tissue to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between METH-treated and control groups. We identified 41 DEGs in the PFC and 32 in the hippocampus, many involved in synaptic plasticity, immune response, and energy metabolism. Key findings included downregulation of mitochondrial function genes and upregulation of genes related to neural development and extracellular matrix organization, highlighting the profound transcriptional effects of METH. As a proof-of-concept, we explored individual gene expression variability in relation to economic demand for METH. Rats exhibiting higher demand showed distinct molecular profiles, including upregulation of genes linked to neural signaling and transcription regulation, such as Foxd1 and Cdh1. This preliminary analysis demonstrates that individual differences in drug-seeking correlate with unique gene expression patterns. These findings suggest that both group-level and individual molecular changes contribute to the neurobiological mechanisms of METH use. A better understanding of these individual differences could potentially inform the development of personalized therapeutic approaches for MUD.

AB  - Essential oils (EOs) are natural antioxidant alternatives that reduce skin damage. However, EOs are highly volatile; therefore, their nanoencapsulation represents a feasible alternative to increase their stability and favor their residence time on the skin to guarantee their effect. In this study, EOs of Rosmarinus officinalis and Lavandula dentata were nanoencapsulated and evaluated as skin delivery systems with potential antioxidant activity. The EOs were characterized and incorporated into polymeric nanocapsules (NC-EOs) using nanoprecipitation. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the ferric thiocyanate method. The ex vivo effects on pig skin were evaluated based on biophysical parameters using bioengineering techniques. An ex vivo dermatokinetic evaluation on pig skin was performed using modified Franz cells and the tape-stripping technique. The results showed that the EOs had good antioxidant activity (>65%), which was maintained after nanoencapsulation and purification. The nanoencapsulation of the EOs favored its deposition in the stratum corneum compared to free EOs; the highest deposition rate was obtained for 1,8-cineole, a major component of L. dentata, at 1 h contact time, compared to R. officinalis with a major deposition of the camphor component. In conclusion, NC-EOs can be used as an alternative antioxidant for skin care.

AB  - Acute enteritis, an intestinal disease with intestinal inflammation and injury as the main pathological manifestations. Inhibiting the inflammatory response is critical to the treatment of acute enteritis. Previous studies have shown that the Hippophae rhamnoides polysaccharide (HRP) has strong immune-enhancing effects. However, their functions regarding the intestines and the underlying mechanism are still unclear. In this study, the role of HRP in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute enteritis in mice and its related mechanisms are discussed from two aspects: intestinal inflammation and intestinal microbiota. Kunming mice were inoculated with LPS to establish animal models of acute enteritis. The results showed that HRP attenuated the histological damage and maintained the intestine mucosal barrier via up-regulating the expression of occludin, claudin-1, and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), and suppressing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)). The relative mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-kappa Bp65) and tumor necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in the intestine tissues of LPSinduced acute enteritis mice significantly increased, whereas these adverse changes were alleviated in the HRP intervention groups. Notably, HRP may regulate the expression of the TRAF6/NF-kappa B signaling pathway by affecting the diversity of the intestinal microbiota. Microbiota analysis showed that HRP promoted the proliferation of beneficial bacteria, including Clostridia_UCG-014, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Bacteroidota, Deferribacterota, and reduced the abundance of Atopostipes, Corynebacterium, Actinobacteriota, and Desulfobacterota. The studies conformed that the gut microbiota is crucial in HRP-mediated immunity regulation. HRP shows great potential as an immune enhancer and a natural medicine for treating intestinal inflammatory diseases.

AB  - A biotemplate method was used for the synthesis of self-doped TiO2 photocatalysts via the impregnation of sheep wool fibers with a solution containing titanium hydroxocomplexes under mild hydrothermal conditions (115 degrees C, 170 kPa), followed by the removal of the wool template during calcination in air at 600 degrees C. An intermediate wool-TiO2 composite, formed as a product of hydrothermal impregnation of a wool biotemplate, was comprehensively studied using IR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, TG analysis, and DSC with mass spectrometric analysis of evaporation products to evaluate the mechanism of TiO2 crystallization. The phase composition, morphology, texture, and optical properties of the synthesized TiO2 photocatalysts were studied using XRD, SEM, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. High-temperature treatment after hydrothermal impregnation led to the formation of anatase and rutile TiO2 nanocrystallites with a characteristic size of 15-20 nm. The as-prepared TiO2 photocatalysts had an optical band gap of similar to 3.0 eV due to the high content of the rutile phase but also absorbed visible light due to impurity atoms and defects. The samples exhibited very high photocatalytic activity in the degradation of Rhodamine B dye, which was used as a probe molecule, under both UV and visible light. Based on the XPS and EPR results, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was attributed to the self-doping effect due to the many defects (Ti3+ sites and oxygen vacancies) formed during TiO2 crystallization, probably via the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ in disproportionation reactions of disulfide bonds involving titanium hydroxocomplexes.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to identify the presence of different spermatozoa subpopulations (SPs) according to their kinematic characteristics in the sperm of common carp and to test the effects of cryopreservation and prolonged (6-day) storage at room temperature (RT; 23 degrees C) and 4 degrees C on spermatozoa motility and subsequently on SP dynamics. Two-step clustering analyses identified three motile SPs based on their kinematic properties: SP1 contained spermatozoa with low velocity and low/moderate STR/LIN values (slow non-linear SP); SP2 was comprised of spermatozoa with high velocities and high STR/LIN values (fast linear SP); SP3 was characterized with high VCL, and moderate LIN/STR (fast non-linear SP); and an additional SP0 was added comprising immotile spermatozoa. Total motility, progressive motility and VCL decreased after cryopreservation to approximately 50% of their value in fresh sperm, while the frequency of SPs characterized by high values of motility parameters declined in favor of those with low motility values and SP0. Motility values of fresh and cryopreserved spermatozoa which were washed with fresh extender after thawing decreased significantly after 24 h of storage at RT and after 72 h of storage at 4 degrees C, while cryopreserved sperm which remained in the original cryomedium faced a steep decline in motility after only 2 h of storage. As subpopulation frequencies followed this dynamic, this indicates that cryopreserved sperm should be washed with fresh extender in order to obtain favorable sperm kinematic properties after freezing.

AB  - ObjectivesAluminium (Al) is also a popular neurotoxin that accelerates oxidative damage to biomolecules, which is correlated to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is a common metal on the globe and can easily enter the body through food and water additives, cutlery, deodorants, and medications. It accumulates mostly in the brain's frontal cortex and hippocampus, and its elimination half-life in the human brain is estimated to be 7 years. It is known to be particularly vulnerable to AD, which is a crippling neurological ailment that primarily affects ageing adults and has a large socioeconomic impact. Niruriflavone (NF) is a natural flavonoid isolated from Phyllanthus niruri Linn. It demonstrated remarkable neuroprotective efficacy by inhibiting oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and 5-lipoxygenase. The efficacy of NF was improved by the formulation of NF-loaded chitosan nanoparticle (NFLC). Consequently, the current study sought to assess the neuroprotective role of synthesized NFLC against aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced AD through the neurobehavioural, biochemical, and histopathological analysis.MethodsChronic administration of 100 mg/kg body weight of AlCl3 orally to Wistar rats resulted in AD. Neurobehavioural tests such the open-field test, elevated plus maze tests, and Morris water maze were used to evaluate the impact of NFLC treatment. The activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and level of aluminium were also measured in AlCl3-induced AD rats. Cresyl violet staining was used to study the histopathological variations.ResultsNFLC treatment considerably increased learning and memory skills, improved the exploratory activities, and reduced the anxiety-related behaviour. NFLC-treated rats had lower Al levels and higher AChE inhibition activity. NFLC prevented the neuronal loss in the AD rat brains which was observed in histopathological studies.ConclusionNFLC helps to treat AD brought on by Al poisoning through the inhibition of AChE activity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. The development of these efficacious multitargeted NFLC could help people afflicted by AD.

AB  - The influence of caffeine on behavioral functions in both healthy and schizophrenic subjects is controversial. Here we aimed to reveal the effects of repeated caffeine pre- and post-training treatments on motor and exploratory activities and cognitive functions in a reward-based test (Ambitus) along with a brain region-specific dopamine D-2 receptor profile in control and schizophrenia-like WISKET model rats. In the control animals, pretreatment caused temporary enhancement in motor activity, while permanent improvement in learning function was detected in the WISKET animals. Post-treatment produced significant impairments in both groups. Caffeine caused short-lasting hyperactivity followed by a rebound in the inactive phase determined in undisturbed circumstance. Caffeine treatment substantially enhanced the dopamine D-2 receptor mediated G-protein activation in the prefrontal cortex and olfactory bulb of both groups, while it increased in the dorsal striatum and cerebral cortex only in the WISKET animals. Caffeine enhanced the maximal binding capacity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of WISKET animals, but it decreased in the prefrontal cortex of the control animals. Regarding the dopamine D-2 receptor mRNA expression, caffeine treatment caused significant enhancement in the prefrontal cortex of WISKET animals, while it increased the hippocampal dopamine D-2 receptor protein amount in both groups. This study highlights the disparate effects of caffeine pre- versus post-training treatments on behavioral parameters in both control and schizophrenia-like animals and the prolonged changes in the dopaminergic system. It is supposed that the delayed depressive effects of caffeine might be compensated by frequent coffee intake, as observed in schizophrenic patients.

AB  - Autobiographical memory (AM) is a type of episodic memory that involves the recollection and re-experiencing of personal life events. AM retrieval is a complex process requiring the coordination of multiple memory processes across the brain. Important questions remain regarding the degree to which specific brain regions are consistently recruited during AM retrieval and the influence of methodological factors such as type of AM retrieval task and control task. Neuroimaging meta-analyses can summarize the brain regions associated with AM retrieval, addressing these questions by revealing consistent findings across multiple studies. We used a coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analysis method, seed based d mapping (SDM), to assess the largest set of neuroimaging studies of AM retrieval to date. An important advantage of SDM over other methods is that it factors in the effect sizes of the activation coordinates from studies, yielding a more representative summary of activations. Studies were selected if they elicited AM retrieval in the scanner, contrasted AM retrieval with a matched control task, and used univariate whole-brain analyses, yielding a set of 50 papers with 963 participants and 891 foci. The findings confirmed the recruitment of many previously identified core AM retrieval regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, retrosplenial cortex and posterior cingulate, and angular gyrus, and revealed additional regions, including bilateral inferior parietal lobule and greater activation extent through the PFC, including lateral PFC activation. Results were robust across different types of AM retrieval tasks (previously rehearsed cues vs. novel cues), and robust across different control tasks (visual/attention vs. semantic retrieval). To maximize the utility of the meta-analysis, all results image files are available online. In summary, the current meta-analysis provides an updated and more representative characterization of the neural correlates of autobiographical memory retrieval and how these neural correlates are affected by important experimental factors.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The solifuge genera Eutrecha Maury, 1982 and Xenotrecha Maury, 1982 are among the rarest and most elusive groups of camel spiders in the New World. Since their inception, both genera have remained unclassified within the subfamilial scheme of Ammotrechidae, where they belong, and their systematic position and affinities to other genera continue to be unexplored. This contribution addresses the affinities that Eutrecha and Xenotrecha have to the type genus of Ammotrechinae, Ammotrecha Banks, 1900. Based on the taxonomic distribution of characters shared by these genera, it is proposed that the three are closely related and classified into Ammotrechinae. Revised diagnoses are presented for Ammotrechinae s.str., Eutrecha, and Xenotrecha, and redescriptions are presented for species of these genera, when possible. A new species, Eutrecha belenensis sp. nov., is described from Colombia, raising to three the number of species in the genus. New material of Eutrecha florezi Villareal-Blanco, Armas and Martinez, 2017 and Xenotrecha huebneri (Kraepelin, 1899) is referenced, thus extending the distribution range of these species in Colombia and Brazil, respectively. Ammotrechinae s.str. is here defined by the presence of a retroventral longitudinal carina on the movable finger of the chelicerae and a cleavage plane basally on the femur of pedipalps, among other characters. The cleavage plane allows the pedipalp to be autotomized, representing the first report of pedipalp autotomy in Solifugae. This work also presents a discussion on the taxonomy of Ammotrechidae and delves into some aspects that affect the current delimitation of some of its subfamilies.

AB  - The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still remains on an upsurge trend. The second wave of this disease has led to panic in many countries, including India and some parts of the world suffering from the third wave. As there are no proper treatment options or remedies available for this deadly infection, supportive care equipment's such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators and heavy use of steroids play a vital role in the man-agement of COVID-19. In the midst of this pandemic, the COVID-19 patients are acquiring secondary infections such as mucormycosis also known as black fungus disease. Mucormycosis is a serious, but rare opportunistic fungal infection that spreads rapidly, and hence prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid high rate of mortality and morbidity rates. Mucormycosis is caused by the inhalation of its filamentous (hyphal form) fungi especially in the patients who are immunosuppressed. Recent studies have documented alarming number of COVID-19 patients with mucormycosis infection. Most of these patients had diabetes and were administered steroids for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and were consequently more prone to mucormycosis. Hence, the present review emphasizes mucormycosis and its related conditions, its mechanism in normal and COVID-19 affected individuals, influencing factors and challenges to overcome this black mold infection. Early identification and further investigation of this fungus will significantly reduce the severity of the disease and mortality rate in COVID-19 affected patients.

AB  - During infection, the host employs nutritional immunity to restrict access to iron. Staphylococcus lugdunensis has been recognized for its ability to utilize host-derived heme to overcome iron restriction. However, the mechanism behind this process involves the release of hemoglobin from erythrocytes, and the hemolytic factors of S. lugdunensis remain poorly understood. S. lugdunensis encodes four phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), short peptides with hemolytic activity. The peptides SLUSH A, SLUSH B, and SLUSH C are beta-type PSMs, and OrfX is an alpha-type PSM. Our study shows the SLUSH locus to be essential for the hemolytic phenotype of S. lugdunensis. All four peptides individually exhibited hemolytic activity against human and sheep erythrocytes, but synergism with sphingomyelinase was observed exclusively against sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that SLUSH is crucial for allowing the utilization of erythrocytes as the sole source of nutritional iron and confirm the transcriptional regulation of SLUSH by Agr. Additionally, our study reveals that SLUSH peptides stimulate the human immune system. Our analysis identifies SLUSH as a pivotal hemolytic factor of S. lugdunensis and demonstrates its concerted action with heme acquisition systems to overcome iron limitation in the presence of host erythrocytes.

AB  - Aerobic exercise is well known to promote neuroplasticity and hippocampal memory. In the developing brain, early-life exercise (ELE) can lead to persistent improvements in hippocampal function, yet molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been fully explored. In this study, transgenic mice harboring the "NuTRAP " (Nuclear tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) cassette in Emx1 expressing neurons ( "Emx1-NuTRAP " mice) undergo ELE during adolescence. We then simultaneously isolate and sequence translating mRNA and nuclear chromatin from single hippocampal homogenates containing Emx1-expressing neurons. This approach allowed us to couple translatomic with epigenomic sequencing data to evaluate the influence of histone modifications H4K8ac and H3K27me3 on translating mRNA after ELE. A subset of ELE mice underwent a hippocampal learning task to determine the gene expression and epigenetic underpinnings of ELE's contribution to improved hippocampal memory performance. From this experiment, we discover gene expression - histone modification relationships that may play a critical role in facilitated memory after ELE. Our data reveal candidate gene-histone modification interactions and implicate gene regulatory pathways involved in ELE's impact on hippocampal memory.

AB  - Females of the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae lay their eggs in olives mainly using fruit volatile stimuli. Using GC-MS analysis, we determined the chemical composition of the volatile blend emitted from field-collected olive fruit of cv. Megaritiki, at different stages of maturity. GC-MS analysis demonstrated qualitative and quantitative differences in the headspace blend emitted by the olive fruit. Certain chemicals such as toluene, n-octane, alpha-pinene, limonene, ethyl hexanol, nonanal n-dodecane, decanal and n-tetradecane were detected in greater amounts, irrespective of the growth stage of the fruit. The flies' exposure to a number of these chemicals, such as n-octane and alpha-pinene, as well as to a mixture consisting of n-octane, alpha-pinene, limonene, ethyl hexanol, nonanal, n-dodecane, decanal and n-tetradecane favoured successful mating and egg production. The results may contribute to the improvement of the mass rearing of the fly, through these findings, which illustrate the positive effect that certain fruit volatile chemicals have on the fly's reproduction and offer a better understanding of the relation between the fly and the host fruit.

AB  - Introduction Diabetes Mellitus (DM) constitutes a global epidemic and is one of the top ten leading causes of mortality (WHO, 2019), projected to rank seventh by 2030. The US National Diabetes Statistics Report (2021) states that 38.4 million Americans have diabetes. Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an FDA-approved target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current DPP-4 inhibitors may cause adverse effects, including gastrointestinal issues, severe joint pain (FDA safety warning), nasopharyngitis, hypersensitivity, and nausea. Moreover, the development of novel drugs and the in vivo assessment of DPP-4 inhibition are both costly and often impractical. These challenges highlight the urgent need for efficient in-silico approaches to facilitate the discovery and optimization of safer and more effective DPP-4 inhibitors.Methodology Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a widely used computational approach for evaluating the properties of chemical substances. In this study, we employed a Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) approach, specifically the Logic Tensor Network (LTN), to develop a DPP-4 QSAR model capable of identifying potential small-molecule inhibitors and predicting bioactivity classification. For comparison, we also implemented baseline models using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Transformers. A total of 6,563 bioactivity records (SMILES-based compounds with IC50 values) were collected from ChEMBL, PubChem, BindingDB, and GTP. Feature sets used for model training included descriptors (CDK Extended-PaDEL), fingerprints (Morgan), chemical language model embeddings (ChemBERTa-2), LLaMa 3.2 embedding features, and physicochemical properties.Results Among all tested configurations, the Neuro-symbolic QSAR model (NeSyDPP-4) performed best using a combination of CDK extended and Morgan fingerprints. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.9725, an F1-score of 0.9723, an ROC AUC of 0.9719, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9446. These results outperformed the baseline DNN and Transformer models, as well as existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. To further validate the robustness of the model, we conducted an external evaluation using the Drug Target Common (DTC) dataset, where NeSyDPP-4 also demonstrated strong performance, with an accuracy of 0.9579, an AUC-ROC of 0.9565, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9171, and an F1-score of 0.9577.Discussion These findings suggest that the NeSyDPP-4 model not only delivered high predictive performance but also demonstrated generalizability to external datasets. This approach presents a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional vivo screening, offering valuable support for the identification and classification of biologically active DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

AB  - The bioactive components present in onion peel powder are a promising factor in preventing/treating obesity. Overweight/obesity causes metabolic changes, which can lead to leptin resistance in the central nervous system (CNS) and, thus, to structural and functional changes in the brain. Objectives: The presented study focused on evaluating the influence of a diet supplemented with onion peel powder on the immunoexpression of leptin receptors (LepRs) in the hippocampus in obese rats and the potential anti-obesity role of the onion in the brain. Methods: To induce obesity, the animals were given a high-energy chow containing lard and sucrose. Onion skin powder was used to modify the standard and high-energy diets (10.5 g per rat/week) of Wistar rats in a 14-week experiment followed by a brain IHC study. Results: The effect of the onion diet on the expression of neuronal LepRs and astrocytes in the hippocampus was analyzed. Obese animals receiving onion in the diet showed significant growth in the average number of immunoreactive LepR (LepR-IR) neurons (p = 0.00108) and their average size (p = 0.00168) in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Meanwhile, in obese rats not given onion peel powder, a significant increase in the average density of astrocytes was observed (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The increased density of astrocytes in the hippocampus of obese animals can probably have a beneficial effect on brain changes in overweight individuals. The inclusion of onion in the diet of overweight/obese individuals may lead to increased hippocampal neuroplasticity, manifested by changes in the immunoexpression of LepRs. It can be speculated that the observed changes have a protective effect on the CNS structures during obesity, but this undoubtedly requires further research.

AB  - Epilepsy is characterized by the unpredictability but recurrence of seizures caused by the synchronized aberrant firing of neuronal populations. It has been shown that astrocytes (one of the most prominent glial cells) are ideally positioned to induce or contribute to neural network synchronization. Although astrocytes cannot generate action potentials, they have the capacity to sense and respond to neuronal activity, which allows them to function as homeostatic regulators of synaptic interactions. Considering the necessity of astrocyte-neuron bidirectional interactions in synaptic transmission and plasticity, in the current study, the role of astrocytes in synaptic metaplasticity and resultant behavioral seizures induced by Pentylentetrazole (PTZ) was assessed. Rats were kindled by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of PTZ (30 mg/kg/48 h). A glial cell inhibitor, Fluorocitrate (FC), was injected into the right lateral cerebral ventricle of the rat 30 min before PTZ during kindling progress. The maximal seizure stage (SS), stage 2 and 4 latency (S2L, S4L), stage 4 and 5 duration (S4D, S5D), and seizure duration (SD) were all assessed 20 min after PTZ administration by observation. Following Schaffer collateral stimulation, in vivo field, potential recordings from the CA1 area of the hip-pocampus were employed to assess the metaplasticity induced in kindled rats. The inhibition of glial cells during the kindling process significantly lowered SS, S4D&S5D and increased S4L (Two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni Posttest, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001). In comparison to the control group, electrophysiological data demonstrated that HFS-induced LTP in kindled animals was decreased (Unpaired t-test, P < 0.05). Glial cell inhibition prevented PTZ's effect on LTP. Our data imply that kindling altered CA1 pyramidal neurons' vulnerability to synaptic plasticity. This shift in neuronal plasticity (metaplasticity) is mediated in part by glial cells and is important in the for-mation of seizure symptoms. As a result, glial cell inhibition was found to alleviate seizure behavior. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globalization, increased frequency of travel, and a rise in legal and illegal animal trades can introduce exotic ticks into the United States. We herein report the importation of a male Rhipicephalus pulchellus (Gerstacker) on a human traveler returning to Connecticut from Tanzania, Africa, and review historical importation records of this species into the United States. This common tick is broadly distributed throughout East Africa, from Eritrea to Tanzania, has a wide host range on domestic animals and wildlife, and has been most frequently introduced into the United States on tick-infested wild animal hosts and animal trophies, but documentation of importation on humans has been rare. Archival records at the United States Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories show R. pulchellus has been introduced into the United States at least 40 times over the last 62 yr. Rhipicephalus pulchellus has been linked to Rickettsia conorii, the agent of boutonneuse fever in humans, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus, and Nairobi sheep disease orthonairovirus. Given the potential for this exotic tick to introduce animal or human pathogens, proper surveillance, interception, identification, and reporting of these ticks are vital in protecting human and animal health.

AB  - Age is an essential attribute in studies of animal development, survival and reproduction. Here we evaluate the age estimation technique of molar progression devised for kangaroos in 1965. We used 71 wild eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) that were first captured and aged as pouch young at Wilsons Promontory National Park, Victoria, and subsequently found dead between the ages of 1 and 14 years. We expected that the original equation, derived from captive kangaroos in Queensland, would not estimate age correctly due to differences in diet and/or clinal variation in skull morphology. We found no difference in rate of molar progression between males (n = 44) and females (n = 27). Our overall regression of age on molar index (MI) was log10 (age, days) = 0.284 (MI) + 2.511, r2 = 0.97. The slope of this equation was indistinguishable from that of the original one, meaning that molar progression in the wild was equivalent to that originally developed on captive kangaroos, despite likely differences in diet and morphology.
   The age of an animal affects every aspect of its biology. Almost 60 years ago, a researcher devised a way to estimate the age of captive kangaroos from their teeth, but the results have never been confirmed. We followed wild kangaroos through their whole lives and found that the estimates closely matched their true ages, so this method can now be used with confidence in kangaroo field studies.

AB  - Purpose To study the effects of gamma radiation on tea seed germination, morphological changes, and genetic variation by using gamma radiation. Material and Method Fresh Tea seed material were irradiated with twenty different doses of gamma radiation such as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 90, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 Gy from Cobalt Co-60 source from Regional Nuclear Agriculture Research Center, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya (BCKV), West Bengal, in between 2019 and 2020. Result and Conclusion The growth behavior of tea seedling was recorded under varying levels of gamma radiation and its performance at nursery stages. It was observed seed irradiated with doses from 35 Gy to 100 Gy could germinate but could not survive beyond five (05) months. When treated with higher doses as 200 Gy, 500 Gy and 1000 Gy, no seed germination takes places due to possible damages occur in the DNA structure. Screening of growth characteristics of tea plant generally monitored by the characteristics like plant height, number of leaves, number of primary branches, base diameter, and total leaf area of plants and we found that these characteristics significantly increased with the progress of time and increasing levels of gamma radiation; however, the plant height showed decreasing trend with the increasing levels of gamma radiation, which could be due to the change in chromosomal structure and genetic alteration. After 90 weeks of planting, the plant height, no. of primary branches, the number of leaves, plant base diameter, and total leaf area per plant recorded were 36.42 cm, 1/plant, 7.11/plant, 0.62 c.m, 22.92 cm(2)/plant respectively under the radiation level 30 Gy, whereas the corresponding figures of the above parameters at the control treatment were 85.32 cm, 1/plant, 18.84/plant, 1.18 c.m and 26.68 cm(2)/plant, respectively. The total plant height, no. of primary branches, the number of leaves, plant base diameter, and total leaf area per plant were significantly influenced by the rising levels of gamma radiation (up to 100 Gy), finally, after 90 weeks of planting, the maximum no. of branching was observed in the treatment of 8 Gy, 10 Gy and 15 Gy respectively. The study reveals a hitherto open the possibility of using gamma radiation on tea plant for creation of variation in the tea seed planting materials. Further studies on mutation using tea planting materials would give an insight into its mutable gene behavior.

AB  - Background Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber, NMRs) and blind mole-rats (Spalax galili, BMRs) are representative subterranean rodents that have evolved many extraordinary traits, including hypoxia tolerance, longevity, and cancer resistance. Although multiple candidate loci responsible for these traits have been uncovered by genomic studies, many of them are limited to functional changes to amino acid sequence and little is known about the contributions of other genetic events. To address this issue, we focused on gene losses (unitary pseudogenes) and systematically analyzed gene losses in NMRs and BMRs, aiming to elucidate the potential roles of pseudogenes in their adaptation to subterranean lifestyle. Results We obtained the pseudogene repertoires in NMRs and BMRs, as well as their respective aboveground relatives, guinea pigs and rats, on a genome-wide scale. As a result, 167, 139, 341, and 112 pseudogenes were identified in NMRs, BMRs, guinea pigs, and rats, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified 4 shared and 2 species-specific enriched functional groups (EFGs) in subterranean lineages. Notably, the pseudogenes in these EFGs might be associated with either regressive (e.g., visual system) or adaptive (e.g., altered DNA damage response) traits. In addition, several pseudogenes including TNNI3K and PDE5A might be associated with specific cardiac features observed in subterranean lineages. Interestingly, we observed 20 convergent gene losses in NMRs and BMRs. Given that the functional investigations of these genes are generally scarce, we provided functional evidence that independent loss of TRIM17 in NMRs and BMRs might be beneficial for neuronal survival under hypoxia, supporting the positive role of eliminating TRIM17 function in hypoxia adaptation. Our results also suggested that pseudogenes, together with positively selected genes, reinforced subterranean adaptations cooperatively. Conclusions Our study provides new insights into the molecular underpinnings of subterranean adaptations and highlights the importance of gene losses in mammalian evolution.

AB  - Nowadays to move toward a more sustainable agriculture, use of pesticide alternatives that have positive effects and play critical roles toward reducing the use of pesticides should be used. Laboratory bioassays were carried out to analyze the bioactivity of tannins isolated from urtica weed leaves (U), bean hull (B), black tea (BT) and green tea (GT) against larvae of cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) using food mixing technique and essential oil isolated from onion against larvae of cotton leafworm, adults of rice weevil and houseflies using fumigation technique. The results showed that during the first week of treatment, tannins extracted from U had the strongest antifeedant activity with an EC50 of 33.034 mu g/g followed by tannins extracted from B (EC50 = 47.839 mu g/g). In the second and third week, tannins isolated from B depicted highest antifeedant activity (EC50 = 37.733 and 84.828, respectively). Furthermore, the isolated tannins induced notable larval growth inhibition on S littoralis. On the other hand, mortality percentage of onion essential oil on tested insects clearly increased with both increased concentration and exposure time. The LC50 (mu g/cm(3)) at 30 min reflected that the essential oil had a greater toxicity to cotton leafworm with a LC50 = 2.15 mu g/cm(3) while least toxic to house flies (LC50 = 16.09). The repellency action based on LT50 values was seen to be highly effective in houseflies (LT50 = 1.85 min). The results demonstrated that tannins and essential oil could be applicable in the management of insect pests to decrease ecologically detrimental effects of synthetic insecticides.

AB  - BackgroundMucormycosis, a fungal emergency, poses a serious threat to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 individuals due to its invasive nature, rapid progression, and high rates of morbidity and mortality. This underscores the crucial need for timely detection and management. In this study, we investigated the utility of real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assays for detecting Mucorales in clinical specimens, and assessed the performance of both SYBR Green and TaqMan probe RT-qPCR in amplifying Mucorales-specific 18S rDNA genes. We conducted accuracy analyses using direct examination with KOH as a standard for the laboratory diagnosis of mucormycosis. Additionally, we compared the results with culture and duplex PCR.Patients/MethodsBoth SYBR Green and TaqMan RT-qPCR were optimized using Mucorales-specific oligonucleotides to amplify the conserved 18S rDNA targets. DNAs extracted from 120 rhino sinus specimens, which all were collected from COVID-19 patients upon suspicion of invasive fungal infections, were used for molecular diagnosis. The results of both RT-qPCR assays were compared with the result of direct microscopy, culture, and duplex Mucorales-specific PCR assay.ResultsSYBR Green real-time PCR produced a distinct melting temperature (Tm) pattern (80.24 +/- 0.70 degrees C) and detected Mucorales in 51 out of 120 clinical samples. When compared to direct examination with KOH, the standard method for diagnosing mucormycosis, SYBR Green PCR demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.67% (95% confidence interval (CI): 86.7-96.5%) and a specificity of 90.28% (95% CI: 84.9-95.5%). In contrast, TaqMan-probe PCR identified Mucorales in 34 out of 120 samples, with a sensitivity of 64.58% (95% CI: 56-73.1%) and a specificity of 95.83% (95% CI: 92.26-99.39%).ConclusionSYBR Green-based PCR can be used as a reliable confirmatory test for diagnosing mucormycosis, particularly in cases with atypical hyphae, mixed infections (featuring both septate and non-septate hyphae), or when the direct examination is positive but culture results are negative. The lower sensitivity of the TaqMan-probe PCR may be attributed to factors such as using a degenerate probe, which can lead to false-negative results.

AB  - Pregnancy morbidity induced by anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL+/PM+) is mainly thought to arise from placental abnormalities. We attempted to investigate the effect of aPL on the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in the trophoblast and how YAP regulated human trophoblasts function. Thus, HTR-8 cells were treated with IgG purified from aPL+/PM+ women or normal controls. We found that aPL+/PM+ IgG impacted YAP activity via abrogating YAP expression. Further investigation of the anti-beta 2GPI-IgG/beta 2GPI complex showed an inhibition of nuclear YAP level and translocation in a dose-dependent manner, which might be rescued by progesterone in HTR-8 cells. YAP overexpression or knockdown HTR-8 cells were established for the evaluation of cell function and related gene expression in vitro. Loss of YAP arrested cell cycles in the G2/M phase, accelerated cell apoptosis by increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl2, and disrupted MMP2/9-mediated cell migration and angiogenesis tube formation by VEGF. These findings support a new mechanism of PM associated with aPL through which YAP inactivation induced by aPL perturbs the trophoblast cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis, finally developing into pregnancy failure.

AB  - The nasal cartilage plays a crucial role in supporting the nose and facilitating respiration, however has a limited regenerative capabilities once damaged. Nasal cartilage tissue engineering presents a promising avenue for addressing cartilage lesions and regeneration. Additionally, surgical procedures such as tumor removal, trauma reconstruction, or rhinoplasty require the surgeon to meticulously shape the cartilage to conform to the patient's individual contours, a task that is both time-consuming and challenging. The advent of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology provides a potential solution to this predicament, as it enables the precise fabrication of intricate and personalized tissue constructs. Furthermore, the decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) with native 3D structures and various bioactive components, which mimic an optimal non-immune environment combined with the seed cell, especially stem cell-recellularized construct, is considered an ideal choice for regenerating functional organs/tissues. In view of this, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the 3D bioprinting technologies and seed cells and dECM biomaterials for 3D bioprinting nasal cartilage tissue engineering, and look forward to the application prospect of 3D bioprinting of nasal cartilage regeneration research.

AB  - In this work we investigate the properties of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centres created during single crystal diamond growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on [113]-oriented substrates and with N2O as a dopant gas. The use of spin echo and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) allows us to assess NV- ratio with respect to substitutional nitrogen impurities (N-s(0)) incorporated during growth, a critical figure of merit for quantum technologies. We demonstrate that, at moderate growth temperatures (800 degrees C), dense NV- ensembles of several hundreds of ppb (800 ppb for 50 ppm of added N2O) and with exceptionally high NV-/ N0s ratios of up to 25% can be achieved. This NV- creation yield is higher by at least an order of magnitude to that typically obtained on standard [100]-grown diamonds and comparable to the best values reported for electron-irradiated diamonds. The material obtained here thus advantageously combines a high NV- density, high creation yield, long coherence times of several tens of ms together with a partial preferential orientation.

AB  - Mast cells (MCs) are an evolutionary well-conserved type of cells, mediating and modulating allergic responses in innate immunity and tissue remodeling after chronic inflammation. Among other tissues, they inhabit both the testis and epididymis. In the testis, MCs usually appear in the interstitial compartment in humans, but not in other standard experimental models, like rats and mice. MCs seem to be responsible for testicular tissue fibrosis in different causes of infertility. Although experimental animal models follow the effect on MC activation or penetration to the interstitial tissue like in humans to some extent, there is an inconsistency in the available literature regarding experimental design, animal strain, and detection methods used. This comprehensive review offers an insight into the literature on MCs in mammalian testes and epididymides. We aimed to find the most suitable model for research on MC and offer recommendations for future experimental designs. When using in vivo animal models, tunica albuginea incorporation and standard histological assessment need to be included. Domesticated boar strains kept in modified controlled conditions exhibit the highest similarity to the MC distribution in the human testis. 3D testicular models are promising but need further fine-tuning to become a valid model for MC investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAgeing and associated cognitive impairments are becoming serious issues around the world. In this study, the physiological properties of three kinds of complexes of fatty acid (capric, stearic and oleic acid, respectively) and de-branched starch molecules were investigated via a d-galactose-induced ageing model. This study revealed differences in the regulation of cognitive impairment and brain damage following intervention of different complexes, which might highlight a potent approach for the prevention of this chronic disease. RESULTSData indicated that three complexes improved response time and cognitive function and the bio-parameter markers associated with oxidative stress in ageing rats. Among them, the complexes prepared from de-branched starch-oleic acid showed a greater improvement compared to others. In addition, de-branched starch-capric acid complex showed a higher improvement in the morphology of colon cells and hippocampal neuronal cells. The consumption of de-branched starch-capric acid and -oleic acid complexes generated more short-chain fatty acids in the gut. More importantly, the complexation of de-branched starch with either caprate or stearate enhanced gut Akkermansia. Therefore, it was proposed that the richness in Akkermansia and gut metabolites might be associated with reduced damage of the hippocampal neuronal cells induced by the ageing progress. Moreover, the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) pathway was activated in liver in de-branched starch-capric acid complex diet. In summary, de-branched starch-capric acid complex exhibited a greater effect on the attenuation of ageing-induced cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONThis study might highlight a new approach for intervening in the cognitive impairment during the ageing progress via a food supply. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - This study determined the effects of purslane aqueous extract (PAE), purslane methanolic extract (PME), and purslane ethanolic extract (PEE) compared with cysteine on goat semen. The samples collected for evaluation were pooled and diluted with a basic Tris diluent 50 mu g/mL of purslane aqueous, methanolic, or ethanolic extract alone and in combination with 10 mM cysteine. Results demonstrated significant improvements using treated diluents in total motility, viability, mitochondrial activity, and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Also, all of the combined treatments and PME50 mu g/mL resulted in higher progressive motility, live spermatozoa, and integrity of DNA and plasma membranes. The apoptotic and dead spermatozoa were decreased significantly using PME50 mu g/mL, cysteine(10mM) + PME50 mu g/mL, and cysteine(10mM) + PAE(50 mu g/mL). DNA integrity in cysteine(10mM) + PME50 mu g/mL was demonstrated to be higher than cysteine and PEE50 mu g/mL. Moreover, higher viability was observed in cysteine(10mM) + PME50 mu g/mL compared with the PME50 mu g/mL, PAE(50 mu g/mL), PEE50 mu g/mL, and cysteine. From comparison among all treatments, cysteine(10mM) + PME50 mu g/mL showed the highest percentages of total motility, mitochondrial activity, and the lowest percentages of MDA. In conclusion, inclusion of purslane extracts and cysteine into the extenders improved the quality of cryopreserved spermatozoa. However, the mixture of methanolic extract and cysteine was more beneficial among the various treatments.

AB  - In sheep, anatomical characteristics of the cervix and animal value limit application of reproductive technologies; therefore, most breeding is natural service. Rams are selected based on desired physical traits and semen capacity, but their contribution to flock genetics is constrained by expression of sexual behavior. In 1964, it was first reported that approximately one-third of rams expressed limited sexual interest toward ewes in estrus. Therefore, if rams were evaluated for expression of sexual behavior, it is estimated that as many rams would be culled for the lack of behavior as are currently culled for semen quality or physical deficiencies. Sexual behavior is complex, requiring sensory recognition and processing, integration of ram cohorts and social dominance, female mate choice, and a physical response. This review of the literature aims to provide insights into factors influencing expression of ram sexual behavior.

AB  - We, herein, investigated the in vitro effects of galactose on the activity of pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), complex II and IV (cytochrome c oxidase) of the respiratory chain and Na+K+-ATPase in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of 30-day-old rats. We also determined the influence of the antioxidants, trolox, ascorbic acid and glutathione, on the effects elicited by galactose. Galactose was added to the assay at concentrations of 0.1, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mM. Control experiments were performed without galactose. Galactose, at 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mM, decreased pyruvate kinase activity in the cerebral cortex and at 10.0 mM in the hippocampus. Galactose, at 10.0 mM, reduced SDH and complex II activities in the cerebellum and hippocampus, and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity in the hippocampus. Additionally, decreased Na+K+-ATPase activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus; conversely, galactose, at 3.0 and 5.0 mM, increased this enzyme's activity in the cerebellum. Data show that galactose disrupts energy metabolism and trolox, ascorbic acid and glutathione addition prevented the majority of alterations in the parameters analyzed, suggesting the use of antioxidants as an adjuvant therapy in Classic galactosemia.

AB  - In the pig industry, the social behaviors of preweaning piglets are critical indicators of their liveability, growth, health, and welfare status. In this study, we developed a novel method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that extracts high-quality spatiotemporal features to detect different types of social behaviors among preweaning piglets: snout-snout and snout-body social nosing, and snout-snout and snout-body aggressive/ playing behavior. In our method, piglets were first detected and individually tracked using an integrated CNNbased network. Upon piglet detection, the key points of the piglet body were detected using a key point detector and a 1-second-tracking-unit strategy was adopted to reduce the influence of tracking errors and missing the detection of piglets. To detect suspected social behaviors in a tracking unit, we constructed a self-adaptive spatial affinity kernel function to represent the relationships between piglets, and pairwise piglets with spatial affinity higher than 0.7 were kept for further analysis, while the others were filtered out. Thereafter, high-quality spatiotemporal features consisting of the piglets' spatial affinity and the corresponding linear motion and angular motion intensities were extracted and input into a support vector machine to hierarchically detect and classify piglet social behaviors. In addition, the proportions of the four detected social behaviors associated with the interaction points were analyzed in short video clips and a long video that covered the whole daytime. Our method achieved a favorable detection performance with a recall of 0.9687, a precision of 0.9309, and an F1 of 0.9494 in the short video clips, and a recall of 0.9576, a precision of 0.9187, and an F1 of 0.9377 in the 8-h long video episode. This shows the feasibility of the detection of social behaviors for piglets using CNNs.

AB  - Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a disease associated with dysregulation of the immune complement system, especially of the alternative pathway (AP). Complement factor H (CFH), consisting of 20 domains called complement control protein (CCP1-20), downregulates the AP as a cofactor for mediating C3 inactivation by complement factor I. However, anomalies related to CFH are known to cause excessive complement activation and cytotoxicity. In aHUS, mutations and the presence of anti-CFH autoantibodies (AAbs) have been reported as plausible causes of CFH dysfunction, and it is known that CFH-related aHUS carries a high probability of end-stage renal disease. Elucidating the detailed functions of CFH at the molecular level will help to understand aHUS pathogenesis. Herein, we used biophysical data to reveal that a heavy-chain antibody fragment, termed VHH4, recognized CFH with high affinity. Hemolytic assays also indicated that VHH4 disrupted the protective function of CFH on sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, Xray crystallography revealed that VHH4 recognized the Leu1181-Leu1189(CCP20) loop, a known anti-CFH AAbs epitope. We next analyzed the dynamics of the C-terminal region of CFH and showed that the epitopes recognized by anti-CFH AAbs and VHH4 were the most flexible regions in CCP18-20. Finally, we conducted mutation analyses to elucidate the mechanism of VHH4 recognition of CFH and revealed that VHH4 inserts the Trp1183(CCP20) residue of CFH into the pocket formed by the complementary determining region 3 loop. These results suggested that anti-CFH AAbs may adopt a similar molecular mechanism to recognize the flexible loop of Leu1181Leu1189(CCP20), leading to aHUS pathogenesis.

AB  - Amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta Os), toxic peptide aggregates found in Alzheimer's disease, cause synapse pathology. A beta Os interact with neurexins (NRXs), key synaptic organizers, and this interaction dampens normal trafficking and function of NRXs. Axonal trafficking of NRX is in part regulated by its interaction with SorCS1, a protein sorting receptor, but the impact of SorCS1 regulation of NRXs in A beta pathology was previously unstudied. Here, we show competition between the SorCS1 ectodomain and A beta Os for beta-NRX binding and rescue effects of the SorCS1b isoform on A beta Oinduced synaptic pathology. Like A beta Os, the SorCS1 ectodomain binds to NRX1 beta through the histidine-rich domain of NRX1 beta, and the SorCS1 ectodomain and A beta Os compete for NRX1 beta binding. In cultured hippocampal neurons, SorCS1b colocalizes with NRX1 beta on the axon surface, and axonal expression of SorCS1b rescues A beta O-induced impairment of NRX-mediated presynaptic organization and presynaptic vesicle recycling and A beta O-induced structural defects in excitatory synapses. Thus, our data suggest a role for SorCS1 in the rescue of A beta O-induced NRX dysfunction and synaptic pathology, providing the basis for a novel potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) are commercially cultivated in >60 countries, and their fresh leaves are processed into tea, which is the most widely consumed beverage in the world. Although several chromosome-level tea plant genomes have been published, they collapsed the two haplotypes and ignored a large number of allelic variations that may underlie important biological functions in this species. Here, we present a phased chromosome-scale assembly for an elite oolong tea cultivar, "Huangdan", that is well known for its high levels of aroma. Based on the two sets of haplotype genome data, we identified numerous genetic variations and a substantial proportion of allelic imbalance related to important traits, including aroma- and stress-related alleles. Comparative genomics revealed extensive structural variations as well as expansion of some gene families, such as terpene synthases (TPSs), that likely contribute to the high-aroma characteristics of the backbone parent, underlying the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of aroma-related chemicals in oolong tea. Our results uncovered the genetic basis of special features of this oolong tea cultivar, providing fundamental genomic resources to study evolution and domestication for the economically important tea crop.

AB  - The transcription coactivator YAP1 mediates the major effects of the Hippo signaling pathway. The CCN family is a small group of glycoproteins known to be downstream effectors of YAP1 in diverse tissues. However, whether CCN family members mediate the effects of YAP1 in human trophoblasts is unknown. In this study, placental expression of both YAP1 and CCN1 was found to be impaired in pregnancies complicated by early-onset severe preeclampsia. CCN1 was expressed not only in cytotrophoblasts, trophoblast columns, and mesenchymal cells, similar to active YAP1, but also in syncytiotrophoblasts of normal first-trimester placental villi; moreover, decidual staining of active YAP1 and CCN1 was found in both interstitial and endovascular extravillous trophoblasts. In cultured immortalized human trophoblastic HTR-8/SVneo cells, knockdown of YAP1 decreased CCN1 mRNA and protein expression and led to impaired cell invasion and migration. Also, CCN1 knockdown negatively affected HTR-8/SVneo cell invasion and migration but not viability. YAP1 knockdown was further found to impair HTR-8/SVneo cell viability via G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, while CCN1 knockdown had minimal effect on cell cycle arrest and no effect on apoptosis. Accordingly, treatment with recombinant CCN1 partially reversed the YAP1 knockdown-induced impairment in trophoblast invasion and migration but not in viability. Thus, CCN1 mediates the effects of YAP1 on human trophoblast invasion and migration but not apoptosis, and decreased placental expression of YAP1 and CCN1 in pregnancies complicated by early-onset severe preeclampsia might contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is essential for the neural control of mammalian circadian timing system. The circadian activity of the SCN is modulated by its afferent projections. In the present study, we examine neuroanatomical characteristics and afferent projections of the SCN in the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) using immunocytochemistry and retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG). Distribution of the vasoactive intestinal peptide was present in the SCN from rostral to caudal, especially concentrated in its ventral part. FG-labeled neurons were observed in the lateral septal nucleus, septofimbrial nucleus, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, posterior hypothalamic nucleus, posterior complex of the thalamus, ventral subiculum, rostral linear nucleus of the raphe, periaqueductal gray, mesencephalic reticular formation, dorsal raphe nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, parvicellular reticular nucleus, intermediate reticular nucleus, and ventrolateral reticular nucleus. In summary, the morphology of the SCN in tree shrews is described from rostral to caudal. In addition, our data demonstrate for the first time that the SCN in tree shrews receives inputs from numerous brain regions in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon. This comprehensive knowledge of the afferent projections of the SCN in tree shrews provides further insights into the neural organization and physiological processes of circadian rhythms.

AB  - Patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of developing cognitive impairment. The cause of mental health disorders in CKD and in chronic hemodialysis patients is multifactorial, due to the interaction of classical cardiovascular disease risk factors, kidney- and dialysis-related risk factors with depression, and multiple drugs overuse. A large number of compounds, defined as uremic toxins that normally are excreted by healthy kidneys, accumulate in the circulations, in the tissues, and in the organs of CKD patients. Among the candidate uremic toxins are several guanidino compounds, such as Guanidine. Uremic toxins may also accumulate in the brain and may have detrimental effects on cerebral resident cells (neurons, astrocytes, microglia) and microcirculation. The present study aims to analyze the effect of Guanidine on hippocampal excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (fEPSPs) and in CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded intracellularly. Moreover, we compared these effects with the alterations induced in vitro by CKD patients derived serum samples. Our results show an increased, dose-dependent, synaptic activity in the CA1 area in response to both synthetic Guanidine and patient's serum, through a mechanism involving glutamatergic transmission. In particular, the concomitant increase of both NMDA and AMPA component of the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) suggests a presynaptic mechanism. Interestingly, in presence of the lower dose of guanidine, we measure a significant reduction of EPSCs, in fact the compound does not inhibit GABA receptors allowing their inhibitory effect of glutamate release. These findings suggest that cognitive symptoms induced by the increase of uremic compounds in the serum of CKD patients are caused, at least in part, by an increased glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus.

AB  - The inherent benefits of soft materials in robotic designs have rendered soft robotics a growing field in research and engineering. Due to their compliance, soft robots are safe in working environments shared with humans, offer great potential in health care and medical applications, and may be operational in environments inaccessible or unfit for their solid body counterparts. However, for truly soft, self-contained robots, onboard electronics-free control is required. While there are pneumatic transistors that can be combined to simple control logics, the weight of these circuits may sometimes overburden soft-legged robots. To overcome the weight limitation of our current soft robotic prototypes, we sought inspiration from nature by studying the leg morphology and parasagittal gait of mammals. They have been shaped by evolution to support the heaviest terrestrial animals on earth: elephants. We assume that the leg morphology and strides of elephants are optimized for energy efficiency and/or load bearing, and we translated their characteristics to a pneumatically actuated elephant soft robotic leg. However, as soft actuators are remarkably different from the mammal joint-and-muscle system, a direct transfer from joint angles and muscle movement is not desirable. We therefore adapted the known kinematics of elephant strides to PneuNet bending actuators by means of approximating the actuators' bending angles to elephants' joint angles and subsequently arranging different actuator states into a sequence in order to approximate the elephant strides. We here present our current version of a biomimetic soft walker with parasagittal gait achieving a speed of 126 mm/s (0.82 body lengths per second) and a total load capacity of >5.2 x its body weight.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) percentage is the proportion of fat between the muscle fibers of the loin eye, which contributes significantly to the flavor and tenderness of the pork. Traditional IMF percentage is measured after slaughter, which requires a high cost, and the slaughtered pig with high IMF percentage can not be directly retained for breeding. Instead of slaughter, using ultrasound images to predict IMF percentage has been gradually proposed as an alternative measurement. However, due to the high cost of dataset construction and limited feature extraction capability of traditional image analysis methods, there is still a lack of an accurate and robust method based on the large-scale dataset for predicting IMF percentage. Here, to establish an accurate model for non-invasive prediction of IMF percentage in pigs, a total number of 4,552 ultrasound images and their corresponding IMF percentage of 945 pigs are collected in this study. We proposed a general-purpose model, PIMFP, to accurately predict IMF percentage based on the deep convolutional neural network. The PIMFP model comprises three primary modules: image preprocessing, feature extraction, and IMF percentage prediction. The preprocessing procedures for the raw ultrasound images include channel conversion, region of interest selection, and contrast enhancement. The feature extraction module characterizes the preprocessed images using the residual neural network as the backbone to extract features. The image features are then delivered to the IMF percentage prediction module depending on the fully connected layer. Our proposed model exhibits significant advantages over existing models in predictive performance, computational speed, classification ability, robustness, and interpretability. For easier use, we also provide a user-friendly web tool for predicting IMF percentage automatically in a single step. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the power of the PIMFP model for predicting IMF percentage, which has great potential in future breeding and highlights the application of artificial intelligence algorithms in livestock.

AB  - The inherent uncertainties in traditional hydrological models present significant challenges for accurately simulating runoff. Combining machine learning models with traditional hydrological models is an essential approach to enhancing the runoff modeling capabilities of hydrological models. However, research on the impact of mixed models on runoff simulation capability is limited. Therefore, this study uses the traditional hydrological model Simplified Daily Hydrological Model (SIMHYD) and the machine learning model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to construct two coupled models: a direct coupling model and a dynamically improved predictive validity hybrid model. These models were evaluated using the US CAMELS dataset to assess the impact of the two model combination methods on runoff modeling capabilities. The results indicate that the runoff modeling capabilities of both combination methods were improved compared to individual models, with the combined forecasting model for dynamic prediction effectiveness (DPE) demonstrating the optimal modeling capability. Compared with LSTM, the mixed model showed a median increase of 12.8% in Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of daily runoff during the validation period, and a 12.5% increase compared to SIMHYD. In addition, compared with the LSTM model, the median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of the hybrid model simulating high flow results increased by 23.6%, and compared with SIMHYD, it increased by 28.4%. At the same time, the stability of the hybrid model simulating low flow was significantly improved. In performance testing involving varying training period lengths, the DPE model trained for 12 years exhibited the best performance, showing a 3.5% and 1.5% increase in the median NSE compared to training periods of 6 years and 18 years, respectively.

AB  - The object of the present study was to investigate some hormonal responses to shearing stress. Thirty Ile De France ewes were selected from an experimental herd according to their hematocrit level and were allocated into 3 groups as follows: low hematocrit (LHct) group (hematocrit range 19.7-27.9%), high hematocrit (HHct) group (hematocrit range 32.0-36.9%) and mean hematocrit (MHct) group (hematocrit range 28.3-29.8%). The traits investigated were blood cortisol, thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), growth hormone and lactate. The experiment was conducted at the end of the first month after artificial insemination. Daily minimum and maximum ambient temperatures during the whole experimental period were 13.4 and 24.2 degrees C, respectively. Blood samples were taken by jugular venipuncture before shearing, immediately after shearing, at 3h and 24h after shearing.
   Shearing resulted in an increase in plasma cortisol in all ewes. The ewes with high baseline hematocrit level had lower percent of cortisol increase in response to shearing compared to MHct (P < 0.05) and LHct ewes (P > 0.05). Thyroxine level in LHct tended to be higher during the entire experimental period and was significantly higher compared to MHct ewes at 3 h following shearing (P < 0.05). Triiodothyronine in HHct ewes declined at 48 h after shearing (P < 0.05). There was a general trend of a slight decrease in T3 and T4 levels in all ewes at 3 h and 48 h after shearing. Blood lactate levels increased in HHct and MHct ewes at 48 h after shearing compared to the respective levels at 3 h after shearing. In conclusion, Adaptation to a lack of skin insulation at ambient temperature range 13.4 to 24.2 degrees C was associated with a slight decrease in basal metabolism accompanied by a slight increase in lactate level.

AB  - Tea plant is one of the most important commercial crops worldwide. The Didymellaceae fungi can cause leaf blight disease of tea plant. In this study, 240 isolates were isolated from tea plant leaves of 10 provinces in China. Combined with multi -locus (ITS, LSU, RPB2 and TUB2) phylogenetic analysis and morphological characteristics, these isolates were identified as 25 species of six genera in Didymellaceae, including 19 known spe- cies Didymella coffeae-arabicae, D. pomorum, D. segeticola, D. sinensis, Epicoccum catenisporum, E. dendrobii, E. draconis, E. italicum, E. latusicollum, E. mackenzie, E. oryzae, E. poaceicola, E. rosae, E. sorghinum, E. tobaicum, Neoascochyta mortariensis, Paraboeremia litseae, Remotididymella anemophila and Stagonosporopsis caricae, of which 15 species were new record species and six novel species, named D. yunnanensis, E. anhuiense, E. jingdongense, E. puerense, N. yunnanensis and N. zhejiangensis. Amongst all isolates, D. segeticola was the most dominant species. Pathogenicity tests on tea plant leaves showed that E. anhuiense had the strongest virulence, while E. puerense had the weakest virulence. Besides, D. pomorum, D. yunnanensis, E. dendrobii, E. italicum, E. jingdongense, E. mackenziei, E. oryzae, E. rosae, E. tobaicum, N. mortariensis, N. yunnanensis, N. zhejiangensis and R. anemophila were non-pathogenic to the tea plant.

AB  - Infections caused by mucorales, with an increasing incidence after candidiasis and aspergillosis, are characterized by the fast angioinvasion of blood vessels and invasion of neighboring organs or structures. Mucorales most commonly cause rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, digestive or disseminated infections, and their spread is favored by certain underlying diseases (diabetes, kidney failure) and risk factors (neutropenia, immunosuppression, iron overload). These infections have a high mortality rate, over 40% in many series, and the key to their cure depends on both an early diagnosis and an antifungal treatment, associated in most cases with extensive surgical debridement and other adjunctive therapies. Currently, there are international guidelines, not only local ones, for the management of mucormycosis, in which it is considered by consensus and with a strong recommendation that first-line treatment with high-dose liposomal amphotericin B is the best choice. The combined antifungal treatment of polyene agents with triazoles or candins remains in open debate. (C) 2021 Asociacion Espanola de Micologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB  - In this study, we determined partition (Ksc/m) and diffusion (Dsc) coefficients of five different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) migrating from squalane into and through the stratum corneum (s.c.) layer of the skin. Carcinogenic PAH have previously been detected in numerous polymer-based consumer products, especially those dyed with carbon black. Upon dermal contact with these products, PAH may penetrate into and through the viable layers of the skin by passing the s.c. and thus may become bioavailable. Squalane, a frequent ingredient in cosmetics, has also been used as a polymer surrogate matrix in previous studies. Ksc/m and Dsc are relevant parameters for risk assessment because they allow estimating the potential of a substance to become bioavailable upon dermal exposure. We developed an analytical method involving incubation of pigskin with naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene in Franz diffusion cell assays under quasi-infinite dose conditions. PAH were subsequently quantified within individual s.c. layers by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The resulting PAH depth profiles in the s.c. were fitted to a solution of Fick's second law of diffusion, yielding Ksc/m and Dsc. The decadic logarithm logKsc/m ranged from -0.43 to +0.69 and showed a trend to higher values for PAH with higher molecular masses. Dsc, on the other hand, was similar for the four higher molecular mass PAH but about 4.6-fold lower than for naphthalene. Moreover, our data suggests that the s.c./viable epidermis boundary layer represents the most relevant barrier for the skin penetration of higher molecular mass PAH. Finally, we empirically derived a mathematical description of the concentration depth profiles that better fits our data. We correlated the resulting parameters to substance specific constants such as the logarithmic octanol-water partition coefficient logP, Ksc/m and the removal rate at the s.c./viable epidermis boundary layer.

AB  - Simple Summary Escherichia coli (E. coli) F17 is one of the major pathogenic bacteria responsible for diarrhea in farm animals; however, little is known about the biological mechanism underlying E. coli F17 infection. The aim of our study was to reveal the interplay between intestinal genes, metabolites and bacteria in E. coli F17 infected sheep. Our results confirm that the intestinal differ significantly in sheep with different E. coli F17 susceptibility, and integrated omics analyses reveal subsets of potential biomarkers for E. coli F17 infection (i.e., GlcADG 18:0-18:2, ethylmalonic acid and FBLIM1). Our results can help in the development of new insight for the treatment of farm animals infected by E. coli F17. Escherichia coli (E. coli) F17 is one of the most common pathogens causing diarrhea in farm livestock. In the previous study, we accessed the transcriptomic and microbiomic profile of E. coli F17-antagonism (AN) and -sensitive (SE) lambs; however, the biological mechanism underlying E. coli F17 infection has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study first analyzed the metabolite data obtained with UHPLC-MS/MS. A total of 1957 metabolites were profiled in the present study, and 11 differential metabolites were identified between E. coli F17 AN and SE lambs (i.e., FAHFAs and propionylcarnitine). Functional enrichment analyses showed that most of the identified metabolites were related to the lipid metabolism. Then, we presented a machine-learning approach (Random Forest) to integrate the microbiome, metabolome and transcriptome data, which identified subsets of potential biomarkers for E. coli F17 infection (i.e., GlcADG 18:0-18:2, ethylmalonic acid and FBLIM1); furthermore, the PCCs were calculated and the interaction network was constructed to gain insight into the crosstalk between the genes, metabolites and bacteria in E. coli F17 AN/SE lambs. By combing classic statistical approaches and a machine-learning approach, our results revealed subsets of metabolites, genes and bacteria that could be potentially developed as candidate biomarkers for E. coli F17 infection in lambs.

AB  - The cadmium (Cd) hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii has been identified to have great ability to accumulate > 100 ppm (dry weight) of Cd in its aboveground biomass. However, little attention has been paid to the possibility that S. alfredii may benefit from this trait. Here, we investigated the effect of Cd accumulation on the performance of the black bean aphid Aphis fabae in S. alfredii. The results showed that 6 weeks of Cd exposure prevented S. alfredii from being infested by aphids. In another experiment, S. alfredii was pretreated with 100 mu mol.dm?(3) CdCl2 for 7 days. Prolonged Cd exposure significantly reduced the number of aphids in the Cd-pretreated S. alfredii after 7 days of aphid infestation. The Cd concentration in the phloem exudates of S. alfredii was also high. Micro X-ray fluorescence mapping of aphids collected from Cd-treated plants revealed high levels of Cd in the stylets. In summary, Cd protects S. alfredii from A. fabae through toxicity, but not deterrence, which may be related to the abundance of Cd in the phloem.

AB  - Giant pandas are mono-estrus seasonal breeders, with the breeding season typically occurring in the spring. Successful fertilization is followed by an embryonic diapause, of variable length, with birth in the late summer/autumn. There is a need for additional understanding of giant panda reproductive physiology, and the development of enhanced biomarkers for impending proestrus and peak fertility. We aimed to determine the utility of non-invasive androgen measurements in the detection of both proestrus and estrus. Urine from 20 cycles (-40 days to +10 days from peak estrus) from 5 female giant pandas was analyzed for estrogen, progestogens and androgens (via testosterone and DHEA assays), and hormone concentrations were corrected against urinary specific gravity. Across proestrus, estrogens increased while progestogens and androgens decreased - at the point of entry into proestrus, androgens (as detected by the testosterone assay) decreased prior to progestogens and gave 4 days advanced warning of proestrus. At the time of peak estrus, androgens (as detected by the DHEA assay) were significantly increased at the time of the decrease in estrogen metabolites from the peak, acting as an alternative confirmatory indicator of the fertile window. This novel finding allows for enlargement of the preparative window for captive breeding and facilitates panda management within breeding programmes. Androgens allow an enhanced monitoring of giant panda estrus, not only advancing the warning of impending proestrus, but also prospectively identifying peak fertility. Lay summary Giant pandas have one chance at pregnancy per year. The 2-day fertile window timing varies by year and panda. This is monitored by measuring the level of estrogens in the urine, which increase, indicating an upcoming fertile period. After 1-2 weeks of increase, estrogens peak and fall, marking the optimal fertile time. We tested other hormones to see if we can predict the fertile window in advance, and the specific fertile time with more accuracy. In 20 breeding seasons from 5 females, we found androgens, usually thought of as male hormones, had an important role. Testosterone gives 4 days advanced warning of estrogens increasing. DHEA identified peak estrogen and the fertile time before needing to see a confirmed decrease in estrogen itself. Therefore, androgens help improve monitoring of the giant panda breeding season, giving early warning of fertility, key in facilitating captive breeding and giant panda conservation.

AB  - Oxidative stress caused by hypoxia can lead to serious bodily damage and functional degradation. Our previous study in pigs showed that the insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF2R) gene might participate in the process of hypoxia adaptability. To investigate the function and mechanism of IGF2R in cellular hypoxia tolerance, we analyze the effect of IGF2R on cell survival capacity under hypoxia conditions in intestinal porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2) cells. The results show that under hypoxia condition (3% O2), cell viability is significantly reduced, the expression of IGF2R and cell apoptosis are significantly increased. Functional analysis suggests that suppressing IGF2R expression under hypoxia does not affect cell cycle and cell proliferation but increases cellular viability. Meanwhile, the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAX is reduced, the hypoxia-induced apoptosis is rescued, and cell survival is significantly improved. Transcriptome analysis suggests that global gene expression changes in knockdown IGF2R under hypoxia, IGF2R may regulate apoptosis through oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that suppressing IGF2R expression under hypoxia can rescue hypoxia-induced cell injury by reducing the expression of BAX, highlighting the potential ability of IGF2R regulation for the treatment of hypoxia stress.

AB  - The neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton underlies the polarization and proper functioning of neurons, amongst others by providing tracks for motor proteins that drive intracellular transport. Different subsets of neuronal microtubules, varying in composition, stability, and motor preference, are known to exist, but the high density of microtubules has so far precluded mapping their relative abundance and three-dimensional organization. Here, we use different super-resolution techniques (STED, Expansion Microscopy) to explore the nanoscale organization of the neuronal microtubule network in rat hippocampal neurons. This revealed that in dendrites acetylated microtubules are enriched in the core of the dendritic shaft, while tyrosinated microtubules are enriched near the plasma membrane, thus forming a shell around the acetylated microtubules. Moreover, using a novel analysis pipeline we quantified the absolute number of acetylated and tyrosinated microtubules within dendrites and found that they account for 65-75% and similar to 20-30% of all microtubules, respectively, leaving only few microtubules that do not fall in either category. Because these different microtubule subtypes facilitate different motor proteins, these novel insights help to understand the spatial regulation of intracellular transport.

AB  - Previous research studies confirmed that both resveratrol (RES) and beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyric acid (HMB) improved growth performance by altering intestinal microbiota. However, the mechanism underlying of RES and HMB on intestinal function remains unclear in ruminant. In this study, supplements of RES and HMB alone or in combination were evaluated as promoters of antioxidant capacity, immune response and barrier function, and modulators of the microbiota and metabolite profiles in the jejunum of Tibetan sheep. A total of 120 two-month-old Tibetan rams were randomly divided into four treatments (n = 30 per treatment), which were supplemented with a basal diet with 1.5 g RES/d (RES group), 1.25 g HMB/d (HMB group), 1.5 g RES/d plus 1.25 g HMB/d (RES-HMB group), and without additions (Control group). The results showed that RES and HMB improved the antioxidant capacity (CAT, GSH-Px, SOD, and T-AOC), immunity (IgA, IgG, and IgM), and digestive enzyme activity (alpha-amylase, lipase, and chymotrypsin) of the experimental lambs (p < 0.05). Additionally, jejunal morphology including villus width, villus height, and muscle layer thickness exhibited a significant difference when rams were fed diets supplemented with RES and HMB (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the determination of fermentation parameters showed that the butyrate concentration in the RES-HMB group was greater than those in the C and RES groups (p < 0.05). When compared to the C group, barrier-related gene expression (MUC-2, ZO-1, and IL-10) was significantly increased in the RES-HMB group (p < 0.05). Dietary RES and (or) HMB supplementation significantly increased the abundance of Methanobrevibacter, Actinobacteriota and Bacillus (p < 0.05). The abundance of differential bacteria was positively associated with butyrate concentration (p < 0.05). Metabolome analysis revealed that alpha ketoglutarate, succinic semialdehyde, and diacetyl as well as butanoate metabolism pathways connected to the improvements in butyrate concentration by RES and (or) HMB supplementation. Collectively, our results suggested that RES and (or) HMB supplementation improved butyrate concentration via regulating the microbial community (Methanobrevibacter, Actinobacteriota and Bacillus) and metabolism (alpha ketoglutarate, succinic semialdehyde, and diacetyl), thus contributing to jejunal morphology, antioxidant capacity, immune response, digestive enzyme activity, and barrier function.

AB  - Healing, reconstruction and recovery after skin injury have long been a major field of research, and many biomaterials have been designed for skin healing treatment. Because the skin repair process includes a series of complex processes such as hemostasis, inflammatory reactions and tissue remodeling, the microenvironment for bionic cell growth is particularly important. Herein, we used the self-organization effect of natural polymer materials to simulate the extracellular matrix, and prepared a structure-stable gelatin-polycaprplactone (Gt-PCL) through high-voltage electrospinning technology and a multiphase method. The composite material was capable of phase separation and showed a superior water retention rate and good fluid transmission effects in vivo and in vitro, which was used in repairing tests after full-thickness skin excision in rats. Gt-PCL materials showed not only good biocompatibility but also appropriate mechanical properties to effectively improve the epidermal healing rate and prevent wound expansion. RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis showed that the polycaprolactone biomimetic formed a stable multi-stage, micro-nano composite structure with various soluble amino acids or proteins through self-organization. This material was able to repair the skin by up-regulating tissue repair-related genes, initiating neural repair and hair regeneration pathways and down-regulating the immune response and stress response-related pathways, thus avoiding secondary injury and excessive wound repair. Moreover, Itgax, a key mRNA associated with wound healing, was identified and has been shown to affect the immune and barrier profiles of the skin. Together, these results demonstrate that Gt-PCL materials promote full-thickness skin regeneration, and may have good clinical effects and potential application value in the future.

AB  - Activating the natural immunity of plants against insect herbivores scores within the global targets of improving food security, while simultaneously reducing pesticide load in the environment. Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are non-toxic and biodegradable stimulants of plant growth that might also activate plant defenses against biotic stresses. We here explored if and how CNPs can stimulate sesame plant resistance against insect herbivores, and jointly improve seed nutritional quality. For this, we compared the effects of CNPs with the addition of bulk chitosan (CS) on sesame plant defenses against the highly voracious caterpillars of Spodoptera litura. We found that foliar application of 100 mg L-1 CNPs resulted in the highest resistance of sesame plants against S. litura and alleviated plant oxidative stress by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Mechanistically, CNP application increased plant resistance against S. litura by activating endogenous signaling cascades (Ca2+ influx and phytohormone accumulation) and enhancing defense metabolite (e.g., sesamolin, shanzhiside methyl ester) production via the up-regulation of defense metabolite biosynthesis genes. Finally, we found that CNP application improved the nutritional quality of sesame seeds under field conditions. Altogether, these results indicated that CNPs could act as an alternative and ecofriendly nanostimulant for inducing plant insect resistance and improving food nutritional quality in agroecosystems.
   Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) play an important elicitor role in activating chemical defense of sesame plants against Spodoptera litura and promoting seed nutritional metabolites.

AB  - The aim of the study was to extract and characterize collagen from solid untanned skin waste from the processing of leather in a Capra aegagrus tannery. Using pepsin (SPC), 37 g of collagen were obtained from 100 g of dry weight skin. Characterization took place using SDS-PAGE, FTIR and UV absorption techniques, identifying it as type I collagen. The ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum showed a peak at 238 nm. In the thermogram, the maximum transition temperature was 56 degrees C. Using the electrophoresis technique, it was observed that SPC consists of band patterns formed by a gamma chain, a beta chain and two distinct alpha chains (alpha 1 and alpha 2). In the FTIR analysis, the collagen showed the absorption peaks for the amides, showing that the SPC extraction process maintained the integrity of the molecule. To observe the effect of NaCl concentration on the solubility of SPC, the collagen showed high solubility, up to a concentration of 2% NaCl. The solubility peak was observed at pH 4.0, with a sharp drop until pH 7.0, reaching its minimum point at pH 10. Scanning microscopy showed some irregular surfaces, cavities and fibrous structures, which may favor the application of collagen as a biomaterial. The zeta potential found the isoelectric point of collagen at pH = 6.61. These results indicate that the collagen obtained has a high level of structural integrity and can be applied as an alternative source, as well as adding value to a waste product that is often discarded in the environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Atkinsoniella is a large genus of 98 species across the world and 88 species recorded in China within the globally distributed subfamily Cicadellinae, which is phytophagous, and some of which have been reported as important agricultural pests. Some Atkinsoniella species are very similar in morphological characteristics, making accurate identification at species level confusing. To provide further evidence toward understanding the relationships within the genus Atkinsoniella and subfamily Cicadellinae, mitogenomes of 12 Atkinsoniella sibling species were obtained and annotated. Their characteristics were comparatively analyzed. In addition, the comprehensive phylogenetic relationship within the subfamily Cicadellinae was determined based on three mitochondrial datasets using both the maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. The results suggested that the genus Atkinsoniella was recovered as a monophyletic group. The branches of the 12 newly sequenced species were clearly separated, with most nodes receiving strong support in all analyses, indicating that mitogenomics is an effective method for identifying closely related species and understanding their phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships. The herbivorous leafhopper genus Atkinsoniella Distant, 1908 (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellinae), a large genus of subfamily Cicadellinae, consists of 98 valid species worldwide and 88 species recorded in China. Some species of the genus are very similar in morphological characteristics, so they are difficult to identify accurately. In this study, 12 mitochondrial genomes of Atkinsoniella species with similar morphological characteristics were first obtained through high-throughput sequencing, which featured a typical circular molecule of 15,034-15,988 bp in length. The arrangement and orientation of 37 genes were identical to those of typical Cicadellidae mitogenomes. The phylogenetic relationship within the subfamily Cicadellinae was reconstructed using maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods based on three concatenated datasets. The topological structures of the six obtained phylogenetic trees were highly consistent. The results suggested that Atkinsoniella was recovered as a monophyletic group and emerged as a sister group with the monophyletic clade of Bothrogonia, Paracrocampsa (part), and Draeculacephala (part). The branches of the 12 newly sequenced species were clearly separated, with most nodes receiving strong support in all analyses. In addition, the key to the 12 Atkinsoniella species was provided to identify species according to morphological characteristics. This study further promotes research on the classification, genetics, evolution, and phylogeny of the genus Atkinsoniella and subfamily Cicadellinae.

AB  - The Early Pleistocene site of Muhkai 2 is located in Central Dagestan, northeastern Caucasus, Russia. The reversed magnetised (below the Olduvai event) brownish-grey petrified loams with a high number of fossil bones were formed during a fluctuating sedimentation regime. In total, 110 individuals of six species of carnivorous and eight species of herbivorous mammals have been identified at Muhkai 2. Here, we provide for the first time a detailed description of the lynx dentognathic remains from the site. Our preliminary morphological analysis suggests the inclusion of these specimens in the Lynx issiodorensis (Croizet & Jobert, 1828) species. The lynx fossils from Muhkai 2 can be considered the first well-documented and preserved example of this species in the northeastern Caucasus. The presence of L. issiodorensis in the site provides new information about the stratigraphic and geographic range of this taxon. Due to its large size, the Issoire lynx was one of the dominant species in the ecosystem and filled its own ecological niche as a specialised predator in the wooded areas and savanna of the Muhkai 2 paleo-landscape.

AB  - Simple Summary An inhibitor of the NF-kappa B (I kappa B) family is involved in regulating innate immune responses. In this study, early pregnancy induces upregulation of I kappa B alpha, but changes and downregulates the expression of BCL-3, I kappa B epsilon, IKK gamma and I kappa BNS, and changes expression of I kappa B beta and I kappa B zeta in the maternal liver, which are related to maternal peripheral tolerance and pregnancy establishment. During normal pregnancy, there is a dynamic regulation of the maternal immune system, including the liver, to accommodate the presence of the allogeneic foetus in the uterus. However, it was unclear that the expression of the IkappaB (I kappa B) family was regulated in the ovine maternal liver during early pregnancy. In this study, sheep livers were collected at day 16 of the oestrous cycle (NP16), and days 13, 16 and 25 of gestation (DP13, DP16 and DP25), and RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to analyse the expression of the I kappa B family, including B cell leukemia-3 (BCL-3), I kappa B alpha, I kappa B beta, I kappa B epsilon, IKK gamma, I kappa BNS and I kappa B zeta. The results revealed that expression of BCL-3, I kappa B beta, I kappa B epsilon and IKK gamma peaked at DP16, and the expression of I kappa B alpha was increased during early pregnancy. In addition, the expression of I kappa B zeta peaked at DP13 and DP16, and I kappa BNS peaked at DP13. I kappa B beta and IKK gamma proteins were located in the endothelial cells of the proper hepatic arteries and portal veins, and hepatocytes. In conclusion, early pregnancy changed the expression of the I kappa B family, suggesting that the modulation of the I kappa B family may be related to the regulation of maternal hepatic functions, which may be favourable for pregnancy establishment in sheep.

AB  - Myocardial injury leads to an irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes (CM). The implantation of human engineered heart tissue (EHT) has become a promising regenerative approach. Previous studies exhibited beneficial, dose -dependent effects of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived EHT patch transplantation in a guinea pig model in the subacute phase of myocardial injury. Yet, advanced heart failure often results from a chronic remodeling process. Therefore, from a clinical standpoint it is worthwhile to explore the ability to repair the chronically injured heart. In this study human EHT patches were generated from hiPSC-derived CMs (15 x 10(6) cells) and implanted epicardially four weeks after injury in a guinea pig cryo-injury model. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography after a follow-up period of four weeks. Hearts revealed large transmural myocardial injuries amounting to 27% of the left ventricle. EHT recipient hearts demonstrated compact muscle islands of human origin in the scar region, as indicated by a positive staining for human Ku80 and dystrophin, remuscularizing 5% of the scar area. Echocardiographic analysis demonstrated no significant functional differ-ence between animals that received EHT patches and animals in the cell-free control group (fractional area change 36% vs. 34%). Thus, EHT patches engrafted in the chronically injured heart but in contrast to the sub-acute model, grafts were smaller and EHT patch transplantation did not improve left ventricular function, highlighting the difficulties for a regenerative approach.

AB  - This study explores the food transport efficiency (E) in a termite tunnel consisting of a main tunnel and a 2-segment loop tunnel through a model simulation. Simulated termites navigate between the main and loop tunnels through branching nodes (a, b, c, d) with associated probabilities (P1, P2, P3, P4). The loop tunnel locations (delta) are considered: near the nest (delta = 1), at the center of the main tunnel (delta = 2), and close to the food site (delta = 3). The results reveal that for delta = 1, paths such as a -> d -> b -> c and c -> d -> b -> a exhibited high E values. Conversely, for delta = 2, P3 and P4 demonstrate elevated E values ranging from 0.4 to 0.6. For delta = 3, paths like c -> d or c -> b display high E values, emphasizing the significance of in-loop separation tunnels (characterized by P3 and P4) in alleviating traffic congestion. Partial rank correlation validates that P1 and P2 minimally influence E, while P3 and P4 significantly negatively impact E, regardless of delta. However, for delta = 2, the influence of P3 and P4 is notably reduced due to the positional symmetry of the loop tunnel. In the discussion, we address model limitations and propose strategies to overcome them. Additionally, we outline potential experimental validations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics governing termite food transport within tunnels.

AB  - The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex includes many phytopathogenic species, causing anthracnose disease on a wide range of host plants and appearing to be globally distributed. Seventy-one Colletotrichum isolates in the complex from different plants and geographic regions in Korea were preserved in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC). Most of them had been identified based on hosts and morphological features, this could lead to inaccurate species names. Therefore, the KACC isolates were re-identified using DNA sequence analyses of six loci, comprising internal transcribed spacer, gapdh, chs-1, his3, act, and tub2 in this study. Based on the combined phylogenetic analysis, KACC strains were assigned to 12 known species and three new species candidates. The detected species are C. siamense (n = 20), C. fructicola (n = 19), C. gloeosporioides (n = 9), C. aenigma (n = 5), C. camelliae (n = 3), C. temperatum (n = 3), C. musae (n = 2), C. theobromicola (n = 2), C. viniferum (n = 2), C. alatae (n = 1), C. jiangxiense (n = 1), and C. yulongense (n = 1). Of these, C. jiangxiense, C. temperatum, C. theobromicola and C. yulongense are unrecorded species in Korea. Host plant comparisons showed that 27 fungus -host associations are newly reported in the country. However, plant -fungus interactions need to be investigated by pathogenicity tests.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a popular and extensively consumed beverage in Malaysia along with many other countries around the world. Grey blight is one of the destructive fungal diseases infecting tea plants which resulted in major yield loss of tea production. Typical symptoms of tea grey blight were observed in Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia from July to December 2019 which involved the formation of tiny, circular to irregular brown spots that gradually enlarged, turned darker and eventually hampered plant growth. A total of 45 fungal isolates were isolated from grey leaf blight of tea and were identified as Neopestalotiopsis clavispora (24 isolates), and Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis (21 isolates). Morphological characterisation and multigene phylogenetic resolution using internal transcribed spacer (ITS), beta-tubulin (tub2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-alpha) were applied to identify the fungal isolates. Pathogenicity tests on leaves of C. sinensis showed that all fungal isolates of N. clavispora and Ps. camelliae-sinensis caused grey blight disease. The present study highlighted the occurrence of grey blight disease of tea in Malaysia caused by N. clavispora and Ps. camelliae-sinensis. The findings from the present study could be beneficial in proper disease monitoring, and effective management purposes of tea plants.

AB  - Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system and is involved in neuronal function, synaptic transmission, and a number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and autism. Recent work from this lab showed that mGlu5 is one of a growing number of G protein -coupled receptors that can signal from intracellular membranes where it drives unique signaling pathways, including upregulation of extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK1/2), ETS transcription factor Elk -1, and activity -regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). To determine the roles of cell surface mGlu5 as well as the intracellular receptor in a well-known mGlu5 synaptic plasticity model such as long-term depression, we used pharmacological isolation and genetic and physiological approaches to analyze spatially restricted pools of mGlu5 in striatal cultures and slice preparations. Here we show that both intracellular and cell surface receptors activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway, whereas only intracellular mGlu5 activates protein phosphatase 2 and leads to fragile X mental retardation protein degradation and de novo protein synthesis followed by a protein synthesis-dependent increase in Arc and post -synaptic density protein 95. However, both cell surface and intracellular mGlu5 activation lead to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor GluA2 internalization and chemically induced longterm depression albeit via different signaling mechanisms. These data underscore the importance of intracellular mGlu5 in the cascade of events associated with sustained synaptic transmission in the striatum.

AB  - Hippocampus erectus inhabiting the shallow coastal waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico are naturally exposed to marked temperature variations occurring in different temporal scales. Under such heterogeneous conditions, a series of physiological and biochemical adjustments take place to restore and maintain homeostasis. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of H. erectus to increased temperature using transcriptome analysis based on RNA-Seq technology. Data was obtained from seahorses after 0.5-h exposure to combinations of different target temperatures (26 degrees C: control, and increased to 30 and 33 degrees C) and rates of thermal increase (abrupt: < 5 min; gradual: 1-1.5 degrees C every 3 h). The transcriptome of seahorses was assembled de novo using Trinity software to obtain 29,211 genes and 30,479 transcripts comprising 27,520,965 assembled bases. Seahorse exposure to both 30 and 33 degrees C triggered characteristic processes of the cellular stress response, regardless of the rate of thermal change. The transcriptomic profiles of H. erectus suggest an arrest of muscle development processes, the activation of heat shock proteins, and a switch to anaerobic metabolism within the first 0.5 h of exposure to target temperatures to ensure energy supply. Interestingly, apoptotic processes involving caspase were activated principally in gradual treatments, suggesting that prolonged exposure to even sublethal temperatures results in the accumulation of deleterious effects that may eventually terminate in cellular death. Results herein validate 30 degrees C and 33 degrees C as potential upper limits of thermal tolerance for H. erectus at the southernmost boundary of its geographic distribution.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a trend towards hyperoestrogenic feeding methods in field conditions, particularly in dairy small ruminants. This study aimed to investigate the effect of alfalfa supplemented ration in the prepartum period on the occurrence of udder oedema in dairy ewes and its impact on fertility problems (dystocia, vaginal prolapse, uterine prolapse, retained placenta) and diseases (mastitis, udder dermatitis) occurring in the postpartum period. In addition, it aimed to follow up the data on maternal rejection behaviours and litter viability, which are believed to affect the future productivity and fertility of the herd. The ewes were divided into two groups: the oedema group (n = 20) and the control group (n = 23). For trial purposes in the oedema group, primiparous animals were provided with alfalfa supplementation. The control group consisted of ewes fed the same ration but without alfalfa supplementation. Ingredient analysis of the rations was performed in the groups. In biochemical analyses, the oedema group demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum urea (p < .05), Ca (p < .000) and Ca/P ratio (p < .01) compared to the control group. Clinical mastitis (0-7 days, p = .051) and (8-30 days, p = .149) were reported at a higher rate in the oedema group compared to the control group. Udder dermatitis cases were more common in the oedema group (p = .005). The mother's rejection of the lamb was higher in the oedema group. Dystocia was determined to be 30% in the oedema group (p = .023). In conclusion, applying hyperoestrogenic feeding strategies during the periparturient period firstly exacerbates physiological udder oedema in ewes, thus predisposing them to various herd fertility problems. This feeding strategy, frequently encountered in field conditions, seriously harms the physiological fertility process.

AB  - Penicillium brasilianum is an environmental filamentous fungus with useful applications in biotechnology. However, human infections caused by P. brasilianum are rare and not well understood. We present the case of a woman in her sixties with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus who was diagnosed with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (IFRS) and orbital apex syndrome. She underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. Notably, beta-tubulin gene sequencing identified the filamentous fungus as P. brasilianum, and long-term itraconazole administration suppressed IFRS flares. Our findings underscore the need for increased awareness and understanding of rare fungal pathogens in clinical practice.

AB  - Neoscytalidium dimidiatum is a rare dematiaceous fungus that was first described in 1916 as Dothiorella mangiferae. From the standpoint of epidemiology and therapy, early detection of fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS), the causative agents, and their associated risk factors can improve the therapeutic outcome and decrease the mortality rates among patients. In this study, we report a 34-year-old Iranian female patient with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), who presented to our facility with an 8-year history of chronic fungal sinusitis, drug-resistant asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, post-nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, nasal polyposis, and anemia. The patient was subjected to diagnostic nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan of paranasal sinuses, as well as routine, complementary mycological, and molecular methods, which confirmed the diagnosis of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis in patients with ABPA. Neoscytalidium dimidiatum was isolated from the sinus of the patient. Results of in vitro susceptibility tests indicated that the case isolate was susceptible to amphotericin B and itraconazole at concentrations which are commonly achieved in patients receiving recommended dosages for invasive mycoses (0.25 to 0.75 mg/kg of body weight daily for amphotericin B and 100 to 400 mg daily for itraconazole) and resistant in vitro to caspofungin, voriconazole, and posaconazole. The patient was successfully treated with amphotericin B / itraconazole + postoperative oral corticosteroids (OCS). Neoscytalidium dimidiatum infection should be considered as a possible additional factor in the etiology of AFRS, especially in immunocompromised patients. (c) 2021 SFMM.

AB  - In the Brassicaceae family, a glucosinolate-myrosinase-based system exists against herbivory Glucosinolate-Myrosinase system is differentially compartmentalized but substrate glucosinolate enter in contact with the enzyme myrosinase when plant tissues are attacked by insects. The glucosinolate breakdown into a variety of biologically active toxins further deterrenting the herbivory of different chewing and sucking insect pests. The myrosinase enzyme present is in myrosin cells were genetically removed from B. napus plant during the seed development. These genetically modified myrosin cells free plants are known as MINELESS plant. Genetically modified oilseed rape (Brassica napus) was produced by removing toxic mines. Here, we evaluauted the tritrophic interaction between Brassica napus wildtype and genetically modified and polyphagous pest Spodoptera. In force feeding experiment, larval growth of S. exigua was slow and gained less weight on MINELESS seedlings as compared to wild-type seedling. Additionally, highest amount of total glucosinolate was found in MINELESS control than that of wild type control. Myrosinase activity was not affected by the S. exigua feeding on the MINELESS plants. However, reduced activity of myrosinase was observed in the wild-type seedlings. Moreover, the S. exigua induced the concentration of tryptophan derived glucosinolate (indol-3-yl-methyl, 1-methoxy-indol-3-yl-methyl) that was found slightly higher in MINELESS seedlings than on wild-type seedling. Feeding of S. exigua deregulated the level of glucosinolate hydrolysis products in both types of plants. Transcriptional data after S. exigua feeding on wildtype and MINELESS showed differential response of methyl jasmonate and glucosinolate responsive genes were observed. We also observed that after methyl jasmonate treatment, methyl jasmonate and glucosinolate responsive genes were incease in the wild-type and MINELESS seedlings showing their negative effect on the growth of S. exigua. Overall, generalist insect results are interesting by considering the function of myrosin cells and binary defense system. Further, same experiment should be performed against generalist and specialist insect herbivores of above- and below-ground.

AB  - Leydig cells (LCs) play an indispensable role in testosterone synthesis, and their dysfunction can result in male reproductive disorders. Previous transcriptome sequencing revealed differential expression of MicroRNA-429 (miR-429) in both Leydig stem cells (SLCs) and LCs, indicating its potential regulatory function in LCs. In this study, we examined the expression of miR-429 in seven pig tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, testis, epididymis, brain) and investigated its impact on the proliferation and apoptosis of testicular interstitial cells using various techniques such as CCK-8, EdU, TUNEL, Western blot, among others. The results demonstrated that miR-429 exhibited lower expression levels in the testis, particularly in the LCs of testicular tissue. Upon upregulation of miR-429, TM3 cell density significantly increased, while downregulation led to a slight elevation in cell density. Further research indicated that the observed phenotype was due to miR-429-induced cell apoptosis, independent of cell proliferation. Additionally, a dual-luciferase reporter system revealed no targeting relationship between miR-429 and the predicted target genes (BMI1 and SOX5). Previous reports confirm Bcl2 as a known target of miR-429, leading us to hypothesize that miR-429 diminishes LCs' anti-apoptotic capability by inhibiting Bcl2. In summary, our findings suggest that miR-429 may induce LC apoptosis, supporting its potential as a biomarker for male reproductive disorders linked to Leydig cell dysfunction.

AB  - Antifungal prophylaxis with a mold-effective agent has led to a substantial decrease in invasive infectionscaused byAspergillusspp. in the management of patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing inductionchemotherapy. However, difficult-to-treat infections caused by other molds, such asFusarium, Lomentospora,and Scedosporiumspecies may still complicate the neutropenic period. Here, we present a case of a 23-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia who developed a breakthrough invasive fungal rhinosinusitiscaused byFusarium proliferatum/annulatumon posaconazole prophylaxis. The infection was diagnosed usingclinical, microbiological, and radiological criteria and the isolate was identified using Matrix Assisted LazerDesorption Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and sequencing. We searchedPubmed with"Fusarium proliferatum","Fusariuannulatum","immunosuppression AND fusariosis","rhino-sinusitis ANDFusarium proliferatum"and summarized the English literature for similar rhinosinusitis casesinfected with the same pathogen.

AB  - In the Amazon, mercury (Hg) contamination comes from ASGM operations along with soil remobilization processes associated with deforestation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (THg) in 88 samples of skin and blubber tissue obtained from live captured river dolphins (Inia boliviensis, Inia geoffrensis, and Inia spp.) in the Madeira River Basin. THg and MeHg measurements were performed by CV-AAS and GC-AFS, respectively. We also calculated the daily intake rate (DIR) of THg (wet weight) by Inia spp. THg levels in blubber tissue of adult river dolphins (Inia spp.) ranged from 0.015 to 3.804 mg kg(-1), while MeHg concentrations in blubber tissue varied from 0.04 to 2.65 mg kg(-1) and in skin tissue from 0.09 to 0.66 mg kg(-1). There were no significant differences in MeHg concentration in blubber (p = 0.616) and skin (p = 0.498) tissue samples between adult males and females in the different sampling locations. The adult animals showed differences in THg and MeHg concentrations significantly higher than in the calves. The estimate of the DIR of the genus Inia ranged from 1.17 to 12.35 mu g kg(-1) day(-1) (bw), from the consumption of fish species with herbivorous to piscivorous habits, respectively. More biological and ecological data, such as the precise determination of age, mediated length, weight, and diet of river dolphins, are necessary to verify the Hg biomagnification. However, our data indicate that bioaccumulation is an active process in the dolphins of the Madeira River Basin.

AB  - Ixodes scapularis is a primary vector of tick-borne pathogens in North America. Repeated exposure to these ticks can induce a humoral response to tick antigens and acquired tick resistance. However, identifying antigens contributing to this resistance is challenging because of the vast number of I. scapularis proteins secreted during feeding. To address this, we developed I. scapularis rapid extracellular antigen monitoring (IscREAM), a technique to detect antibody responses to more than 3000 tick antigens. We validated IscREAM with immunoglobulin G (IgG) from guinea pigs vaccinated with tick antigens, including a cement antigen cocktail that induced tick resistance. Furthermore, we explored the natural response to tick bites by profiling antigens recognized by IgG isolated from a tick-resistant individual, as well as from others with Lyme disease and tick-bitten guinea pigs and mice, to identify 199 recognized antigens. We observed that several antigens contained histamine-binding domains. This work enhances our understanding of the host immune response to I. scapularis and defines immunogen candidates for future antitick vaccines.

AB  - Neuropathy that develops due to diabetic complications causes cognitive impairment due to functional and structural damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biochemical, histological and physiological effects of Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) against brain tissue damage caused by diabetes. Fourty male Wistar albino rats were separated into four groups as control, diabetes mellitus (DM), ALA and DM+ALA. Single dose of 50 mg/kg intraperitonal streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce DM. For six weeks, ALA (100 mg/kg/day) was administered to the ALA and DM+ALA groups. At the end of the six week rats were sacrificed by collecting blood samples and collected brain tissues (hippocampus, cortex, hippotalamus and striatum) were histologically evaluated in addition to the oxidant-antioxidant parameters. ALA administration showed significant improvement in cognitive functions evaluated by MWM in rats with diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05). SOD, CAT, GSH-Px activities, which were decreased in the DM group compared to the control group, increased statistically significantly in rats in DM+ALA group (p < 0.05). While MDA and PC levels increased in the DM group, they decreased statistically significantly in the DM+ALA group (p < 0.05). According to the histological examinations made by light and electron microscopies, it was determined that the ultrastructural damage and degeneration findings observed in the sections of the DM group were significantly ameliorated in the sections of rats in the DM+ALA group. ALA may be effective in restoring cell damage and cognitive functions in brain tissue with its antioxidant and neuroprotective effects without showing antidiabetic effects.

AB  - Optoelectronic biointerfaces have gained significant interest for wireless and electrical control of neurons. Three-dimentional (3D) pseudocapacitive nanomaterials with large surface areas and interconnected porous structures have great potential for optoelectronic biointerfaces that can fulfill the requirement of high electrode-electrolyte capacitance to effectively transduce light into stimulating ionic currents. In this study, the integration of 3D manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoflowers into flexible optoelectronic biointerfaces for safe and efficient photostimulation of neurons is demonstrated. MnO2 nanoflowers are grown via chemical bath deposition on the return electrode, which has a MnO2 seed layer deposited via cyclic voltammetry. They facilitate a high interfacial capacitance (larger than 10 mF cm(-2)) and photogenerated charge density (over 20 & mu;C cm(-2)) under low light intensity (1 mW mm(-2)). MnO2 nanoflowers induce safe capacitive currents with reversible Faradaic reactions and do not cause any toxicity on hippocampal neurons in vitro, making them a promising material for biointerfacing with electrogenic cells. Patch-clamp electrophysiology is recorded in the whole-cell configuration of hippocampal neurons, and the optoelectronic biointerfaces trigger repetitive and rapid firing of action potentials in response to light pulse trains. This study points out the potential of electrochemically-deposited 3D pseudocapacitive nanomaterials as a robust building block for optoelectronic control of neurons.

AB  - This study aims to determine the hemostatic effectivity and biocompatibility of a novel absorbable bone wax in comparison with a commercially available product. Eighteen small fat-tail sheep were used to simulate clinical surface bleeding of sternal injury. Hemostasis effectiveness, the degree of bone healing, micro-computed tomography, and histopathology were evaluated over a period after the application of the material to the surgically created wound. The absorbable bone wax used in the study stopped bleeding immediately and did not affect bone healing. The histopathological results also showed that there were no complications associated with the new material. The results showed that the new absorbable bone wax used in this study was effective and biocompatible.
   Impact Statement Comparing a new biodegradable bone wax with a conventional bone wax, we validated its safety and effectiveness. The new material was found to be biocompatible and stopped bleeding successfully in large experimental animals.

AB  - UO 2 fuel fragmentation and pulverization during loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs) is an ongoing safety concern that has gained importance due to recent interest in increasing burnup limits for light water reactor fuel. In this work, we investigate the importance of bubble pressure on fragmentation using 2D phase field fracture simulations of UO 2 polycrystals. The model includes anisotropic single crystal elastic constants, encourages intergranular fracture, and includes bubble pressure and its impact on crack opening. An external stress is applied that is representative of the internal stresses observed in macroscale BISON simulations of LOCA tests. Cracks do not form under the external applied stress in UO 2 polycrystals without porosity. Crack nucleation and propagation do occur under the external applied stress in polycrystals with unpressurized 1 mu m radius intergranular voids, and crack propagation accelerates with increasing number of voids. Crack nucleation and propagation also occur in polycrystals without the external applied stress if the intergranular pores are pressurized, and crack propagation is faster with both pressurized pores and the external applied stress. Our 2D results indicate that bubble pressure may not be necessary to initiate fragmentation in polycrystals with intergranular porosity under LOCA conditions, though this should be verified using 3D simulations with fewer assumptions.

AB  - Valproate (VPA) as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor has shown neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. This study evaluated whether VPA treatment ameliorated the synaptic plasticity dysfunction, hippocampal neuronal loss, and spatial memory deficits induced by cerebral ischemia in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups control, sham, cerebral ischemia+vehicle (MCAO+V), and MCAO+VPA. The right common carotid artery was occluded for 1 hour. VPA (300 mg/kg) or vehicles were injected intraperitoneally on days 0,1,2 and 3 of the reperfusion. After 7 days of reperfusion the Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and open field tests were performed. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area was recorded by field potential recording. We used the term neuronal Input-Output (I/O) function and paired-pulse ratio (PPR) to refer to basal synaptic transmission and presynaptic neurotransmitter release probability respectively. After that, the brains were removed for assaying stereological parameters of the CA1 neurons. Our results showed the VPA administration significantly reduced the total infarct volume, improved MCAO-induced spatial learning-memory, fear memory, and anxiety compared to the MCAO+V group. In addition, the field potential recording showed that VPA significantly ameliorated the impaired the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by MCAO, without any effects on basal synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter release probability. Therefore, it seems that a decrease in total infarct volume and induction of long-term potentiation via postsynaptic mechanisms is responsible for improving MCAO-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - BackgroundCentral nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis is an uncommon but fatal disease, the diagnosis of which is still difficult. ObjectivesWe aim to explore the diagnositic performance of noncultural methods for CNS aspergillosis. MethodsIn this retrospective study, all pathologically confirmed rhinosinusitis patients in whom cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) galactomannan (GM) test and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) had been performed were included. We evaluated the diagnostic performances of CSF GM optical density indexes (ODI) at different cut-off values and compared performance with mNGS in patients with and without CNS aspergillosis, as well as in patients with different manifestations of CNS aspergillosis. ResultsOf the 21 proven and probable cases, one had positive culture result, five had positive mNGS results and 10 had a CSF GM ODI of >0.7. Sample concordance between mNGS and GM test was poor, but best diagnostic performance was achieved by combination of GM test (ODI of >0.7) and mNGS, which generated a sensitivity of 61.9% and specificity of 82.6%. Further investigation of combination diagnostic performances in different kind of CNS aspergillosis was also conducted. Lowest sensitivity (42.9%) was identified in abscess group, while increased sensitivity (60.0%) was achieved in abscess with encephalitis groups. Combination test exhibited the best performance for encephalitis patients who had only CSF abnormalities, in whom the sensitivity and specificity were 77.8% and 82.6%, respectively. ConclusionsIn conclusion, combination of these two tests might be useful for diagnosis of CNS aspergillosis associated with fungal rhinosinusitis, especially in encephalitis patients.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate the oviduct environment by studying oviduct gene expression after under-nutrition in day-5 pregnant ewes with different initial (i) BCS, and its association with the number of embryos recovered. Thirty-six ewes were divided into 2 groups with different iBCS: iBCS 2.75 (n = 19; high, H) and iBCS <2.25 (n = 17; low, L), and were randomly assigned to two nutritional treatments for 20 days: 1.5 (control, C) or 0.5 (underfed, U) times the daily maintenance requirements. Thus, the final four groups were: high-iBCS control (HC, n = 9), high-iBCS underfed (HU, n = 10), low-iBCS control (LC, n = 9) and low-iBCS underfed (LU, n = 8). Samples of oviduct were collected and the expression of target genes was quantified using real-time PCR. While high-iBCS control ewes presented more ADIPOR1 mRNA than the high-iBCS underfed group (P < 0.05) and low-iBCS control ewes (P = 0.01), high-iBCS underfed group presented higher ADIPOR2 gene expression than low-iBCS underfed ewes (P < 0.01) evidencing a differential oviductal gene expression for these receptors. In high-iBCS ewes, control animals presented higher IGFBP2 gene expression than underfed ewes (P < 0.05), associated these results with a poor oviductal environment. High-iBCS underfed ewes presented higher IGFBP4 gene expression than high-iBCS control ewes (P < 0.05). Stepwise regression models, using various combinations of data on metabolic and reproductive hormones, and oviduct gene expression as independent variables, identified a set of variables that accounted for 75% of the variation in the number of embryos recovered. In conclusion, the oviductal gene expression depends on body reserves and nutritional treatment, and the effect is gene-specific. ?? 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aimed to prepare a novel "self-regenerative" electrochemical biosensor by successively modifying gold nanoparticles, four-arm polyethylene glycol-NH2, and NH2-MIL-53 (Al) (MOF) on the glassy carbon electrode interface. A hairpin G-triplex-mediated DNA (G3 probe) as a part of the mycoplasma ovine pneumonia (MO) gene was loosely adsorbed to MOF. Based on the mechanism of hybridization induction, the G3 probe could effectively detach from the MOF only after introducing the target DNA. Subsequently, its guanine-rich nucleic acid se-quences were exposed to solution of methylene blue. As a result, the diffusion current of the sensor system showed a sharp decline. The developed biosensor showed excellent selectivity, and the concentration of target DNA exhibited a good correlation in the range 10-10 to 10-6 M with a detection limit of 1.00 pM (S/N = 3), even in 10% goat serum. Most interestingly, this biosensor interface automatically started the regeneration program. Moreover, regeneration could be effectively achieved at least seven times, and the recovery rate of the electrode interface and sensing efficiency was up to 90%. Additionally, this platform could be used for other clinical assays in various systems by simply changing the DNA sequence of the probe.

AB  - Agricultural plant species differ in susceptibility to herbivores; therefore, identifying natural resistances or tolerances to pests can be leveraged to develop preventative, integrated pest management approaches. While many Citrus species are grown in California, most pest management guidelines are based upon research conducted on navel oranges [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck; Sapindales: Rutaceae]. A recent study has established European earwigs (Forficula auricularia L.; Dermaptera: Forficulidae) as herbivores of young navel orange fruit, causing damage ranging from small bite marks to large chewed holes. It is unknown whether earwigs damage fruit of other citrus species. We conducted field experiments in which we caged earwigs to branch terminals bearing young fruit to explore potential differences in susceptibility of Citrus species to European earwigs. Specifically, we tested whether three species, navel oranges, clementines (C. clementina hort. ex Tanaka), and true mandarins (C. reticulata Blanco) exhibit differences in: 1) feeding deterrence to earwigs; 2) suitability as food for earwigs; 3) preferential abscission of damaged fruit; and 4) healing of damaged fruit. Earwigs caused heavy damage on navel orange and clementine fruit, whereas heavy damage was rare on true mandarin fruit. There was little evidence of preferential abscission of damaged fruit or healing of seriously damaged fruit. Consequently, several heavily damaged navel orange and one clementine fruit were retained to harvest and developed large scars. Overall, we found that Citrus fruit vary in their susceptibility to earwigs, and pest management strategies for earwigs should be refined to consider their varying effects on different Citrus species.

AB  - Animal models are widely used for biomedical studies and drug evaluation. The small intestine plays key roles in nutrient absorption, hormone secretion, microbiota defense and drug absorption and metabolism. Although the intestinal structure of mammals is conserved, the differences on epithelial cell composition, functional assignments and drug absorption among mammals are largely unknown. Here, cross-species analysis of single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the ileum epithelium from mouse, rat, pig, macaque and human reveals the conserved and differential cell types and functions among species, identifies a new CA7+ cell type in pig, macaque and human ileum, uncovers the distinct expression pattern in enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells and Paneth cells, and defines the conserved and species-specific intestinal stem cell signature genes. The examination of drug absorption across species suggests that drug metabolism in mouse ileum is closer to human while drug transport in macaque ileum is more similar to human. Together, our data provide the comprehensive information about cell composition and functional assignments in five species, and offer the valuable guidance for animal model selection and drug testing.

AB  - In taxonomic works, the weight to be given to morphological, mitochondrial, or nuclear signals, and the assessment of differences as species or subspecies distinctions has also varied considerably over the past decades and is largely a subjective research decision. This apparent example of the "grey zone of taxonomy" underpins the need of critical studies of as many specimens as possible and of using both mitochondrial and nuclear genes in taxonomic-systematic studies, as phylogeny based on uniparentally inherited genes alone may not represent true evolutionary scenarios. Myotis sicarius, a species occurring thorough the Himalayan foothills was found for the first time out of SouthAsia, in North Vietnam. Analysis of topotypical and Vietnamese specimens revealed high mitochondrial heterogeneity - at the upper limit of the usual threshold of intraspecific difference - but only minute nuclear sequence and negligible morphological differences. Albeit the large geographic distance between the two records might suggest the existence of two putative reproductively isolated taxonomic units, based on the incongruent results we concluded that the split of geographic populations of M. sicarius into different taxa is unsupported. As a morphologically closely resembling species, we also reviewed the taxonomic status of the two morphological forms of M. annectans and synonymizing M. primula with M. annectans was also corroborated by our phylogenetic analyses.

AB  - Depression is a severe mental illness affecting patient's physical and mental health. However, long-term effects of existing therapeutic modalities for depression are not satisfactory. Geniposide is an iridoid compound highly expressed in gardenia jasminoides for removing annoyance. The activity of geniposide against depression has been widely studied while most studies concentrated on the expression levels of gene and protein. Herein, the aim of the present study was to employ non-target metabolomic platform of serum to investigate metabolic changes of depression mice and further verify in hippocampus for analyzing the antidepressant mechanism of geniposide. Then we discovered that 9 metabolites of serum were significantly increased in depressive group (prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4, arachidonic acid, phosphatidylcholine (PC, 16:0/16:0), LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/ 0:0), phosphatidylethanolamine (14:0/16:0), creatine, oleamide and aminomalonic acid) and 6 metabolites were decreased (indoxylsulfuric acid, testosterone, lactic acid, glucose 6-phosphate, leucine and valine). The levels of arachidonic acid, LysoPC, lactic acid and glucose 6-phosphate in hippocampus were consistent change with serum in depression mice. Most of them showed significant tendencies to be normal by geniposide treatment. Metabolic pathway analysis indicated that arachidonic acid metabolism and glucose metabolism were the main pathogenesis for the antidepressant effect of geniposide. In addition, the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 were increased in depressive mice and reversed after geniposide treatment. This study revealed that abnormal metabolism of inflammatory response and glucose metabolism of the serum and hippocampus involved in the occurrence of depressive disorder and antidepressant effect of geniposide.

Alternaria and Curvularia are two genera of dematiaceous molds known to cause invasive fungal rhinosinusitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Co-infection with two dematiaceous fungi is rarely reported in the literature. This report describes a case of biopsy proven invasive fungal rhinosinusitis with Alternaria spp. and Curvularia spp. co-infection in a neutropenic host. The infection characteristics, microbiologic findings, and treatment are described. (c) 2024 SFMM. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Alpacas are important livestock animals in the Andean highlands of South America. However, their reproductive efficiency is low under natural conditions. In this study, we analysed the oestradiol-17 beta (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels in the serum and faecal samples of female alpacas before exposure to males for mating to determine whether E2 and P4 affect male acceptance and pregnancy in alpacas. In Experiment 1, faecal samples were collected from nine female alpacas prior to exposure to males for mating to evaluate the effects of premating faecal hormone levels on mating behaviour. In Experiment 2, four of nine female alpacas, which had not previously accepted mating, were injected intramuscularly with oestradiol benzoate (EB). Mating receptivity after EB administration, serum E2 levels before and after EB administration and pregnancy were then evaluated. In both experiments, P4 and E2 were measured in serum and faecal samples using ELISA kits after extraction with diethyl ether and methanol respectively. In Experiment 1, of 23 contacts with males in the mating test, females accepted males 12 times and rejected them 11 times. The proportion of females rejecting males increased as the premating faecal P4 level increased (p = 0.021) and the proportion of females accepting males increased as the faecal E2 level increased (p = 0.035). In Experiment 2, serum E2 levels were higher 2 h after injection than before EB injection (p < 0.05). Alpacas that refused to mate before injection accepted mating 2 h after EB treatment. All alpacas with faecal E2 levels more than 0.5 ng/mg of dry matter before mating had higher P4 levels a month after mating than those with low E2 levels (p < 0.05) and were pregnant. In conclusion, this study showed that measurement of faecal E2 levels can help in determining the appropriate breeding time and that EB treatment improves reproductive performance in alpacas.

AB  - The green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Elephantorrhiza elephantina (Burch) bulb extracts and evaluation of their antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and antioxidant properties were investigated. The crude plant extracts were prepared using distilled water, ethanol, and methanol for a comparison. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized via UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed using the UV-VIS spectra at 550 nm. The TEM confirmed the nanoparticle morphology as a mixed dispersed sphere, oval, and triangular shapes with a size range of 7.8 nm to 31.3 nm. The secondary metabolites were detected using TLC, DPPH, and LC-MS. Antimicrobial activity was assessed based on agar-well diffusion; cytotoxicity was examined through MTS assays. Various phytochemical constituents were detected through TLC and LC-MS. The crude extracts and methanol-extract-capped AgNP were able to scavenge free radicals, as shown by the developments of inhibitory bands on the TLC plate. The agar well diffusion test revealed that the AgNP capped methanol extract had potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug resistant bacteria in comparison with penicillin and neomycin, with inhibition zones ranging between 10 mm and 14 mm for the methanol-extract-capped AgNP. The in vitro MTS assay revealed that methanol crude extracts and methanol-extract-capped AgNP had a less cytotoxic effect on the HEK293 cells in comparison with untreated cells (control). We therefore conclude that methanol was the best reducing solvent with the best overall nanoparticle morphology and performance in antimicrobial and cytotoxicity, in comparison to ethanol and distilled water.

AB  - The hard tick Hyalomma dromedarii, a vector for numerous animal and human pathogens, was investigated for genetic diversity using the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (cox I) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes. Hyalomma dromedarii sequences (n = 11 cox I; n = 7 16S rRNA) were deposited in GenBank (LC761179-89, LC761173-78, LC654692), showing 99.52-100 % (cox I) and 98.15-100 % (16S rRNA) similarity to existing GenBank sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed monophyletic clades for H. dromedarii sequences from this study and GenBank. Haplotype network analysis identified 34 and 11 haplotypes for the cox Iand 16S rRNA genes, respectively, displaying stellate configurations. The overall cox I dataset showed very low nucleotide diversity (0.0019 f 0.0002) and high haplotype diversity (0.535 f 0.052). In contrast, the 16S rRNA gene dataset displayed low nucleotide (0.00211 f 0.00071) and haplotype (0.351 f 0.079) diversities. Neutrality tests showed significant negative values (Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D, and Fu and Li's F), indicating recent population expansion or selective sweep. Pairwise FST values (-0.00942 to 0.02007 for cox I;-0.04878 to 0 for 16S rRNA) suggested non-significant genetic differentiation between populations, supported by high gene flow (Nm) values. This study provided novel insights into H. dromedarii population genetics, revealing recent expansion, weak population differentiation, and high gene flow. These findings have implications for understanding the tick's evolutionary history and epidemiological significance.

AB  - Background The inner ear morphology and size are linked to hearing and balance ability. The goal of this study was to determine the morphology and morphometrics of the dromedary camel's inner ear and how it influences hearing accommodation and equilibrium in the desert environment. Materials and methods Gross morphology, computed tomography images, and the endocast were used to show the inner ear morphology. A caliper and ImageJ software were used to take measurements on a plastic endocast. Results The presence of the subarcuate fossa, flat cochlea, radii curvature of the semicircular canals, particularly the lateral semicircular canal, orthogonality, and the union between the semicircular canals, along with slightly increased saccule and utricle size, maintains camel balance on sandy ground, even during heavy sandstorms. The cochlear basilar membrane length and cochlea radii ratio aided low-frequency hearing and perception over a wide octave range. Conclusion The camel's cochlear characteristics revealed a lengthy basilar membrane, a high radii ratio, 3.0 cochlear canal turns, and a very broad cochlea. The orthogonality of the semicircular canals, the high curvature of the lateral semicircular canal, the presence of the subarcuate fossa, and the confluence between the lateral and posterior semicircular canal were particular specifications that allowed the inner ear of the camel to adapt to desert living.

AB  - Audiogenic seizures (AGS) (audiogenic kindling) in genetically selected audiogenic rodents are a reliable model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Temporal lobe epilepsy is accompanied with neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, but how the cells die is not fully understood. We analyzed the dynamics and mecha-nisms of cell loss in the hippocampus of audiogenic Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats during the develop-ment of TLE. Audiogenic kindling of different durations was carried out to reproduce TLE progression in KM rats. Behavioral analysis showed the development of post-tonic clonus, the main indicator of TLE, by the 14th AGS. The severity and duration of post-tonic clonus positively correlated with the increase in the number of AGS. Temporal lobe epilepsy development was accompanied with two peaks of cell loss. The first peak was detected after 7 AGS in the dentate gyrus (DG) granular layer and associated with activa-tion of p53-and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. After a 7-day rest period, activation of autophagy and restoration of cell number were revealed. The second peak occurred after 14 AGS, affected both gran-ular and hilar mossy cells and persisted further after 21 AGS, but no compensation was observed. Thus, activation of autophagy probably plays a neuroprotective role and supports survival of hippocampal cells at the beginning of epileptogenesis, but exacerbation of limbic seizures during TLE development causes irreversible neurodegeneration.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Tea plants are more sensitive to variations in calcium concentration compared to other plants, whereas a moderate aluminum concentration facilitates the growth and development of tea plants. Aluminum and calcium show a competitive interaction with respect to the uptake of elements, consequently exerting physiological effects on plants. To further explore these interactions, in this study, we used the solution culture method to treat tea plants with two calcium concentrations (0.8 mM and 5.6 mM) and three aluminum concentrations (0 mM, 0.4 mM, and 1 mM). We then determined the influence of the combined treatments on root growth and quality compound accumulation in the tissues by a combination of phenotype, gene expression, and metabolite analyses. Moderate aluminum supplementation (0.4 mM) alleviated the inhibition of root growth caused by high calcium stress. High calcium stress significantly inhibited the accumulation of most amino acids (e.g., Glutamic acid, Citulline, and Arginine) and organic acids (e.g., a-ketoglutaric acid) in the roots, stems, and leaves, whereas aluminum deficiency significantly increased most amino acids in the roots and leaves (except Serine, Alanine, and Phenylalanine in the roots and Ser in the leaves), with a more than two-fold increase in Arg and Lysine. High calcium stress also induced the accumulation of secondary metabolites such as epigallocatechin gallate and procyanidin in the roots, whereas aluminum supplementation significantly reduced the contents of flavonol glycosides such as quercetin, rutin, myricitrin, and kaempferitrin, as well as caffeine, regardless of calcium concentration. Aluminum supplementation reversed some of the changes in the contents of leaf metabolites induced by calcium stress (e.g., 4-dihydroquercetin, apigenin C-pentoside, phenethylamine, and caffeine). Overall, calcium stress caused severe growth inhibition and metabolic disorders in tea plants, which could be reversed by aluminum supplementation, particularly in maintaining the root tips and the accumulation of secondary metabolites. These results provide a theoretical basis for improving calcium-aluminum nutrient management to promote tea plant growth and quality.

AB  - Chitin, an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine polymer, has multiple functions in living organisms, including the induction of disease resistance and growth promotion in plants. In addition, chitin oligosaccharides (COs) are used as the backbone of the signaling molecule Nod factor secreted by soil bacteria rhizobia to establish a mutual symbiosis with leguminous plants. Nod factor perception triggers host plant responses for rhizobial symbiosis. In this study, the effects of chitins on rhizobial symbiosis were examined in the leguminous plants Lotus japonicus and soybean. Chitin nanofiber (CNF), retained with polymeric structures, and COs elicited calcium spiking in L. japonicus roots expressing a nuclear-localized cameleon reporter. Shoot growth and symbiotic nitrogen fixation were significantly increased by CNF but not COs in L. japonicus and soybean. However, treatments with chitin and cellulose nanofiber, structurally similar polymers to CNF, did not affect shoot growth and nitrogen fixation in L. japonicus. Transcriptome analysis also supported the specific effects of CNF on rhizobial symbiosis in L. japonicus. Although chitins comprise the same monosaccharides and nanofibers share similar physical properties, only CNF can promote rhizobial nitrogen fixation in leguminous plants. Taking the advantages on physical properties, CNF could be a promising material for improving legume yield by enhancing rhizobial symbiosis.

AB  - Porous tantalum (Ta) has exhibited exceptional biocompatibility and osseointegration capacity as an advanced orthopedic implant material. This study employs selective laser melting (SLM) to fabricate porous Ta scaffolds with controlled porosities (65 %, 75 %, 85 %, 90 %), systematically investigating their structure-property relationship for bone tissue engineering applications. Results demonstrate that SLM-fabricated porous Ta scaffolds possess biomechanical properties comparable to native bone tissue while maintaining superior fatigue resistance. In vitro assessments confirm the scaffolds' excellent cytocompatibility, with porosity levels significantly affecting MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast differentiation. Notably, scaffolds with 75 % porosity induced optimal osteogenic differentiation, as evidenced by enhanced mineralization markers. Porous Ta scaffolds with 75 % porosity were implanted in rabbit femoral condyles for bone defect repair. Quantitative analysis revealed progressive osseointegration, with bone ingrowth area ratios measuring 7.4 +/- 3.4 % at 4 weeks and 21.7 +/- 5.5 % at 12 weeks post-implantation. In parallel large-animal trials, 75 % porosity scaffolds were successfully deployed in goat femoral defects. After 12 weeks of implantation, VG staining confirmed distinct bone ingrowth within the scaffolds, while mechanical evaluation demonstrated sustained load-bearing capacity sufficient for femoral defect stabilization.

AB  - There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that dietary polysaccharides play a crucial role in preventing metabolic syndrome (MetS) through their interaction with gut microbes. Tea ( Camellia sinensis L.) . ) flower polysacchride (TFPS) is a novel functional compound known for its diverse beneficial effects in both vivo and vitro. . To further investigate the effects of TFPS on MetS and gut microbiota, and the possible association between gut microbiota and their activities, this study was carried out on mice that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and given oral TFPS at a dose of 400 and 800 mg/kg & sdot;body weight (BW)/d, respectively. TFPS treatment significantly mitigated HFD-induced MetS, evidenced by reductions in body weight, fat accumulation, plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-1 beta, along with an increase in plasma IL-10 levels. Furthermore, TFPS induced alterations in the diversity and composition of HFD-induced gut microbiota. Specifically, TFPS influenced the relative abundance of 11 genera, including Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, , which showed strong correlations with metabolic improvements and likely contributed to the amelioration of MetS. In conclusion, TFPS exhibits promising prebiotic properties in preventing MetS and regulating gut microbiota.

AB  - Plasmodiophora brassicae causes a serious threat to cruciferous plants including radish (Raphanus sativus L.). Knowledge on the pathogenic regularity and molecular mechanism of P. brassicae and radish is limited, especially on the metabolism level. In the present study, clubroot-susceptible and clubroot-resistant cultivars were inoculated with P. brassicae Race 4, root hairs initial infection of resting spores (10(7) CFU/mL) at 24 h post-inoculation and root galls symptom arising at cortex splitting stage were identified on both cultivars. Root samples of cortex splitting stage of two cultivars were collected and used for untargeted metabonomic analysis. We demonstrated changes in metabolite regulation and pathways during the cortex splitting stage of diseased roots between clubroot-susceptible and clubroot-resistant cultivars using untargeted metabonomic analysis. We identified a larger number of differentially regulated metabolites and heavier metabolite profile changes in the susceptible cultivar than in the resistant counterpart. The metabolites that were differentially regulated in both cultivars were mostly lipids and lipid-like molecules. Significantly regulated metabolites and pathways according to the P value and variable important in projection score were identified. Moreover, four compounds, including ethyl alpha-D-thioglucopyranoside, imipenem, ginsenoside Rg1, and 6-gingerol, were selected, and their anti-P. brassicae ability and effects on seedling growth were verified on the susceptible cultivar. Except for ethyl alpha-D-thioglucopyranoside, the remaining could inhibit clubroot development of varing degree. The use of 5 mg/L ginsenoside Rg1 + 5 mg/L 6-gingerol resulted in the lowest disease incidence and disease index among all treatments and enhanced seedling growth. The regulation of pathways or metabolites of carbapenem and ginsenoside was further explored. The results provide a preliminary understanding of the interaction between radish and P. brassicae at the metabolism level, as well as the development of measures for preventing clubroot.

AB  - Trypanosoma theileri, a non-pathogenic parasite of bovines, has a predicted surface protein architecture that likely aids survival in its mammalian host. Their surface proteins are encoded by genes which account for similar to 10% of their genome. A non-pathogenic parasite of sheep, Trypanosoma melophagium, is transmitted by the sheep ked and is closely related to T. theileri. To explore host and vector specificity between these species, we sequenced the T. melophagium genome and transcriptome and an annotated draft genome was assembled. T. melophagium was compared to 43 kinetoplastid genomes, including T. theileri. T. melophagium and T. theileri have an AT biased genome, the greatest bias of publicly available trypanosomatids. This trend may result from selection acting to decrease the genomic nucleotide cost. The T. melophagium genome is 6.3Mb smaller than T. theileri and large families of proteins, characteristic of the predicted surface of T theileri, were found to be absent or greatly reduced in T. melophagium. Instead, T. melophagium has modestly expanded protein families associated with the avoidance of complement-mediated lysis. We propose that the contrasting genomic features of these species is linked to their mode of transmission from their insect vector to their mammalian host.

TI  - Mechanistic Insights into PRRSV Inhibition through CD163-SRCR5 Blockade by PRRSV/CD163-IN-1
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA  - English
KW  - PIGS
AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes severe economic losses in the swine industry by targeting pulmonary alveolar macrophages via the CD163 receptor, particularly its SRCR5 domain. However, the molecular details of small-molecule inhibition at this interface remain unclear. Here, we provide the first mechanistic insights into how the PRRSV/CD163-IN-1 (B7) compound blocks CD163-SRCR5. Using structural refinement, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ensemble docking, and fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations, we identified a plausible B7/CD163-SRCR5 binding conformation. Due to the limitations of the crystal structure in representing conformational flexibility, we proposed an MD-refined model of CD163-SRCR5 to facilitate the efficient virtual screening of a small-molecule repurposing library. Baicalin emerged as a top candidate through the in silico analyses, consistent with previous experimental evidence. This result supports baicalin's antiviral activity, reinforcing its potential as a lead compound. This study provides a molecular basis for ligand recognition at CD163-SRCR5 and a framework for designing PRRSV entry inhibitors.

AB  - In the present study, the occurrence of MPs in herbivore, omnivore and carnivore fishes has been evaluated from beel, a freshwater wetland. A total of 90 fishes were collected and MPs detected in all the samples. Glossogobius giuris, a carnivorous fish had the highest number of MP mean abundance of 5.50 +/- 0.60 numbers per individual. Carnivorous fishes exhibited the highest number of average MP abundance compared to omnivorous and herbivorous fishes. Fibre-shaped MPs were most abundantly found. Smaller MPs in the size range of 100-500 mu m were dominant and transparent MPs followed by blue colored MPs were mostly found. The predominant polymer was polyethylene in the case of carnivores followed by omnivore while Nylon was mostly found in omnivores. A positive relationship was found between the trophic levels and MPs abundance which indicates that MPs may transfer along the food chain and accumulate in higher trophic levels.

AB  - Due to its unique flavor and high antioxidant content, the sea buckthorn (genus Hippophae L.) fruit is increasingly favored by consumers. Developing from the perianth tube, the sea buckthorn fruit varies greatly among species in both size and shape. However, the cellular regulation mechanism of sea buckthorn fruit morphogenesis remains unclear. This study presents the growth and development patterns, morphological changes, and cytological observations of the fruits of three Hippophae species (H. rhamnoides ssp. sinensis, H. neurocarpa, and H. goniocarpa). The fruits were monitored every 10-30 days after anthesis (DAA) for six periods in their natural population on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The results showed that the fruits of H. rhamnoides ssp. sinensis and H. goniocarpa grew in a sigmoid mode, while H. neurocarpa grew in an exponential mode under the complex regulation of cell division and cell expansion. In addition, cellular observations showed that the mesocarp cells of H. rhamnoides ssp. sinensis and H. goniocarpa were larger in the area with prolonged cell expansion activity, while H. neurocarpa had a higher cell division rate. Elongation and proliferation of the mesocarp cells were found to be essential factors affecting the formation of fruit morphology. Finally, we established a preliminary cellular scenario for fruit morphogenesis in the three species of sea buckthorn. Fruit development could be divided into a cell division phase and a cell expansion phase with an overlap between 10 and 30 DAA. In particular, the two phases in H. neurocarpa showed an additional overlap between 40 and 80 DAA. The description of the sea buckthorn fruit's transformation and its temporal order may provide a theoretical basis to explore the growth mechanism of fruits and regulate their size through certain cultivation techniques.

AB  - Simple Summary Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia and is associated with multiple alterations in biological processes. The most profound changes consist of the formation of two types of protein aggregations, called & beta;-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau proteins. Different biologically relevant metals are believed to play a role during the development of Alzheimer's disease, including copper. In Alzheimer's disease, copper has been reported to interact with & beta;-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, while in addition its homeostasis and metabolism are known to be affected. Therefore, Cu was investigated in a murine model mimicking Alzheimer's disease. These mice were genetically manipulated, resulting in the presence of typical Alzheimer's disease symptoms. By making use of two inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) based analysis techniques, the Cu concentration and the ratio between the natural Cu-65 and Cu-63 isotopes (Cu-65/Cu-63) were determined in blood plasma and four different brain regions-brain stem, cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus-of young and aged Alzheimer's mice and age-matched healthy controls. The Cu concentration in blood plasma was significantly altered in response to both age- and Alzheimer's-related effects, whereas the blood plasma Cu isotope ratio was affected in the Alzheimer's-affected mice only. Both the brain stem and cerebellum showed changes in Cu concentration and Cu-65/Cu-63 isotope ratio as a result of ageing and the development of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, a correlation was observed between the Cu-65/Cu-63 isotope ratio in the cerebellum and blood plasma. Determination of Cu concentration and isotope ratio is therefore a relevant tool to unravel the role of Cu in ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's' disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of & beta;-amyloid (A & beta;) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein in the brain. A & beta; plaques are formed by the cleavage of the & beta;-amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to protein aggregations, the metabolism of the essential mineral element Cu is also altered during the pathogenesis of AD. The concentration and the natural isotopic composition of Cu were investigated in blood plasma and multiple brain regions (brain stem, cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus) of young (3-4 weeks) and aged (27-30 weeks) APP(NL-G-F) knock-in mice and wild-type controls to assess potential alterations associated with ageing and AD. Tandem inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) was used for elemental analysis and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) for high-precision isotopic analysis. The blood plasma Cu concentration was significantly altered in response to both age- and AD-related effects, whereas the blood plasma Cu isotope ratio was only affected by the development of AD. Changes in the Cu isotopic signature of the cerebellum were significantly correlated with the changes observed in blood plasma. The brain stem showed a significant increase in Cu concentration for both young and aged AD transgenic mice compared with healthy controls, whereas the Cu isotopic signature became lighter as a result of age-related changes. In this work, ICP-MS/MS and MC-ICP-MS provided relevant and complementary information on the potential role of Cu in ageing and AD.

AB  - Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibition with malonate during reperfusion reduced myocardial infarction in animals, whereas its endogenous substrate, succinate, is detected in plasma from STEMI patients. We investigated whether protection by SDH inhibition is additive to that of remote ischemic perconditioning (RIC) in pigs submitted to transient coronary artery occlusion, and whether protective maneuvers influence plasma levels of citric acid cycle metabolites. Forty pigs were submitted to 40 min coronary occlusion and reperfusion, and allocated to four groups (controls, sodium malonate 10 mmol/L, RIC, and malonate + RIC). Plasma was obtained from femoral and great cardiac veins and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Malonate, RIC, and malonate + RIC reduced infarct size (24.67 +/- 5.98, 25.29 +/- 3.92 and 29.83 +/- 4.62% vs. 46.47 +/- 4.49% in controls, p < 0.05), but no additive effects were detected. Enhanced concentrations of succinate, fumarate, malate and citrate were observed in controls during initial reperfusion in the great cardiac vein, and most were reduced by cardioprotective maneuvers. Concentrations of succinate, fumarate, and malate significantly correlated with infarct size. In conclusion, despite the combination of SDH inhibition during reperfusion and RIC did not result in additive protection, plasma concentrations of selected citric acid cycle metabolites are attenuated by protective maneuvers, correlate with irreversible injury, and might become a prognosis tool in STEMI patients.

AB  - Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi (E-Pae) causes bleeding canker disease in the woody tissue of European horse chestnut (HC). Comparative genomic analysis of E-Pae with a related leaf-infecting strain (I-Pae) and other P. syringae strains identified candidate virulence genes for colonisation of woody tissue, including a sucrose uptake and utilisation system (scrYABCDBR cluster) found in 162 of 206 P. syringae strains spanning the pangenome. Growth analysis using sucrose as sole carbon source showed that I-Pae (lacking the gene cluster) was unable to grow whereas E-Pae could grow. P. savastanoi pv. phaseolicola 1448A and P. syringae pv. morsprunorum R15244 were compromised in growth despite the presence of the gene cluster. Sucrose utilisation assays using scrB and scrY mutants and complemented strains confirmed the importance of the cluster for sucrose metabolism in vitro. Pathogenicity assays in HC revealed the sucrose gene cluster is important for symptom development in the woody tissue. While the scr genes contribute to disease causation, they were not essential for pathogen fitness when compared to hrpL and hopAB1 mutants. E-Pae caused disease symptoms in HC leaves, suggesting the strain has the potential to infect leaves as well. However, it was notable that the scrB mutant of E-Pae caused increased disease symptoms, possibly highlighting a niche adaptation strategy for I-Pae to cause leaf spots in HC as well as constraining E-Pae to predominantly infect the woody tissue.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels are characterized by their extraordinary stretchability, flexibility, and biocompatibility, making them ideal materials for flexible wearable sensors. However, they often encounter challenges such as freezing and water loss, which can adversely affect their conductivity and stretching performance. In this study, we introduce a conductive hydrogel incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), acrylic acid (AA), acrylamide (AM), and lithium chloride (LiCl), which exhibits low-temperature tolerance, resistance to drying, self-adhesion, and mechanical robustness. The hydrogel's excellent mechanical properties, including an elongation at break of 1120% and a toughness of 2.9 MJ m(-3), are attributed to the formation of a tight polymer network between P(AA-AM) and PEG through hydrogen bonding. The multiple hydrogen bonding system between PEG and the polymer networks, combined with the hydration of LiCl and electrostatic interactions between the carboxyl group and Li+, significantly enhances the hydrogel's freezing resistance (down to -60 degrees C), water retention (with only 20% water loss after 15 days), and self-adhesion (with an adhesion strength to pig skin of up to 55.08 kPa). When employed as a flexible sensor, the P(AA-AM)/PEG/LiCl hydrogel exhibited excellent sensing properties for monitoring various human motions, with an impressive gauge factor of 1.91 and electrical conductivity of 4.50 S m(-1) Moreover, it maintained a high electrical conductivity (3.82 S m(-1)) even at -20 degrees C. The conductive hydrogel consistently produced stable and reliable electrical signals in response to external mechanical stimuli, making it a preferred material for human motion monitoring.

AB  - Background: The therapeutic effects of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSCs) may be mainly mediated by their paracrine effects. The ADSC-secretome can ameliorate hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We explored the therapeutic effect of the ADSC-secretome from the perspective of excessive hepatocyte autophagy induced by hepatic IRI.
   Methods: We established a miniature pig model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and hepatectomy using a laparoscopic technique and transplanted ADSCs and the ADSC-secretome into the liver parenchyma immediately after surgery. Liver injury and hepatocyte autophagy were evaluated by histopathological examination and assessment of relevant cytokines and other factors.
   Results: The results showed that the ADSC-secretome alleviated the pathological changes of liver tissue and the microstructural damage of hepatocytes after IRI. Moreover, the expression levels of autophagy-related markers including Beclin-1, ATG5, ATG12, and LC3II/LC3I decreased, whereas those of p62 increased during phagophore expansion. Furthermore, the expression levels of markers related to the autophagy inhibition pathway phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR), including P13K, Akt, and mTOR, increased.
   Conclusion: The ADSC-secretome attenuates hepatic I/R and hepatectomy-induced liver damage by inhibiting autophagy, which is possibly mediated by activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, there was no significant difference between ADSCs and the ADSC-secretome in the regulation of hepatocyte autophagy. Therefore, ADSCs may improve the excessive autophagy-induced injury of hepatocytes in hepatic I/R and hepatectomy through paracrine effect. Our findings provide new insight into the therapeutic potential of cell-free products, which could replace cell therapy in liver diseases.

AB  - The combination of C-13-isotopic labeling and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) offers an approach to analyze metabolic flux in situ. However, combining isotopic labeling and MSI presents technical challenges ranging from sample preparation, label incorporation, data collection, and analysis. Isotopic labeling and MSI individually create large, complex data sets, and this is compounded when both methods are combined. Therefore, analyzing isotopically labeled MSI data requires streamlined procedures to support biologically meaningful interpretations. Using currently available software and techniques, here we describe a workflow to analyze C-13-labeled isotopologues of the membrane lipid and storage oil lipid intermediate-phosphatidylcholine (PC). Our results with embryos of the oilseed crops, Camelina sativa and Thlaspi arvense (pennycress), demonstrated greater C-13-isotopic labeling in the cotyledons of developing embryos compared with the embryonic axis. Greater isotopic enrichment in PC molecular species with more saturated and longer chain fatty acids suggest different flux patterns related to fatty acid desaturation and elongation pathways. The ability to evaluate MSI data of isotopically labeled plant embryos will facilitate the potential to investigate spatial aspects of metabolic flux in situ.

AB  - Simple Summary The reproductive efficiency of ewes in their first breeding season (maiden ewes) can be inconsistent and disappointing. The frequency of abortion and its relative contribution to lamb losses in maiden ewe flocks in Australia has not been well studied. This study measured abortion and lamb mortality occurring between pregnancy diagnosis (scanning) and lamb marking in 30 flocks of maiden ewes on Australian sheep farms. The study included flocks of ewe lambs that had lambed for the first time at approximately one-year-old (n = 19) and two-tooth ewes that had lambed for the first time at two-years-old (n = 11). Abortion was detected in 14/19 flocks of ewe lambs and 6/11 flocks of two-tooth ewes using repeated scans. On average 5.7% of ewe lambs and 0.9% of two-tooth ewes aborted; however, abortion rates between flocks ranged from 0-50% for ewe lambs and 0-4.4% for two-tooth ewes. Lamb mortality from birth to marking represented the greatest contributor to overall lamb mortality occurring after pregnancy scanning but abortions were an important contributor to the overall losses in some ewe lamb flocks. This study highlights the variability in reproductive performance for maiden ewes and indicates that addressing losses due to abortion may improve reproductive performance in some ewe lamb flocks. The contribution of abortions to the overall mortality of lambs born to maiden (primiparous) ewes in Australia remains unclear. This cohort study aimed to quantify abortion and lamb mortality for ewe lambs and maiden Merino two-tooth ewes. Lamb mortality from pregnancy scanning to marking were determined for 19 ewe lamb and 11 Merino two-tooth ewe flocks across southern Australia. Average lamb mortality from scanning to marking was 35.8% (range 14.3-71.1%) for the ewe lambs and 29.4% (range 19.7-52.7%) for the two-tooth ewes. Mid-pregnancy abortion was detected in 5.7% of ewes (range 0-50%) in the ewe lamb flocks and 0.9% of ewes (range 0-4.4%) in the two-tooth ewe flocks. Mid-pregnancy abortion affecting >= 2% of ewes was observed in 6/19 ewe lamb flocks and 2/11 two-tooth ewe flocks. Lamb mortality from birth to marking represented the greatest contributor to foetal and lamb mortality after scanning, but mid-pregnancy abortion was an important contributor to lamb mortality in some ewe lamb flocks. Variability between the flocks indicates scope to improve the overall reproductive performance for maiden ewes by reducing foetal and lamb losses. Addressing mid-pregnancy abortion may improve the reproductive performance in some flocks.

AB  - Accurate estimates of demographic parameters are instrumental in effective management of animal populations. For species with individually distinctive features, photo-identification (photo-ID) provides a reliable means to gather capture-recapture data for population parameter estimation with considerable precision and accuracy. We use a 3-year photo-ID mark-recapture dataset of African savannah elephants (Loxodontaafricana) in Pilanesberg National Park (PNP), South Africa, to model their population size and estimate survival rates. All photographed elephants, irrespective of age, were individually identified based on their unique pattern of facial wrinkles. The population currently numbers 385 elephants (95% CI = 380-401), of which nearly half are grown individuals in a sex ratio of 1 male: 1.23 female. Considerable heterogeneity in capture and recapture probabilities, both within and between sex-age classes suggests some form of individual-specific or herd-specific variability, perhaps behavioural or spatio-behavioural dissimilarity within the PNP population. Estimated annual survival rates are high (0.967-0.996) and do not differ between sex-age classes, a likely expression of an extended parental care, low predation pressure, access to rich food and water resources, and absence of targeted killing/poaching. The lack of detectable difference between sexes in adult survival/mortality sets PNP elephants apart from other known African elephant populations and warrants further research attention. Given previous estimates (aerial counts in the early 2000s), the PNP elephant population has grown similar to 5.7% per annum over a 16-year period. This is similar to what is reported in other conservation areas in South Africa, but considerably lower than previously projected. Natural mortality, even if low as 0.4-3.3%, is not negligible and plays a role in moderating population growth. This realisation must be recognised when considering population management measures. It is, therefore, important to obtain and apply the most up-to-date population-specific demographic parameters when making management decisions. Periodic photo-ID surveys with mark-recapture analyses can generate such demographic indicators with a considerable accuracy and should be adopted as a useful tool to inform management decisions, complimentary to direct aerial counts, especially in small-to-medium size fenced conservation areas.

AB  - Tea plant leaves exhibit fluorine-accumulating properties, and the excessive intake of fluoride (F) via tea consumption may pose health risks to consumers; however, despite the high-F content in tea plant, signs of F toxicity are absent, suggesting the presence of F tolerance mechanisms within tea plant. This study investigated F accumulation in the cell walls and structural composition of cell walls in leaves of two tea plant varieties from tea gardens: Camellia sinensis cv. Nongkangzao, a high-F cultivar, and C. sinensis cv. Pingyang Tezao, a low-F cultivar. The results indicate that cell walls are the primary site of F accumulation in tea leaves, accounting for greater than 80.8% of total F, primarily in a water-soluble form. Furthermore, the F in tea leaf cell walls is predominantly located within pectin polysaccharides. In the leaves of Nongkangzao and Pingyang Tezao, the F in pectin accounted for 83.2% and 89.6% of cell wall F, respectively. The fluoride in the cell wall components shows a significant correlation with the metal elements Al, Ca, Mn, and K. The cell wall modifications show that fluoride is closely associated with the amino and carboxyl groups in pectin. Thus, this study aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of the role of tea plant leaf cell walls in F accumulation. In summary, we hypothesize that F in tea plant may directly bind to the amino and carboxyl groups in pectin, or it may bind together with metal elements at these sites in pectin, thereby being fixed within the cell wall. This prevents fluoride from further entering the cell interior and mitigates its damaging effects on intracellular structures. This may be a key mechanism underlying the F tolerance in tea plants.

AB  - Secoiridoid glucosides (SGs) are monoterpenoids derived from the iridoid cyclopentane-C-pyran skeleton with beta-D glucose linked at C1 position. Coordinated metabolic processes, such as biosynthesis and catabolism of SGs, ensure constitutive presence of these bitter tasting compounds in plant tissues, which plays a decisive role in the defense against pathogens and herbivores. These compounds are susceptible to hydrolysis mediated by enzymes beta-glucosidases, and the resulting aglycones are subsequently directed toward different metabolic pathways in plants. Function of two beta-D-glucosidases (named CeBGlu1 and CeBGlu2) from centaury (Centaurium erythraea Rafn; fam. Gentianaceae), belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 1 (GH1) family, was confirmed using in vitro assays with recombinant proteins, following their heterologous expression in E. coli and His-tag affinity purification. Although they show slightly differential substrate preference, both isoforms display high specificity toward SGs and the organ-specific distribution of transcripts was positively correlated with the content of SGs in diploid and tetraploid C. erythraea plants. Transient overexpression of CeBGlu1 and CeBGlu2 in C. erythraea leaves induced changes in metabolite profiles. The effectiveness of transgene overexpression has been altered by plant ploidy. UHPLC/DAD/(+/-)HESI - MS2 profiling of leaves of diploid and tetraploid C. erythraea genotypes revealed that the amounts of major SGs; sweroside, swertiamarin, and gentiopicrin was decreased in agroinfiltrated leaves, especially when CeBGlu1 and CeBGlu2 were co-expressed with transgene silencing suppressor p19. The work demonstrates that in planta metabolic engineering adopting transient overexpression of CeBGlu1 and CeBGlu2 is a suitable tool for the modulation of SGs content and glucosides/aglycones ratio, which might have substantial effects on overall phytochemistry of C. erythraea.

AB  - Earlier, after our bioinformatic analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TATA-binding protein-binding sites within gene promoters on the human Y chromosome, we suggested that human reproductive potential diminishes during self-domestication. Here, we implemented bioinformatics models of human diseases using animal in vivo genome-wide RNA-Seq data to compare the effect of co-directed changes in the expression of orthologous genes on human reproductive potential and during the divergence of domestic and wild animals from their nearest common ancestor (NCA). For example, serotonin receptor 3A (HTR3A) deficiency contributes to sudden death in pregnancy, consistently with Htr3a underexpression in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) during their divergence from their NCA with cavy (C. aperea). Overall, 25 and three differentially expressed genes (hereinafter, DEGs) in domestic animals versus 11 and 17 DEGs in wild animals show the direction consistent with human orthologous gene-markers of reduced and increased reproductive potential. This indicates a reliable association between DEGs in domestic animals and human orthologous genes reducing reproductive potential (Pearson's chi(2) test p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test p < 0.05, binomial distribution p < 0.0001), whereas DEGs in wild animals uniformly match human orthologous genes decreasing and increasing human reproductive potential (p > 0.1; binomial distribution), thus enforcing the norm (wild type).

AB  - Two tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated nuclear fuel particles were examined by electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) as part of the Advanced Gas Reactor program. The compacts' average irradiation temper-atures ranged from approximately 1260 to 1290 degrees C. One particle was examined in the as-irradiated con-dition, while the other was subject to 1600 degrees C post-irradiation safety testing. This study was undertaken to test a newly-developed EPMA technique to determine fission product masses in TRISO particles on a layer-by-layer basis, and to compare fission product distributions between an as-irradiated and safety -tested particle. Fission product concentration profiles were collected along two radii in each particle, with measured concentrations used to compute the fission product mass in each TRISO particle layer. These measured masses were then compared to those predicted from ORIGEN modeling calculations. Data col-lected from these measurements show that for these two particles, masses determined via EPMA were within +/- 20% of the calculated masses for the rare-earth elements, Mo, Zr, Cs, I, and Pd. Elements that tend to be less homogeneously distributed include Sr, Te, Eu, Ag, and possibly Ba. Measured Ag masses differed by more than 40% from the calculated mass. Lanthanides other than Eu remain primarily within the fuel kernel in the as-irradiated particle but in the safety-tested particle these element masses were divided approximately equally between the kernel and kernel periphery. In both particles, the majority of Sr and Eu accumulated in the carbon-rich kernel periphery, although in the safety-tested particle, Sr and Eu accumulated farther from the fuel kernel than occurred with irradiation alone. A greater mass fraction of mobile elements, such as Cs and I accumulated in the buffer and IPyC in the safety-tested particle as compared to the as-irradiated particle. When fully developed and tested, this mass balance approach to TRISO particle analysis has the potential to provide insight into fuel behavior.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The consumption of bottled mineral water has been rising in the last decades. During the water bottling process, the risk of bacterial contamination with pathogen bacteria is a well-known problem. In this study, the influence of different carbon dioxide concentrations, in mineral water bottles, on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis was investigated. Inside an Austrian mineral water bottling factory, a sum of 160 glass bottles with different carbon dioxide concentrations (3.0 g/L, 5.5 g/L, and 7.0 g/L) were capped after artificial contamination, stored at room temperature (20 degrees C), kept away from light, and dried in the laboratory. Water samples from freshly opened bottles were filtrated and cultivated on agar media to determine the number of colony-forming units over a period of 30 days. After the 23rd day, no more cultivable bacteria were detected in the samples from the freshly opened bottles. This observation leads to the conclusion that carbonated mineral water is an inappropriate habitat for Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. During the process of mineral water production, many possible contamination settings can influence the quality of bottled water. Microbial contamination can originate from different sources, for example, the ambient air, the bottles, the caps, and from the bottling machine itself. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of three different carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations (3.0 g/L, 5.5 g/L, and 7.0 g/L; 20 bottles each) in bottled mineral water on the bacterial growth of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (Ent. faecalis). The examined mineral water was artificially contaminated before capping the bottles inside the factory. After a specific number of days, water samples were taken from freshly opened bottles and after filtration (100 mL), filters were placed on Columbia Agar with 5% Sheep blood to cultivate S. aureus and Slanetz and Bartley Agar to cultivate Ent. faecalis. The respective colony-forming units (CFU) were counted after incubation times ranging from 24 to 120 h. Colony-forming units of S. aureus were not detectable after the 16th and 27th day, whereas Ent. faecalis was not cultivable after the 5th and 13th day when stored inside the bottles. The investigation of the bottles that were stored open for a certain amount of time with CO2 bubbling out showed only single colonies for S. aureus after the 5th day and no CFUs for Ent. faecalis after the 17th day. A reduction in the two investigated bacterial strains during storage in carbonated mineral water bottles means that a proper standardized disinfection and cleaning procedure, according to valid hygiene standards of industrial bottling machines, cannot be replaced by carbonation.

AB  - Mixed farming systems are gaining interest both as a risk management strategy and to apply agroecological principles. This study set out to assess the sustainability of mixed systems compared to their specialized counterparts. The Orfee bioeconomic farm model was used to simulate three mixed farms: beef and dairy, beef and sheep, and cash crop and beef, under 1990-2017 prices and policies in France. Several sustainability criteria were computed at two scales (i) aggregated farm level, to assess whether mixed farms with several integrated enterprises performed better than if these enterprises were managed in specialized farms, and (ii) unit of product or labour to assess whether a product was produced more sustainably and a worker obtained higher and more stable income in a mixed farm. We found that mixed farms had less work peaks, lower global warming potentials and nitrogen balances, lower total production costs, higher and more stable net incomes than if their enterprises were managed in two specialized farms. However, profitability and income variability of the mixed farms were not better than the best performing specialized farm. The consumption of concentrate feed decreased in the mixed livestock farms but increased in the beef-crop farm that degraded feed-food competition.

AB  - Wear protection materials, especially those for high-temperature service, often contain substantial amounts of chromium, cobalt and/or nickel and/or with embedded hard phases or forming harder intermetallic phases. Due to the comparatively high environmental impact of those elements, more sustainable alternatives must be found. This study presents a life cycle assessment quantifying the environmental impacts of three groups of cast alloys for wear protection: iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-based alloys. The assessment includes the production stage from raw materials extraction to casting (upstream impacts from cradle-to-gate), with the functional unit defined as 1 dm3 wear protection material. Global average process data were used to estimate the environmental impact of the respective alloy. Results indicate that iron-based alloys as studied here cause lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during production (57-103 kg CO2eq/dm3 or 8.4-13.8 t CO2eq/t) compared to nickel-based (185-205 CO2eq/dm3 or 20-22 t CO2eq/t) and cobalt-based alloys (318-347 CO2eq/dm3 or 31.2-39.5 t CO2eq/t). The lowest emissions during production are caused by iron aluminide-based alloys at around 57 kg CO2eq/dm3 or approx. 8.4 t CO2eq/t, which is up to 90% less than cobalt-based alloys, of up to 60 % less than nickel-based alloys, and around 50 % relative to Cr-rich iron-based alloys. Further, lifetime considerations based on actual wear data of the respective alloys at ambient and elevated temperatures were accounted for, and three different case studies were evaluated, namely abrasive wear at feeder plates, erosive wear on sieves (both at ambient and high temperatures) as well as wear on grate bars of a sintering plant for pig iron. Here, it was shown that the wear materials' lifetime of wearing materials has a crucial effect on the environmental impact, since a prolonged lifetime reduces the need for spare parts and of replacement of the goods with their embedded carbon footprint. For example, an average hot sieve can achieve GHG emission savings of approx. 50 t CO2eq/a when using an iron-aluminium alloy instead of a cobalt-based wear protection. The exchange of 10 m3 worn grate bars for a sintering plant made of an iron aluminide instead of a white cast iron saves over 500 t CO2eq/a. Further, over 50 % emission savings in other environmental impact categories can be achieved by this measure.

AB  - The work of criminal police in contemporary society is characterized by the proliferation of data and information to be processed, a more significant limitation of access to personal data, increased public monitoring, and higher expectations in the efficiency of identifying perpetrators. Also, all information collected during investigations is distributed through police systems separated by different levels and organization units, and often there are insufficient human and material resources. Resolving the perpetrator's identity in those circumstances is a complex task, and police decision support systems must group all available evidence related to specific persons. For that purpose, this paper proposes a new approach to unconstrained pairwise clustering of face feature vectors extracted from the histogram of oriented gradients descriptor, named Truthvalue clustering (TVC), based on non-axiomatic logic and graphs. The clustering approach was experimentally tested with six different face image databases. They were created to simulate unconstrained conditions like IARPA Janus Benchmark-B Face Dataset (IJB-B), IMDb-Wiki, Labeled Faces in the Wild, and YouTube Faces. The results of the proposed solution are compared with other state-of-the-art methods, showing that the approach gives, in summary, significantly better results. Application of the IJB-B protocol created for testing face clustering showed that the new approach gives better results by an average of 8.25% (cr = 4.2). The main advantage over other methods is the possibility of utilizing mechanisms from non-axiomatic logic such as revision, which can then acquire new knowledge based on information from different nodes of the distributed environment consisting of various police information systems.

AB  - The growing usage of aluminum nanoparticles (Al-NP) and their exposure may influence body function. Considering the proposed relationship between Al and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and the concern about the effect of this nanoparticle on brain health and cognitive function, the use of neuroprotective agents might be helpful. According to the reported neuroprotective effects of agmatine, in the present study, the possible protective effect of agmatine was assessed in mice model of Al-NP-induced memory impairment. In addition, due to the roles of hippocampal Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) and ERK signaling in memory and its disorders, these pathways were also investigated. Al-NP (10 mg/kg/p.o.) with/without agmatine (5 or 10 mg/kg/i.p.) was administered to adult male NMRI mice for 5 days. Novel object recognition (NOR) test session was used to assess cognitive function. Following the behavioral assessments, the hippocampi were used to determine the phosphorylated and total levels of GSK-3 beta and ERK as well as GAPDH using western blot analysis. The results showed that Al-NP impaired NOR memory in mice while agmatine 10 mg/kg prevented the memory deficit induced by Al-NP. Furthermore, Al-NP activated GSK-3 beta as well as ERK signals within the hippocampus while agmatine prevented the effects of Al-NP on GSK-3 beta and ERK signals within the hippocampus. Besides supporting the neuroprotective effects of agmatine, these findings suggest the possibility of the connection of hippocampal GSK-3 beta and ERK signaling in the neuroprotective effect of this polyamine against Al-NP.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Yupingfeng granules, a well-known traditional Chinese medication, combined with glucocorticoids on eosinophil (EOS) number and inflammatory factors in nasal secretions of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). 76 patients with AR were randomly divided into controls (nasal inhaled corticosteroids alone) and experimental group (combined with Yupingfeng granules orally). The efficacy, symptoms, number of EOS and levels of inflammatory factors in nasal secretions were compared between the two groups after 2 months of treatment. The results showed that in the experimental group (94.73%, 0.48 +/- 0.25 points), the effective rate of treatment was obviously higher and the physical sign score was clearly lower compared with controls (81.57%, 0.97 +/- 0.36 points); the EOS count in the experimental group was clearly less than that in the controls; the tumor necrosis factor-D (TNF-D) (0.76 +/- 0.44 ng/mL), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (11.83 +/- 3.72 pg/mL), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) (17.45 +/- 6.53 pg/mL) levels were evidently lower in the experimental group than in the controls (1.48 +/- 0.72 ng/mL, 14.62 +/- 5.19 pg/mL, 22.86 +/- 9.35 pg/mL) ( P < 0.05). In summary, compared with nasal inhalation of glucocorticoids alone, combined with oral administration of Yupingfeng granules, it can more significantly improve the symptoms of nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea in AR patients, reduce nasal mucosal edema, reduce the number of EOS in nasal secretions, and reduce the level of inflammatory factors, which is of positive significance for the clinical treatment of AR patients.

AB  - Background: The surveillance of serious and superficial skin fungal infections in Iraq has not been conducted. Limited information exists on their incidence and prevalence. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze, compute and estimate the prevalence and burden of fungal infections, as no previous data is available and no studies has been attempted in Iraq. Methods: In the present study the data were collected and reviewed from published data on epidemiology of fungal infections nationally, internationally, from unpublished postgraduate master and PhD theses, hospital records and private clinic records. External sources of data from other countries were used for diseases which lacked sufficient local data. Results: We estimated 985,628 annual serious infections comprising of 2.26 % of the total population. When including superficial fungal infections group of the skin, this rises to 2,075,113 infections at 4.76% of the total population. The most common serious and skin infections were recurrent Candida vaginitis, fungal rhinosinusitis and tinea capitis comprising 61.5 %, 21.8 %, and 22.4 % of all infections although the total incidence of superficial fungal infections was also high at 1,071,485. Respiratory fungal disease is also common comprising 14.0 % of infections. We predicted the following annual burden per 100,000; oral candidiasis at 247.9, esophageal candidiasis at 6.04, candidemia at 5.0, Candida peritonitis at 0.75, recurrent Candida vaginitis at 5461, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis at 35, severe asthma with fungal sensitisation at 46, invasive aspergillosis at 7.9, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis at 11.7, chronic fungal rhinosinusitis at 496, mucormycosis at 0.99, fungal keratitis at 14.0, and total dermatophytosis at 1631, the most severe being tinea capitis at 366. Many of these estimates were made with data sourced from other nations, so additional data from Iraq is required to validate or modify these estimates. Conclusion: Recurrent Candida vaginitis, fungal rhinosinusitis, and tinea capitis are considered to be the most frequent fungal diseases present in Iraq.

AB  - Annually, lots of useless black tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze] residue is produced in Iranian factories; nonetheless, their bioactive compounds can be extracted and used in the pharmaceutical and food industries. The investigation, which looked at the extraction of all compounds from tea residue, was conducted from 2006 to 2008 to solve environmental problems related to the disposal of tea residues. Extracting one compound to build a lateral products factory is unprofitable, but extracting all bioactive compounds can increase productivity. Four bioactive substances (caffeine, polyphenol, protein, and fiber) were extraction from four tea residues types (dust, fluff, footstalk, and stalk) that nine tea companies generated in the spring, summer, and autumn, assessed in this study. Caffeine was measured by spectrophotometer, followed by cellulose and polyphenol by weight technique, and protein by micro-Kjeldal. Statistical analysis was done on a split plot in randomized complete blocks with three replications (sampling places were randomly selected, and treatments were fixed). The triple effect of residue types, harvest seasons, and factories were significant at a 0.01 level on the levels of caffeine, protein, and fiber, according to the variance analysis findings. The highest amount of caffeine in the dust x summer x Moein factory, followed by protein in the dust x spring x Poltan factory, and fiber in the stalk x autumn x Tohied and Setareh Shomal factories, was observed. Finally, the result demonstrated that consideration must be given to the types of residue, harvest seasons, and factories when using tea factory residues for industrial purposes.

AB  - We isolated and further characterized fibroblasts obtained from postmortem skin biopsies of three different Brazilian wild species (Chrysocyon brachyurus-maned wolf, Cerdocyon thous-crab-eating fox, Mazama gouazoubira-brown brocket deer). The effects of two cryoprotectants, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 5% dimethylformamide (DMF), were assessed to determine the most efficient cryopreservation protocol. Such an investigation promotes the creation of germplasm banks, using samples that would otherwise be rejected and permanently lost following the death of the animals. We utilized animal corpses that were involved in highway accidents, found dead in the natural environment, or referred to us from the veterinary hospital at the Brasilia Zoo. Fibroblasts from C. brachyurus specimens presented a delay in cell growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in relation to other species. This observation is a limiting factor for the future storage of cells from this species. Differences in cellular morphology were observed between C. brachyurus, C. thous, and M. gouazoubira, presenting branched, fusiform, and spherical forms, respectively. The cryoprotective solution containing 10% DMSO was more efficient than 5% DMF medium in preserving the viability of fibroblasts of the three species (p < 0.05). After defining the best cryopreservation solution, a germplasm bank was successfully formed. This biological reservoir is configured as the first germplasm bank containing somatic cells and gametes of wild mammals of the Cerrado biome of Brazil. This material will be used for future characterization of the species and multiplication by means of nuclear transfer cloning.

AB  - Microwave radiation (MWR) has been linked to neurodegeneration by inducing oxidative stress in the hippocampus of brain responsible for learning and memory. Ashwagandha (ASW), a medicinal plant is known to prevent neurodegeneration and promote neuronal health. This study investigated the effects of MWR and ASW on oxidative stress and cholinergic imbalance in the hippocampus of adult male Japanese quail. One control group received no treatment, the second group quails were exposed to MWR at 2 h/day for 30 days, third was administered with ASW root extract orally 100 mg/day/kg body weight and the fourth was exposed to MWR and also treated with ASW. The results showed that MWR increased serum corticosterone levels, disrupted cholinergic balance and induced neuro-inflammation. This neuro-inflammation further led to oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GSH. MWR also caused a significant decline in the nissil substances in the hippocampus region of brain indicating neurodegeneration through oxidative stress mediated hippocampal apoptosis. ASW, on the other hand, was able to effectively enhance the cholinergic balance and subsequently lower inflammation in hippocampus neurons. This suggests that ASW can protect against the neurodegenerative effects of MWR. ASW also reduced excessive ROS production by increasing the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Additionally, ASW prevented neurodegeneration through decreased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in hippocampus, thus promoting neuronal health. In conclusion, this study showed that MWR induces apoptosis and oxidative stress in the brain, while ASW reduces excessive ROS production, prevents neurodegeneration and promotes neuronal health.

AB  - Escalation of human-elephant conflict (HEC) in India threatens its Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population and victimizes local communities. India supports 60% of the total Asian elephant population in the world. Understanding HEC spatial patterns will ensure targeted mitigation efforts and efficient resource allocation to high-risk regions. This study deals with the spatial aspects of HEC in Keonjhar forest division, where 345 people were killed and 5,145 hectares of croplands were destroyed by elephant attacks during 2001-2018. We classified the data into three temporal phases (HEC1: 2001-2006, HEC2: 2007-2012, and HEC3: 2013-2018), in order to (1) derive spatial patterns of HEC; (2) identify the hotspots of HEC and its different types along with the number of people living in the high-risk zones; and (3) assess the temporal change in the spatial risk of HEC. Significantly dense clusters of HEC were identified in Keonjhar and Ghatgaon forest ranges throughout the 18 years, whereas Champua forest range became a prominent hotspot since HEC2. The number of people under HEC risk escalated from 14,724 during HEC1 and 34,288 in HEC2, to 65,444 people during HEC3. Crop damage was the most frequent form of HEC in the study area followed by house damage and loss of human lives. Risk mapping of HEC types and high priority regions that are vulnerable to HEC, provides a contextual background for researchers, policy makers and managers.

AB  - Quercus robur is a tree species that produces acorns with rich nutritional value. Its leaf rolling is crucial for adapting to stress, but this trait's impact on plant-insect interactions remains unknown. We compared the resistance phenotypes, metabolomic profiles, and transcriptomic data of the curly leaf (Qr-T) and normal-leaf (Qr-S) varieties of Q. robur. Findings revealed that Qr-T exhibited higher leaf area consumption under herbivory. Metabolomic analysis found lower levels of key defensive compounds like Questiomycin A, Caffeine, and Indoleacrylic acid in Qr-T. Transcriptomics revealed up-regulation of DEGs related to development (e.g., MYO17, LEC2) and down-regulation of defense-related DEGs (like IOS1, Y3471) in Qr-T. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that defense responses and the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway were suppressed in Qr-T. Coexpression network analysis identified coordinated down-regulation of defense-related genes, such as CYP81Q32 and CYP94A5, and their coexpressed transcription factors (such as WRKY6, WRKY53) in Qr-T. The above findings suggest that leaf curling of Q. robur may weaken its insect resistance, which provides clues for improving plant resistance in agroforestry.

AB  - Academic interest in human-animal interactions steadily started to gain momentum in the 1970s, and "anthrozoology" was coined in 1990 to describe the study of human interactions with other animals. However, the scope and focus have shifted and expanded over the past four decades. We sought to identify themes and trends and produce a holistic picture of how the field is evolving by examining the scholarship published in academic journals. A summative content analysis was performed on 19 international journals dedicated to the study of anthrozoology/human-animal studies (HAS) or focused on some aspect of human-animal relations (such as critical animal studies or animal law). From these journals, 4,023 research papers published between 1984 and 2023 were retrieved. Based on the title, abstract, and keywords, these were coded for categories of animals that were the primary focus or the main research beneficiaries. Categories were broadly coded by animal utility, including companionship, wildlife in natural habitats, zoo exhibits or circus performers, research subjects, farmed commodities, education, sport, service, or occupying liminal spaces, and non-specific. The latter was reserved for articles concerning human attitudes or perceptions of animals more generally. How species and classes are represented over time within and across coded categories and journals were examined, alongside trends in regional focus (e.g., US versus European-based authorship institutions). The results show that despite species focus having shifted across time and journals, companion animal species, charismatic megafauna, and anthropocentric relationships remain the common focus of anthrozoological scholarship. Recommendations for species and topics in need of further anthrozoological attention are provided. Most pertinently, this study concludes with a discussion of the need to address the deficit in representation within international research.

AB  - Purpose of Review Digested manure effluent is a potential resource for the production of liquid organic fertilizer and reused water. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding on the advances and challenges to high-value processing and utilization for digested manure effluent treatment. Recent Findings The main problem that restricts the utilization of digested manure effluent is that there is not enough land for consumption. Reasonable and efficient treatment of digested manure effluent is the key to promoting healthy development and sustainable operation. Digested manure effluent can increase yield, improve quality, and enhance the stress resistance of crops. In addition, digested manure effluent can also be used in seed soaking and feed applications. Membrane treatment techniques for the concentration of digested manure effluent can recover water and produce liquid fertilizer. It mainly includes pressure-driven membrane, osmotic-driven membrane, membrane distillation, and their combined technologies. However, membrane concentration of digested manure effluent still has challenges such as high cost and membrane fouling that restrict development. Thus, several potential approaches have been proposed to address these challenges. These approaches can be largely classified as pretreatment, process optimization, and government-guided source control. In this paper, we critically reviewed the properties and utilization of digested manure effluent. Meanwhile, the performance of different membrane concentration processes was provided. Furthermore, key technical challenges of high-value processing and their potential countermeasures were delineated.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accepted as a form of progressive dementia. Cholinergic systems are commonly affected in AD. Neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) is involved in learning memory-related processes. It is known that the activation of NK3R affects the release of many neurotransmitters. The aim of this project was to investigate the effects of NK3R agonist senktide administration on neurobehavioral mechanisms in the experimental AD-like rat model. 50 male Wistar albino rats were divided into Control (C), AD, Control + NK3R agonist (CS), AD + NK3R agonist (ADS), AD + NK3Ragonist + antagonist groups (ADSO). We designed AD-like model by intrahippocampal administration of A beta 1-42. After NK3R agonist + antagonist injections, open field (OF), Morris water maze (MWM) tests were applied. Cholinergic mechanism analysis from hippocampus-cortex tissues was performed by ELISA and catecholamine analysis from brain stem tissue were performed by HPLC method. The transitions from edge to center, rearing, grooming parameters were found to be reduced in final values of OF. While the group-time interaction was significant in the OF test findings, there was no significant difference between the groups. In MWM test, ADS group showed a learning level close to control group and animals in AD and ADSO groups could not learn target quadrant in MWM test. The brain stem NA and DA concentrations were not statistically significant. Hippocampal AChE-ChAT levels were supported by positive effects of senktide on learning via the cholinergic mechanisms. As a result, NK3R agonists were found to be effective in improving cognitive functions in rats with AD pathology. In the experimental AD model, positive effects of NK3R on learning memory may be mediated by cholinergic mechanisms.

AB  - Sertoli cells provide nutrients and support for germ cell differentiation and maintain a stable microenvironment for spermatogenesis. Comprehensive identification of Sertoli cellular proteins is important in understanding spermatogenesis. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of the proteome and phosphoproteome to explore the role of Sertoli cells in spermatogenesis. A total of 2912 and 753 proteins were identified from the proteome and phosphoproteome in Sertoli cells, respectively; 438 proteins were common to the proteome and phosphoproteome. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024984. In the proteome, ACTG1, ACTB, ACTA2, MYH9 were the most abundant proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that most of the proteins were involved in the processes of localization, biosynthesis, gene expression, and transport. In addition, some of the proteins related to Sertoli cell functions were also enriched. In the phosphoproteome, most of the proteins were involved in gene expression and the RNA metabolic process; the pathways mainly involved the spliceosome, mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and tight junctions. The pleckstrin homology-like domain is the most highly enriched protein domain in phosphoproteins. Cyclindependent kinases and protein kinases C were found to be highly active kinases in the kinasesubstrate network analysis. Ten proteins most closely related to network stability were found in the analysis of the network interactions of proteins identified jointly in the phosphoproteome and proteome. Through immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence verification of vimentin, it was found that there were localization differences between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated vimentin in testicular tissue. This study is the first in-depth proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of buffalo testicular Sertoli cells. The results provide insight into the role of Sertoli cells in spermatogenesis and provide clues for further study of male reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary During lactation, the mammary glands of ewes are prone to infections caused by numerous pathogens. Consequently, mastitis and other udder abnormalities frequently occur. Unfortunately, udder inflammation, whether clinical or subclinical, it poses a significant barrier to livestock profitability by reducing milk production, decreasing milk quality, and suppressing ewes' reproductive performance. The cost of subclinical mastitis often is greater than that of clinical mastitis. Thus, such conditions must be treated during the dry period, which is important for mammary gland repair and recovery. Moreover, an early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Ultrasonography is a useful tool that is employed in the detection of echotextural and hemodynamic changes. During recent decades, there has been an increasing scientific interest in the contributions of B-mode and Doppler to the determination of physiological and pathological conditions occurring in mammary glands, which cannot be detected during a physical examination. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the alterations in ewes' udders' echotexture and blood flow during the end of lactation, the stages of dry period, and the first days of the postpartum period. A further objective was to investigate the hemodynamic and echotextural differentiations between ewes having healthy udders and ewes having subclinical mastitis. The objective of the current study was to investigate the echotextural and hemodynamic changes of ewes entering the dry period with or without subclinical mastitis. B-mode and color Doppler ultrasonography were applied to 12 Chios ewes (6 with healthy udders (group A) and 6 with subclinical mastitis (group B)) before the dry period, during the dry period (the involution phase, steady state, and transition phase), and postpartum. The color Doppler of the mammary arteries was used to evaluate them according to the pulsatility index (PI), resistive index (RI), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMV), blood flow volume (BFV), and artery diameter (D). Udder parenchyma images, analyzed by Echovet v2.0, were used to evaluate the mean value (MV), standard deviation (SD), gradient mean value (GMV), gradient variance (GV), contrast (Con), entropy (Ent), gray value distribution (GVD), run length distribution (RunLD), and long run emphasis (LRunEm). In the involution phase, the PI was higher in group B compared to group A (p <= 0.05). The PI and RI were higher postpartum, whereas the EDV, TAVM, and D were higher in the transition phase (p <= 0.05). Neither the period nor the ewe group affected the MV, SD, GMV, GV, Con, and GVD values (p <= 0.05). In the steady state, the LRunEm was higher in group B, but postpartum, it was higher in group A (p <= 0.05). In conclusion, B-mode and Doppler can reveal differences (i) between healthy ewes and ewes with subclinical mastitis and (ii) among the different periods studied. Further research is needed on the blood flow and echotexture indices of the udders of ewes with unilateral subclinical mastitis.

AB  - Simple Summary Fishmeal (FM) is a valuable ingredient in piglet diets, offering high-quality protein and essential nutrients that promote growth and intestinal health. However, current nutritional data for FM, particularly for weaned piglets, is limited, and there are no accurate models to predict its nutrient utilization in real time. This study evaluates the digestibility and energy values of 10 different FM varieties in piglets, revealing significant variations in nutrient absorption. The results also show that the current NRC estimates for FM's nutritional value may be underestimated. Additionally, the study develops predictive models to estimate the digestibility of key amino acids and energy values based on FM's chemical composition. These findings provide crucial data and predictive tools to improve the precision of FM usage in animal feeding, advancing the development of more efficient and tailored diets for weaned pigs. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids, digestible energy (DE), metabolizable energy (ME), and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients in 10 fishmeal (FM) samples were evaluated in weaned barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) using two experiments. In Experiment 1, 11 piglets (18.87 +/- 0.10 kg) fitted with T-cannulas were randomly allocated to an 11 x 6 Latin-square design with 11 diets (1 nitrogen-free diet and 10 assay diets) and six periods. The AID and SID of all amino acids (AAs) except proline showed significant differences among all FM (p < 0.05). Importantly, the SID of amino acids was positively correlated with key antioxidant markers and immune parameters, and it was negatively correlated with oxidative stress markers (MDA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and IL-6). In Experiment 2, 11 piglets (18.05 +/- 1.15 kg) were assigned to an 11 x 5 Latin-square design with 11 diets (a 96.35% corn diet and 10 assay diets) and five consecutive periods. Significant variations were observed in the DE, ME, and ATTD of dry matter among different FM samples (p < 0.05). Moreover, predictive equations for estimating the SID of lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan, as well as DE and ME, were established using stepwise regression analysis based on the chemical composition of the FM. These findings demonstrate that the nutritional value of FM in nursery pig diets has been underestimated, and this study provides precise data and predictive methods for evaluating the nutritional quality of FM in precision nutrition.

AB  - Fructose and glucose are substrates for the pentose cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle in ovine conceptuses.
   Roles of fructose in elongating ovine conceptuses are poorly understood, despite it being the major hexose sugar in fetal fluids and plasma throughout gestation. Therefore, we determined if elongating ovine conceptuses utilize fructose via metabolic pathways for survival and development. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that trophectoderm and extra-embryonic endoderm express ketohexokinase and aldolase B during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy for conversion of fructose into fructose-1-phosphate for entry into glycolysis and related metabolic pathways. Conceptus homogenates were cultured with C-14-labeled glucose and/or fructose under oxygenated and hypoxic conditions to assess contributions of glucose and fructose to the pentose cycle (PC), tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycoproteins, and lipid synthesis. Results indicated that both glucose and fructose contributed carbons to each of these pathways, except for lipid synthesis, and metabolized to pyruvate and lactate, with lactate being the primary product of glycolysis under oxygenated and hypoxic conditions. We also found that (1) conceptuses preferentially oxidized glucose over fructose (P < 0.05); (2) incorporation of fructose and glucose at 4 mM each into the PC by Day 16 conceptus homogenates was similar in the presence or absence of glucose, but incorporation of glucose into the PC was enhanced by the presence of fructose (P < 0.05); (3) incorporation of fructose into the PC in the absence of glucose was greater under oxygenated conditions (P < 0.01); and (4) incorporation of glucose into the PC under oxygenated conditions was greater in the presence of fructose (P = 0.05). These results indicate that fructose is an important metabolic substrate for ovine conceptuses.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Usually, goat dairy farms have a major problem with the kids they produce for sale, due to their low average daily gain, high feed conversion ratio and poor body conformation, which leads to poor profitability. This paper proposes a solution by crossing the dams not used for replacement with males of a meat breed in a mixed rearing system. The results show that crossbred kids (Murciano-GranadinaxBoer) reached the minimum slaughter weight a week earlier than Murciano-Granadina purebred kids, and that there is a decrease of energy content in milk and in the consumption by the kids as their age increases, which shows the importance of having a concentrated feed that complements their needs to express all the genetic potential for growth observed in the references, especially in the crossing of these two breeds. In addition to this, farms that follow this strategy will also be able to improve their profitability through a higher quantity of milk sold.
   In dairy goats, the low average daily gain and the high conversion ratio for milk and concentrate of the kids mean that their sale price does not offset the costs generated. The hypothesis proposes that a crossbreeding of the Murciano-Granadina breed (MG) with the Boer breed (MGxBoer) will improve the profitability of the kids sold. Thus, the effect of two different groups of kids (purebred MG and crossbred MGxBoer) on birth weight (BW), mortality, average daily gain (ADG), the time for minimum slaughter weight (7 kg) and its variation factors were studied. MGxBoer kids had a 27% greater BW than purebred MG kids (2885 +/- 84 g and 2275 +/- 74 g, respectively), similar ADG (156 +/- 6 g and 142 +/- 6 g, respectively) and mortality (18% and 20%, respectively), and reached minimum slaughter weight a week sooner. ADG was less and less as the lactation period progressed due to a lower milk consumption and milk energy value, which highlights the importance of providing a concentrate that will compensate for this reduced energy content. In conclusion, the results show that MGxBoer crossbred kids reached the minimum slaughter weight a week earlier than purebred MG kids, and highlighted the improvement of farm profitability through the increase of milk sold and the need to provide a concentrate feed to enhance the growth of the kids.

AB  - Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been successfully employed across various mammalian species, yet cloned animals consistently exhibit low pregnancy rates, primarily due to placental abnormalities such as hyperplasia and hypertrophy. This study investigated the involvement of the Hippo signaling pathway in aberrant placental development in SCNT-induced bovine pregnancies. SCNT-derived cattle exhibited placental hypertrophy, including enlarged abdominal circumference and altered placental cotyledon morphology. RNA sequencing analysis indicated significant dysregulation of Hippo signaling pathway genes in SCNT placentas. Co- expression of YAP1 and CCND1 was observed in cloned blastocysts, placental tissues, and bovine placental mesenchymal stem cells (bPMSCs). Manipulation of YAP1 expression demonstrated the capacity to regulate bPMSC proliferation. Experimental assays confirmed the direct binding of YAP1 to CCND1, which subsequently promoted CCND1 expression in bPMSCs. Furthermore, inhibition of CDK6, a downstream target of CCND1, attenuated SCNT bPMSC proliferation. This study identified YAP1 as a key regulatory component within the Hippo signaling pathway that drives placental hyperplasia in cloned cattle through up-regulation of CCND1-CDK6 expression, facilitating cell cycle progression. These findings offer potential avenues for enhancing cloning efficiency, with implications for evolutionary biology and the conservation of valuable germplasm resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial contaminants in the semen are a major concern for most of the semen production laboratories because they adversely affect the semen quality. During sperm cryopreservation, the inclusion of antimicrobials in extenders may help to minimize bacterial growth. However, due to bacterial resistance to commonly used antimicrobials, they cannot fully assure microbiological safety to the frozen semen. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the microbial load and antibiogram of microorganisms isolated from the fresh and frozen bull semen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bacterial load was estimated in fresh and frozen semen samples of crossbred Frieswal bulls by the pour plate method. Microorganisms were identified as Gram positive and Gram negative by Gram staining. The representative bacterial colonies were streaked onto different specific media which were further confirmed by biochemical tests. Bacterial isolates were subjected to in vitro antibiotic sensitivity test. RESULTS: The average microbial load of fresh and frozen semen samples was found to be 8397.4 +/- 524.31 cfu/mL and 680.87 +/- 105.41cfu/mL, respectively. Microorganisms belonging to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus, Klebsiella, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces, E. coli, Rhodococcus, Neisseria and Micrococcus were identified in the semen samples. The antibiotic sensitivity testing of the bacterial isolates revealed that benzyl penicillin was found to be the least effective against the isolated organisms while gentamicin and spectinomycin were found to be most effective among the antibiotics used. Lincomycin, tylosin and streptomycin showed moderate efficacy against the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Gentamicin, tylosin, lincomycin, and spectinomycin (GTLS) antibiotic combination is more effective against bacterial isolates and may be added to semen extender to better control bacterial load and semen quality.

AB  - Background: Status epilepticus (SE) is a continuous episode of seizures which leads to hippocampal neurodegeneration, severe systemic inflammation, and extreme damage to the brain. Modafinil, a psychostimulant and wake-promoting agent, has exerted neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in previous preclinical studies. The aim of this study was to assess effects of modafinil on the lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE rat model and to explore possible involvement of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and nitric oxide (NO) pathways in this regard.Methods: Status epilepticus was provoked by injection of lithium chloride (127 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p]) and pilocarpine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. Animals received different modafinil doses (50, 75,100, and 150 mg/kg, i.p.) and SE scores were documented over 3 hours of duration. Moreover, the role of the nitrergic pathway in the effects of modafinil was evaluated by injection of the non-selective NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NG-Nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), the selective neuronal NOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (30 mg/kg, i.p.), and the selective inducible NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min before saline/vehicle or modafinil. The ELISA method was used to quantify TNF-a and NO metabolite levels in the isolated hippocampus. Results: Modafinil at 100 mg/kg significantly decreased SE scores (P < 0.01). Pre-treatment with L-NAME, 7-nitroindazole, and aminoguanidine significantly reversed the anticonvulsive effects of modafinil. Status epilepticus-induced animals showed significantly higher NO metabolite and TNF-a levels in their hippocampal tissues, an effect that was reversed by modafinil (100 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment. Administration of NOS inhibitors resulted in excessive NO level reduction but an escalation of TNF-a level in modafinil-treated SE-animals. Conclusion: Our study revealed anticonvulsive effects of modafinil in the lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE rat model via possible involvement of TNF-a and nitrergic pathways. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Building atrium design is crucial to maintaining a sustainable built environment and providing thermal comfort to occupants. This study proposes a parametric framework to optimize the atrium's geometry for environmental performance and thermal comfort improvement. It integrates the parametric design, performance simulation, and multi-objective optimization in the Rhino and Grasshopper platform to realize automatic optimization. The atrium's well index, shape ratio, volume ratio, position index, and inner interface window-to-wall ratio were set as optimized factors. For the optimization objectives, useful daylight illuminance (UDI), energy use intensity (EUI), and the discomfort time percentage (DTP) were chosen as metrics for the measurement of daylighting, energy use efficiency, and thermal comfort, respectively. Moreover, a geometry mapping method is developed; it can turn atrium shape into rectangular profiles. Thus, the framework can apply to general buildings. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, an atrium optimization case study is conducted for a villa in Poland. According to the optimization results, the performance of the compared three objectives are improved by 43.20%, 15.52%, and 3.89%, respectively. The running time for the optimization is about 36 s per solution, which greatly reduce the human and time cost compared to the traditional working method.

AB  - Wolbachia is a widespread and well-known bacterium that can induce a wide range of changes within its host. Ants specifically harbor a great deal of Wolbachia diversity and are useful systems to study endosymbiosis. The turtle ants (Cephalotes) are a widespread group of tropical ants that rely on gut microbes to support their herbivorous diet for their survival, yet little is known of the extent of this diversity. Therefore, studying their endosymbionts and categorizing the diversity of bacteria within Cephalotes hosts could help to delimit species and identify new strains and can help lead to a further understanding of how the microbiome leads to survival and speciation in the wild. In our study, 116 individual samples were initially tested for positive infection with the wsp gene. Of the initial 116 samples, 9 samples were infected with only one strain of Wolbachia, and 7 were able to be used successfully for multilocus sequence typing (MLST). We used the new MLST data to infer a phylogeny with other Formicidae samples from the MLST online database to identify new Wolbachia strains and related genes, of which only one came back as an exact match. The 18 Wolbachia-positive samples ranged across 15 different species and 7 different countries, which we further test for species identity and geographic correlation. This study is the first comprehensive look into the diversity of Wolbachia in the turtle ants, providing insight into how endosymbionts are oriented in widespread species and providing a strong foundation for further research in host-microbe interactions.

AB  - During cryopreservation, spermatozoa may suffer cold and cryo-induced injuries.associated with alterations in cell defense systems. that are detrimental to their function and subsequent fertility. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of supplementing the semen freezing extender with the antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH) in cattle. Semen was collected from four bulls and diluted in a freezing extender supplemented with or without GSH (0, 1, 5, and 10 mM) before the cooling step of the cryopreservation process. After thawing, the quality of the frozen-thawed semen was investigated for motility, viability, acrosomal and DNA integrity, and subsequent embryo development after in vitro fertilization of bovine oocytes. Additionally, semen from one of the bulls was used to analyze semen antioxidative potential, sperm penetration into oocytes, male pronucleus formation rate, and embryo DNA integrity. The sperm quality varied among bulls after GSH supplementation. One bull had decreased sperm total motility, and two bulls had decreased sperm DNA integrity. GSH supplementation had positive effects on embryo development for three bulls. Two of them showed both improved cleavage and blastocyst formation rates, while the other one only showed an improved cleavage rate. We observed positive effects on early male pronucleus formation and no negative effects on DNA integrity and cell number in blastocyst stage embryos. Although the effect varies depending on individual bulls and GSH concentration, GSH supplementation in semen may improve in vitro embryo production from frozen semen.

AB  - Humans and other animals evolved to make decisions that extend over time with continuous and ever-changing options. Nonetheless, the academic study of decision-making is mostly limited to the simple case of choice between two options. Here, we advocate that the study of choice should expand to include continuous decisions. Continuous decisions, by our definition, involve a continuum of possible responses and take place over an extended period of time during which the response is continuously subject to modification. In most continuous decisions, the range of options can fluctuate and is affected by recent responses, making consideration of reciprocal feedback between choices and the environment essential. The study of continuous decisions raises new questions, such as how abstract processes of valuation and comparison are co-implemented with action planning and execution, how we simulate the large number of possible futures our choices lead to, and how our brains employ hierarchical structure to make choices more efficiently. While microeconomic theory has proven invaluable for discrete decisions, we propose that engineering control theory may serve as a better foundation for continuous ones. And while the concept of value has proven foundational for discrete decisions, goal states and policies may prove more useful for continuous ones.

AB  - The effects of dietary Origanum syriacum L. and Teucrium polium L., alone and in combination, on the quality and stability of raw broiler meat were evaluated. Broilers (N=140) were reared for 21 days, divided into five groups under completely randomized design receiving one of five dietary treatments (w/w): 1) Control, 2) 1.5% germander (GER), 3) 2.5% oregano (ORE), 4) 1.5% ORE combined with 2.5% GER (CM), 5) 0.02% butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Meat was stored under refrigeration at 4 degrees C for up to 7 days, and analyzed for thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein oxidation, and CIE color values at 0, 4, and 7 days. A similar procedure was used for sensory evaluation and other quality measurements. Both CM and ORE treatments had the significant effect (P = 0.05) on decreasing TBARS values. In addition, CM treatment had the greatest anti-carbonyl effect and exhibited the greatest stabilizing effect on L* values at day 7. CM and ORE treatments were also best able to maintain a* values. The preservative effect of ORE and CM was significantly higher (P <= 0.05), retarding the development of off-odor and rancidity. In conclusion, the current CM level still needs further investigation to be recommended as a commercial additive.

AB  - Deer antler blastema progenitor cells (ABPCs) are promising for regenerative medicine due to their role in annual antler regeneration, the only case of complete organ regeneration in mammals. ABPC-derived signals show great potential for promoting regeneration in tissues with limited natural regenerative ability. Our findings demonstrate the capability of extracellular vesicles from ABPCs (EVsABPC) to repair spinal cord injury (SCI), a condition with low regenerative capacity. EVsABPC significantly enhanced the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and activated neuronal regenerative potential, resulting in a 5.2-fold increase in axonal length. Additionally, EVsABPC exhibited immunomodulatory effects, shifting macrophages from M1 to M2. Engineered with activated cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs), EVsABPC significantly outperformed EVs from rat bone marrow stem cells (EVsBMSC) and neural stem cells (EVsNSC), promoting a 1.3-fold increase in axonal growth, a 30.6% reduction in neuronal apoptosis, and a 2.6-fold improvement in motor function recovery. These findings support ABPC-derived EVs as a promising therapeutic candidate for SCI repair.

AB  - Simple Summary Epigenetic modifications of the genes regulate the inflammation process that includes the DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Sulforaphane is well known for its immunomodulatory properties. Notably, the mechanism of its anti-inflammatory functions involving epigenetic modifications is unclear. This study highlighted the regulatory mechanism of sulforaphane in the innate immunity responses in an acute inflammatory state employ in vivo cell culture model. Porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells were exposed to LPS with or without sulforaphane pre-treatment for these purposes. Epigenetics modulations of the important genes and regulatory factors were studies as well as the immune responses of the cells were vigorously studied over the period of time. This study deciphers the mechanism of SFN in restricting the excessive inflammatory reactions, thereby, exerting its protective and anti-inflammatory function though epigenetic mechanism. Inflammation is regulated by epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Sulforaphane (SFN), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, is also a potent immunomodulatory agent, but its anti-inflammatory functions through epigenetic modifications remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the epigenetic effects of SFN in maintaining the immunomodulatory homeostasis of innate immunity during acute inflammation. For this purpose, SFN-induced epigenetic changes and expression levels of immune-related genes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) were analyzed. These results demonstrated that SFN inhibited HDAC activity and caused histone H3 and H4 acetylation. SFN treatment also induced DNA demethylation in the promoter region of the MHC-SLA1 gene, resulting in the upregulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MHC-SLA1, and inflammatory cytokines' expression at 6 h of LPS stimulation. Moreover, the protein levels of cytokines in the cell culture supernatants were significantly inhibited by SFN pre-treatment followed by LPS stimulation in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that inhibition of HDAC activity and DNA methylation by SFN may restrict the excessive inflammatory cytokine availability in the extracellular environment. We postulate that SFN may exert a protective and anti-inflammatory function by epigenetically influencing signaling pathways in experimental conditions employing porcine moDCs.

AB  - Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) performs a critical role in maintaining homeostasis of intestinal mucosa regulation and controls the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of many immune cells. In this study, we discovered that the infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a coronavirus, upregulated TGF-beta 1 expression via activating Tregs. Besides, recombinant porcine TGF-beta 1 decreased the percentage of CD21(+) B cells within the lymphocyte population in vitro. We further found that TGF-beta 1 reduced the IgA-secreting B cell numbers and also inhibited plasma cell differentiation. Additional investigations revealed that TGF-beta 1 induced the apoptosis of IgM(+) B cells in both peyer's patches (PPs) and peripheral blood (PB) through the activation of the Bax/Bcl2-Caspase3 pathway. Conversely, the application of the TGF-beta 1 signaling inhibitor SB431542 significantly antagonized the TGF-beta 1-induced reduction of IgA secretion and B cell apoptosis and restored plasma cell differentiation. Collectively, TGF-beta 1 plays an important role in regulating the survival and differentiation of porcine IgA-secreting B cells through the classical mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. These findings will facilitate future mucosal vaccine designs that target the regulation of TGF-beta 1 for the control of enteric pathogens in the pig industry.

AB  - High concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in piggery digestive wastewater are toxic to the microorganisms in wastewater treatment systems. The ammonia nitrogen load can be decreased by struvite precipitation. The purpose of this paper was to take phosphate from magnesium-modified biochar adsorbed wastewater as a phosphorus source and add it to biogas slurry to reduce the ammonia nitrogen concentration. The effects of phosphorus source dosage, initial reaction pH value and reaction time on ammonia nitrogen removal from biogas slurry were investigated, and then the subsequent biogas slurry underwent sequencing batch reactor biochemical treatment. When the phosphorus source dosage was 20 g/L, initial reaction pH value was 10.0 and reaction time was 1 h, the NH3-N recovery was 62.98%. The subsequent biogas slurry met the discharge standards (DB44/613-2009) after biochemical treatment. An innovative process for the recycling of pig farm waste, nitrogen and phosphorus recovery and advanced treatment of biogas slurry is first proposed in this paper.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders impacting people worldwide. Using an auditory Stop Signal Task (SST), we have developed an anxiety disorder biomarker (goal-conflict specific rhythmicity/GCSR) that occurs at the right frontal site F8 in righthanded participants. Here, we compare its laterality in left-handers (n = 26) versus demographically-matched right-handers (n = 26) between the ages of 18-30. We assessed the effects on GCSR power of the handedness of the participants (left or right), blocks of the SST, left-right variation across frontal channels (F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8), and EEG frequency (4-12 Hz). Left-handers differed from right-handers most at the channels furthest from the midline. This difference was largely a mirroring of right hander responses by left handers. With frontal channels coded in reverse order for left handers the original significant differences disappeared. Some differences remained between the groups in the frequency variation across blocks of testing. These and other data suggest that the circuitry engaged by conflict in the SST is different from that directly controlling stopping behaviour. Our results also suggest that where GCSR is used as an anxiety process or disorder biomarker in groups that combine both left and right-handed people, data only from the channel ipsilateral to the dominant hand should be used (F7, or F8, respectively).

AB  - Adult neurogenesis enables the life-long addition of functional neurons to the hippocampus and is regulated by both cell-intrinsic molecular programs and behavioral activity. De novo DNA methylation is crucial for embryonic brain development, but its role during adult hippocampal neurogenesis has remained unknown. Here, we show that de novo DNA methylation is critical for maturation and functional integration of adult-born neurons in the mouse hippocampus. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that de novo DNA methyltransferases target neuronal enhancers and gene bodies during adult hippocampal neural stem cell differentiation, to establish neuronal methylomes and facilitate transcriptional up-regulation of neuronal genes. Inducible deletion of both de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in adult neural stem cells did not affect proliferation or fate specification, but specifically impaired dendritic outgrowth and synaptogenesis of newborn neurons, thereby hampering their functional maturation. Consequently, abolishing de novo DNA methylation modulated activation patterns in the hippocampal circuitry and caused specific deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Our results demonstrate that proper establishment of neuronal methylomes during adult neurogenesis is fundamental for hippocampal function.

AB  - Despite Bacillus species having been extensively utilized in the food industry and biocontrol as part of probiotic preparations, limited knowledge exists regarding their impact on intestinal disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of Bacillus licheniformis ZW3 (ZW3), a potential probiotic isolated from camel feces, on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The results showed ZW3 partially mitigated body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon shortening, and suppressed immune response in colitis mice, as evidenced by the reduction in the levels of the inflammatory markers IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 (p < 0.05). ZW3 was found to ameliorate DSS-induced dysfunction of the colonic barrier by enhancing mucin 2 (MUC2), zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), and occludin. Furthermore, enriched beneficial bacteria Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and decreased harmful bacteria Escherichia-Shigella revealed that ZW3 improved the imbalanced gut microbiota. Abnormally elevated uric acid levels in colitis were further normalized upon ZW3 supplementation. Overall, this study emphasized the protective effects of ZW3 in colitis mice as well as some potential applications in the management of inflammation-related diseases.

AB  - Large pig farms generate enormous volumes of wastewater without proper treatment before discharge. High-rate anaerobic reactors as the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) are rarely reported for that purpose. In this study, an EGSB reactor with Cuban natural zeolite addition was evaluated for treating piggery wastewaters at lab scale. This study was conducted at different organic loading rate (OLR) ranging from 0.32 to 6.13 g(COD)/Ld with a constant hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h. The evolution of several control and operational parameters as the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) demonstrated a proper bioreactor performance to treat piggery wastewater. The results showed that the addition of natural zeolite at 40 g(zeo)/L-reactor in EGSB reactor results in COD efficiencies over 70%, despite of the fluctuations of fed wastewater characteristics. The kinetic study demonstrates that, the modified Stover-Kincannon model was found to be appropriate for EGSB reactor. The effluent soluble COD was predicted with high determination coefficient. The maximum removal rate constant (U-max) and saturation value constant (K-B) were reported for a first time for the EGSB reactor with values of 10.2 and 11.8 g(COD)/Ld, respectively. Methane yield for both, batch and continues experiments, were in the range from 214.5 to 299.8 mL(CH4)/g(COD).

AB  - Melittin, a 26-amino acid peptide, is the main component of the venom of four honeybee species and exhibits neuroprotective actions. However, it is unclear how melittin ameliorates neuronal cells in oxidative stress and how it affects memory impairment in an in vivo model. We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of melittin on A beta(25-35)-induced neuro-oxidative stress in both in vitro HT22 cells and in vivo animal model. Melittin effectively protected against HT22 cell viability and significantly deregulated the A beta(25-35)-induced overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis showed that melittin suppressed cell apoptosis and regulated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as well as the expression of proapoptotic related factors: Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), Calpain, Cytochrome c (CytoC), Cleaved caspase-3 (Cleacas3). Additionally, melittin enhanced the antioxidant defense pathway by regulating the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) thus upregulated the production of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a major cellular antioxidant enzyme combating neuronal oxidative stress. Furthermore, melittin treatment activated the Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB)/cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB)/Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), contributing to neuronal neurogenesis, and regulating the normal function of synapses in the brain. In our in vivo experiment, melittin was shown to enhance the depleted learning and memory ability, a novel finding. A mouse model with cognitive deficits induced by A beta(25-35) intracerebroventricular injection was used. Melittin had dose-dependently enhanced neural-disrupted animal behavior and enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus hippocampal region. Further analysis of mouse brain tissue and serum confirmed that melittin enhanced oxidant-antioxidant balance, cholinergic system activity, and intercellular neurotrophic factors regulation, which were all negatively altered by A beta(25-35). Our study shows that melittin exerts antioxidant and neuroprotective actions against neural oxidative stress. Melittin can be a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - BackgroundVolumetric Muscle Loss (VML), resulting from severe trauma or surgical ablation, is a pathological condition preventing myofibers regeneration, since skeletal muscle owns the remarkable ability to restore tissue damage, but only when limited in size. The current surgical therapies employed in the treatment of this pathology, which particularly affects military personnel, do not yet provide satisfactory results. For this reason, more innovative approaches must be sought, specifically skeletal muscle tissue engineering seems to highlight promising results obtained from preclinical studies in VML mouse model. Despite the great results obtained in rodents, translation into human needs a comparable animal model in terms of size, in order to validate the efficacy of the tissue engineering approach reconstructing larger muscle mass (human-like). In this work we aim to demonstrate the validity of a porcine model, that has underwent a surgical ablation of a large muscle area, as a VML damage model.ResultsFor this purpose, morphological, ultrasound, histological and fluorescence analyses were carried out on the scar tissue formed following the surgical ablation of the peroneus tertius muscle of Sus scrofa domesticus commonly called mini-pig. In particular, the replenishment of the damaged area, the macrophage infiltration and the vascularization at different time-points were evaluated up to the harvesting of the scar upon six months.ConclusionHere we demonstrated that following VML damage, there is an extremely poor regenerative process in the swine muscle tissue, while the formation of fibrotic, scar tissue occurs. The analyses performed up to 180 days after the injury revealed the development of a stable, structured and cellularized tissue, provided with vessels and extracellular matrix acquiring the status of granulation tissue like in human.

AB  - Knowing where livestock are located enables optimized management and mustering. However, Australian farms are large meaning that many of Australia's livestock are unmonitored which impacts farm profit, animal welfare and the environment. Effective animal localisation and counting by analysing satellite imagery overcomes this management hurdle however, high resolution satellite imagery is expensive. Thus, to minimise cost the lowest spatial resolution data that enables accurate livestock detection should be selected. In our work, we determine the association between object detector performance and spatial degradation for cattle, sheep and dogs. Accurate ground truth was established using high resolution drone images which were then downsampled to various ground sample distances (GSDs). Both circular and cassegrain aperture optics were simulated to generate point spread functions (PSFs) corresponding to various optical qualities. By simulating the PSF, rather than approximating it as a Gaussian, the images were accurately degraded to match the spatial resolution and blurring structure of satellite imagery. Two existing datasets were combined and used to train and test a YoloV5 object detection network. Detector performance was found to drop steeply around a GSD of 0.5 m/px and was associated with PSF matrix structure within this GSD region. Detector mAP performance fell by 52% when a cassegrain, rather than circular, aperture was used at a 0.5 m/px GSD. Overall blurring magnitude also had a small impact when matched to GSD, as did the internal network resolution. Our results here inform the selection of remote sensing data requirements for animal detection tasks, allowing farmers and ecologists to use more accessible medium resolution imagery with confidence.

AB  - Understanding the survival and reproductive rates of a population is critical to determining its long-term dynamics and viability. Mark-resight models are often used to estimate these demographic rates, but estimation of survival and reproductive rates is challenging, especially for wide-ranging, patchily distributed, or cryptic species. In particular, existing mark-resight models cannot accommodate data from populations in which offspring remain with parents for multiple years, are not always detected, and cannot be aged with certainty. Here we describe a Bayesian multievent mark-resight modelling framework that uses all available adult and adult-offspring sightings (including sightings with older offspring of uncertain age) to estimate reproductive rates and survival rates of adults and juveniles. We extend existing multievent mark-resight models that typically only incorporate adult breeding state uncertainty by additionally accounting for age uncertainty in unmarked offspring and uncertainty in the duration of the mother-offspring association. We describe our model in general terms and with a simple illustrative example, then apply it in a more complex empirical setting using 13 years of photo-ID data from a critically endangered population of beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas. We evaluated model performance using simulated data under a range of sample sizes, and adult and offspring detection rates. Applying our model to the beluga data yielded precise estimates for all demographic rates of interest (despite substantial uncertainty in calf ages), including nonbreeder survival and reproductive rates lower than in other beluga populations. Simulations suggested our model yields asymptotically unbiased parameter estimates with good precision and low bias even with moderate sample sizes and detection rates. This work represents an important new development in multievent mark-resight modelling, allowing estimation of reproductive and juvenile survival rates for populations with extended adult-offspring associations and uncertain offspring ages (e.g. some marine mammals, elephants, bears, great apes, bats and birds). Our model facilitated estimation of robust demographic rates for an endangered beluga population that were previously inestimable (e.g. nonbreeder and juvenile survival, reproductive rate) and that will yield new insights into this population's continued decline.

AB  - Simple Summary The potential use of exotic plants in animal feed provides a source of fiber for grazing ruminants when there is a shortage of pasture. The objective of this research was to evaluate the nutritional value, digestibility, and gas production potential of six exotic plants present in the Azores. Samples of these plants were collected and their chemical composition and potential as forage food were evaluated. Data analysis included univariate and multivariate methods. The results obtained showed variations among the studied forages in terms of crude protein, and fibers: NDF, ADF, and ADL. The gross, metabolizable, and digestible energy of E. globulus and C. japonica showed higher values than the other plants. P. undulatum with a relative food value of 92.12% stood out from the other plants. In gas production, the values of gas produced by A. donax stand out, as the species that presented the highest gas production, observing a significant difference) for the other plants. P. undulatum stands out for presenting good quality in the RFV index and A. donax for having good digestibility, both can be used as forage in periods of greater scarcity of pastures. This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional potential of unconventional plants: Pittosporum undulatum, Cryptomeria japonica, Acacia melanoxylon, Hedychium gardnerianum, Eucalyptus globulus, and Arundo donax, as an alternative roughage for ruminants. Chemical composition, gross energy, in vitro gas production, kinetics, and digestibility of dry matter and organic matter in vitro were determined for each species. The obtained results showed variations between the studied forages concerning crude protein, and the different fiber fractions: NDF, ADF, and ADL The P. undulatum with a relative food value of 92.12%, showed a significant difference compared to the other species under study. After 96 h of incubation, the plants that produced, on average, less in vitro gas were A. melanoxylon and E. globulus. Among the studied species, A. donax stands out as the species that presented the highest gas production, with 31.53 mL. 200 mg(-1) DM, observing a significant difference compared to the other plants. This is a reflection of it having the highest DMD (60.44 +/- 1.22%) as well. P. undulatum was the species with the longest colonization time (4.8 h). Among the plants studied, we highlight P. undulatum as presenting a good quality in the RFV index and A. donax as having good digestibility. Both can be used as roughage in periods of greater shortage of pastures.

AB  - Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a transboundary disease of economic importance affecting cattle and buffaloes. In South-Eastern Europe, immunization of cattle with homologous live attenuated vaccines for LSD control has prevented outbreaks since 2017, but has been associated with adverse reactions resembling disease symptoms. Thus, a diagnostic method suitable for disease surveillance in farms during vaccination campaigns with Neethling (Onderstepoort) and SIS type (Lumpyvax) live attenuated LSDV vaccines in Europe should be able to detect the wild type (WT) LSDV in animals with adverse reactions to the vaccines and samples with potentially high titers of the vaccine LSDV. To this end, a real-time PCR method targeting the EEV gene of LSDV was developed for the specific detection of WT strains, along with the use of beta-actin gene as an internal amplification control (IAC). Amplification efficiency of the WT virus target was 99.0% and 98.6%, in the presence and in the absence of high loads of vaccine LSDV, respectively. In the presence of 105.6 vaccine LSDV DNA copies, the limit of detection for WT LSDV was 12.6 DNA copies per reaction. The inter-assay CV was 0.04% for WT LSDV and 0.13% for beta-actin. The method can confirm diagnosis in suspect cases irrespective of the presence of the vaccine LSDV DNA by overcoming the masking effect of the WT LSDV. The simultaneous amplification of the beta-actin gene further assures the quality of diagnostic testing. The new method is a surveillance tool, complementing the DIVA real-time PCR during vaccination campaigns and can provide rapid insight on the targeted EEV gene in countries with novel and recombinant LSDV strains.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress is known to cause disruptions to a variety of physiological processes in sheep, including reproduction and ultimately pregnancy, mostly by promoting reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress. It has been proposed that the exogenous administration of melatonin, because of its antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties, could help alleviate adverse effects of heat stress. However, the way that melatonin modulates these activities is unclear, especially during pregnancy under heat stress conditions, as well as during lambing. For these reasons, proteomics analysis was used to elucidate the proteins that are regulated by the presence of melatonin. The findings derived from proteomics analysis indicated that melatonin regulates proteins that are involved in cell cycle division, boosted immune response and protective mechanisms affecting both the maternal organism and the embryo(s).Abstract Melatonin is an indoleamine with broad spectrum properties that acts as a regulator of antioxidant and immune response in organisms. In our previous studies, melatonin improved redox status and inflammatory response in pregnant ewes under heat stress conditions. In the present study, using proteomics, the proteins regulated by melatonin during different stages of pregnancy and lambing were assessed. Twenty-two ewes equally divided into two groups, the melatonin (M) (n = 11) and control (C) group (n = 11), participated in the study and were exposed to heat stress during the first months of pregnancy. In the M group, melatonin implants were administered throughout pregnancy, every 40 days, until parturition (a total of four implants per ewe). Blood samples were collected at the beginning of the study simultaneously with the administration of the first melatonin implant (blood samples M1, C1), mating (M2, C2), second implant (M3, C3), fourth implant (M4, C4) and parturition (M5, C5), and MALDI-TOF analysis was performed. The results revealed the existence of 42 extra proteins in samples M2, M3 and M4 and 53 in M5 (sample at parturition) that are linked to melatonin. The biological processes of these proteins refer to boosted immune response, the alleviation of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, energy metabolism, the protection of the maternal organism and embryo development. This proteomics analysis indicates that melatonin regulates protective mechanisms and controls cell proliferation under exogenous or endogenous stressful stimuli during pregnancy and parturition.

AB  - Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a prevalent adverse cardiovascular event at high-altitude environments. Prolonged exposure to high altitudes may result in myocardial injury, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics of myocardial injury in patients with PH at high altitude.Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to a general tertiary hospital at the altitude of 3,650 m were selected into this retrospective study. Clinical and biochemical data were collected, as well as based on cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and echocardiography, patients were divided into myocardial injury group and non-myocardial injury group.Results: A total of 231 patients were enrolled, among whom 29 (12.6%) had myocardial injury. We found that body mass index, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and serum level of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in myocardial injury group were significantly higher than non-myocardial injury group. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that cTnI has a significant positive correlation with CK-MB and lactic dehydrogenase instead of aspartate aminotransferase. A receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to demonstrate that CK-MB could significantly predict the occurrence of myocardial injury with an area under the curve of 0.749, and a level of 3.035 (sensitivity = 59.3%, specificity = 90.5%) was optimal cutoff value.Conclusion: The incidence of myocardial injury in highlanders with PH is significant. CK-MB, as a convenient and efficient marker, has been found to be closely associated with cTnI and plays a predictive role in the occurrence of myocardial injury with PH in individuals exposed to high altitude.

AB  - Host adaptation in herbivorous arthropods is one of the first steps to sympatric speciation, and spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) are useful model organisms for studying this phenomenon. Many researchers have studied the process of host adaptation via artificial selection experiments. Recent analyses suggest that hybridisation has diversified host ranges, although empirical evidence is scarce. We explored the host exploitation of two strains of Eotetranychus asiaticus established from Ternstroemia gymnanthera (Pentaphylacaceae) and Japanese cinnamon, Cinnamomum yabunikkei (Lauraceae), and evaluated the effect of hybridisation on offspring host use. Transplant experiments showed that females oviposited and immature mites developed only on their native hosts, suggesting specialisation to the secondary metabolites of each host plant. However, F1 hybrids from reciprocal crosses developed on both host plants (survival rate: 92-100%) with normal female-biased sex ratios. Furthermore, all backcrosses to the parental strains yielded B1 offspring that were also viable on both host plants with normal sex ratios (69-87% and 39-92% females on T. gymnanthera and C. yabunikkei, respectively). B1 survival rates in interstrain crosses were varied (11-63%) and lower than those in intrastrain crosses (88-93%). We could not detect any reproductive barriers in these experiments, and host preference may be the sole factor determining pre-mating isolation. The survival rates and sex ratios we observed suggest cytochromosome interactions. In conclusion, hybridisation, which results in heterozygotes and recombination, is an underexplored way to provide spider mites with a novel host plant.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM), as the most active ingredient in compost, directly determines the speciation and environmental behavior of HMs. Here, the binding properties of DOM derived from chicken-manure compost (CHM), cow-manure compost (COM) and pig-manure compost (PIM) with HMs were explored by analyses of Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) and two-dimensional correlation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (2D-FTIR-COS). Results showed that the binding characteristics vary with origin of DOM and type of HMs. The fulvic-like component dominated the transformation of HMs speciation, and CHM-DOM had higher affinity with HMs and greater risk causing pollution due to its higher aromaticity, molecular weight and distribution of fluorescent components. Moreover, Cu(II) can efficiently bind to DOM with the stability constants (log kM) ranging from 4.53 to 5.38, followed by Pb(II) (3.34-3.57), whereas Cd (II) can hardly bind to DOM. The amide and polysaccharide were the predominant sites for HMs binding in CHMDOM, and polysaccharide and phenolic in COM-DOM, while phenolic and amide in PIM-DOM, respectively. Although the proportion of protein-like components and non-fluorescent polysaccharides in DOM were low, their role in HMs binding should not be ignored. In brief, the environmental risk caused by livestock manure compost may originate from interactions between DOM and HMs.

AB  - Objective: Mind-wandering is a pervasive human brain state and, when in excess, may promote negative affect and neuropsychiatric conditions. Mindfulness meditation may promote alternate brain states, improving affect and reducing stress. An understanding of the neural basis between these brain states could thus advance treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions, including those associated with epilepsy. Methods: To explore the neural basis of mindfulness meditation versus mind-wandering, we enrolled eight patients in a trial of structured mindfulness meditation and open mind-wandering who underwent stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) within the mesial temporal lobe for seizure localization. Electrophysiology was compared between mind-wandering and mindfulness separately for epileptic and non-epileptic MTL. Using fitting-one-over-f modeling, periodic components of electrophysiology were compared in canonical frequency bands of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-55 Hz). Aperiodic components of the power spectra were assessed by the model offset, knee, and exponent. Results: We found a significant reduction in gamma power (30-55 Hz) within the mesial temporal lobe (MTL) during mindfulness meditation compared with mind-wandering in non-epileptic (p = 1.20E-4) but not in epileptic MTL (p = 0.352).There was also a significant difference between epileptic versus non-epileptic MTL in gamma power between conditions (p = 0.011). There were no significant changes in power across any frequency band within epileptic mesial temporal MTL between brain states. Conversely, there were significant differences between mind-wandering and mindfulness within epileptic MTL in aperiodic components (offset, knee, and exponent, all p < 0.05), while no differences in aperiodic components were seen in non-epileptic MTL (all p > 0.70). Significance: Intracranial electrophysiologic modulations between brain state (mind-wandering versus mindfulness) may differ between epileptic and non-epileptic MTL. Modulations in gamma activity in non-epileptic MTL may represent functional changes in brain state, while aperiodic changes in epileptic MTL may modulate propensity for seizures.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by changes in interneuron numbers in the hippocampus. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging tool to treat TLE seizures, although its mechanisms are not fully deciphered. We aimed to depict the effect of amygdala DBS on the density of the most common interneuron types in the CA1 hippocampal subfield in the lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Status epilepticus was induced in male Wistar rats. Eight weeks later, a stimulation electrode was implanted to the left basolateral amygdala of both pilocarpine-treated (Pilo, n = 14) and age-matched control rats (n = 12). Ten Pilo and 4 control animals received for 10 days 4 daily packages of 50 s 4 Hz regular stimulation trains. At the end of the stimulation period, interneurons were identified by immunolabeling for parvalbumin (PV), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Cell density was determined in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus using confocal microscopy. We found that PV+ cell density was preserved in pilocarpine-treated rats, while the NPY+/nNOS+ cell density decreased significantly. The amygdala DBS did not significantly change the cell density in healthy or in epileptic animals. We conclude that DBS with low frequency applied for 10 days does not influence interneuron cell density changes in the hippocampus of epileptic rats.

AB  - Herbivore-induced wounding can elicit a defense response in plants. However, whether plants possess a surveillance system capable of detecting herbivore threats and initiating preparatory defenses before wounding occurs remains unclear. In this study, we reveal that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) trichomes can detect and respond to the mechanical stimuli generated by herbivores. Mechanical stimuli are preferentially perceived by long trichomes, and this mechanosensation is transduced via intra-trichome communication. This communication presumably involves calcium waves, and the transduced signals activate the jasmonic acid signaling pathway in short glandular trichomes, resulting in the upregulation of the Woolly (Wo)-SlMYC1 regulatory module for terpene biosynthesis. This induced defense mechanism provides plants with an early warning system against the threat of herbivore invasion. Our findings represent a perspective on the role of multicellular trichomes in plant defense and the underlying intra-trichome communication.
   Different trichome types (nonglandular and glandular) in tomato detect the mechanical forces generated by herbivores to activate early defense responses.

AB  - Humans overlap with Asian elephants, resulting in frequent costly human-elephant conflicts, which disturb and even threaten local residents. In this study, we treat provincial and national nature reserves where Asian elephants still exist and other alternative habitats suitable for Asian elephants in southern Yunnan, China, as ecological patches. By using this approach, we can treat the terrain and surface state factors that hinder the migration of Asian elephants as a form of ecological resistance surface. We can then use a circuit theory model and remote sensing data to construct an ecological network, which allows us to identify ecological corridors and ecological pinch points. Herein, the possible migration routes of wild Asian elephants were identified. The main results are as follows: (1) In the study area, dense forests with steep slopes and high altitudes, cultivated land, and building land have greater migration resistance, while the gently undulating shrubs, bamboo forests, and grasslands far away from the city have less migration resistance. (2) There are three ecological corridor groups in the study area, mainly composed of shrub and grassland. The ecological corridors identified in this paper are the most likely migration routes of wild Asian elephants in China, and areas with higher simulated current densities reflect a higher probability of Asian elephants passing through. (3) According to the analysis, the ecological pinch points in the study area are 602 km(2 )in total, and woodland and grassland account for 89.2% of the total ecological pinch area. The areas where the pinch points are located have a high probability of Asian elephants passing through and a narrow space. Our findings can provide suggestions and solutions for the current conservation of wild Asian elephant species, alleviate human-elephant conflicts, promote the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, and provide reference for biological protection and biological reserve planning.

AB  - BACKGROUND Selenium has shown effectiveness in protecting plants from herbivores. However, some insects have evolved adaptability to selenium.
   RESULTS Selenium accumulation in host plants protected them against spider mite feeding. Selenium showed toxic effects on spider mites by reducing growth and interfering with reproduction. After 40 generations on selenium-rich plants, a Tetranychus cinnabarinus strain (Tc-Se) developed adaptability to selenium, with an increased rate of population growth and enhanced ability for selenium metabolism. The high expression of two genes (GSTd07 and SPS1) in the selenium metabolism pathway might be involved in selenium metabolism in spider mites. After GSTd07 and SPS1 were silenced, the selenium adaptability decreased. Recombinant GSTd07 protein promoted the reaction between sodium selenite and glutathione (GSH) and increased the production of sodium selenite metabolites. The results indicated that GSTd07 was involved in the first step of selenium metabolism.
   CONCLUSION Plants can resist spider mite feeding by accumulating selenium. Spider mites subjected to long-term selenium exposure can adapt to selenium by increasing the expression of key genes involved in selenium metabolism. These results elucidate the mechanism of the interaction between mites and host plants mediated by selenium. This study of the interaction between selenium-mediated host plants and spider mites may lead to the development of new and less toxic methods for the prevention and control of spider mites.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the effects of camel placenta powder on associated symptoms, signs and indicators in type 2 diabetic rats. For this study sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal group, model group, metformin group, and low-, medium- and high-dose camel placenta groups. A high-fat and high-sugar feed combined with intraperitoneal injection of STZ dissolved in a citric acid-sodium citrate buffer was used to establish a rat model of hyperglycaemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets were used as a positive control to detect fasting blood glucose. The contents of glycated haemoglobin (HbALc), insulin (INS) and glucose (GLUC3) as well as the protein expression and mRNA levels of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) were used to study the mechanism of the hypoglycaemic effect of CPP on diabetic rats. We found that camel placenta produced no meaningful changes in the weight of hyperglycaemic rats or the weight of the liver, kidney, or pancreas. After STZ modelling, the blood glucose levels of rats noticeably increased. However, the blood glucose values of rats decreased substantially due to camel placenta treatment from the 4th to the 6th week. Camel placenta dramatically reduced the serum HbALc and GLUC3 content in hyperglycaemic rats. Dry CPP had a down-regulating effect on the levels of SGLT2 and GLUT2 protein, SGLT2 mRNA and GLUT2 mRNA in the kidneys of hyperglycaemic rats. However, there was no meaningful difference between the metformin group and the high- and medium-dose camel placenta groups. To conclude camel placenta has a notable hypoglycaemic effect on diabetic rats induced by STZ with a high-fat and high-sugar feed.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) exposure has been reported to have neurotoxic effects in animal studies and associated with increased Alzheimer's Disease mortality and lower cognitive function in cross-sectional and case-control studies. However, no results from longitudinal studies on Cd and cognitive decline are available. In this prospective cohort study, we recruited 1867 participants aged 65 years or older from rural areas in China, blood Cd and cognitive function were measured at baseline (2010-2012), and 1554 participants completed cognitive function tests during a 3-year follow-up (2013-2015). Cognitive function was evaluated using nine standardized cognitive tests: The Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, the CERAD Word List Learning. Word list recall, IU Story Recall, Animal Fluency Test, Boston Naming Test, Stick Design, Delayed Stick Design and the IU Token Test. Analysis of covariance models and logistic regression models were used to determine the association between Cd and standardized cognitive decline adjusting for covariates. The median blood Cd concentration of this study population was 2.12 mu g/L and the interquartile range was 1.42-4.64 mu g/L Significant association of higher Cd levels with lower cognitive scores were observed in five individual cognitive tests ( Delayed Stick Design Test, Boston Naming Test, CERAD Word List Learning Test, Word List Recall Test and IU Story Recall Test) and the composite cognitive score adjusting for multi-covariates at baseline. Higher Cd levels were significantly associated with greater 3-year cognitive decline in Delayed Stick Design Test, Boston Naming Test, Hi Token Test, Word List Recall Test and Composite cognitive score. For these cognitive tests, participants in the top two Cd quartile groups had significantly greater decline than those in the lowest Cd quartile group, while the two lowest Cd quartile groups were not significantly different Our findings suggest that higher Cd exposure is associated with greater cognitive decline in older Chinese adults.

AB  - Cervical mucus plays an important role in female fertility, since it allows the entry of motile and morphological normal sperm while preventing the ascent of pathogens from the vagina. The function of cervical mucus is critically linked to its rheological properties that are in turn dictated by O-glycosylated proteins, called mucins. We aimed to characterize the O-glycan composition in the cervical mucus of six European ewe breeds with known differences in pregnancy rates following cervical/vaginal artificial insemination with frozen-thawed semen, which are due to reported differences in cervical sperm transport. These were Suffolk (low fertility) and Belclare (medium fertility) in Ireland, Ile de France and Romanov (both with medium fertility) in France, and Norwegian White Sheep (NWS) and Fur (both with high fertility) in Norway (n = 28-30 ewes/breed). We identified 124 O-glycans, from which 51 were the major glycans with core 2 and fucosylated glycans as the most common structures. The use of exogenous hormones for synchronization did not affect the O-glycan composition in both high-fertility ewe breeds, but it did in the other four ewe breeds. There was a higher abundance of the sulfated glycan (Gal beta 1-3[SO3-GlcNAc beta 1-6]GalNAc), fucosylated glycan (GlcNAc beta 1-3(Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3)GalNAc) and core 4 glycan (GlcNAc beta 1-3[GlcNAc beta 1-6]GalNAc) in the low-fertility Suffolk breed compared with NWS (high fertility). In addition, core 4 glycans were negatively correlated with mucus viscosity. This novel study has identified O-glycans that are important for cervical sperm transport and could have applications across a range of species including human.

AB  - After-hours events are a popular way for modern zoos and aquariums to engage the local community, increase attendance, and generate additional income. Using fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGM), behavioral, and sound level monitoring, we analyzed whether cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis sp.) showed any significant changes in response to three types of event "treatments" at the Oregon Zoo: (1) "concerts" with significantly elevated sound levels; (2) "other" evening events which constituted popular events with minimal sound disruptions, and (3) "control" when no evening events took place. We found significantly higher sound pressure levels in both habitats during "concert" event types with no significant differences between the remaining event types. Both cheetahs and giraffes exhibited subtle behavior changes during each event type, such as increased instances of "not visible" for cheetahs and a slight increase in the rate of "social interaction" for giraffes. However, no significant changes in fGM concentrations were measured for any individual animal across all the different event types. Yet there were some significant differences in fGM concentrations between the 2 years of data collection as well as some differences in fGM variability driven primarily by individual differences within each species. Results from this study, therefore, emphasize the highly individualistic nature of behavior and physiological responses to events of any type and illustrate how important it is to measure responses of each individual, when feasible, rather than focusing on an overall species typical response.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) induced learning and memory deficits through mechanisms that are not fully understood. In this study, we discovered that the demethylase FTO was significantly downregulated in hippocampal neurons in an experimental a mouse model of Mn exposure. This decreased expression of FTO was associated with Mninduced learning and memory impairments, as well as the dysfunction in synaptic plasticity and damage to regional neurons. The overexpression of FTO, or its positive modulation with agonists, provides protection against neurological damage and cognitive impairments. Mechanistically, FTO interacts synergistically with the reader YTHDF3 to facilitate the degradation of GRIN1 and GRIN3B through the m6A modification pathway. Additionally, Mn decreases the phosphorylation of SOX2, which specifically impairs the transcriptional regulation of FTO activity. Additionally, we found that the natural compounds artemisinin and apigenin that can bind molecularly with SOX2 and reduce Mn-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice. Our findings suggest that the SOX2-FTO-Grins axis represents a viable target for addressing Mn-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive impairments.

AB  - The multi-level perspective has been criticized for being functionalistic and paying little attention to actor-based perspectives. Nevertheless, for the identification and assessment of potential change agents in a sustainability transition, a clear conceptual and methodological approach is necessary. This paper, thus, develops a multi-dimensional typology of niche, regime, and hybrid actors, which is conceptually grounded in transition studies and empirically illustrated by a cluster analysis based on a survey of pig and poultry farmers in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Animal husbandry is chosen as a case study because a significant share of the environmental impact within the agri-food system is attributed to this sector and there is evidence for resistance to change by mainstream actors. Conceptually, the paper provides a framework of constitutive elements for different kinds of actors and contributes to an extension of the niche-regime dichotomy by adding the group of hybrid actors. The empirical results show that cluster analysis is a suitable approach to identify conceptually meaningful differences among interviewed farmers. Among pig and poultry farmers, the regime actors are by far the largest group. The smaller group of hybrid actors, however, has large potential to act as boundary spanners. A particularly interesting finding is that several larger farms are among the group of niche actors which hints at the possibility that larger farms are not necessarily resistant to change.

AB  - Aims: Campylobacteriosis, caused by Campylobacter spp., is one of the most important foodborne zoonotic diseases in the world and a common cause of gastroenteritis. In the European Union, campylobacteriosis is considered the most common zoonotic disease, with over 10,000 cases in 2020 alone. This high occurrence highlights the need of more efficient surveillance methods and identification of key points. Methods and Results: Herein, we evaluated and identified key points of Campylobacter spp. occurrence along the Spanish food chain during 2015-2020, based on the following variables: product, stage and region. We analysed a dataset provided by the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition using a machine learning algorithm (random forests). Campylobacter presence was influenced by the three selected explanatory variables, especially by product, followed by region and stage. Among the studied products, meat, especially poultry and sheep, presented the highest probability of occurrence of Campylobacter, where the bacterium was present in the initial, intermediate and final stages (e.g., wholesale, retail) of the food chain. The presence in final stages may represent direct consumer exposure to the bacteria. Conclussions: By using the random forest method, this study contributes to the identification of Campylobacter key points and the evaluation of control efforts in the Spanish food chain.

AB  - Early life exposure to immune activation and stress are critical factors involved in the development of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders in adulthood. This study explored the individual and combined effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide-induced (LPS)-induced immune activation and postnatal maternal separation on cognitive performance and oxidative metabolism in male Wistar rats. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, pregnant dams were exposed to LPS or saline on gestational day 15, and offspring underwent maternal separation from postnatal days 2-14. In adulthood, cognitive function was assessed using the Morris Water Maze, and regional brain energy metabolism was evaluated using quantitative histochemistry of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) quantitative histochemistry in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and retrosplenial cortex. Rats exposed to both stressors demonstrated significant impairments in spatial memory and cognitive flexibility, supporting the "two-hit" hypothesis of early adversity, which posits that early life exposure to an adverse environmental event (first hit) combined with subsequent exposure to stress during critical developmental periods (second hit) can significantly increase the risk of developing behavioral or neurodevelopmental disorders in adulthood. Accordingly, adult animals exposed to prenatal LPS and maternal separation showed prolonged escape latencies and decreased spatial memory retention during the behavioral tasks. Concurrently, CCO activity was markedly increased in all measured regions, reflecting heightened metabolic demands. These changes are consistent with impaired hippocampal-prefrontal-retrosplenial network integration and the underlying key processes involved in cognitive alterations such as memory or attention. This study underscores the synergistic effects of these environmental factors on cognitive and metabolic dysfunction, providing a translational model to better understand the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interacting environmental factors in the context of early life adversity.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a two-week running intervention on depressive symptoms and structural changes of different subfields of the hippocampus in young adults from the general population. The intervention was realized in small groups of participants in a mostly forested area and was organized into seven units of about 60 min each. The study design included two intervention groups which were tested at three time points and which received the intervention time-delayed: The first group between the first and the second time point, and the second group between the second and the third time point (waiting control group). At each test session, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and symptoms related to depression were measured by means of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. Results revealed a significant reduction of CES-D scores after the running intervention. The intervention also resulted in significant increases in the volume of the hippocampus, and reductions of CES-D scores right after the intervention were associated with increases in hippocampal volume. These findings add important new evidence on the beneficial role of aerobic exercise on depressive symptoms and related structural alterations of the hippocampus. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The accidentally introduced ragweed leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) is a most promising biological control agent for common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), which herbivore has already emerged in several areas of the Palearctic region. The aim of our study was to model the expansion of O. communa and the number of generations in the various Palearctic regions. Furthermore, our objective was to determine the effect of the prevailing wind on the direction of its spread and to ascertain the relationship between the green biomass production of ragweed and individual numbers of this leaf beetle. According to our meta-analytical findings, the advancement of O. communa is continuous in the Palearctic areas. This phytophagous insect invades new habitats, which are occupied by A. artemisiifolia, and spreads quickly. The stable populations of O. communa seem to be strictly linked to the presence of its primary host, A. artemisiifolia. We show that the rapid spread of this insect is due to the combination of wind direction and topography features, which was reinforced by our analysis. O. communa possesses uniformly multivoltine populations in its Palearctic habitats. So, insects possessing facultative diapause are able to colonize northern areas depending on the presence of their host, which statement is based on the processing of 143 East- and 68 West-Palearctic records According to our investigations, the mass appearance of this phytophagous insect coincided with the assimilation peak of its main host, common ragweed.

AB  - Background: Ginsenosides and their metabolites have antidepressant-like effects, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We previously identified 14-3-3 zeta as one of the target proteins of 20 (S)protopanaxadiol (PPD), a fully deglycosylated ginsenoside metabolite. Methods: Corticosterone (CORT) was administered repeatedly to induce the depression model, and PPD was given concurrently. The tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swimming test (FST) were used for behavioral evaluation. All mice were sacrificed. Golgi-cox staining, GSK 3(3 activity assay, and Western blot analysis were performed. In vitro, the kinetic binding analysis with the Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) was used to determine the molecular interactions. Results: TST and FST both revealed that PPD reversed CORT-induced behavioral deficits. PPD also ameliorated the CORT-induced expression alterations of hippocampal Ser9 phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3(3 (p-Ser9 GSK 3(3), Ser133 phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pSer133 CREB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Moreover, PPD attenuated the CORTinduced increase in GSK 3(3 activity and decrease in dendritic spine density in the hippocampus. In vitro, 14-3-3 zeta protein specifically bound to p-Ser9 GSK 3(3 polypeptide. PPD promoted the binding and subsequently decreased GSK 3(3 activity. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated the antidepressant-like effects of PPD on the CORT-induced mouse depression model and indicated a possible target-based mechanism. The combination of PPD with the 14-3-3 zeta protein may promote the binding of 14-3-3 zeta to p-GSK 3(3 (Ser9) and enhance the inhibition of Ser9 phosphorylation on GSK 3(3 kinase activity, thereby activating the plasticity-related CREB-BDNF signaling pathway.

AB  - NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus is a well-known form of synaptic plasticity that has been linked to different cognitive functions. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, this form of LTD cannot be induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in adult mice. In this study, we found that LFS-induced LTD was not easily induced in adult animals and was age dependent. Interestingly, the level of the 5-HT1A receptor was correspondingly increased and exhibited an inverse correlation with the magnitude of LFS-LTD during development. Knockout or pharmacological inhibition of the 5-HT1A receptor reversed impaired LFS-LTD in adult mice (P60), while activation or inhibition of this receptor disturbed or enhanced LFS-LTD in adolescent mice (P21), respectively. Furthermore, the astrocytic 5-HT1A receptor in the hippocampus predominantly mediated age-dependent LFS-LTD through enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission. Finally, fear memory extinction differed among the above conditions. These observations enrich our knowledge of LTD at the cellular level and suggest a therapeutic approach for LTD-related psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Simple Summary As one of the most important components, starch has made great contributions to feed but was wasted numerously during pig feeding. This paper is designed to explore the optimal ratio of dietary amylose to amylopectin for gut health and absorption, thereby improving starch utilization. Our results indicated that the dietary amylose/amylopectin ratio (AAR) of 0.60 could reduce feed conversion rate of piglets, having a certain positive significance for saving feed. In addition, under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stress, a diet with an AAR of 0.40 to 0.60 significantly improved the intestinal health of piglets, which would provide data to support for the formulation of feed in weaned piglets during bacterial infection. This study investigated the effects of diet with different amylose-amylopectin ratios (AAR) on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, digestive enzyme activities and mRNA expression of nutrients transporters in piglets with short-term lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal injections. Sixty 21 days-old piglets (Landrace x Yorkshire; 6.504 +/- 0.079) were randomly assigned based on their body weight (BW) and litters of origins to five groups with experimental diets with an AAR of 0.00, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, or 0.80 (namely, the 0.00, 0.20, 0.40, and 0.80 groups), respectively. Each treatment included 12 piglets (one piglet per pen). This experiment lasted for 28 days. On the 28th day, six piglets in each treatment were randomly selected for an LPS intraperitoneal injection (100 mu g/kg BW), and other piglets were injected with normal saline. Twelve hours after LPS injection, all piglets were sacrificed to collect small intestinal mucosa for analysis. Although different AAR did not influence the final BW in piglets, the piglets in the 0.40 group represented the poorest feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) in the first, second and fourth week (p < 0.05) and the lowest average daily gain (ADG) in the fourth week (p < 0.05) compared with other groups. In terms of the small intestinal morphology, piglets in the 0.20 and 0.60 groups showed better ileal villous width (p < 0.05). Piglets in the 0.60 group presented greater activities of jejunal maltase, sucrase and alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05) than those of 0.20 and 0.40. However, a low amylose diet increased the mRNA expression of jejunal glucose and amino acid transporters (p < 0.05). In addition, compared to saline injection, the LPS challenge significantly lessened jejunal digestive enzyme activities (p < 0.01) and, ileal villous width and downregulated the gene expression of glucose and amino acid transporters (p < 0.05) in piglets. Interestingly, certain diet -LPS interactions on duodenal VH/CD, jejunal maltase activity (p < 0.05) and the expression of glucose transporters (p < 0.05) were observed. Taken together, in terms of small intestinal digestion and absorption capacity, these results demonstrated that a diet with an AAR of 0.60 diets could improve the intestinal digestive and absorptive capability by affecting small intestinal morphology, digestive enzymes, and nutrients absorptions in piglets. In addition, the diets containing an AAR of 0.40-0.60 were more likely to resist the damage of LPS stress to intestinal morphology and nutrient absorption.

AB  - Depression is a common mood disorder and many patients do not respond to conventional pharmacotherapy or experience a variety of adverse effects. This work proposed that riparin I (RIP I) and riparin II (RIP II) present neuroprotective effects through modulation of astrocytes and microglia, resulting in the reversal of depressive-like behaviors. To verify our hypothesis and clarify the pathways underlying the effect of RIP I and RIP II on neuroinflammation, we used the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) depression model in mice. Male Swiss mice were exposed to stressors for 28 days. From 15th to the 22nd day, the animals received RIP I or RIP II (50 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (FLU, 10 mg/kg) or vehicle, by gavage. On the 29th day, behavioral tests were performed. Expressions of microglia (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 - Iba-1) and astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein - GFAP) markers and levels of cytokines tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) were measured in the hippocampus. CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, high TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels, decreased GFAP, and increased Iba-1 expressions. RIP I and RIP II reversed these alterations. These results contribute to the understanding the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect of RIP I and RIP II, which may be related to neuroinflammatory suppression.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is an acute, febrile, highly contagious infection of pigs caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The purpose of this study is to understand the molecular mechanism of ASFV infection and evaluate the effect of DCA on MAPK pathway, so as to provide scientific basis for the development of new antiviral drugs. The transcriptome analysis found that ASFV infection up -regulated the IL -17 and MAPK signaling pathways to facilitate viral replication. Metabolome analysis showed that DCA levels were up -regulated after ASFV infection, and that exogenous DCA could inhibit activation of the MAPK pathway by ASFV infection and thus inhibit viral replication. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to screen the genes of ASFV and revealed that I73R could significantly up -regulate the transcription level of AP -1 transcription factor in the MAPK pathway. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that I73R could promote AP -1 entry into the nucleus, and that DCA could inhibit the I73R -mediated nuclear entry of AP -1, inhibiting MAPK pathway, and I73R interacts with AP -1. These results indicated that DCA can inhibit ASFV-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway, thus inhibiting ASFV replication. This study provides a theoretical basis for research on ASF pathogenesis and for antiviral drug development.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in pediatric patients and often results in delayed neural development and altered connectivity, leading to lifelong learning, memory, behavior, and motor function deficits. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (iNSCs) may serve as a novel multimodal therapeutic as iNSCs possess neuroprotective, regenerative, and cell-replacement capabilities post-TBI. In this study, we evaluated the effects of iNSC treatment on cellular, tissue, and functional recovery in a translational controlled cortical impact TBI piglet model. Five days post-craniectomy (n = 6) or TBI (n = 18), iNSCs (n = 7) or PBS (n = 11) were injected into perilesional brain tissue. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) neurological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging, and immunohistochemistry were performed over the 12-week study period. At 12-weeks post-transplantation, iNSCs showed long-term engraftment and differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. iNSC treatment enhanced endogenous neuroprotective and regenerative activities indicated by decreasing intracerebral immune responses, preserving endogenous neurons, and increasing neuroblast formation. These cellular changes corresponded with decreased hemispheric atrophy, midline shift, and lesion volume as well as the preservation of cerebral blood flow. iNSC treatment increased piglet survival and decreased mRS scores. The results of this study in a predictive pediatric large-animal pig model demonstrate that iNSC treatment is a robust multimodal therapeutic that has significant promise in potentially treating human pediatric TBI patients.

AB  - Magnesium (Mg) plays important roles in photosynthesis, sucrose partitioning, and biomass allocation in plants. However, the specific mechanisms of tea plant response to Mg deficiency remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of Mg deficiency on the quality constituents of tea leaves. Our results showed that the short-term (7 days) Mg deficiency partially elevated the concentrations of polyphenols, free amino acids, and caffeine but decreased the contents of chlorophyll and Mg. However, long-term (30 days) Mg-deficient tea displayed decreased contents of these constituents. Particularly, Mg deficiency increased the index of catechins' bitter taste and the ratio of total polyphenols to total free amino acids. Moreover, the transcription of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoid, caffeine, and theanine was differentially affected by Mg deficiency. Additionally, short-term Mg deficiency induced global transcriptome change in tea leaves, in which a total of 2522 differentially expressed genes were identified involved in secondary metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and chlorophyll metabolism. These results may help to elucidate why short-term Mg deficiency partially improves the quality constituents of tea, while long-term Mgdeficient tea may taste more bitter, more astringent, and less umami.

AB  - Achieving hemostasis effectively is essential for surgical success and excellent patient outcomes. However, it is challenging to develop hemostatic adhesives that are fast-acting, strongly adherent, long-lasting, and biocompatible for treating hemorrhage. In this study, a sequential crosslinking fibrin glue (SCFG) is developed, of which the first network of the fibrin glue forms in situ within 2 s to act as an initial physical barrier and locks the gelatin methacryloyl precursor for tight construction of the second network to enhance wet adhesion and durability for tissues covered with blood. The sequential crosslinking glue can provide large pressures (approximate to 280 mmHg of burst pressure), makes strong (38 kPa of shear strength) and tough (approximate to 60 J m-2 of interfacial toughness) interfaces with wet tissues, and outperforms commercial hemostatic agents and gelatin methacryloyl. SCFG are demonstrated as an effective and safe sealant to enhance the treatment outcomes of bleeding tissues in rat, rabbit, and pig models. The ultrafast gelation, strong adhesion and durability, excellent compatibility, and easy manufacture of SCFG make it a promising hemostatic adhesive for clinical applications.

AB  - Calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) are known to modulate neuronal excitability and calcium signaling, and they may play a role in the imbalances of excitation and inhibition of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). While parvalbumin and calretinin are well-characterized CaBPs, N-Terminal EF-Hand Calcium-Binding Protein 1 (NECAB1) remains understudied in epilepsy, despite its association with neurodegenerative conditions. In this study, we used fluorescent immunolabeling to determine the distribution of NECAB1, as well as its co-expression with parvalbumin and calretinin, in brain regions associated with the epileptic circuitry using a kainic acid-induced TLE model. Additionally, we examined the impact of levetiracetam and brivaracetam on NECAB1 expression. In our study, NECAB1-positive cells were prominently localized to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), endopiriform nucleus (EPN), and amygdala in healthy brain regions involved in epileptic circuitry. A NECAB1-calretinin co-expressing subpopulation was detected in the amygdala, PVT, and hippocampus but was nearly absent in the EPN. In chronic epilepsy, NECAB1 expression was significantly upregulated in the PVT and bilaterally in the amygdala. These findings suggest that NECAB1 upregulation may compensate for epileptic hyperexcitability, potentially contributing to circuit remodeling via thalamocortical regulation and interneuron diversity. Levetiracetam and brivaracetam treatments partially reduced the NECAB1 density increase in TLE, indicating a modulatory effect on NECAB1 expression.

AB  - Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) is an epigenetic modulator and numerous studies have explored its impact on the central nervous system manifestations. However, little attention has been given to its potential contributions to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). To investigate the regulation of Mecp2 in the PNS on specific central regions, we generated Mecp2(fl/fl)Advillin(cre) mice with the sensory-neuron-specific deletion of the Mecp2 gene and found the mutant mice had a heightened sensitivity to temperature, which, however, did not affect the sense of motion, social behaviors, and anxiety-like behavior. Notably, in comparison to Mecp2(fl/fl) mice, Mecp2(fl/fl)Advillin(cre) mice exhibited improved learning and memory abilities. The levels of hippocampal synaptophysin and PSD95 proteins were higher in Mecp2(fl/fl)Advillin(cre) mice than in Mecp2(fl/fl) mice. Golgi staining revealed a significant increase in total spine density, and dendritic arborization in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons of Mecp2(fl/fl)Advillin(cre) mice compared to Mecp2(fl/fl) mice. In addition, the activation of the BDNF-TrkB-CREB1 pathway was observed in the hippocampus and spinal cord of Mecp2(fl/fl)Advillin(cre) mice. Intriguingly, the hippocampal BDNF/CREB1 signaling pathway in mutant mice was initiated within 5 days after birth. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the BDNF-TrkB-CREB1 signaling pathway and peripheral somasensory neurons to treat learning and cognitive deficits associated with Mecp2 disorders.

AB  - Background The formation and domestication of ornamental traits are influenced by various aspects, such as the recognition of esthetic values and cultural traditions. Camellia japonica is widely appreciated and domesticated around the world mainly due to its rich variations in ornamental traits. Ornamental camellias have a diverse range of resources, including different bud variations from Camellia spp. as well as inter- and intra- specific hybridization. Despite research on the formation of ornamental traits, a basic understanding of their genetics and genomics is still lacking. Results Here, we report the chromosomal-level reference genome of C. japonica through combining multiple DNA-sequencing technologies and obtain a high-density genetic linkage map of 4255 markers by sequencing 98 interspecific F-1 hybrids between C. japonica and C. chekiangoleosa. We identify two whole-genome duplication events in C. japonica: one is a shared ancient gamma event, and the other is revealed to be specific to genus Camellia. Based on the micro-collinearity analysis, we find large-scale segmental duplication of chromosome 8, resulting to two copies of the AGAMOUS loci, which may play a key role in the domestication of floral shapes. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of seasonal flowering, we have analyzed year-round gene expression patterns of C. japonica and C. azalea-a sister plant of continuous flowering that has been widely used for cross breeding. Through comparative analyses of gene co-expression networks and annual gene expression patterns, we show that annual expression rhythms of some important regulators of seasonal growth and development, including GIGANTEA and CONSTANS of the photoperiod pathway, have been disrupted in C. azalea. Furthermore, we reveal that the distinctive expression patterns of FLOWERING LOCUS T can be correlated with the seasonal activities of flowering and flushing. We demonstrate that the regulatory module involved in GIGANTEA, CONSTANS, and FLOWERING LOCUS T is central to achieve seasonality. Conclusions Through the genomic and comparative genomics characterizations of ornamental Camellia spp., we propose that duplication of chromosomal segments as well as the establishment of gene expression patterns has played a key role in the formation of ornamental traits (e.g., flower shape, flowering time). This work provides a valuable genomic platform for understanding the molecular basis of ornamental traits.

AB  - Carotenoids are diet-based micronutrients important in health and coloration signaling. Related species with similar diets can differ in the kinds and levels of circulating carotenoids, which suggests specific physiological mechanisms to efficiently utilize these micronutrients, regardless of their availability. We explored whether diet and parental provisioning of unusual sources of carotenoids (fresh vegetal matter and vertebrate feces) can explain the occurrence and concentrations of carotenoids in the cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus, griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, and Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus nestlings, even when these pigments appear to not be deposited in their integumentary system. A greater diversity of wild prey in diet could be behind the profile of higher concentrations of carotenoids in the Egyptian vulture, the species with carotenoid-dependent coloration during adulthood, while differences in diet composition between cinereous and griffon vultures do not translate to different carotenoid profiles. The carotenoid profile appears to not be related to the ingestion of unusual matter rich in these compounds, although the infrequent occurrence of lycopene and unidentified gamma-carotene-like compounds suggest that these vultures may be exploiting vegetal matter that left no identifiable unconsumed remains in the nest of Egyptian vultures. The consumption of green plant material by griffon vultures does not result in especially high levels of carotenoids when compared to the carotenoids found in cinereous vultures, which do not consume green plant material. Ungulate feces were not provisioned to Egyptian vulture nestlings, despite the fact they contain carotenoids that adults need for appropriate coloration. Overall, this study indicates that diet differences alone appear insufficient to explain contrasting interspecific carotenoid profiles, especially since all types of food consumed are considered to be poor in carotenoids, except vegetable matter. We suggest that nestling Egyptian vultures are comparatively efficient in uptaking carotenoids present in low concentrations in food when these compounds are not deposited in their integument, which suggests allocation to other functions.

AB  - The proposed mission to Mars will expose astronauts to space radiation that is known to adversely affect cognition and tasks that rely on fine sensorimotor function. Space radiation has also been shown to affect the microglial and neurogenic responses in the central nervous system (CNS). We recently reported that a low dose of 5 cGy 600 MeV/n Si-28 results in impaired cognition and skilled motor behavior in adult rats. Since these tasks rely at least in part on the proper functioning of the striatum, we examined striatal microglial cells in these same subjects. Using morphometric analysis, we found that Si-28 exposure increased activated microglial cells in the striatum. The majority of these striatal Iba1(+) microglia were ED1-, indicating that they were in an alternatively activated state, where microglia do not have phagocytic activity but may be releasing cytokines that could negatively impact neuronal function. In the other areas studied, Iba1(+) microglial cells were increased in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but not in the dentate gyrus (DG). Additionally, we examined the relationship between the microglial response and neurogenesis. An analysis of new neurons in the DG revealed an increase in doublecortin-positive (DCX+) hilar ectopic granule cells (hEGC) which correlated with Iba1(+) cells, suggesting that microglial cells contributed to this aberrant distribution which may adversely affect hippocampal function. Taken together, these results indicate that a single dose of Si-28 radiation results in persistent cellular effects in the CNS that may impact astronauts both in the short and long-term following deep space missions.

AB  - The circular economy of animal by-products rich in collagen focuses on converting collagen into peptides with a defined molecular weight. Collagen hydrolysates prepared by biotechnological methods from chicken gizzards, deer tendons, and Cyprinus carpio skeletons can be an alternative source of collagen for cosmetic products that traditionally use bovine or porcine collagen hydrolysates. Collagen hydrolysates were characterized by antioxidant activity, surface tension, solution contact angle, and other parameters (dry weight, ash content, and solution clarity). Furthermore, the vibrational characterization of functional groups and their molecular weight was performed using the GPC-RID method. Subsequently, emulsion and gel cosmetic matrices were prepared with 0.5% and 1.5% collagen hydrolysates. Microbiological stability, organoleptic properties, and viscosity were investigated. Verification of the biophysical parameters of the topical formulations was performed in vivo on a group of volunteers by measuring skin hydration and pH and determining trans-epidermal water loss. Fish collagen hydrolysate was the most suitable for cosmetic applications in the parameters investigated. Moreover, it also effectively reduces wrinkles in the periorbital region when used in a gel matrix.

AB  - Pre-weaned porcine islets (PPIs) represent an unlimited source for islet transplantation but are functionally immature. We previously showed that necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) immediately after islet isolation enhanced the in vitro development of PPIs. Here, we examined the impact of Nec-1 on the in vivo function of PPIs after transplantation in diabetic mice. PPIs were isolated from pancreata of 8-15-day-old, pre-weaned pigs and cultured in media alone, or supplemented with Nec-1 (100 mu M) on day 0 or on day 3 of culture (n = 5 for each group). On day 7, islet recovery, viability, oxygen consumption rate, insulin content, cellular composition, insulin secretion capacity, and transplant outcomes were evaluated. While islet viability and oxygen consumption rate remained high throughout 7-day tissue culture, Nec-1 supplementation on day 3 significantly improved islet recovery, insulin content, endocrine composition, GLUT2 expression, differentiation potential, proliferation capacity of endocrine cells, and insulin secretion. Adding Nec-1 on day 3 of tissue culture enhanced the islet recovery, proportion of delta cells, beta-cell differentiation and proliferation, and stimulation index. In vivo, this leads to shorter times to normoglycemia, better glycemic control, and higher circulating insulin. Our findings identify the novel time-dependent effects of Nec-1 supplementation on porcine islet quantity and quality prior to transplantation.

AB  - Epilepsy and stress are each significant concerns in today's society, bearing heavy impacts on mental and physical health and overall quality of life. Unfortunately, the intersection between these is potentially even more concerning, as stress is a frequent trigger of seizures and may contribute to neural hyperexcitability. A growing body of research suggests a connection between early life stress (occurring in the prenatal or postnatal stage) and later development of epilepsy. While the larger part of this literature suggests that early life stress increases vulnerability for epilepsy development, there are a number of interacting factors influencing this relationship. These factors include developmental stage at which both stressor and seizure assessment occur, type of stressor, sex effects, and type of seizure (convulsive or non-convulsive). Additionally, a number of potential mechanisms have been identified, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neuroinflammation, altered inhibitory/excitatory balance, and temporal lobe structures. Developing a clearer understanding of this relationship between early life stress and epilepsy, the factors that influence it, and underlying mechanisms that may serve as targets for intervention is crucial to improving quality of life for persons with epilepsy.

AB  - Adolescence is a period of biological, psychological and social changes, and the peak time for the emergence of mental health problems. During this life stage, brain plasticity including hippocampal neurogenesis is increased, which is crucial for cognitive functions and regulation of emotional responses. The hippocampus is especially susceptible to environmental and lifestyle influences, mediated by changes in physiological systems, resulting in enhanced brain plasticity but also an elevated risk for developing mental health problems. Indeed, adolescence is accompanied by increased activation of the maturing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sensitivity to meta-bolic changes due to increased nutritional needs and hormonal changes, and gut microbiota maturation. Importantly, dietary habits and levels of physical activity significantly impact these systems. In this review, the interactions between exercise and Western-style diets, which are high in fat and sugar, on adolescent stress susceptibility, metabolism and the gut microbiota are explored. We provide an overview of current knowledge on implications of these interactions for hippocampal function and adolescent mental health, and speculate on potential mechanisms which require further investigation.

AB  - This study examined the impact of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) on executive function using a series of operant conditioning-based tasks in rats. Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to either non-diabetic (n = 12; 6 male) or diabetic (n = 14; 6 male) groups. Diabetes was induced using multiple low-dose streptozotocin injections. All diabetic rodents were insulin-treated using subcutaneous insulin pellet implants (9-15 mM). At week 14 of the study, rats were placed on a food restricted diet to induce 5-10 % weight loss. Rodents were familiarized and their set-shifting ability was tested on a series of tasks that required continuous adjustments to novel stimulus-reward paradigms in order to receive food rewards. Results showed no differences in the number of trials, nor number and type of errors made to successfully complete each task between groups. Therefore, we report no differences in executive function, or more specifically set-shifting abilities between non-diabetic and diabetic rodents that receive insulin.

AB  - Individuals diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) often display behavioral impairments in executive functioning (EF). Specifically, the domains of working memory, inhibition, and set shifting are frequently impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure. Coordination between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus appear to be essential for these domains of executive functioning. The current study uses a rodent model of human third-trimester binge drinking to identify the extent of persistent executive functioning deficits following developmental alcohol by using a behavioral battery of hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-dependent behavioral assays in adulthood. Alcohol added to milk formula was administered to Long Evans rat pups on postnatal days 4?9 (5.25 g/kg/day of ethanol; intragastric intubation), a period when rodent brain development undergoes comparable processes to human third-trimester neurodevelopment. Procedural control animals underwent sham intubation, without administration of any liquids (i.e., alcohol, milk solution). In adulthood, male rats were run on a battery of behavioral assays: novel object recognition, object-in-place associative memory, spontaneous alternation, and behavioral flexibility tasks. Alcohol-exposed rats demonstrated behavioral impairment in objectin-place preference and performed worse when the rule was switched on a plus maze task. All rats showed similar levels of novel object recognition, spontaneous alternation, discrimination learning, and reversal learning, suggesting alcohol-induced behavioral alterations are selective to executive functioning domains of spatial working memory and set-shifting in this widely-utilized rodent model. These specific behavioral alterations support the hypothesis that behavioral impairments in EF following prenatal alcohol exposure are caused by distributed damage to the prefrontal-thalamo-hippocampal circuit consisting of the medial prefrontal cortex, thalamic nucleus reuniens, and CA1 of hippocampus.

AB  - Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is a promising pharmacological strategy for the treatment of cerebral ischemic conditions. To increase the relevance and increase the translational value of preclinical studies, it is important to conduct experiments using different animal species and strains, different animal models, and to evaluate long-term functional outcomes after cerebral ischemia. In the present study, the effects of the selective PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Balb/c mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and tested during 21 days in multiple behavioral tasks to investigate the long-term effects of roflumilast on functional recovery. The effects of roflumilast were also investigated on hippocampal cell loss, white matter injury, and expression of neuroinflammatory markers. Roflumilast prevented cognitive and emotional deficits induced by BCCAO in mice. Roflumilast also prevented neurodegeneration and reduced the white matter damage in the brain of ischemic animals. Besides, roflumilast decreased Iba-1 (microglia marker) levels and increased Arginase-1 (Arg-1; microglia M2 phenotype marker) levels in the hippocampus of these mice. Likewise, roflumilast suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (microglia M1 phenotype marker) expression and increased Arg-1 levels in a primary mouse microglia culture. These findings support evidence that PDE4 inhibition by roflumilast might be beneficial in cerebral ischemic conditions. The neuroprotective effects of roflumilast appear to be mediated by a decrease in neuroinflammation.

AB  - Basal-like breast cancers exhibit distinct cellular heterogeneity that contributes to disease pathology. In this study we used a genetic mouse model of basal-like breast cancer driven by epithelial-specific inactivation of the Hippo pathway-regulating LATS1 and LATS2 kinases to elucidate epithelial-stromal interactions. We demonstrate that basal-like carcinoma initiation in this model is accompanied by the accumulation of distinct cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophages and dramatic extracellular matrix remodeling, phenocopying the stromal diversity observed in human triple-negative breast tumors. Dysregulated epithelial-stromal signals were observed, including those mediated by TGF-beta, PDGF, and CSF. Autonomous activation of the transcriptional effector TAZ was observed in LATS1/2-deleted cells along with non-autonomous activation within the evolving tumor niche. We further show that inhibition of the YAP/TAZ-associated TEAD family of transcription factors blocks the development of the carcinomas and associated microenvironment. These observations demonstrate that carcinomas resulting from Hippo pathway dysregulation in the mammary epithelium are sufficient to drive cellular events that promote a basal-like tumor-associated niche and suggest that targeting dysregulated YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity may offer a therapeutic opportunity for basal-like mammary tumors.

AB  - Propofol has shown strong addictive properties in rats and humans. Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) modulate dopamine signal and addictive behaviors such as cocaine- and amphetamine-induced self-administration. However, whether A2AR can modulate propofol addiction remains unknown. AAV-shA2AR was intra-NAc injected 3 weeks before the propofol self-administration training to test the impacts of NAc A2AR on establishing the self-administration model with fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule. Thereafter, the rats were withdrawal from propofol for 14 days and tested cue-induced reinstatement of propofol seeking behavior on day 15. The propofol withdrawal rats received one of the doses of CGS21680 (A2AR agonist, 2.5-10.0 ng/site), MSX-3 (A2AR antagonist, 5.0-20.0 mu g/site) or eticlopride (D2 receptor (D2R) antagonist, 0.75-3.0 mu g/site) or vehicle via intra-NAc injection before relapse behavior test. The numbers of active and inactive nose-poke response were recorded. Focal knockdown A2AR by shA2AR did not affect the acquisition of propofol self-administration behavior, but enhance cue-induced reinstatement of propofol self-administration compared with the AAV-shCTRLgroup. Pharmacological activation of the A2AR by CGS21680 (>= 5.0 ng/site) attenuated cue-induced reinstatement of propofol self-administration behavior. Similarly, pharmacological blockade of D2R by eticlopride (0.75-3.0 mu g/site) attenuated propofol seeking behavior. These effects were reversed by the administration of MSX-3 (5.0-20.0 mu g/site). The A2AR- and D2R-mediated effects on propofol relapse were not confounded by the learning process, and motor activity as the sucrose self-administration and locomotor activity were not affected by all the treatments. This study provides genetic and pharmacological evidence that NAc A2AR activation suppresses cue-induced propofol relapse in rats, possibly by interacting with D2R.

AB  - This study aimed to develop an ensemble Machine learning (ML) model based on K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Regression Tree (RT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the prediction of body weight (BW) of chickens from their morphometric traits. The data of 100 Ross 308 broiler chickens (50 female and 50 male) from day 1 to 29 were used for predicting the BW of chickens using various body measurements such as body girth, body length, keel length, wing length and shank length. The data were randomly partitioned into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets and 10-fold cross-validation was employed to check the stability of the model. The predictive performance of the proposed ensemble method was evaluated and compared with individual ML models using evaluation criteria of adjusted coefficient of determination (AdjR(2)), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The proposed ensemble model outperformed all other ML methods used in the study, having very high predictive accuracy with AdjR(2) (0.999, 0.999), RMSE (3.222, 5.465), MAE (2.332, 3.913) and MAPE (0.941, 2.029) values for training and testing datasets, respectively. The results of the study revealed that the proposed ensemble model may help researchers and practitioners to accurately predict the BW of chickens from body measurements.

AB  - Classical swine fever (CSF) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are highly contagious viral diseases that pose a significant threat to piglets and cause substantial economic losses in the global swine industry. Therefore, the development of a bivalent vaccine capable of targeting both CSF and PED simultaneously is crucial. In this study, we genetically engineered a recombinant classical swine fever virus (rCSFV) expressing the antigenic domains of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) based on the modified infectious cDNA clone of the vaccine strain C-strain. The S1N and COE domains of PEDV were inserted into C-strain cDNA clone harboring the mutated 136th residue of N-pro and substituted 3 & PRIME;UTR to generate the recombinant chimeric virus vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-S1NCOE. To improve the efficacy of the vaccine, we introduced the tissue plasminogen activator signal (tPAs) and CARD domain of the signaling molecule VISA into vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-S1NCOE to obtain vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-tPAsS1NCOE and vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-CARD/tPAsS1NCOE, respectively. We characterized three vaccine candidates in vitro and investigated their immune responses in rabbits and pigs. The N-D136N(pro) mutant exhibited normal autoprotease activity and mitigated the inhibition of IFN-& beta; induction. The introduction of tPAs and the CARD domain led to the secretory expression of the S1NCOE protein and upregulated IFN-& beta; induction in infected cells. Immunization with recombinant CSFVs expressing secretory S1NCOE resulted in a significantly increased in PEDV-specific antibody production, and coexpression of the CARD domain of VISA upregulated the PEDV-specific IFN-& gamma; level in the serum of vaccinated animals. Notably, vaccination with vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-CARD/tPAsS1NCOE conferred protection against virulent CSFV and PEDV challenge in pigs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the engineered vC/SM3 & PRIME;UTRN-CARD/tPAsS1NCOE is a promising bivalent vaccine candidate against both CSFV and PEDV infections.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) can result in neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, A beta production, neuroinflammation, and ultimately cognitive deterioration. WuYou Decoction (WYD), a contemporary prescription, has shown promise in enhancing sleep quality and cognitive performance in individuals with insomnia. However, the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective effects of WYD on CSD remain incompletely understood. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of WYD on the CSD model and its molecular mechanism. Materials and methods: UHPLC-MS/MS analysis was utilized to analyze the active ingredients of WYD extract. The study employed the multi-platform water environment method to establish the CSD model in rats. Subsequent to treatment with varying doses of WYD in CSD rats, cognitive function and pathological alterations in hippocampus and cortex, including neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, A beta production, and neuroinflammation, were evaluated through a combination of Morris Water Maze test, HE staining, Nissl staining, Golgi-Cox staining, Transmission electron microscope, ELISA, Immunohistochemistry staining, Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Results: UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed a total of 99 active ingredients were identified from the WYD extract. The administration of WYD exhibited a mitigation of cognitive decline in the model of CSD, as evidenced by increased neuron count in the hippocampus and cortex, and improved density and length of dendritic spines in these brain regions. Furthermore, WYD was found to suppress the A beta production, and inhibit the expression of BACE1, PS1, GFAP, IBA1, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, phosphorylated I kappa B alpha (Ser32) and phosphorylated NF-kappa B p65 (Ser536) in the hippocampus and cortex, while also increasing the levels of PSD95, SYN1, ADAM10, IDE, SIRT1 and Nrf2. Conclusions: WYD exhibits neuroprotective properties in CSD, potentially through modulation of the A beta-related enzymes and SIRT1/Nrf2/NF-kappa B pathway.

AB  - T-2 toxin, a mycotoxin found in foods and feeds, poses a threat to female reproductive health in both humans and animals. LncRNA CUFF.253988.1 (CUFF.253988.1), highly expressed in pigs, has an undisclosed regulatory role. This study aimed to establish a model of T-2 toxin-induced ovarian injury in sows, both in vivo and in vitro, and to explore the regulatory role and potential mechanisms of CUFF.253988.1. The results showed that feeding T-2 toxin-contaminated feed (1 mg/kg) induced ovarian follicle atresia and mitochondrial structural damage, accompanied by a significant upregulation of CUFF.253988.1 expression in the ovaries. Additionally, T-2 toxin inhibited the SIRT3/PGC1-alpha pathway associated with mitochondrial function. Moreover, T-2 toxin induced cell apoptosis by upregulating the expression of Cyt c , Bax, cleaved-caspase-9, and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins. In T-2 toxin-induced injury to the ovarian granulosa AVG-16 cells at concentrations of 10, 40 and 160 nM, not only were the previously mentioned effects observed, but also a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, and an elevation in ROS levels. However, downregulating CUFF.253988.1 reversed T-2 toxin's inhibition of the SIRT3/PGC1-alpha pathway, alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing cell apoptosis. Notably, this may be attributed to the inhibition of T-2 toxin-induced enrichment of CUFF.253988.1 in mitochondria. In conclusion, CUFF.253988.1 plays a pivotal role in T-2 toxin-induced ovarian damage, operating through the inhibition of the SIRT3/PGC1-alpha pathway and promotion of cell apoptosis.

TI  - Antler stem cell exosomes alleviate pulmonary fibrosis via inhibiting recruitment of monocyte macrophage, rather than polarization of M2 macrophages in mice
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY

KW  - REGENERATION
KW  - PATHWAY
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a chronic interstitial lung disease, is characterized by over-abundant deposition of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of collagen I. In previous studies, we demonstrated that deer antler stem cells (AnSCs), a novel type of adult stem cell, are capable of significantly down-regulating collagen formation in different organs and tissues and speculated that they could effectively treat PF via reducing collagen deposition in the lung tissue. In the present study, we found that administration of AnSCs improved the survival rate of PF mice and reduced lung fibrosis, collagen deposition and myofibroblast differentiation. The effects of AnSC treatment were significantly better than the positive control (adipose-derived stem cells). Interestingly, AnSC-Exos were almost equally effective as AnSCs in treating PF, suggesting that the effects of AnSCs on reduction of PF may be mainly through a paracrine mechanism. Further, AnSC-Exos reduced the number of M2 macrophages, a type of macrophage that secrets pro-fibrotic factors to accelerate fibrotic progression, in the lung tissues. In vitro experiments showed that the effects of AnSC-Exos on macrophage modulation were likely achieved via inhibition of the recruitment of circulating monocyte-derived macrophages (reducing the number of macrophages), rather than via inhibition of M2 polarization of macrophages. Inhibition of macrophage recruitment by AnSCs may be achieved indirectly via inhibiting CCL7 expression in fibroblasts; both let-7b and let-7a were highly enriched in AnSC-Exos and may play a critical role in the inhibition of CCL7 expression of fibroblasts. Collectively, the use of antler stem cells or their exosomes opens up a novel strategy for PF treatment in the clinical setting.

AB  - Corn oil, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are widely used as solvents or suspensions in animal experiments, but the effects of prenatal exposure to them on fetal development have not been reported. In this study, Kunming mice were given a conventional dose of corn oil (9.2 g/kg center dot d), CMC-Na (0.05 g/kg center dot d) or DMSO (0.088 g/kg center dot d) during gestation days 10-18, and the pregnancy outcome, fetal phys-ical development, serum phenotype, and multi-organ function changes were observed. The results showed that corn oil decreased serum triglyceride level in males but increased their serum testosterone and CORT levels, and affected female placenta and female/male multi-organ functions (mainly bone, liver, kidney). CMC-Na increased female/male body lengths and tail lengths, decreased serum glucose and total cholesterol levels in males as well as increased their serum LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and testosterone level, decreased female serum bile acid level, and affected male/female placenta and multi-organ functions (mainly bone, liver, hippocampus). DMSO decreased male body weight and serum glucose level, decreased male/female serum bile acid levels, and affected male/ female placenta and multi-organs functions (mainly bone, hippocampus, adrenal gland). In conclusion, prenatal exposure to a conventional dose of corn oil, CMC-Na or DMSO could affect fetal physical development and multi-organ functions, and has the characteristics of "multi-pathway, multi-organ and multi-target". This study provides the experimental basis for the rational selection of solvents or suspensions in pharmacology and toxicology studies.

AB  - Hippocampal subfield CA3 is thought to stably store memories in assemblies of recurrently connected cells functioning as a collective. However, the collective hippocampal coding properties that are unique to CA3 and how such properties facilitate the stability or precision of the neural code remain unclear. Here, we per-formed large-scale Ca2+ imaging in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 of freely behaving mice that repeatedly explored the same, initially novel environments over weeks. CA3 place cells have more precise and more stable tuning and show a higher statistical dependence with their peers compared with CA1 place cells, uncovering a cell assembly organization in CA3. Surprisingly, although tuning precision and long-term stability are correlated, cells with stronger peer dependence exhibit higher stability but not higher precision. Overall, our results expose the three-way relationship between tuning precision, long-term stability, and peer dependence, suggesting that a cell assembly organization underlies long-term storage of information in the hippocampus.

AB  - Louse flies live among the fur and feathers of their hosts. The pulvillae, covered with rows of bristle-like formations ending in bilobed hooks is one of the elements of tarsus in louse flies. Hooks provide the mechanical attachment of the individual. The study of peculiarities of hook attachment to the down feathers of the host birds has not revealed obvious species specificity. Hooks can be attached with their outer and inner surface. Depending on the shape and location of hooks, more universal hooks (pulville morphotype 1) can attach both to basal cells of rays and the rest of rays of downy pinnula, while more specialized hooks (pulville morphotypes 3, 4) can attach only to the rest of rays. The rest of rays are more preferred for hook attachment than basal cells. The results obtained contribute to the study of the common patterns of the attachment mechanism and the morphological structures responsible for this process, which is similar in both invertebrates and some vertebrates.

AB  - The inspection and quantification of minor defects for subsea pipelines is an important topic for ensuring structural stability and safety. This study proposes an in-line inspection and characterization model for the subsea pipeline cracks based on spatial magnetic signals extraction technology and machine learning algorithms. First, the crack inspection mechanism is elaborated by the magnetic domain deflection from the micro level, and the effect of the crack width, depth, and lift-off on the signal features are evaluated by numerical simulations. Second, a custom-built experimental system adopted to scan the tiny cracks is incorporated to validate the reliability of the simulation results. Finally, 11 statistic features are extracted from the time series signals and defined as the input of the regression models based on various machine learning algorithms to realize the quantitative characterization of the crack dimensions. Consequently, the probes manufactured in this research can accurately identify cracks with a minimum width of 0.3 mm. Moreover, the random forest algorithm achieves state-of-the-art inversion performance with mean errors of the prediction accuracy to the crack width, depth, and lift-off at 0.102 mm, 0.040 mm, and 0.004 mm, respectively.

AB  - Cardiac glycosides are a large class of secondary metabolites found in plants. In the genus Asclepias, cardenolides in milkweed plants have an established role in plant-herbivore and predator-prey interactions, based on their ability to inhibit the membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme. Milkweed seeds are eaten by specialist lygaeid bugs, which are the most cardenolide-tolerant insects known. These insects likely impose natural selection for the repeated derivatisation of cardenolides. A first step in investigating this hypothesis is to conduct a phytochemical profiling of the cardenolides in the seeds. Here, we report the concentrations of 10 purified cardenolides from the seeds of Asclepias curassavica. We report the structures of new compounds: 3-O-beta-allopyranosyl coroglaucigenin (1), 3-[4 '-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-beta-allopyranosyl] coroglaucigenin (2), 3 '-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-15-beta-hydroxycalotropin (3), and 3-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-12-beta-hydroxyl coroglaucigenin (4), as well as six previously reported cardenolides (5-10). We test the in vitro inhibition of these compounds on the sensitive porcine Na+/K+-ATPase. The least inhibitory compound was also the most abundant in the seeds-4 '-O-beta-glucopyranosyl frugoside (5). Gofruside (9) was the most inhibitory. We found no direct correlation between the number of glycosides/sugar moieties in a cardenolide and its inhibitory effect. Our results enhance the literature on cardenolide diversity and concentration among tissues eaten by insects and provide an opportunity to uncover potential evolutionary relationships between tissue-specific defense expression and insect adaptations in plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Although the hippocampus is one of the most-studied brain regions in mammals, research on the avian hippo-campus has been more limited in scope. It is generally agreed that the hippocampus is an ancient feature of the amniote brain, and therefore homologous between the two lineages. Because birds and mammals are evolutionarily not very closely related, any shared anatomy is likely to be crucial for shared functions of their hippocampi. These functions, in turn, are likely to be essential if they have been conserved for over 300 million years. Therefore, research on the avian hippocampus can help us understand how this brain region evolved and how it has changed over evolutionary time. Further, there is a strong research foundation in birds on hippocampal-supported behaviors such as spatial navigation, food caching, and brood parasitism that scientists can build upon to better understand how hippocampal anatomy, network circuitry, endocrinology, and physiology can help control these behaviors. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the avian hippocampus in spatial cognition as well as in regulating anxiety, approach-avoidance behavior, and stress responses. Although there are still some questions about the exact number of subdivisions in the avian hippo-campus and how that might vary in different avian families, there is intriguing evidence that the avian hippocampus might have complementary functional profiles along the rostral-caudal axis similar to the dorsal -ventral axis of the rodent hippocampus, where the rostral/dorsal hippocampus is more involved in cognitive processes like spatial learning and the caudal/ventral hippocampus regulates emotional states, anxiety, and the stress response. Future research should focus on elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms - including endocrinological -in the avian hippocampus that underlie behaviors such as spatial navigation, spatial memory, and anxiety-related behaviors, and in so doing, resolve outstanding questions about avian hippocampal function and organization.

AB  - Sacoglossa is a monophyletic group of small suctorial herbivorous & Ncy;eterobranchia. Due to the biology of feeding, most sacoglossans (except Cylindrobulla) have a distinctive feeding apparatus, which includes a sucking muscular organ as well as a sacoglossan-type radula with one tooth in a transverse row, which pierces algal cells. Although there is obvious interest in the radular morphology and developmental modes of Sacoglossa, as these characters may provide some insight into the evolutionary history and phylogenetic relationships of Sacoglossa, data on radula formation and morphogenesis in this group are sparse. This paper presents original data on the direct development, formation, and morphogenesis of the radula of Limapontia senestra (Quatrefages, 1844) from the White Sea. Based on the data obtained, we describe the development and formation of the radula. They fit into the general pattern of heterochrony in the radula anlage, characteristic of all gastropods. The small number of odontoblasts in the formation of the adult radula of L. senestra is a distinctive feature of the radula of Heterobranchia.

AB  - Accumulating evidence has shown that inflammation, the gut microbiota, and neurotransmitters are closely associated with the pathophysiology of depression. However, the links between the gut microbiota and neurotransmitter metabolism remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroinflammatory reactions in chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depression and to delineate the potential links between the gut microbiota and neurotransmitter metabolism. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to chronic restraint stress for 5 weeks, followed by behavioural tests (the sucrose preference test, forced swim test, open field test, and elevated plus maze) and analysis. The results showed that CRS significantly increased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) levels and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, accompanied by the activation of IkappaB-alpha-phosphorylation-nuclear factor kappa-B (I kappa B alpha-p-NF-kappa B) signalling in the mouse hippocampus. In addition, the neurotransmitter metabolomics results showed that CRS resulted in decreased levels of plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and noradrenaline (NE) and their corresponding metabolites, and gut microbiota faecal metabolites with the 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that CRS caused marked microbiota dysbiosis in mice, with a significant increase in Helicobacter, Lactobacillus, and Oscillibacter and a decrease in Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Prevotella. Notably, CRS-induced depressive behaviours and the disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolism and microbiota dysbiosis can be substantially restored by dexamethasone (DXMS) administration. Furthermore, a Pearson heatmap focusing on correlations between the microbiota, behaviours, and neurotransmitters showed that Helicobacter, Lactobacillus, and Oscillibacter were positively correlated with depressive behaviours but were negatively correlated with neurotransmitter metabolism, and Parabacteroides and Ruminococcus were negatively correlated with depressive behaviours but were positively correlated with neurotransmitter metabolism. Taken together, the results suggest that inflammation is involved in microbiota dysbiosis and the disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolism in CRS-induced depressive changes, and the delineation of the potential links between the microbiota and neurotransmitter metabolism will provide novel strategies for depression treatment.

AB  - Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) contains various physiologically active substances, including vitamins, polyphenols, flavonoids, phytosterols, and saponins. Research showed that saponins were the protective substances in the outer layer of quinoa seeds to defend against microbes, herbivores, and insects. Because the aglycones of quinoa saponins are triterpenoids, they are called triterpenoid saponins (TSs). In addition, the presence of TS imparted bitterness in quinoa and resulted in anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the seeds of low-saponin quinoa, NT376-2 (N), and high-saponin quinoa, B-12071(B), at 30 and 60 days after flowering (DAF) were used to measure the TS content and evaluated for their transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles. The amounts of TS were found to significantly differ between all possible comparisons: N and B at 30 DAF (N1_vs_B1), N and B at 60 DAF (N2_vs_B2), N at 30 DAF and 60 DAF (N1_vs_N2), and B at 30 DAF and 60 DAF (B1_vs_B2). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and revealed 14,703 upregulated DEGs and 26,267 downregulated DEGs in the four comparison groups. The 311 overlapping DEGs found in the four comparisons were used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses to screen for DEGs related to TS biosynthesis in quinoa. Metabolomics analysis identified acetyl-CoA, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl-4-diphosphate, farnesal, and (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene as the key differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). Transcriptomics-metabolomics joint analysis showed that triterpenoid biosynthesis and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were the enriched pathways of TS biosynthesis; farnesal were the key DAMs shared in the four comparison groups and associated with 10 key candidate DEGs related to TS biosynthesis in quinoa. These results provided important references for in-depth research on the metabolic mechanism of TS in quinoa.

AB  - The claustrum complex is viewed as fundamental for higher-order cognition; however, the circuit organization and function of its neuroanatomical subregions are not well understood. We demonstrated that some of the key roles of the CLA complex can be attributed to the connectivity and function of a small group of neurons in its ventral subregion, the endopiriform (EN). We identified a subpopulation of EN neurons by their projection to the ventral CA1 (ENvCA1-proj. neurons), embedded in recurrent circuits with other EN neurons and the piriform cortex. Although the ENvCA1-proj. neuron activity was biased toward novelty across stimulus categories, their chemogenetic inhibition selectively disrupted the memory-guided but not innate responses of mice to novelty. Based on our functional connectivity analysis, we suggest that ENvCA1-proj. neurons serve as an essential node for recognition memory through recurrent circuits mediating sustained attention to novelty, and through feed-forward inhibition of distal vCA1 neurons shifting memory-guided behavior from familiarity to novelty.

AB  - A characterization of the sound absorption of a sustainable material with scarce current use such as natural virgin cork is presented in this paper in order to explore further possible applications in the design of acoustic solutions. Different samples of virgin cork not bonded and various decorative panel formats were tested under random sound incidence conditions in a standardized reverberation chamber. The samples in which the outer bark of the cork was facing upwards showed a better behavior as an acoustic absorber, with sound absorption coefficient values generally greater than 0.6 for frequency bands between 1 and 5 kHz. The results obtained were compared with samples of some recycled materials available in the scientific literature, such as sheep wool and PET.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is the macronutrients essential for the development and growth of plants, but how external inorganic phosphate (Pi) level and signaling affect tea plant growth and characteristic secondary metabolite biosynthesis are not understood. Theanine is major secondary metabolites, and its contents largely determine tea favor and nutrition qualities. Here, we found theanine contents in tea leaves and roots declined as Pi concentration increased in tea plants after Pi feeding. The transcriptome analysis of global gene expression in tea leaves under Pi feeding suggested a wide range of genes involved in Pi/N transport and responses were altered. Among them, CsSPX3 and CsPHL7 transcript levels in response to Pi feeding to tea plants, their expression patterns were generally opposite to these of major theanine biosynthesis genes, indicating possible regulatory correlations. Biochemical analyses showed that CsSPX3 interacted with CsPHL7, and CsPHL7 negatively regulated theanine biosynthesis genes CsGS1 and CsTS1. Meanwhile, VIGS and transient overexpression systems in tea plants verified the functions of CsSPX3 and CsPHL7 in mediating Pi-feeding-repressed theanine biosynthesis. This study offers fresh insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying Pi repression of theanine biosynthesis, and the CsSPX3-CsPHL7-CsGS1/CsTS1 module plays a role in high Pi inhibition of theanine production in tea leaves. It has an instructional significance for guiding the high-quality tea production in tea garden fertilization.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental endocrine disrupting chemical, is one of the most widely used chemicals in the world and is widely distributed in the external environment, specifically in food, water, dust, and soil. BPA exposure is associated with abnormal cognitive behaviors. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats were orally exposed to BPA at a low dose of 0, 0.04, 0.4, or 4 mg per kg<middle dot>of body weight per day from embryonic Day 0 (ED 0) to postnatal Day 21 (PND 21). Spatial learning and memory were measured via a Morris water maze test on PND 22. PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway protein expression was detected in the hippocampi of male offspring using a western blot. The water maze test demonstrated that BPA exposure considerably reduced the learning and memory capacities of the male offspring exposure groups when compared to the control group. The male offspring rats' latency to escape increased significantly, the time taken to traverse a platform reduced, and latency to find a hidden platform showed an increasing trend. Meanwhile, maternal exposure to BPA downregulated the expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in the hippocampi of the offspring. Moreover, BPA exposure improved the GSK3 beta and phosphorylated tau protein (T231) levels, increased malondialdehyde levels, and activated caspase-3 expression in the hippocampi of the male offspring rats. Taken together, these findings indicate that maternal exposure to BPA causes learning and memory impairment and that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway participates in the mechanism of BPA-induced neurocognitive decline.

AB  - Simple Summary Tryptophan plays an important role in the pig industry but has the potential to improve performance in the poultry industry. However, the effects of tryptophan in a diet of different protein levels remain poorly understood. This study assessed the effect of tryptophan supplementation in diets with different protein levels on the growth performance and serum glycolipid metabolism-related parameters of broilers. A medium-protein diet with more tryptophan can improve male broiler performance; a low-protein diet with more tryptophan may temporarily reduce the feed intake of female broilers in the early stage of the experiment.Abstract Tryptophan plays an important role in the pig industry but has the potential to improve performance in the poultry industry. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of tryptophan supplementation in diets with different protein levels on the feed intake, average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (F/G) of broilers. A total of 180 twenty-one-day-old broilers (half male and half female) were weighed and randomly allocated to twelve groups, with six male and six female groups. Each group consisted of 15 broilers. The broilers were fed low- (17.2%), medium- (19.2%), or high- (21.2%) protein diets with or without extra tryptophan (up to 0.25%) during the 28-day experiment. Food intake and body weight were measured weekly during the trial period. Male broilers fed a medium-protein diet containing more tryptophan showed a lower F/G. In the low-protein diet groups, additional tryptophan caused a significant reduction in the feed intake of female broilers during the first two weeks. Moreover, the serum GLP-1, cholesterol, and bile acid levels, as well as the expression of FXR mRNA in the ileum, were significantly increased. Additionally, the FXR mRNA in the hypothalamus and the GCG and GLP-1R mRNAs in the ileum tended to increase in these broilers. In summary, the tryptophan concentration in the diet can influence the feed intake and metabolism of broilers. Under a standard diet, an appropriate amount of tryptophan is beneficial to the F/G of male broilers, while under a low-protein diet, tryptophan supplementation may cause a short-term reduction in the feed intake of female broilers by increasing serum GLP-1 and bile acid signals.

AB  - In recent years, the co-processing of agricultural and rural domestic waste for composting has emerged as a primary approach to promote resource recycling. However, the presence of antibiotics and other harmful chemicals in the raw materials can induce the generation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the composting process, thereby triggering multiple potential risks, including environmental and ecological risks and human health risks. Currently, the production patterns of ARGs in the co-processing of multiple raw materials remain unclear, and research on reduction technologies is also inadequate. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a multi-material ratio scheme for achieving high compost maturity and effective ARG reduction. Aerobic composting experiments used varying ratios of four agricultural and rural organic wastes with a simple centroid design. The results demonstrated that special cubic response models for E4/E6 and the total reduction rates of four ARG types were successfully fitted. The optimal ratios were 40.5 % kitchen waste, 11.5 % pig manure, 28 % human feces, and 20 % wheat straw. Under these optimal conditions, the total reduction rates of ARGs increased by 0.31 %-19.64 %. These findings provide valuable theoretical support for enhancing ARG removal through mixed composting.

AB  - The stress-induced alterations in cognitive processes and psychiatric disorders can be accelerated when acute stressors challenge the hippocampal functions. To address this issue, we used Western Blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry assays to investigate the impact of acute forced swimming (FS) on the expression of the CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) in the hippocampus (HC) of the male outbred Roman High- (RHA) and LowAvoidance (RLA) rat lines, one of the most validated genetic models for the study of behavior related to fear/ anxiety and stress-induced depression. The distinct responses to FS confirmed the different behavioral strategies displayed by the two phenotypes when exposed to stressors, with RLA and RHA rats displaying reactive vs. proactive coping, respectively. In control rats, the WB analysis showed lower hippocampal CB1R relative levels in RLA rats than in their RHA counterparts. After FS, RLA rats showed increased CB1R levels in the dorsal HC (dHC) vs. no change in the ventral HC (vHC), while RHA rats displayed no change in the dHC vs. a decrease in the vHC. In the tissue sections from dHC, FS elicited an increment over the control level of CB1R-like immunoreactivity (LI) in the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the Ammon's horn of RLA rats, while in RHA rats the density of CB1R-LI increased only in the CA1 sector. In tissue sections from the vHC, FS caused an increase over the control values of CB1R-LI only in the CA1 sector of RLA rats and a decrement of the CB1R-LI in the CA1 sector and dentate gyrus of control RHA rats. This study shows for the first time that, in baseline conditions, the CB1Rs are present in the dHC and the vHC of the Roman rat lines with a different distribution along the septo-temporal extension of the HC and that the FS induces rapid and distinct changes in the hippocampal expression of CB1R of RLA vs. RLA rats, in keeping with the view that endocannabinoid signaling may contribute to the molecular mechanisms that regulate the different responses of the dHC vs. the vHC to aversive situations in male Roman rats. Our results also provide evidence supporting the involvement of CB1R in the molecular underpinnings of the susceptibility of RLA rats and the resistance of RHA rats to stress-induced depression-like behavior.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), marked by cognitive impairment, predominantly affects the brain regions regulated by cholinergic innervation, such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Cholinergic dysfunction, a key contributor to age-related cognitive decline, has spurred investigations into potential therapeutic interventions. We have previously shown that choline alphoscerate (alpha-GPC), a cholinergic neurotransmission-enhancing agent, protects from A beta-mediated neurotoxicity. Herein, we investigated the effects of alpha-GPC on the microglial phenotype in response to A beta via modulation of the nicotinic alpha-7 acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7 nAChR). BV2 microglial cells were pre-treated for 1 h with alpha-GPC and were treated for 24, 48, and 72 h with A beta 1-42 and/or alpha-BTX, a selective alpha 7nAchR antagonist. Fluorescent immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis showed that alpha-GPC was able to antagonize A beta-induced inflammatory effects. Of note, alpha-GPC exerted its anti-inflammatory effect by directly activating the alpha 7nAChR receptor, as suggested by the induction of an increase in [Ca2+]i and Ach-like currents. Considering that cholinergic transmission appears crucial in regulating the inflammatory profiles of glial cells, its modulation emerges as a potential pharmaco-therapeutic target to improve outcomes in inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD.

AB  - Pharmaceutical plants contain several phytochemicals that are sources of myriad biological activities. These biological activities can be explored in multiple fields for the benefit of mankind. Pharmaceutical plants with high ethnobotanical indices (i.e., use value and relative frequency of citation) were reported with the potential to inhibit lettuce elongation through leachates and volatiles. The focus of the study was to assess Chinese pharmaceutical plants for both antioxidants, as well as allelopathic potentials to explore any underlying relationship. The estimation of antioxidative capacity and content of total phenolics (TPC) for the 55 Chinese pharmaceutical plants was conducted by the assays of DPPH radical scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and the means of Folin-Ciocalteu. The estimation of the activity of allelopathy for collected medicinal plants was done by adopting the sandwich method for plant leachates and the dishpack method for volatile constituents, respectively. The fruits of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) had the most remarkable ORAC value (168 +/- 7.04 mu mol TE/g) and DPPH radical scavenging activity (440 +/- 7.32 mu mol TE/g) and contained the highest contents of total phenolic compounds (236 +/- 7.62 mg GAE/g) in the 55 pharmaceutical plant species according to the results. In addition, sea buckthorn showed dominant allelopathic potential through plant leachates evaluated by using the sandwich method. Star anise (Illicium verum Hook. f.) showed conspicuous allelopathic activity through plant volatiles assessed by the dishpack bioassay method. Among the same plant species, antioxidative ability and total phenolics, in comparison with potential allelopathy of medicinal herbs indicated that volatile allelochemical had a weak active effect (r = 0.407 to 0.472, p < 0.01), with antioxidant capacity by the dishpack method. However, the evaluation by the sandwich method showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.718 to 0.809, p < 0.001) with antioxidant capacity. Based on these results, a new hypothesis is that the antioxidant activity of plants may have an involvement with the potential allelopathic activity.

AB  - ObjectiveGrowing evidence indicate that prenatal intermittent hypoxia (PIH) exposure can have an impact on the critical brain nerve development of the fetus, resulting in cognitive deficits in the offspring mice. Resveratrol, recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities, has potential to ameliorate synaptic dysfunction, which in turn may contribute to its positive influence on cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the precise manner in which resveratrol mitigates cognitive deficits stemming from maternal hypoxia remains to be fully elucidated, including the specific mechanisms at play.MethodPregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia using the ProOx-100 animal hypoxia control system during late pregnancy for 7 consecutive days. Resveratrol treatment at 40 mg/kg dosage was given to the subjects between postnatal Days 60 and 88. Morris water maze test was utilized to assess the cognitive capabilities of the male offspring mice. ELISA was employed to measure the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the hippocampal region of the mature offspring mice. The expression levels of the regulatory proteins SIRT1 and HIF-1 alpha, along with the synaptic plasticity markers SYP, Arc, GAP-43, and PSD-95 were measured by employing western blotting and RT-qPCR.ResultsIn male offspring subjected to PIH, there was a marked decline in learning and memory capabilities, accompanied by increased levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha within the hippocampal region. Administration of resveratrol notably ameliorated the cognitive deficits observed in these offspring and mitigated the heightened levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, exposure to PIH was associated with a reduction in the expression of key proteins such as SIRT1, HIF-1 alpha, Arc, GAP-43, PSD-95, and SYP within the hippocampal region, which were subsequently normalized following resveratrol intervention.ConclusionThe findings from our study indicate that resveratrol potently alleviates learning and memory impairments, the inflammatory response, and impairments in synaptic plasticity, which are induced by maternal intermittent hypoxia, by modulating the SIRT1/HIF-1 alpha signaling pathway.

AB  - Neuroscience research has been increasingly active during the last 2 decades, largely driven by the high prevalence and increasing burden of neurologic disorders. While rodents are essential models for biomedical research of neurologic disorders, they lack similar brain anatomy and protein expression profiles to humans, thus limiting their translational value as models of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The use of ferrets as a model species in neuroscience has been increasing due to their neuroanatomical similarities with humans, including a gyrencephalic brain and larger white matter-to-gray matter ratio. Compared with nonhuman primates, sheep, and swine, ferrets also have the advantages of reduced size, lower housing costs, and lower phylogenetic order. These, among other advantages, make ferrets a promising species to bridge research gaps and complement traditional rodent studies. Although modern neuroscience research in ferrets relies heavily on advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most of the preclinical MRI installations are not designed or optimized for use with ferrets. In this paper we discuss the intricacies and limitations that need to be considered when performing ferret MRI procedures. Reviews of ferret biologic peculiarities, anesthetic protocols, management of complications, and the impact of these factors on MRI outcomes are presented. Standardizing anesthesia protocols for the conduct of MRI in ferrets will aid in better physiologic monitoring as well as imaging outcomes that ultimately benefit the science being conducted.

AB  - The joint pollution of microplastics (MPs) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalic acid (DEHP) often occurs, and consequently poses a serious threat to human and animal health, which has attracted widespread attention. However, the damage to the female mammalian ovary caused by the single exposure and co-exposure of MPs and DEHP and its specific mechanisms are not clear. Here, we established mouse models of single and co-exposures to polystyrene-microplastics (PS-MPs) and DEHP. The results showed that exposed to 100 mg/L PS-MPs and 200 mg/kg DEHP for 35 days destroyed the ovarian granulosa cell layer of mice, leading to follicular fragmentation and atresia. We cultured ovary granulosa cells in vitro to perform further mechanism studies and found that PS-MPs and DEHP had synergistic effects. Both of them promoted the excessive production of ROS and induced oxidative stress by triggering the CNR1/ CRBN/YY1/CYP2E1 signaling axis, which in turn caused DNA oxidative damage. Additionally, we provided compel-ling evidence that oxidative stress mediated-hippo signaling pathway played a critical role in PS-MPs and DEHP caused ovary damage, resulting in ovarian granulosa cell cycle arrest and necroptosis. Using oxidative stress inhibitor AM251 or DAS could reverse these changes markedly and alleviate the reproductive toxicity caused by PS-MPs and DEHP, effectively. Overall, these results demonstrated that co-exposure of PS-MPs and DEHP adversely affected the integrity of ovary granulosa cell layer, resulting in DNA oxidative damage, cell cycle arrest and increased necroptosis of mouse ovarian granulosa cells by inducing oxidative stress. Our study shed new light on the co-exposure toxicity of PS-MPs and DEHP, provided novel insights for the reproductive toxicity of PS-MPs combined exposure with DEHP in female animals from a new free radical generation pathway perspective.

AB  - Geraniol is a potent tea odorant and exists mainly as geranyl glycoside in Camellia sinensis. Understanding the mechanisms of geraniol biosynthesis at molecular levels in tea plants is of great importance for practical improvement of tea aroma. In this study, geraniol and its glycosides from tea plants were examined using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Two candidate geraniol synthase (GES) genes (CsTPS) and two Nudix hydrolase genes (CsNUDX1-cyto and CsNUDX1-chlo) from the tea genome were functionally investigated through gene transcription manipulation and gene chemical product analyses. Our data showed that in tea leaves, levels of geranyl beta-primeveroside were dramatically higher than those of geranyl beta-glucoside, while free geraniol was undetectable in this study. A tempo-spatial variation of geranyl beta-primeveroside abundance in tea plants existed, with high levels in young and green tissues and low levels in mature or non-green tissues. Cytosolic CsNUDX1-cyto showed higher hydrolysis activity of geranyl-pyrophosphate to geranyl-monophosphate (GP) in vitro than did chloroplastidial CsNUDX1-chlo. A transgenic study revealed that expression of CsNUDX1-cyto resulted in significantly more geranyl beta-primeveroside in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana compared with non-transgenic wild-type, whereas expression of CsNUDX1-chlo had no effect. An antisense oligo-deoxynucleotide study confirmed that suppression of CsNUDX1-cyto transcription in tea shoots led to a significant decrease in geranyl beta-primeveroside abundance. Additionally, CsNUDX1-cyto transcript levels and geranyl beta-primeveroside abundances shared the same tempo-spatial patterns in different organs in the tea cultivar "Shucha Zao, " indicating that CsNUDX1-cyto is important for geranyl beta-primeveroside formation in tea plants. Results also suggested that neither of the two candidate GES genes in tea plants did not function as GES in transgenic N. benthamiana. All our data indicated that CsNUDX1-cyto is involved in geranyl beta-primeveroside production in tea plants. Our speculation about possible conversion from the chemical product of CsNUDX1-cyto to geranyl beta-primeveroside in plants was also discussed.

AB  - PurposePerineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix proteoglycans surrounding neurons and glia. It has been suggested that PNNs are involved in the pathophysiology of multiple CNS illnesses, including stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders.MethodBefore examining the putative role of PNNs in stress-related responses, we described for the first time the anatomical distribution in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), an excellent model organism for studying social stress and circadian rhythms.ResultsWe observed PNNs throughout the hamster cortex and hippocampus but found low to no expression in subcortical regions such as the hypothalamus, thalamus, and striatum, sites where they are observed in rats and mice. We further demonstrated that PNNs are dynamically regulated in a sex-dependent manner in response to acute social stress, specifically in hippocampal area CA1. We did not observe a difference in PNNs between the beginning of the dark versus light phase of the light-dark cycle in hamsters, despite other laboratory rodents showing diurnal variation in PNNs. Finally, we also demonstrated that there are sex differences in PNN expression in the somatosensory cortex and the basolateral amygdala in hamsters, suggesting that sex as a biological variable should be considered in studies of PNN function.ConclusionTogether, the data from the current study suggest that a comparative approach will be necessary to fully elucidate the functional role of PNNs and, further, that Syrian hamsters are a valuable model in this endeavor.

AB  - In 2005, the Moser group identified a new type of cell in the entorhinal cortex (ERC): the grid cell (Hafting, Nature, 436, 2005, pp. 801-806). A landmark series of studies from these investigators showed that grid cells support spatial navigation by encoding position, direction as well as distance information, and they subsequently found grid cells in pre- and para-subiculum areas adjacent to the ERC (Boccara, Nature Neuroscience, 13, 2010, pp. 987-994). Fast forward to 2010, when some clever investigators developed fMRI analysis methods to document grid-like responses in the human ERC (Doeller, Nature, 463, 2010, pp. 657-661). What was not at all expected was the co-identification of grid-like fMRI responses outside of the ERC, in particular, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Here we provide a compact overview of the burgeoning literature on grid cells in both rodent and human species, while considering the intriguing question: what are grid-like responses doing in the OFC and vmPFC?

AB  - As a kind of environmental noise, infrasonic noise has negative effects on various human organs. To date, research has shown that infrasound impairs cognitive function, especially the ability for learning and memory. Previously, we demonstrated that impaired learning and memory induced by infrasound was closely related with glia activation; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Connexin 43 hemichannels (Cx43 HCs), which are mainly expressed in hippocampal astrocytes, are activated under pathological conditions, lending support to the hypothesis that Cx43 HCs might function in the impaired learning and memory induced by infrasound. This study revealed that that blocking hippocampal Cx43 HCs or downregulating hippocampal Cx43 expression significantly alleviated impaired learning and memory induced by infrasound. We also observed that infrasound exposure led to the abundant release of glutamate and ATP through Cx43 HCs. In addition, the abundant release of glutamate and ATP depended on proinflammatory cytokines. Our finds suggested that the enhanced release of ATP and glutamate by astroglial Cx43 HCs may be involved in the learning and memory deficits caused by infrasound exposure.

AB  - In the present study, a total of 80 presumed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from camel milk. Selected LAB were identified as Lactococcus lactis (cam 12), Enterococcus lactis (cam 14) and Lactobacillus plantarum (cam 15) and their potential were tested by tolerance & de-conjugation of bile salts, antimicrobial activity, surface hydrophobicity and adhesion potential) along with this of probiotics were evaluated for curd formation and assessed for sensory properties and syneresis. Selected LABs showed antimicrobial activity against wide range of pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Escherchiaia. coli). LAB (cam 12, cam 14 and cam15) were highly sceptible to chloramphenicol, vancomycin, and tetracyclin. In vitro adhesion studies with Caco-2 cells demonstrated strong adhesion activity with hydrophobicity (99%) was observed. Acute oral toxicity of E. lactis and L. plantarum showed non-toxic, non-virulent and safe for industrial application. The study provides potential LAB which may act as a substitute of functional food, synthetic feed and industrial curd formulation with in the shortest span (240 min at 28-32 degrees C).

AB  - Fear-induced antinociception (FIA), an instinctive defensive response producing pain suppression in stressful and/or dangerous situations, has been the subject of extensive research to elucidate the mechanisms involved in triggering and controlling pain during emotional disorders. In this systematic review, we synthesized pre-clinical studies that demonstrated the neural hodology and the neurochemical bases of FIA in laboratory animals. The literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus, from inception up to July 2022, retrieved 797 articles from which 50 studies were included in this review. This review highlights key encephalic regions implicated in the modulation of FIA, such as the prefrontal cortex, the amygdaloid complex, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, the corpora quadrigemina, the periaqueductal gray matter, and some reticular formation nuclei. FIA-related neural pathways, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators such as glutamatergic, serotonergic, norepinephrine, GABAergic, nitrergic, opioidergic and endocannabinoid connections across these encephalic regions were also addressed. Understanding these neural circuits and molecular neural mediation sheds light on the complex interplay between fear, anxiety, and pain modulation, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting pain management in the context of heightened emotional states.

AB  - Background: The African swine fever (ASF) virus (ASFV) and ASF-like viral sequences were identified in human samples and sewage as well as in different water environments. Pigs regularly experience infections by the ASFV. The considerable stability of the virus in the environment suggests that there is ongoing and long-term contact between humans and the ASFV. However, humans exhibit resistance to the ASFV, and the decisive factor in developing infection in the body is most likely the reaction of target macrophages to the virus. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the responses of human macrophages to the virus and explore the distinct features of the viral replication cycle within human macrophages. Methods: The ASFV Armenia/07 strain was used in all experiments. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the ASFV gene expression; flow cytometry analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of the inactive and active ASFV (inASFV and aASFV) treatments on the phenotype of THP-1-derived macrophages (Myo0) and inflammatory markers. Moreover, other methods such as cell viability and apoptosis assays, staining techniques, phagocytosis assay, lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) cytometry, and cytokine detection were used during experiments. Results: Our findings showed that the virus initiated replication by entering human macrophages. Subsequently, the virus shed its capsid and initiated the transcription of numerous viral genes, and at least some of these genes executed their functions. In THP-1-derived macrophages (Myo0), the ASFV implemented several functions to suppress cell activity, although the timing of their implementation was slower compared with virus-sensitive porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Additionally, the virus could not complete the entire replication cycle in human Myo0, as indicated by the absence of viral factories and a decrease in infectious titers of the virus with each subsequent passage. Overall, the infection of Myo0 with the ASFV caused significant alterations in their phenotype and functions, such as increased TLR2, TLR3, CD80, CD36, CD163, CXCR2, and surface LAMP-1 expression. Increased production of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-10 and decreased production of interferon (IFN)-alpha were also observed. Taken together, the virus enters human THP-1-derived macrophages, starts transcription, and causes immunological responses by target cells but cannot complete the replicative cycle. Conclusion: These findings suggest that there may be molecular limitations within human macrophages that at least partially restrict the complete replication of the ASFV. Understanding the factors that hinder viral replication in Myo0 can provide valuable insights into the host-virus interactions and the mechanisms underlying the resistance of human macrophages to the ASFV.

AB  - Hippo-Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) plays an important role in gastric cancer (GC) progression; however, its regulatory network remains unclear. In this study, we identified Copine III (CPNE3) was identified as a novel direct target gene regulated by the YAP1/TEADs transcription factor complex. The downregulation of CPNE3 inhibited proliferation and invasion, and increased the chemosensitivity of GC cells, whereas the overexpression of CPNE3 had the opposite biological effects. Mechanistically, CPNE3 binds to the YAP1 protein in the cytoplasm, inhibiting YAP1 ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the E3 ubiquitination ligase beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TRCP). Thereby activating the transcription of YAP1 downstream target genes, which creates a positive feedback cycle to facilitate GC progression. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated significant upregulation of CPNE3 in GC tissues. Survival and Cox regression analyses indicated that high CPNE3 expression was an independent prognostic marker for GC. This study elucidated the pivotal involvement of an aberrantly activated CPNE3/YAP1 positive feedback loop in the malignant progression of GC, thereby uncovering novel prognostic factors and therapeutic targets in GC.

AB  - Stress is ever present in our modern, performance-oriented and demanding society, which causes adverse stress reactions of the body and affects health seriously. Chronic stress has been recognized as a significant risk factor leading to cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanism is far from fully understood. Norepinephrine (NE), a pivotal stress-induced hormone, has been found to induce cell apoptosis. However, the function and the key downstream mediator of NE on the regulation of hippocampal neurons still need further exploration. In this study, we explored the role of NE in neuronal apoptosis and its association with MALAT1. Flow cytometry assay and automated western bot assay were carried out to evaluate the cell apoptosis. The data showed that the rate of apoptosis rate and the levels of apoptotic proteins (cleaved-Caspase3 and cleaved-PARP) were significantly increased in HT22 cells after a high dose of NE treatment, suggesting a facilitative role of NE on hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. Besides, a high level of NE up-regulated the expression of MALAT1 in HT22 cells. Then, a lentivirus expressing MALAT1 shRNA was constructed to investigate the role of MALAT1 in cell apoptosis and the results revealed that MALAT1 depletion decreased the cell apoptosis. Moreover, the knockdown of MALAT1 abolished the discrepancy in apoptosis between NE-treated cells and control cells. In conclusion, a high level of the stress-induced hormone NE promoted apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by elevating the expression of MALAT1. Our findings provide new experimental data supporting the epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of stress response and may provide a potential therapeutic target for stress-related cognition dysfunction.

AB  - Androgens play an important role in the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. While the classical mo-lecular mechanism of androgen's genomic activity is their binding to intracellular androgen receptors (iARs), they can also induce rapid non-genomic effects through specific membrane androgen receptors (mARs). In this study, we aimed to localize and characterize these mARs in primary rat hippocampal neurons. Specific punctate fluorescent signals on the cell surface, observed by testosterone-fetal bovine serum albumin conjugated fluo-rescein isothiocyanate (T-BSA-FITC), indicated the presence of mARs in hippocampal neurons. T-BSA-FITC binding to the cell membrane was incompletely blocked by the iAR-antagonist flutamide, and mAR binding site was competitively bound by free testosterone (T). Most neurons expressing androgen membrane binding sites are glutamatergic (excitatory), although several are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic (inhibitory). Confocal mi-croscopy and live-cell imaging techniques were used to observe the real-time rapid effects of androgens on hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. Immunofluorescence cell staining was used to observe their effects on the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synapsin (SYN) synaptic markers. While androgens did not cause a short-term increase in dendritic spine density of rat primary hippocampal neurons, they promoted the transformation of dendritic spines from thin to mushroom, promoted dendritic spine maturation, increased dendritic spine surface area, and rapidly increased PSD95 and SYN expression in the primary hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal synaptosomes were prepared using the Optiprep and Percoll density gradient two-step centrifuge methods, and the gene expression profiles of the synaptosomes and hippocampus were compared using a gene chip; PSD95 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Several mRNAs were detected at the synaptic site, including PSD95. Finally, the Venus-PSD95 plasmid was constructed and transfected into HT22 cells, which is a mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line. The real-time effect of androgen on synaptic protein PSD95 was observed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ex-periments, which involved the translation process of PSD95 mRNA. In conclusion, our findings increased our understanding of how androgens exert the neuroprotective mechanisms on synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Predator odors provide critical information to prey species allowing them to gage potential threat via the detection of semiochemicals called kairomones. Recent reports indicate that the commercially available predator odor coyote urine (CU), and to a lesser extent 2-phenylethylamine (PEA), induce innate defensive behaviors in adult rats and mice. The aim of the present study was to see if the defense-inducing effects of CU and PEA would extend to adolescents. Specifically, we evaluated the ability of CU and PEA to induce unconditioned and conditioned defensive behavior in predator-odor naive adolescent male and female Long-Evans hooded rats. An additional group of males were exposed to the non-predatory aversive odor formalin to control for potential general aversive properties of the odorants. The data revealed that in males, both CU and PEA, but not formalin induced measures of risk assessment, whereas CU and formalin produced avoidance of the odor source. In partial contrast, both CU and PEA produced avoidance of the odor source and increased measures of risk assessment in females. Surprisingly males failed to show any measures of defense during the cue+context conditioning test trial. In contrast, in females both odorants produced marginal effects during re-exposure to the conditioning context, with CU inducing conditioned avoidance and PEA inducing conditioned risk assessment. We conclude that commercially available CU and PEA elicit a moderate defensive profile compared to previous reports examining cat fur/skin odor in male and female adolescent rats. Future research needs to examine additional concentrations of the odorants to determine if a more robust unconditioned defensive profile (e.g., freezing) can be induced by these predator odors, and whether the defensive profile responds to standard anxiolytic drugs.

AB  - Terpene synthases (TPSs) are key enzymes in terpenoids synthesis of plants and play crucial roles in regulating plant defence against pests and diseases. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20, which were upregulated by the attack of brown planthopper (BPH). BPH female adults performed concentration-dependent behavioural responses to (S)-limonene showing preference behaviour at low concentrations and avoidance behaviour at high concentrations. Overexpression lines of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20, which emitted higher amounts of the monoterpene (S)-limonene, decreased the hatching rate of BPH eggs, reduced the lesion length of sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani and bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae. While knockout lines of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20, which emitted lower amounts of (S)-limonene, were more susceptible to these pathogens. Overexpression of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 in rice plants had adverse effects on the incidence of BPH, rice blast, and sheath blight in the field and had no significant impacts on rice yield traits. OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 were found to be involved in fine-tuning the emission of (S)-limonene in rice plants and play an important role in defence against both BPH and rice pathogens.

AB  - Social decision-making is critically influenced by neurocircuitries that regulate stress responsiveness. Adaptive choices, therefore, are altered by stress-related neuromodulatory peptide systems, such as corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). Experimental designs that take advantage of ecologically salient fear-inducing stimuli allow for revelation of neural mechanisms that regulate the balance between pro-and anti-stress responsiveness. To accomplish this, we developed a social stress and conditioning protocol, the Stress Alternatives Model (SAM), that utilizes a simple dichotomous choice, and produces distinctive behavioral phenotypes (Escape or Stay). The experiments involve repeated social aggression, a potent unconditioned stimulus (US), from a novel larger conspecific (a 3X larger Rainbow trout). Prior to the social interaction, the smaller test fish is presented with an auditory conditioning stimulus (water off = CS). During the social aggression, an escape route is available, but is only large enough for the smaller test animal. Surprisingly, although the new aggressor provides vigorous attacks each day, only 50% of the test fish choose Escape. Stay fish, treated with the CRF1 antagonist antalarmin, a potent anxiolytic drug, on day 4, promotes Escape behavior for the last 4 days of the SAM protocol. The results suggest that the decision to Escape, required a reduction in stress reactivity. The Stay fish that chose Escape following anxiolytic treatment, learned how to use the escape route prior to stress reduction, as the Escape la-tency in these fish was significantly faster than first time escapers. In Escape fish, the use of the escape route is learned over several days, reducing the Escape latency over time in the SAM. Fear conditioning (water off + aggression) resulted in elevated hippocampal (DL) Bdnf mRNA levels, with coincident reduction in the AMPA receptor subunit Glua1 expression, a result that is reversed following a one-time treatment (during SAM aggression on day 4) with the anxiolytic CRF1 receptor antagonist antalarmin.

AB  - Critical network states and neural plasticity enable adaptive behavior in dynamic environments, supporting efficient information processing and experience-dependent learning. Synaptic-weight-based Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling are key mechanisms that enable memory while stabilizing network dynamics. However, the role of structural plasticity as a homeostatic mechanism remains less consistently reported, particularly under activity inhibition, leading to an incomplete understanding of its functional impact. In this study, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGFP-labeled neurons in mouse organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures (Thy1-eGFP mice of both sexes) with computational modeling to investigate how synapse-number-based structural plasticity responds to activity perturbations and interacts with homeostatic synaptic scaling. Tracking individual dendritic segments, we found that inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission does not monotonically regulate dendritic spine density. Specifically, inhibition of AMPA receptors with 200 nM 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) increased spine density, whereas complete AMPA receptor blockade with 50 mu M NBQX reduced it. Motivated by these findings, we developed network simulations incorporating a biphasic structural plasticity rule governing activity-dependent synapse formation. These simulations showed that the biphasic rule maintains neural activity homeostasis under stimulation and permits either synapse formation or synapse loss depending on the degree of activity deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling further modulated recurrent connectivity, network activity, and structural plasticity outcomes. It reduced stimulation-triggered synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights and rescued silencing-induced synapse loss by upscaling recurrent input, thus reactivating silent neurons. The interaction between these mechanisms provides a mechanistic explanation for divergent findings in the literature. In summary, homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity dynamically compete and compensate for each other, ensuring efficient and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.

AB  - The issue of antimicrobial resistance, particularly among Gram-negative enteric bacteria, in agricultural settings has been documented in literature and continues to be a growing public health concern. Among the Enterobacteriaceae family, the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are especially concerning because of the impact they have on healthcare worldwide. We employed a novel approach by constructing and placing adhesive air strips in a stockyard in Madison County, Kentucky. Samples were placed in enteric enrichment (EE) broth after collection and incubated for 24 hr. Samples that turned yellow due to fermentation were subsequently inoculated on ESBL and CRE screening media. We transferred colonies that grew on both plates onto MacConkey and sheep blood agar to use for further testing. We recovered 8 of the 10 placed air strips. Of the EE broth tubes, 7 of the 16 turned yellow, indicative of enteric bacteria. Of the 7 positive tubes, 5 isolates grew on ESBL and CRE screening media with only 1 isolate displaying pigmentation indicative of a resistant organism. We were able to isolate resistant enteric bacteria from particulate matter in an agricultural setting using our novel sampling approach.

AB  - Abl2/Arg (ABL-related gene) is a member of the Abelson family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, known for its role in tumor progression, metastasis, tissue injury responses, inflammation, neural degeneration, and other diseases. In this study, we developed Abl2/Arg knockout (abl2-/-) mice to explore its impact on sensory/motor functions and emotion-related behaviors. Our findings show that abl2-/- mice exhibit normal growth and phenotypic characteristics, closely resembling their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Behavioral tests, including the elevated plus maze, marble-burying behavior test, and open field test, indicated pronounced anxiety-like behaviors in abl2-/- mice compared to WT mice. Furthermore, in the tail suspension test, abl2-/- mice showed a significant decrease in mobility time, suggesting depressive-like behavior. Conversely, in the Y-maze and cliff avoidance reaction tests, no notable differences were observed between abl2-/- and WT mice, suggesting the absence of working memory deficits and impulsivity in abl2-/- mice. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in abl2-/- mice highlighted significant alterations in proteins related to anxiety and depression, especially those associated with the GABAergic synapse in inhibitory neurotransmission. The expression of Gabbr2 was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of abl2-/- compared to WT mice, and intraperitoneal treatment of GABA receptor agonist Gaboxadol normalized anxiety/depression-related behaviors of abl2-/- mice. These findings underscore the potential role of Abl2/Arg in influencing anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, thereby contributing valuable insights into its broader physiological and pathological functions.

AB  - Increasing evidence has shown that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is closely related to the pathophysiological condition of depressive disorders. Recently, chronic social defeat stress paradigms have been regarded as important animal models of depression, accompanied with neural plastic changes in the hippocampus. However, little is known about influences of non-physical stress on neurogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the chronic vicarious social defeat stress paradigm and examined the effect of psychological stress on mouse hippocampal neurogenesis. Immediately after the chronic psychological stress, the cell survival rate in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was significantly diminished without modifying the cell proliferation rate. The decreased ratio in cell survival persisted for 4 weeks after the stress-loading period, while the differentiation and maturity of new-born neurons were identical to control groups. Furthermore, treatment with the chronic antidepressant fluoxetine reversed the social behavioral deficits and promoted new-born neurons survival. These results demonstrate that emotional stress in the vicarious social defeat stress paradigm influences neuronal cell survival in the hippocampus, which reinforces its validity as an animal model of depression.

AB  - Significant stress in childhood or adolescence is linked to both structural and functional changes in the brain in human and analogous animal models. In addition, neuromodulators, such as noradrenaline (NA), show life-long alterations in response to these early life stressors, which may impact upon the sensitivity and time course of key adrenergic activities, such as rapid autonomic stress responses (the 'fight or flight response'). The locus-coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) network, a key stress-responsive network in the brain, displays numerous changes in response to significant early- life stress. Here, we review the relationship between NA and the neurobiological changes associated with early life stress and set out future lines of research that can illuminate how brain circuits and circulating neurotransmitters adapt in response to childhood stressors

AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of energy balance playing important roles in the balancing of anabolic and catabolic activities. The high energy demands of the brain and its limited capacity to store energy indicate that AMPK may play a significant role in brain metabolism. Here, we activated AMPK in guinea pig cortical tissue slices, both directly with A769662 and PF 06409577 and indirectly with AICAR and metformin. We studied the resultant metabolism of [1-C-13]glucose and [1,2-C-13]acetate using NMR spectroscopy. We found distinct activator concentration-dependent effects on metabolism, which ranged from decreased metabolic pool sizes at EC50 activator concentrations with no expected stimulation in glycolytic flux to increased aerobic glycolysis and decreased pyruvate metabolism with certain activators. Further, activation with direct versus indirect activators produced distinct metabolic outcomes at both low (EC50) and higher (EC50 x 10) concentrations. Specific direct activation of beta 1-containing AMPK isoforms with PF 06409577 resulted in increased Krebs cycle activity, restoring pyruvate metabolism while A769662 increased lactate and alanine production, as well as labelling of citrate and glutamine. These results reveal a complex metabolic response to AMPK activators in brain beyond increased aerobic glycolysis and indicate that further research is warranted into their concentration- and mechanism-dependent impact.

AB  - Gamma-Delta T cells are a prominent subset of T cells in pigs. However, developmental changes, antigen recognition, cell migration, and their contributions to pathogen clearance remain largely unknown. We have recently shown that porcine ?d T cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and that TLR7/8 stimulation can function as a co-stimulatory signal that complements cytokine-induced signals to enhance INF? production. Nonetheless, the signaling pathways behind this increased cytokine responsiveness remained unclear. Here, we analyzed the signaling pathways by measuring cellular kinase activity and selective inhibition, confirming that the TLR7/8 expression by ?d T cells is indeed functional. Moreover, TLR downstream signaling responses showed a distinct age-dependency, emphasizing the importance of age in immune function. While the TLR7/8 co-stimulation depended on activation of IRAK1/4, p38 and JNK in adult-derived ?d T cells, ?d T cells from young pigs utilized only p38, indicating the existence of an alternative signaling pathway in young pigs. Overall, this data suggests that porcine ?d T cells could be able to recognize viral RNA through TLR7/8 and subsequently support the survival and activation of the adaptive immune response by cytokine production.

AB  - Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) are emerging as promising alternatives to synthetic grafts, particularly in pediatric cardiovascular surgery. While TEVGs have demonstrated growth potential, compliance, and resistance to calcification, their functional integration into the circulation, especially their ability to respond to physiological stimuli, remains underexplored. Vasoreactivity, the dynamic contraction or dilation of blood vessels in response to vasoactive agents, is a key property of native vessels that affects systemic hemodynamics and long-term vascular function. This study aimed to develop and validate an in vivo protocol to assess the vasoreactive capacity of TEVGs implanted as inferior vena cava (IVC) interposition grafts in a large animal model. Bone marrow-seeded TEVGs were implanted in the thoracic IVC of Dorset sheep. A combination of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and invasive hemodynamic monitoring was used to evaluate vessel response to norepinephrine (NE) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Cross-sectional luminal area changes were measured using a custom Python-based software package (VIVUS) that leverages deep learning for IVUS image segmentation. Physiological parameters including blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output were continuously recorded. NE injections induced significant, dose-dependent vasoconstriction of TEVGs, with peak reductions in luminal area averaging similar to 15% and corresponding increases in heart rate and mean arterial pressure. Conversely, SNP did not elicit measurable vasodilation in TEVGs, likely due to structural differences in venous tissue, the low-pressure environment of the thoracic IVC, and systemic confounders. Overall, the TEVGs demonstrated active, rapid, and reversible vasoconstrictive behavior in response to pharmacologic stimuli. This study presents a novel in vivo method for assessing TEVG vasoreactivity using real-time imaging and hemodynamic data. TEVGs possess functional vasoactivity, suggesting they may play an active role in modulating venous return and systemic hemodynamics. These findings are particularly relevant for Fontan patients and other scenarios where dynamic venous regulation is critical. Future work will compare TEVG vasoreactivity with native veins and synthetic grafts to further characterize their physiological integration and potential clinical benefits.
   Impact Statement This study presents a novel in vivo method to assess the vasoreactivity of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) in a large animal model. By demonstrating that TEVGs can actively constrict in response to pharmacologic stimuli, this work provides new evidence of their functional integration with the circulatory system. These findings advance the field by highlighting the dynamic physiological potential of TEVGs, with important implications for improving long-term outcomes in congenital heart disease, especially in Fontan circulation where controlled venous flow is critical.

AB  - Persistent COVID-19 symptoms post-acute state have been shown to have a significant negative impact on brain structure and function. In this study, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole brain in 43 working-age adults (mean age: 44.79+10.80; +10.80; range: 24-65 years) with a history of COVID-19 (731.17+312.41 +312.41 days post-diagnosis), and also assessed their cognitive function (processing speed, attention, working memory, executive function, and recognition memory), mental health, and sleep quality. MRI data were processed using FSL to derive regional volumes for bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and total grey matter, white matter, and cerebral spinal fluid volume, and analysed in relation to persistent COVID-19 symptom load, mental health, and sleep quality. Higher persistent COVID-19 symptom load was significantly associated with smaller putamen volume, lower response accuracy on working memory, executive function, and recognition memory tasks, as well as a longer time to complete the executive function task, and poorer mental health and sleep quality. Smaller putamen fully mediated the relationship between persistent COVID-19 symptom load and lower executive function. Further research is required to confirm whether reduced putamen volume and its association with poor executive function persists in COVID-19 survivors in the long term.

AB  - Aims: Glioblastoma (GB) is one of the most aggressive brain tumors. These tumors modify their metabolism, increasing the expression of glucose transporters, GLUTs, which incorporate glucose and the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). We hypothesized that GB cells preferentially take up DHA, which is intracellularly reduced and compartmentalized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), promoting collagen biosynthesis and an aggressive phenotype.Results: Our results showed that GB cells take up DHA using GLUT1, while GLUT3 and sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) are preferably intracellular. Using a baculoviral system and reticulum-enriched extracts, we determined that SVCT2 is mainly located in the ER and corresponds to a short isoform. Ascorbic acid (AA) was compartmentalized, stimulating collagen IV secretion and increasing in vitro and in situ cell migration. Finally, orthotopic xenografts induced in immunocompetent guinea pigs showed that vitamin C deficiency retained collagen, reduced blood vessel invasion, and affected glomeruloid vasculature formation, all pathological conditions associated with malignancy.Innovation and Conclusion: We propose a functional role for vitamin C in GB development and progression. Vitamin C is incorporated into the ER of GB cells, where it favors the synthesis of collagen, thus impacting tumor development. Collagen secreted by tumor cells favors the formation of the glomeruloid vasculature and enhances perivascular invasion.

AB  - Tooth loss greatly affects a person's quality of life and many turn to dental implants to replace lost teeth. The success of a dental implant depends on the amount of alveolar bone supporting the implant, and thus, bone augmentation is often necessary to preserve or build up bone volume in the alveolar ridge. Bone can be augmented with autogenous bone, allografts, or xenografts, but the limitations of such natural bone grafts prompt researchers to develop synthetic scaffolds supplemented with cells and/or bioactive agents as alternative bone grafts. The translation of these combination scaffolds from the laboratory to the clinic requires reliable experimental models that can simulate the clinical conditions in human patients. In this article, we describe the use of a porcine alveolar defect model as a platform to evaluate the efficacy of a novel combination of a three-dimensional-printed polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) scaffold and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) in lateral alveolar augmentation. The surgical protocol for the defect creation and regenerative surgery, as well as analytical methods to determine the extent of tissue regeneration, are described and discussed.

AB  - Introduction Moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in an early loss of immature hippocampal granule cells and the activation of typically quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus. Activation of NSCs leads to a robust increase in proliferation and generation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), supporting restoration of the immature neuron population of over a period of 1-2 weeks. However, it is unclear if neurons born early after injury develop normally, survive long-term and functionally integrate into the hippocampal network. Although adult hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated in a sex-dependent manner, the majority of pre-clinical TBI studies lack the inclusion of both sexes. The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in hippocampal neurogenesis in response to a moderate controlled cortical impact brain injury.Methods In-vivo labeling of NPCs and tracking of their morphological development into a granule cell was achieved using an inducible Cre recombinase driven by the Ascl1 promoter in a CAG-floxStopTom reporter mouse. Ascl1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor transiently expressed in NPCs and activated NSCs in the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian brain. To specifically label NPCs born acutely after TBI, tamoxifen was delivered to mice on days 2 and 3 postinjury. Mice survived to 6 weeks after TBI to allow for full neuronal maturation of tdTomato-labeled NPCs.Results At 6 weeks postinjury, numbers of tdTomato-positive granule cells were significantly reduced in the ipsilateral hippocampus of brain-injured mice compared to controls, with a more pronounced decrease in males. Further, posttrauma-born neurons in males, but not females, exhibited impaired dendritic development. Neurons born after injury extended axons which formed synaptic terminals within the CA3 region. Numbers of mossy fiber boutons were significantly decreased in injured males compared to na & iuml;ve males or to injured females. Potential forms of plasticity were observed in brain-injured females, including increased neurogenesis in the contralateral hippocampus and increased mossy fiber bouton volume. Together these data suggest a neurogenic advantage in females after injury.Discussion This study is the first to report sex differences in posttraumatic hippocampal neurogenesis and to demonstrate modification of synaptic terminals formed by neurons born after TBI.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence has shown that maternal infection is a notable risk factor for developmental psychiatric disorders. Animal models have corroborated this link and demonstrated that maternal immune activation (MIA) induces long-term behavioural deficits and neuroimmunological responses to subsequent immune stress in offspring. However, it is unclear whether MIA offspring are more sensitive or more tolerant to immunological challenges from postnatal infections. Pregnant mice were weighed and injected with a single dose of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or saline at gestational day 9.5, and their male offspring were exposed to poly I:C or saline again during adolescence, adulthood, and middle life. After a two-week recovery from the last exposure to poly I:C, the mice underwent behavioural and neuroendophenotypic evaluations. Finally, the mice were sacrificed, and the expression levels of inflammatory factors and the activation levels of glial cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were evaluated. We found MIA mice have lifelong behavioural deficits and glial activation abnormalities. Postpartum infection exposure at different ages has different consequences. Adolescent and middle life exposure prevents sensorimotor gating deficiency, but adult exposure leads to increased sensitivity to MK-801. Moreover, MIA imposed a lasting impact on the neuroimmune profile, resulting in an enhanced cytokine-associated response and diminished microglial reactivity to postnatal infection. Our results reveal an intricate interplay between prenatal and postpartum infection in neuropsychiatric phenotypes, which identify potential windows where preventive or mitigating measures could be applied.

AB  - Attachment of a detached retina does not always restore vision to pre-injury levels, even if the attachment is anatomically successful. The problem is due in part to long-term damage to photoreceptor synapses. Previously, we reported on damage to rod synapses and synaptic protection using a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (AR13503) after retinal detachment (RD). This report documents the effects of detachment, reattachment, and protection by ROCK inhibition on cone synapses. Conventional confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy were used for morphological assessment and electroretinograms for functional analysis of an adult pig model of RD. RDs were examined 2 and 4 h after injury or two days later when spontaneous reattachment had occurred. Cone pedicles respond differently than rod spherules. They lose their synaptic ribbons, reduce invaginations, and change their shape. ROCK inhibition protects against these structural abnormalities whether the inhibitor is applied immediately or 2 h after the RD. Functional restoration of the photopic b-wave, indicating cone-bipolar neurotransmission, is also improved with ROCK inhibition. Successful protection of both rod and cone synapses with AR13503 suggests this drug will (1) be a useful adjunct to subretinal administration of gene or stem cell therapies and (2) improve recovery of the injured retina when treatment is delayed.

AB  - Understanding of tongue deformations during mammalian mastication is limited, but has benefited from recent developments in multiplanar imaging technology. Here, we demonstrate how a standardized radiopaque marker implant configuration and biplanar fluoroscopy can quantify three-dimensional shape changes during chewing in pigs. Transverse and sagittal components of the three-dimensional angle between markers enable characterizing deformations in anatomically relevant directions. The transverse component illustrates bending to the left or to the right, which can occur symmetrically or asymmetrically, the latter sometimes indicating regional widening. The sagittal component reflects 'arching' or convex deformations in the dorsoventral dimension symmetrically or asymmetrically, the latter characteristic of twisting. Trends are detected in both the transverse and sagittal planes, and combinations thereof, to modify tongue shape in complex deformations. Both the transverse and sagittal components were also measured at key jaw and tongue positions, demonstrating variability particularly with respect to maximum and minimum gape. This highlights the fact that unlike tongue position, tongue deformations are more independent of jaw position, likely in response to the ever-changing bolus shape and position. From a methodological perspective, our study showcases advantages of a repeatable three-marker implant configuration suitable for animals of different sizes and highlights considerations for different implant patterns.This article is part of the theme issue 'Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals'.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that various receptors, including dopamine receptors, are expressed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Besides, indicatively, dopamine receptors play an essential role in the modulation of pain perception. On the other hand, stressful experiences can produce analgesia, termed stress-induced analgesia (SIA). The current study examined the probable role of dopamine receptors within the DG in antinociception induced by restraint stress (RS). Ninety-seven male albino Wistar rats were unilaterally implanted with a cannula in the DG. Animals received intra-DG microinjections of SCH23390 or Sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/rat) as D1 -and D2 -like dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively, five minutes before RS. Ten minutes after the end of the induction of RS for three hours, 50 mu l 2.5% formalin was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the hind paw to induce persistent inflammatory pain. Pain scores were evaluated at 5 -minute intervals for 60 minutes. These findings showed that; exposure to RS for three hours produced SIA in both phases of the formalin test, while this RS-induced analgesia was attenuated in the early and late phases of the formalin test by intra-DG microinjection of SCH23390 and Sulpiride. The results of the present study suggested that both D1- and D2 -like dopamine receptors in the DG have a considerable role in the induced analgesia by RS.

AB  - Aging, especially in female, is complex, involving various factors such as reproductive sensitivity, cognitive and functional decline, and an imbalance in the redox system. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of long-term resistance training as a non-pharmacological strategy to mitigate the impairment of recognition memory, hippocampal redox state, and ambulation in aging female Wistar rats during the periestropause period. Thirty Wistar rats aged 17 months, in periestropause, were distributed into non-trained (NT) and resistance training (RT; stair climbing 3 times per week for 4 months) groups. Before (17 months) and after (21 months) of the RT period, the rats underwent tests for ambulation, elevated plus maze (EPM), open field, and object recognition. Biochemical and histological analyses were conducted on the hippocampus of these animals. Analysis of the results revealed that at 21 months, females in the NT group (21Mo/NT) exhibited a decreased in length (p=0.0458) and an increased in past width (p<0.0479) compared to their measurements at 17 months. However, after 4 months of RT, the female rats aged 21 months (21Mo/RT group) experienced changes in gait components, showing an increase in length (p<0.0008) and a decrease in stride width. Regarding memory, the object recognition test indicated potential cognitive improvement in 21Mo/RT animals, with significant interaction between intervention and age across all three stages of the test (total exploration time, p=0.0001; Test 1, p=0.0003; Test 2, p=0.0014). This response was notable compared to animals in the 21Mo/NT group, which showed a decline in memory capacity (p<0.01). The data showed a significant difference in relation to the age of the animals (p<0.01). The hippocampal redox state markers showed reduced lipid oxidative (p=0.028), catalase (p=0.022), and superoxide dismutase (p=0.0067) in the RT group compared to the NT group. Hippocampal cells from the 21Mo/RT group showed increased citrate synthase enzyme activity (p<0.05) and Nissl body staining (p<0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that RT performed during the periestropause phase leads to significant improvements in functional abilities, cognitive performance, and neuroplasticity in aging female rats.

AB  - Sensory-motor gating, the process of filtering sensory stimuli to modulate motor responses, is impaired in many psychiatric diseases but especially schizophrenia. Sensory-motor gating assessed with the prepulse inhibition paradigm (PPI) measures startle in response to preceding acoustic stimuli. PPI studies in rodents have consistently found that neonatal hippocampal lesions impair sensory-motor gating in adult animals, but its applicability to primates has yet to be tested. The study examined acoustic startle responses and PPI in adult rhesus monkeys with neonatal lesions of the hippocampus (Neo-Hibo), amygdala (Neo-Aibo), and orbital frontal cortex areas 11 and 13 (Neo-Oasp) and with sham-operations (Neo-C). All monkeys were initially habituated to the startle apparatus and assayed for acoustic startle response curves. Subsequently, PPI was measured with the prepulse occurring at 60, 120, 240, 480, 1000 and 5000 msec prior to the pulse onset. No significant group differences in baseline startle were found. Compared to Neo-C monkeys, Neo-Hibo monkeys showed normal startle curves as well as normal PPI at short prepulse delays but prepulse facilitation (PPF) at longer prepulse intervals. Neo-Aibo monkeys displayed enhanced startle responses with only minor changes in PPI, whereas NeoOasp monkeys had severe dampening of startle responses and impaired PPI at shorter prepulse intervals. These results support prior evidence from rodent literature of the involvement of each of these areas in the development of the complex cortico-limbic circuit modulating sensory-motor gating and may shade light on the specific neural structures associated with deficits in PPI reported in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and post-traumatic disorders.

AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) with liquid -preserved stallion semen is a widely used reproductive technology. As the demand for AI doses of high-class stallions is transnational, they are frequently exposed to long-distance transport. Since recent studies in boars indicated that vibration emissions caused by transport negatively affected sperm quality in vitro, this study questioned whether sperm quality in stallions is similarly impaired. Furthermore, we investigated stallion and extender -related differences in the spermatozoa's resistance to transport -related quality loss. Stallion ejaculates (n = 30) were collected at a German AI center, split in half, and subsequently diluted to a final sperm concentration of 50 x 10(6 )sperm/mL using the semen extenders EquiPlus or Gent (both Minitub GmbH, Germany). Four 12 mL aliquots of each sample were filled in plastic syringes according to a split -sample design and exposed to vibration (Displacement index D-i = 3.0 +/- 0.1) at 5 C-degrees for 0 h (control), 3 h, 6 h or 9 h. All samples were stored for four days at 5 C after transport simulation and analyzed for total sperm motility, thermo-resistance, membrane integrity, and mitochondrial activity determined by flow cytometry as well as the pH. After calculating generalized linear mixed models for each sperm quality trait, a negative impact of the duration of transport simulation could be shown on total sperm motility (P = 0.001), thermo-resistance (P = 0.030), and the pH (P = 0.001). Simulated transport for 6 h and 9 h diminished sperm quality (P <= 0.01), with 9 h reducing thermo-resistance by 5 +/- 2.2% points (PP) for EquiPlus and sperm motility by 2.2 +/- 1.7 PP for Gent compared to the control group. In contrast, samples exposed to vibration for 3 h showed no decline in sperm quality (P > 0.05). The individual stallion influenced every semen trait (P < 0.05) and transport -related losses in sperm thermo-resistance of up to 15.9 PP were demonstrated. Furthermore, EquiPlus was superior to Gent in all semen assessments (P < 0.001). We conclude that in vitro sperm quality is impaired by vibration. As the quality loss depends on the transport time, we recommend keeping shipping time as short as possible especially for spermatozoa of stallions that are susceptible to vibration -induced sperm quality loss.

AB  - It has been declared that dopamine receptors within the hippocampal formation are involved in emotion, memory, and pain processing. Remarkably, both CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampal formation are involved in persistent peripheral nociceptive perception. A prior study showed that dopamine receptors within the hippocampal DG have a critical role in antinociception induced by forced swim stress (FSS), as a physical stressor, in the presence of formalin irritation. The present experiments were designed to assess whether dopaminergic receptors within the CA1 have any role in antinociceptive responses induced by restraint stress (RS) as a psychological stressor after applying the formalin test as an animal model of persistent inflammatory pain. The D1-and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists, SCH23390 and Sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/0.5 mu l), were injected into the CA1 areas of ninety-six male albino Wistar rats 5 min before a 3-h period of restraint stress. Ten min after stress termination, a 50-mu l formalin 2.5 % was subcutaneously injected into the plantar surface of the rat's hind paw to induce persistent inflammatory pain. Nociceptive behaviors in both phases of the formalin test were analyzed in the 5-min blocks for a 60-min period. The obtained results demonstrate that although RS could induce an antinociceptive response in both phases of the formalin test, microinjection of D1-and D2-like dopamine receptors, antagonists attenuated RS-induced analgesia. These results support the hypothesis that acute restraint stress could induce analgesia via dopaminergic projection to the CA1 region of the hippocampal formation.

AB  - The fulfillment of belonging needs underlies a variety of behaviors. In order to understand how social needs unmet during maturation shape everyday life, we examined social motivation and cognition in peripubertal rats, as a rodent model of adolescence, subjected to social isolation (SI) during early and early-to-mid adolescence. The behavioral correlates of social orientation (social space preference), sociability (preference for social over non-social novelty), and social novelty preference (SNP) were examined in group-housed (GH) and single-housed (SH) rats in a 3-chamber test. The response to social odors was examined to gain insights into the developmental role of social odors in motivated social behavior. Differentiation between appetitive (number of visits/approaches) and consummatory (exploratory time) aspects of motivated social behavior was done to determine which facet of social motivation characterizes maturation when social needs are met and which aspect dominates when social needs are unsatisfied. The SI-sensitive parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVI) in the hippocampus were examined using immunohistochemistry. The main findings are the following: (1) in GH rats, the preference for social space is not evident regardless of animals' age, while sociability becomes apparent in mid-adolescence strictly through consummatory behavior, along with complete SNP (appetitive, consummatory); (2) SH promotes staying in a social chamber/space regardless of animals' age and produces an appetitive preference for it only in early-adolescent animals; (3) SH promotes sociability (appetitive, consummatory) regardless of the animals' age and prevents the SNP; (4) the preference for a social odor is displayed in all the groups through consummatory behavior, while appetitive behavior is evident only in SH rats; (5) the response to social odors does not commensurate directly to the response to conspecifics; (6) SH does not influence PVI in the hippocampus, except in the case of early-adolescence when a transient decrease in the dentate gyrus is observed. These results accentuate the developmental complexity of social motivation and cognition, and the power of SI in adolescence to infringe social maturation at different functional levels, promoting appetitive behavior toward peers overall but harming the interest for social novelty. The findings emphasize the importance of the fulfillment of basic social needs in the navigation through the social world.

AB  - Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) production supplies the deep limb of the global overturning circulation and ventilates the deep ocean. While the Weddell and Ross Seas are recognized as key sites for AABW production, additional sources have been discovered in coastal polynya regions around East Antarctica, most recently at Vincennes Bay. Vincennes Bay, despite encompassing two distinct polynya regions, is considered the weakest source, producing Dense Shelf Water (DSW) only just dense enough to contribute to the lighter density classes of AABW found offshore. Here we provide the first detailed oceanographic observations of the continental shelf in Vincennes Bay (104-111 degrees E), using CTD data from instrumented elephant seals spanning from February to November of 2012. We find that Vincennes Bay has East Antarctica's warmest recorded intrusions of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) and that warm mCDW drives basal melt under Vanderford and Underwood ice shelves. Our study also provides the first direct observational evidence for the inflow of meltwater to this region, which increases stratification and hinders DSW formation, and thus AABW production. The Vincennes Bay glaciers, together with the Totten Glacier, drain part of the Aurora Basin, which holds up to 7 m of sea level rise equivalent. Our results highlight the vulnerability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to intrusions of mCDW.

AB  - The nervous systems of manatees are strikingly unique across multiple dimensions. Manatees have the largest lissencephalic (smooth) brains in the animal kingdom, and demonstrate unusual somatosensory anatomy and physiology in the peripheral and central nervous system. As a rare aquatic herbivore sharing ancestry with modern elephants, manatee evolutionary history and behavioral ecology diverges substantially from that of other marine mammal clades, and their nervous system has adapted to the specific challenges they face. Although they are difficult to access for controlled behavioral study, prior neurobiological work has provided insight into manatee cognition. Here we review the evidence on manatee peripheral and central nervous function and present novel preliminary post-mortem diffusion MRI findings on whole-brain patterns of connectivity. Compared to another marine mammal, the California sea lion, manatee brains show apparently reduced corticocortical complexity. This may help explain their lissencephaly and relate to hypothesized reduced radial glial cell activity during neurodevelopment. Despite this apparently "simple" brain, manatees in the wild show some cognitively sophisticated behaviors, particularly in the realm of navigation. Future work in manatees should examine local and global brain connectivity related to spatial navigation and other complex cognitive capabilities.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that a temporary period of circadian arrhythmia would transiently impair recall of an aversive memory in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). Unlike mice or rats, circadian arrhythmia is easily induced in this species by a one-time manipulation of their ambient lighting [i.e., the disruptive phase shift (DPS) protocol]. Hamsters were conditioned to associate footshocks with a shock chamber (context) and with a predictive auditory tone (cue), and then exposed to the DPS protocol. Following DPS, animals either became arrhythmic (ARR), reentrained to the light-dark cycle (ENT), or became arrhythmic for < 14 days before their circadian locomotor rhythms spontaneously recovered and reentrained (ARR-ENT). Tests for contextual memory showed that freezing was decreased 9-10 days post-DPS when both ARR and ARR-ENT groups were arrhythmic. Once ARR-ENT animals reentrained (day 41), however, freezing was elevated back to Pre-DPS levels and did not differ from those observed in ENT hamsters. ENT animals maintained high levels of freezing at both time points, whereas, freezing remained low in ARR hamsters. In contrast to contextual responses, cued responses were unaffected by circadian arrhythmia; all three groups exhibited elevated levels of freezing in response to the tones. The differential impact of circadian arrhythmia on contextual versus cued associative memory suggests that arrhythmia preferentially impacts memory processes that depend on the hippocampus.

AB  - Studies of positional behavior, gait, and habitat use are important for understanding how animals adapt to the challenges of their environment. In turn, this information is useful for advancing research on primate morphology, life history, and ecology. Data on eco-mechanical variables can be used to develop concrete conservation and management plans for understudied and threatened primate groups. The present study explores the positional behavior, gaits, and habitat use of male and female adult golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana), an endemic, endangered, and highly dimorphic species of central China. Using focal animal sampling and opportunistic videorecording in the Guanyinshan National Nature Reserve on the southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains, it was determined that gait parameters were largely the same between sexes. By contrast, habitat use and, to a lesser extent, positional behavior varied significantly between males and females. In general, males were more terrestrial than females. When they moved arboreally, males also used a greater proportion of horizontal and large substrates compared to females. Furthermore, males used more standing postures, forelimb suspensory positional behaviors, and quadrupedal walking. These data suggest that, when faced with the mechanical challenges of large body size, primates such as R. roxellana are more likely to respond by altering habitat use rather than positional behaviors or intrinsic kinematics and timing.

AB  - Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane proteins, which play an important role in water homeostasis in the uterus. According to the literature, the expression of aquaporins in reproductive structures depends on the local hormonal milieu. The current study investigated the effect of selected PKA kinase inhibitor H89 and MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059, on the expression of AQP1, 2, 5, and 7, and steroid hormones (E-2), progesterone (P-4), and arachidonic acid (AA) in the porcine endometrium on days 18-20 and 2-4 of the estrous cycle (the follicular phase where estrogen and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are secreted increasingly in preparation for estrus and the luteal phase where the ovarian follicles begin the process of luteinization with the formation of the corpus luteum and progesterone secretion, respectively). The luminal epithelial cells were incubated in vitro in the presence of the aforementioned factors. The expression of mRNA was determined by the quantitative real-time PCR technique. In general, in Experiment 1, steroid hormones significantly increased expression of AQP1, 2, and 5 while arachidonic acid increased expression of AQP2 and AQP7. On the other hand, MAPK kinase inhibitor significantly decreased the expression of AQP1 and 5. In Experiment 2, E-2, P-4, or AA combined with kinase inhibitors differentially affected on AQPs expression. E-2 in combination with PKA inhibitor significantly decreased expression of AQP1 but E-2 or P-4 combined with this inhibitor increased the expression of AQP5 and 7. On the contrary, E-2 with PD98059 significantly increased AQP5 and AQP7 expression. Progesterone in combination with MAPK kinase inhibitor significantly downregulated the expression of AQP5 and upregulated AQP7. Arachidonic acid mixed with H89 or PD98059 caused a decrease in the expression of AQP5 and an increase of AQP7. The obtained results indicate that estradiol, progesterone, and arachidonic acid through PKA and MAPK signaling pathways regulate the expression of AQP1 and AQP5 in the porcine luminal epithelial cells in the periovulatory period.

AB  - Background: Exposure to arsenic (As) is a major public health challenge worldwide. Chronic exposure to As can cause various human health effects, including skin diseases, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and cancer. Studies have shown that As exposure can lead to disturbances in the balance of trace elements in the body. Moreover, As readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and can be enriched in the hippocampus and cortex, causing neurotoxic damage. At present, there are few reports on the effect of As on trace element levels in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, we sought to explore As-induced neurotoxicity and the effects of As on CNS trace element levels. Methods: An As-induced neurological injury model in rats was established by feeding As chow for 90 days of continuous exposure, and 19 elements were detected in the hippocampus and cortex of As-exposed rats by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: The results showed that the As levels in the hippocampus and cortex of As-exposed rats were significantly higher than those in the control group, The As levels in the cortex were significantly higher than in the hippocampus group. The levels of Cd, Ho, and Rb were increased in the hippocampus and decreased in Au, Ba, Ce, Cs, Pd, Se, Sr, and Tl in the As-exposed group, while the levels of Cd and Rb were increased and Se and Au were decreased in the cortex. Significant gender differences in the effects of As on hippocampal Cd, Ba, Rb, and Sr, and cortical Cd and Mo. Conclusion: It is suggested that elemental imbalance may be a risk factor for developing As toxicity plays a synergistic or antagonistic role in As-induced toxicity and is closely related to As-induced CNS damage.

AB  - Previous studies have found that amphiregulin (AREG) may participate in eye elongation during the development of myopia, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we tested tear concentrations of AREG in adults and detected the role of AREG in scleral remodeling in form-deprivation myopia (FDM) in guinea pigs. We found the tear concentrations of AREG in myopes were significantly higher than those in emmetropes using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tear concentrations of AREG were negatively correlated with spherical equivalent refraction and positively correlated with axial length (AL) and AL/corneal radii. We then used RNAi, DNA transfection and PD98059 treatments to determine the effects of AREG on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) in primary scleral fibroblasts (SFs). The hypothesis was further verified via loss- and gain-of-function experiments by intravitreal application of anti-AREG antibody (anti-AR) or AREG in form-deprivation eyes in guinea pigs. Immunofluorescence assay was used for cell type identification. Western-blot and q-PCR were used for the detection of relative expressions. Transmission electron microscopy was performed for posterior scleral observation. In vitro, we found AREG overexpression increased phospho-ERK1/2 and MMP-2 expression, while depletion of AREG inhibited their expressions. PD98059 (an effective ERK1/2 inhibitor) inhibited AREG-induced MMP-2 upregulation. In vivo, we found anti-AR treatments suppressed FDM by inhibiting scleral remodeling, while AREG treatments promoted FDM. Our results suggest that AREG in tear fluids can serve as a potential biomarker in myopes. AREG is involved in scleral remodeling through the ERK1/2-MMP-2 pathway. AREG is a potential target for myopia control.

AB  - A fundamental shift in neuroscience suggests bidirectional interaction of gut microbiota with the healthy and dysfunctional brain. This microbiota-gut-brain axis has mainly been investigated in stress-related psychopathology (e.g. depression, anxiety). The hippocampus, a key structure in both the healthy brain and psychopathologies, is implicated by work in rodents that suggests gut microbiota substantially impact hippocampaldependent learning and memory. However, understanding microbiota-hippocampus mechanisms in health and disease, and translation to humans, is hampered by the absence of a coherent evaluative approach. We review the current knowledge regarding four main gut microbiota-hippocampus routes in rodents: through the vagus nerve; via the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis; by metabolism of neuroactive substances; and through modulation of host inflammation. Next, we suggest an approach including testing (biomarkers of) the four routes as a function of the influence of gut microbiota (composition) on hippocampal-dependent (dys)functioning. We argue that such an approach is necessary to proceed from the current state of preclinical research to beneficial application in humans to optimise microbiota-based strategies to treat and enhance hippocampal-dependent memory (dys)functions.

AB  - Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for multiple neurodevelopmental disorders; however, animal models developed to explore MIA mechanisms are sensitive to experimental factors, which has led to complexity in previous reports of the MIA phenotype. We sought to characterize an MIA protocol throughout development to understand how prenatal immune insult alters the trajectory of important neurodevelopmental processes, including the microglial regulation of synaptic spines and complement signaling. We used polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) to induce MIA on gestational day 9.5 in CD-1 mice, and measured their synaptic spine density, microglial synaptic pruning, and complement protein expression. We found reduced dendritic spine density in the somatosensory cortex starting at 3-weeks-of-age with requisite increases in microglial synaptic pruning and phagocytosis, suggesting spine density loss was caused by increased microglial synaptic pruning. Additionally, we showed dysregulation in complement protein expression persisting into adulthood. Our findings highlight disruptions in the prenatal environment leading to alterations in multiple dynamic processes through to postnatal development. This could potentially suggest developmental time points during which synaptic processes could be measured as risk factors or targeted with therapeutics for neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the biological efficacy of cochlioquinone-9 (cq-9), a plant secondary metabolite, for controlling white-backed planthopper (WBPH) and compared the gene expression levels following cq-9 treatment. The results show that cq-9 enhances plant growth against WBPH and is associated with aromatic amino acid-related plant defense genes. This demonstrates the potential of cq-9 to replace chemical pesticides and suggests a new method for controlling WBPH. Rice is exposed to various biotic stresses in the natural environment. The white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera, WBPH) is a pest that causes loss of rice yield and threatens the global food supply. In most cases, pesticides are used to control WBPH. However, excessive use of pesticides increases pesticide resistance to pests and causes environmental pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to develop natural product-based pesticides to control WBPH. Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites for protection. Secondary metabolites act as a defense against pathogens and pests and are valuable as pesticides and breeding materials. Cochlioquinone is a secondary metabolite that exhibits various biological activities, has a negative effect on the growth and development of insects, and contributes to plant defense. Here, we compared plant growth after treatment with cochlioquinone-9 (cq-9), a quinone family member. cq-9 improved the ability of plants to resist WBPH and had an effect on plant growth. Gene expression analysis revealed that cq-9 interacts with various defense-related genes to confer resistance to WBPH, suggesting that it is related to flavonoid compounds. Overall, this study provides insight into the mechanisms of WBPH resistance and suggests that cq-9 represents an environmentally friendly agent for WBPH control.

AB  - Members of the genus Sarcocystis are protozoan parasites that infect mammals, birds, and reptiles. Sarcocystis spp. have an obligatory two-host prey-predator life cycle. Sarcocysts form in the muscles and central nervous system of the intermediate host, while oocysts and sporocysts develop in the small intestine of the definitive host. There is a lack of studies on omnivorous birds of family Corvidae as potential definitive hosts of Sarcocystis spp. Until now, only S. ovalis has been confirmed to be transmitted via corvids. In the current study, 91 small intestine samples from six corvid species from Lithuania were examined for the presence of Sarcocystis spp. that use birds, carnivorous mammals, and cervids as intermediate hosts. Oocysts of Sarcocystis spp. were observed in 43 samples (47.3%) using a light microscope. Based on molecular methods, 11 Sarcocystis spp., (S. columbae, S. cornixi, S. halieti, S. kutkienae, S. lari, S. turdusi, S. wobeseri, S. arctica, S. lutrae, S. ovalis, and S. oviformis) were identified. These results indicate that corvids may transmit some species of Sarcocystis that use birds and mammals as intermediate hosts.
   Members of the family Corvidae are ecologically flexible omnivorous birds, particularly adaptive to urban habitats, and living in proximity to humans; these birds may serve as definitive hosts (DH) for Sarcocystis spp., but research about this is lacking. In the present study, intestinal samples from 91 corvids collected in Lithuania were molecularly tested by species-specific PCR targeting the ITS1 and cox1 genes and subsequently sequenced for the presence of Sarcocystis spp. Under a light microscope, oocysts of Sarcocystis spp. were observed in 43 samples (47.3%), while molecular methods, detected Sarcocystis spp. in 77 birds (84.6%). Eleven Sarcocystis spp. (S. columbae, S. cornixi, potentially pathogenic S. halieti, S. kutkienae, S. lari, S. turdusi, S. wobeseri, S. arctica, S. lutrae, S. ovalis, and S. oviformis) were identified in the intestinal samples from six corvid species from Lithuania. Infections with multiple Sarcocystis spp. were detected in 79.2% of the infected corvid birds. Three of the identified Sarcocystis spp. use corvids as intermediate hosts (IH); therefore, corvids may serve as IH and DH of the same Sarcocystis species. Based on molecular results and on corvid diet, omnivorous corvids may play an important role in transmitting Sarcocystis spp.

AB  - Gut enzymes can metabolize plant defense compounds and thereby affect the growth and fitness of insect herbivores. Whether these enzymes also influence feeding preference is largely unknown. We studied the metabolization of taraxinic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G), a sesquiterpene lactone of the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) that deters its major root herbivore, the common cockchafer larva (Melolontha melolontha). We have demonstrated that TA-G is rapidly deglucosylated and conjugated to glutathione in the insect gut. A broad-spectrum M. melolontha beta-glucosidase, Mm_bGlc17, is sufficient and necessary for TA-G deglucosylation. Using cross-species RNA interference, we have shown that Mm_bGlc17 reduces TA-G toxicity. Furthermore, Mm_bGlc17 is required for the preference of M. melolontha larvae for TA-G-deficient plants. Thus, herbivore metabolism modulates both the toxicity and deterrence of a plant defense compound. Our work illustrates the multifaceted roles of insect digestive enzymes as mediators of plant-herbivore interactions.
   eLife digest Plants produce certain substances to fend off attackers like plant-feeding insects. To stop these compounds from damaging their own cells, plants often attach sugar molecules to them. When an insect tries to eat the plant, the plant removes the stabilizing sugar, 'activating' the compounds and making them toxic or foul-tasting. Curiously, some insects remove the sugar themselves, but it is unclear what consequences this has, especially for insect behavior. Dandelions, Taraxacum officinale, make high concentrations of a sugar-containing defense compound in their roots called taraxinic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, or TA-G for short. TA-G deters the larvae of the Maybug - a pest also known as the common cockchafer or the doodlebug - from eating dandelion roots. When Maybug larvae do eat TA-G, it is found in their systems without its sugar. However, it is unclear whether it is the plant or the larva that removes the sugar. A second open question is how the sugar removal process affects the behavior of the Maybug larvae. Using chemical analysis and genetic manipulation, Huber et al. investigated what happens when Maybug larvae eat TA-G. This revealed that the acidity levels in the larvae's digestive system deactivate the proteins from the dandelion that would normally remove the sugar from TA-G. However, rather than leaving the compound intact, larvae remove the sugar from TA-G themselves. They do this using a digestive enzyme, known as a beta-glucosidase, that cuts through sugar. Removing the sugar from TA-G made the compound less toxic, allowing the larvae to grow bigger, but it also increased TA-G's deterrent effects, making the larvae less likely to eat the roots. Any organism that eats plants, including humans, must deal with chemicals like TA-G in their food. Once inside the body, enzymes can change these chemicals, altering their effects. This happens with many medicines, too. In the future, it might be possible to design compounds that activate only in certain species, or under certain conditions. Further studies in different systems may aid the development of new methods of pest control, or new drug treatments.

AB  - In this study, keratins were extracted from pig nail waste through the reduction method using L-cysteine as a reductant. Curcumin was successively incorporated in a mixed solution including keratin, gelatin, and glycerin to prepare different kinds of keratin/gelatin/glycerin/curcumin composite films. The morphology of the keratin/ gelatin/glycerin/curcumin composite films were examined using scanning electron microscopy. The structures and the molecular interactions between curcumin, keratin, and pectin were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, and the thermal properties were determined through thermogravimetric analysis. The tensile strengths of keratin/gelatin/glycerin/curcumin and keratin/gelatin/curcumin composite films are 13.73 and 12.45 MPa, respectively, and their respective elongations at break are 56.7% and 4.6%. In addition, compared with the control group (no film wrapped on the surface of tomato), the ratio of weight loss of the keratin (7.0%)/gelatin (10%)/glycerin (2.0%)/curcumin (1.0%) experimental groups is 8.76 +/- 0.2%, and the hardness value of the tomatoes wrapped with composite films is 11.2 +/- 0.39 kg/cm(3). Finally, the composite films have a superior antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli because of the addition of curcumin. As the concentration of curcumin reaches 1.0%, the antibacterial activity effect of the film is significantly improved. The diameter of the inhibition zone of E. coli is (12.16 +/- 0.53) mm, and that of S. aureus is (14.532 +/- 0.97) mm. The multifunctional keratin/gelatin/glycerin/curcumin bioactive films have great potential application in the food packaging industry.

AB  - Mannheimia haemolytica is the main etiological bacterial agent in ruminant respiratory disease. M. haemolytica secretes leukotoxin, lipopolysaccharides, and proteases, which may be targeted to treat infections. We recently reported the purification and in vivo detection of a 110 kDa Zn metalloprotease with collagenase activity (110-Mh metalloprotease) in a sheep with mannheimiosis, and this protease may be an important virulence factor. Due to the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant strains of M. haemolytica, new alternatives to antibiotics are being explored; one option is lactoferrin (Lf), which is a multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein from the innate immune system of mammals. Bovine apo-lactoferrin (apo-bLf) possesses many properties, and its bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects have been highlighted. The present study was conducted to investigate whether apo-bLf inhibits the secretion and proteolytic activity of the 110-Mh metalloprotease. This enzyme was purified and sublethal doses of apo-bLf were added to cultures of M. haemolytica or co-incubated with the 110-Mh metalloprotease. The collagenase activity was evaluated using zymography and azocoll assays. Our results showed that apo-bLf inhibited the secretion and activity of the 110-Mh metalloprotease. Molecular docking and overlay assays showed that apo-bLf bound near the active site of the 110-Mh metalloprotease, which affected its enzymatic activity.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of the active substance of green tea, epigallocatechin-3gallate (EGCG), on behavioral phenotypes and markers of neurogenesis in an Alzheimer disease (AD) rat model. The groups included sham, AD, and three AD groups receiving orally EGCG with different doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg. The AD model was induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozocin (STZ) at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Real-time PCR assay was used for evaluating the expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of animals. STZ disrupted the function of animals in MWM acquisition phase by almost 65 % and all doses of EGCG could return the learning parameters to those of control animals. STZ also impaired the memory function (P < 0.05) and a dose of 25 mg/kg EGCG could significantly return it to the control level (29 % vs 53 %, P < 0.01). Hippocampal APP gene expression was increased in the AD group and EGCG with dose 25 mg/kg decreased it significantly (P < 0.05). AD animals had decreased levels of hippocampal BDNF and treating with dose 25 mg/kg of EGCG could significantly increase it (P < 0.05). EGCG with dose 25 mg/kg can improve spatial memory deficits in AD model rats. It may be due to the impact on the expression of hippocampal factors involved in AD pathology. These findings could provide a beneficial insight for developing novel, safe, and efficient natural compounds for preventing or alleviation AD symptoms in humans.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency primarily due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. The prevailing treatment for T1DM involves daily subcutaneous insulin injections, but a substantial proportion of patients face challenges such as severe hypoglycemic episodes and poorly controlled hyperglycemia. For T1DM patients, a more effective therapeutic option involves the replacement of beta-cells through allogeneic transplantation of either the entire pancreas or isolated pancreatic islets. Unfortunately, the scarcity of transplantable human organs has led to a growing list of patients waiting for an islet transplant. One potential alternative is xenotransplantation of porcine pancreatic islets. However, due to inter-species molecular incompatibilities, porcine tissues trigger a robust immune response in humans, leading to xenograft rejection. Several promising strategies aim to overcome this challenge and enhance the long-term survival and functionality of xenogeneic islet grafts. These strategies include the use of islets derived from genetically modified pigs, immunoisolation of islets by encapsulation in biocompatible materials, and the creation of an immunomodulatory microenvironment by co-transplanting islets with accessory cells or utilizing immunomodulatory biomaterials. This review concentrates on delineating the primary obstacles in islet xenotransplantation and elucidates the fundamental principles and recent breakthroughs aimed at addressing these challenges.
   Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) arises from insulin deficiency resulting from the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Treatment usually entails daily insulin injections, but challenges endure. Allogeneic pancreatic islet transplantation holds promise, yet its viability is constrained by organ scarcity. Xenotransplantation of porcine islets provides an alternative, impeded by immune rejection. Strategies such as genetic modification and immunoisolation aim to improve graft survival, explored in this review (created with Biorender.com). image

AB  - Polyamine oxidase (PAO) is a key enzyme maintaining polyamine homeostasis, which affects plant physiological activities. Until now, the gene members and function of PAOs in tea (Camellia sinenesis) have not been fully identified. Here, through the expression in Escherichia coli and Nicotiana benthamiana, we identified six genes annotated as CsPAO in tea genome and transcriptome and determined their enzyme reaction modes and gene expression profiles in tea cultivar "Yinghong 9'. We found that CsPAO1,2,3 could catalyze spermine, thermospermine, and norspermidine, and CsPAO2,3 could catalyze spermidine in the back-conversion mode, which indicated that the precursor of gamma-aminobutyric acid might originate from the oxidation of putrescin but not spermidine. We further investigated the changes of CsPAO activity with temperature and pH and their stability. Kinetic parameters suggested that CsPAO2 was the major PAO modifying polyamine composition in tea, and it could be inactivated by beta- hydroxyethylhydrazine and aminoguanidine. Putrescine content and CsPAO2 expression were high in tea flowers. CsPAO2 responded to wound, drought, and salt stress; CsPAO1 might be the main member responding to cold stress; anoxia induced CsPAO3. We conclude that in terms of phylogenetic tree, enzyme characteristics, and expression profile, CsPAO2 might be the dominant CsPAO in the polyamine degradation pathway.

AB  - Understanding radiation-induced non-cancer effects on the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for the risk assessment of medical (e.g., radiotherapy) and occupational (e.g., nuclear workers and astronauts) exposures. Herein, the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) approach was used to consolidate relevant studies in the area of cognitive decline for identification of research gaps, countermeasure development, and for eventual use in risk assessments. AOPs are an analytical construct describing critical events to an adverse outcome (AO) in a simplified form beginning with a molecular initiating event (MIE). An AOP was constructed utilizing mechanistic information to build empirical support for the key event relationships (KERs) between the MIE of deposition of energy to the AO of learning and memory impairment through multiple key events (KEs). The evidence for the AOP was acquired through a documented scoping review of the literature. In this AOP, the MIE is connected to the AO via six KEs: increased oxidative stress, increased deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks, altered stress response signaling, tissue resident cell activation, increased pro-inflammatory mediators, and abnormal neural remodeling that encompasses atypical structural and functional alterations of neural cells and surrounding environment. Deposition of energy directly leads to oxidative stress, increased DNA strand breaks, an increase of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue resident cell activation. These KEs, which are themselves interconnected, can lead to abnormal neural remodeling impacting learning and memory processes. Identified knowledge gaps include improving quantitative understanding of the AOP across several KERs and additional testing of proposed modulating factors through experimental work. Broadly, it is envisioned that the outcome of these efforts could be extended to other cognitive disorders and complement ongoing work by international radiation governing bodies in their review of the system of radiological protection.

AB  - The phenotypic characteristics and meat quality of skeletal muscles are collectively determined by muscle cells and their intricate interactions with the extracellular microenvironment. In this study, we evaluated muscle fiber phenotypes in the longissimus dorsi (HC-L) and psoas major (HC-P) of Hechuan black pigs. The results revealed significant differences in muscle fiber diameter, density, and type (P < 0.05). Subsequently, co-culture experiments with myoblasts demonstrated that skeletal muscle-derived exosomes (SKM-Exos) promoted myoblast proliferation and differentiation with P-Exo exhibiting superior efficacy in promoting the augmentation of MyHCIIa fiber. Furthermore, SKM-Exos are inherently heterogeneous, and the microRNAs (miRNAs) present in SKM-Exos are selectively coated. Notably, the expression of miR-4331-3p was significantly higher in SKM-Exos than in the corresponding skeletal muscles. The expression of miR-4331-3p was significantly elevated in the SKM-Exos of HC-L compared to that of HC-P, and it interacted with differentially expressed genes between HC-L and HC-P. Moreover, miR-4331-3p enhanced myoblast proliferation and inhibited differentiation. Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular processes that contribute to meat formation, including intricate cellular interactions.

AB  - The delicate balance of trace mineral supplementation is critical for optimizing rumen function and overall ruminant health. This study evaluated the solubility of an advanced chelate technology-based supplement and assessed its impact on rumen degradability and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) when replacing inorganic sources. The solubility of the advanced trace minerals supplement (ACTM) was assessed at pH 5 and pH 2. In situ ruminal degradability of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and fiber fractions was evaluated using two fistulated rams fed diets supplemented with either ACTM or inorganic trace minerals. ATTD was determined in 6 lambs fed diets supplemented with 100% ACTM, 50% ACTM, and 50% inorganic (50% ACTM), or 100% inorganic sources in a Latin square design. Results showed solubilities ranging from 6.75% to 11.81% at pH 5, increasing to 69.24% to 80.47% at pH 2. ACTM supplementation significantly enhanced the rumen degradability of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) at 6 h of incubation (p <= 0.05). The 100% ACTM treatment significantly decreased rumen pH (p = 0.051) and improved DM, OM, NDF, and ADF digestibility, as well as trace mineral absorbability compared to 100% inorganic (p <= 0.05). These findings highlight the potential of ACTM supplementation to enhance ruminal degradability, promote better trace mineral absorption, and improve the ATTD of nutrients compared to inorganic sources.

AB  - Background: Synapses can adapt to changes in the intracerebral microenvironment by regulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor expression following hypoxic ischemia (HI) injury. The peptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) exerts a protective effect on neurons after HI and may be involved in maintaining the function of synaptic networks. In this study, we investigated the changes in the expression of NAAG, glutamic acid (Glu) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), as well as the dynamic regulation of neurotransmitters in the brain after HI, and assessed their effects on synaptic plasticity of the cerebral cortex.
   Methods: Thirty-six Yorkshire newborn pigs (3-day-old, males, 1.0-1.5 kg) were selected and randomly divided into normal saline (NS) group (n = 18) and glutamate carboxypeptidase II inhibition group (n = 18), both groups were divided into control group, 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h and 48-72 h groups (all n = 3) according to different post-HI time. The content of Glu and NAAG after HI injury were detected by 1H-MRS scanning, immunofluorescence staining of mGluRs, synaptophysin (syph) along with postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) and transmission electron microscopy were performed. ANOVA, Tukey and LSD test were used to compare the differences in metabolite and protein expression levels among subgroups. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson analysis with a significance level of alpha = 0.05.
   Results: We observed that the NAAG and mGluR3 expression levels in the brain increased and then decreased after HI and was significantly higher in the 12-24 h (P < 0.05, Tukey test). There was a significant positive correlation between Glu content and the expression of mGluR1/mGluR5 after HI with r = 0.521 (P = 0.027) and r = 0.477 (P = 0.045), respectively. NAAG content was significantly and positively correlated with the level of mGluR3 expression (r = 0.472, P = 0.048). When hydrolysis of NAAG was inhibited, the expression of synaptic protein PSD95 and syph decreased significantly.
   Conclusions: After 12-24 h of HI injury, there was a one-time elevation in NAAG levels, which was consistent with the corresponding mGluR3 receptor expression trend; the NAAG maintains cortical synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter homeostasis by inhibiting presynaptic glutamate vesicle release, regulating postsynaptic density proteins and postsynaptic receptor expression after pathway activation.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of neural networks and their response to external stimuli is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms associated with learning processes. In this study, we hypothesized that electrical stimulation (ES) would lead to significant alterations in the activity patterns of hippocampal neuronal networks and investigated the effects of low-frequency ES on hippocampal neuronal populations using the microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Our findings revealed significant alterations in the activity of hippocampal neuronal networks following low-frequency ES trainings. Post-stimulation, the neural activity exhibited an organized burst firing pattern characterized by increased spike and burst firings, increased synchronization, and enhanced learning behaviors. Analysis of peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) further revealed that low-frequency ES (1Hz) significantly enhanced neural plasticity, thereby facilitating the learning process of cultured neurons, whereas high-frequency ES (>10Hz) impeded this process. Moreover, we observed a substantial increase in correlations and connectivity within neuronal networks following ES trainings. These alterations in network properties indicated enhanced synaptic plasticity and emphasized the positive impact of low-frequency ES on hippocampal neural activities, contributing to the brain's capacity for learning and memory.

AB  - Global warming is predicted to have major effects on the annual time windows during which species may successfully reproduce. At the organismal level, climatic shifts engage with the control mechanism for reproductive seasonality. In mammals, laboratory studies on neuroendocrine mechanism emphasize photoperiod as a predictive cue, but this is based on a restricted group of species. In contrast, field-oriented comparative analyses demonstrate that proximate bioenergetic effects on the reproductive axis are a major determinant of seasonal reproductive timing. The interaction between proximate energetic and predictive photoperiodic cues is neglected. Here, we focused on photoperiodic modulation of postnatal reproductive development in common voles (Microtus arvalis), a herbivorous species in which a plastic timing of breeding is well documented. We demonstrate that temperature-dependent modulation of photoperiodic responses manifest in the thyrotrophin-sensitive tanycytes of the mediobasal hypothalamus. Here, the photoperiod-dependent expression of type 2 deiodinase expression, associated with the summer phenotype was enhanced by 21 degrees C, whereas the photoperiod-dependent expression of type 3 deiodinase expression, associated with the winter phenotype, was enhanced by 10 degrees C in spring voles. Increased levels of testosterone were found at 21 degrees C, whereas somatic and gonadal growth were oppositely affected by temperature. The magnitude of these temperature effects was similar in voles photoperiodical programmed for accelerated maturation (ie, born early in the breeding season) and in voles photoperiodical programmed for delayed maturation (ie, born late in the breeding season). The melatonin-sensitive pars tuberalis was relatively insensitive to temperature. These data define a mechanistic hierarchy for the integration of predictive temporal cues and proximate thermo-energetic effects in mammalian reproduction.

AB  - Environmental contamination and the resulting food contamination represent a serious problem and pose a major threat to animal and human health. The gastrointestinal tract is directly exposed to a variety of substances. One is glyphosate, whose presence in the soil is commonly observed. This study demonstrates the effects of low and high glyphosate doses on the populations of intramural neurons of the porcine descending colon. An analysis was performed on neurons ex-pressing the vasoactive intestinal peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, a neuronal isoform of nitrogen oxide synthase, and galanin. Even a low dose of glyphosate increased the number of neurons immunoreactive against the studied substances. However, the changes depended on both the plexus analysed and the substance tested. Meanwhile, a high glyphosate dose resulted in quantitative changes (an increase in the number) within neurons immunoreactive against all the studied neuropeptides/enzymes in the myenteric plexus and both submucosal plexuses. The response of the enteric nervous system in the form of an increase in the number of neurons immunoreactive against neuroprotective substances may suggest that glyphosate has a toxic effect on enteric neurons which attempt to increase their survivability through the released neuroprotective substances.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine whether the nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio had any influence on the timing of embryo compaction and blastocoel formation, as well as formation rate and quality of blastocyst. First, we produced embryos with increased N/C ratio by removal of approximately one-third of the cytoplasm and with decreased N/C ratio by doubling the oocyte cytoplasm with an enucleated oocyte. The initiation of compaction and cavitation in reduced cytoplasm group was significantly earlier (P < 0.05) compared with the control and doubled cytoplasm groups. The rate of blastocysts in the reduced cytoplasm and doubled cytoplasm groups was significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Blastocyst quality in terms of total cell number in the reduced cytoplasm group was significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared with the doubled cytoplasm group, but not different from the control group. Next, we produced embryos with various N/C ratios by oocyte fusion combined with cytochalasin D treatment. The onset of compaction and cavitation in the 2N/2C group (decreased N/C ratio) was significantly delayed (P < 0.05) or had the tendency to be delayed (P = 0.064), respectively, compared with the control group (2N/1C). A significantly higher rate of blastocyst was observed in the 4N/2C group compared with the 1N/1C group (P < 0.05) but not different from the remaining groups. These results demonstrated that an increase in N/C ratio caused an earlier occurrence of morula compaction and blastocyst formation in both in vitro fertilization (IVF) and parthenogenetically activated pig embryos.

AB  - Aggregation of beta-amyloid (A beta 42) peptide in the neural extracellular space leads to cellular dysfunction, resulting in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hydrophobic core of the amyloidogenic A beta 42 peptide contains aromatic residues that play an important role in the self-assembly and subsequent aggregation of the peptide. Hence, targeting these hydrophobic core residues by potent low molecular agents can be a promising therapeutic approach toward AD. In the current work, we have developed self-fluorescent solo tryptophan nanoparticles (TNPs) as nanotheranostic systems against AD. We demonstrated that TNPs could significantly inhibit as well as disrupt the fibrils formed by both A beta 42 peptide and another reductionist approach-based amyloid model dipeptide, phenylalanine-phenylalanine (FF). More importantly, these nanostructures were nontoxic to neural cells and could protect the neurons from A beta 42 peptide and FF aggregate-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, efficacy studies performed in animal model further revealed that the TNPs could rescue spatial and learning memory in intracerebroventricular streptozotocinadministration-induced AD phenotype in rats. Moreover, our pharmacokinetics study further established the BBB permeability and brain delivery potency of TNPs. The inherent excellent fluorescent properties of these nanoparticles could be exploited further to use them as imaging modalities for tagging and detecting FF and A beta 42 peptide fibrils. Overall, our results clearly illustrated that the solo TNPs could serve as promising nanotheranostic agents for AD therapy.

AB  - Prion disorders, or transmissible spongiform encephalophaties (TSE), are fatal neurodegenerative diseases affecting mammals. Prion-infectious particles comprise of misfolded pathological prion proteins (PrPTSE). Different TSEs are associated with distinct PrPTSE folds called prion strains. The high resistance of prions to conventional sterilization increases the risk of prion transmission in medical, veterinary and food industry practices. Recently, we have demonstrated the ability of disulfonated hydroxyaluminum phthalocyanine to photodynamically inactivate mouse RML prions by generated singlet oxygen. Herein, we studied the efficiency of three phthalocyanine derivatives in photodynamic treatment of seven mouse adapted prion strains originating from sheep, human, and cow species. We report the different susceptibilities of the strains to photodynamic oxidative elimination of PrPTSE epitopes: RML, A139, Fu-1 > mBSE, mvCJD > ME7, 22L. The efficiency of the phthalocyanine derivatives in the epitope elimination also differed (AlPcOH(SO3)(2) > ZnPc(SO3)(1-3) > SiPc(OH)(2)(SO3)(1-3)) and was not correlated to the yields of generated singlet oxygen. Our data suggest that the structural properties of both the phthalocyanine and the PrPTSE strain may affect the effectiveness of the photodynamic prion inactivation. Our finding provides a new option for the discrimination of prion strains and highlights the necessity of utilizing range of prion strains when validating the photodynamic prion decontamination procedures.

AB  - Learning and memory rely on changes in postsynaptic glutamergic a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazo-lepropionic acid (AMPA)-type receptor (AMPAR) number, spatial organization, and function. The Hippo pathway component WW and C2 domain-containing protein 1 (WWC1) regulates AMPAR surface expression and impacts on memory performance. However, synaptic binding partners of WWC1 and its hierarchical po-sition in AMPAR complexes are largely unclear. Using cell-surface proteomics in hippocampal tissue of Wwc1-deficient mice and by generating a hippocampus-specific interactome, we show that WWC1 is a major regulatory platform in AMPAR signaling networks. Under basal conditions, the Hippo pathway members WWC1 and large tumor-suppressor kinase (LATS) are associated, which might prevent WWC1 effects on synaptic proteins. Reduction of WWC1/LATS binding through a point mutation at WWC1 elevates the abundance of WWC1 in AMPAR complexes and improves hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Thus, uncoupling of WWC1 from the Hippo pathway to AMPAR-regulatory complexes provides an innovative strategy to enhance synaptic transmission.

AB  - Consolidation of initially encoded hippocampal representations in the neocortex through reactivation is crucial for long-term memory formation and is facilitated by the coordination of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) with cortical slow and spindle oscillations during non-REM sleep. Recent evidence suggests that high-frequency cortical ripples can also coordinate with hippocampal SWRs in support of consolidation; however, the contribution of cortical ripples to reactivation remains unclear. We used high-density, continuous recordings in the hippocampus (area CA1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) over the course of spatial learning and show that independent PFC ripples dissociated from SWRs are prevalent in NREM sleep and predominantly suppress hippocampal activity. PFC ripples paradoxically mediate top-down suppression of hippocampal reactivation rather than coordination, and this suppression is stronger for assemblies that are reactivated during coordinated CA1-PFC ripples for consolidation of recent experiences. Further, we show non-canonical, serial coordination of independent cortical ripples with slow and spindle oscillations, which are known signatures of memory consolidation. These results establish a role for prefrontal cortical ripples in top-down regulation of behaviorally relevant hippocampal representations during consolidation.

AB  - The present study aimed to assess the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and anti-depression impacts of Moringa oleifera Lam. leaf ethanolic extract (MOLE) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of CCl4-induced hepatic encephalopathy mouse model. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to detect marker compounds: rutin and beta-sitosterol. Animals were divided into four groups: vehicle group, CCl4-treated group, MOLE-treated group, and (CCl4 + MOLE) group treated with MOLE for 14 days before CCl4-induced neurotoxicity. MOLE decreased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, corticosterone, and ammonia levels in serum and improved the antioxidant status of CCl4-treated mice in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It reduced the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TLR2, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) genes and the protein levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. MOLE also attenuated apoptosis, as revealed by the reduced expression of caspase3, and prevented histological deterioration. Furthermore, MOLE attenuated CCl4-induced anxiety and depression-like behavioral changes. Collectively, MOLE modulates neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, TLR4/2-MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling, and apoptosis in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the hepatic encephalopathy experimental model.

AB  - The widespread cultivation of Camellia oleifera in subtropical regions has played a significant role in promoting economic development in southern China. In recent years, the cultivation area has continuously expanded, highlighting the importance of extracting Camellia oleifera plantations automatically and monitoring ecological changes in these regions. This study proposes a novel method based on deep learning, utilizing Sentinel-2 images for efficient assessing ecological quality of Camellia oleifera plantations. First, we undertook a comprehensive examination and assessment of different semantic segmentation models, utilizing a dataset of Camellia oleifera plantations that we compiled. The most effective segmentation model was then employed to automatically extract Camellia oleifera plantations in Shaoyang City. Finally, to gain a deeper understanding of the ecological status of Camellia oleifera plantations, the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) was introduced to analyse ecological changes from 2018 to 2022. The research results indicate that when the U-Net++ model is applied to extract Camellia oleifera plantations from Sentinel-2 images, its performance surpasses other semantic segmentation methods. This method achieves notable metrics: accuracy of 0.80, recall of 0.79, F1-Score of 0.81, and MIoU of 0.88, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying Camellia oleifera plantations. The research findings of Camellia oleifera plantations in Shaoyang City show a notable increase in the mean RSEI, with a rise from 0.166 in 2018 to 0.345 in 2022. Through the application of deep learning for automated Camellia oleifera plantation extraction and RSEI for ecological assessment, the study discovers a continuous expansion of Camellia oleifera plantations and a yearly increase in ecological quality.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Traditional Chinese medicine posits that affect-mind ill-being is the primary cause of depression, with Qi movement stagnation as its pathogenesis. As such, clinical treatment for depression should prioritize regulating Qi and relieving depressive symptoms. The pharmacological properties of traditional Chinese medicine indicate that Perilla frutescens may have potential therapeutic effects on depression and other neuropsychiatric diseases due to its ability to regulate Qi and alleviate depressive symptoms. Although previous studies have reported the antidepressant effects of Perilla frutescens, the mechanism underlying PFEO inhalation mediated antidepressant effect remains unclear.Aim of the study: The aim of this investigation is to elucidate the antidepressant mechanisms of PFEO by examining its effects on monoamine neurotransmitters and the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.Materials and methods: The CUMS rat model of depression was established, and the depressive state of the animals was assessed through sucrose preference and forced swim tests. ELISA assays were conducted to determine monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and RT-PCR experiments were employed to investigate the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway's regulation of depression via PFEO inhalation.Results: It has been observed that inhalation administration of PFEO can significantly enhance the preference for sugar water in CUMS rats and reduce their immobility time during forced swimming. Additionally, there was an increase in the levels of monoamine transmitters in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of these rats. Furthermore, there was an upregulation in the expression levels of BDNF and TrkB positive cells as well as BDNF and TrkB proteins within both regions, along with increased BDNF mRNA and TrkB mRNA expression levels. Conclusion: The antidepressant effect of PFEO via inhalation administration is speculated to be mediated through the monoamine neurotransmitters and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.

AB  - Intra-amniotic infections (IAI) are one of the reasons for preterm birth. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein with various physiological functions, including tissue healing. Its excessive extracellular release potentiates inflammatory reaction and can revert its action from beneficial to detrimental. We infected the amniotic fluid of a pig on the 80th day of gestation with 1 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFUs) of E. coli O55 for 10 h, and evaluated the appearance of HMGB1, receptor for glycation endproducts (RAGE), and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in the amniotic membrane and fluid. Sham-infected amniotic fluid served as a control. The expression and release of HMGB1 were evaluated by Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. The infection downregulated HMGB1 mRNA expression in the amniotic membrane, changed the distribution of HMGB1 protein in the amniotic membrane, and increased its level in amniotic fluid. All RAGE mRNA, protein expression in the amniotic membrane, and soluble RAGE level in the amniotic fluid were downregulated. TLR4 mRNA and protein expression and soluble TLR4 were all upregulated. HMGB1 is a potential target for therapy to suppress the exaggerated inflammatory response. This controlled expression and release can, in some cases, prevent the preterm birth of vulnerable infants. Studies on suitable animal models can contribute to the development of appropriate therapy.

AB  - Lignin accumulation can enhance the disease resistance of young tea shoots (Camellia sinensis). It also greatly reduces their tenderness, which indirectly affects the quality and yield of tea. Therefore, the regulation of lignin biosynthesis appears to be an effective way to balance tenderness and disease resistance in young tea shoots. In this study, we identified a laccase gene, CsLAC17, that is induced during tenderness reduction and gray blight infection in young tea shoots. Overexpression of CsLAC17 significantly increased the lignin content in transgenic Arabidopsis, enhancing their resistance to gray blight and decreasing stem tenderness. In addition, we found that CsLAC17 was negatively regulated by the upstream CsmiR397a by 5 '-RLM-RACE, dual-luciferase assay, and transient expression in young tea shoots. Interestingly, the expression of CsmiR397a was inhibited during tenderness reduction and gray blight infection of young tea shoots. Overexpression of CsmiR397a reduced lignin accumulation, resulting in decreased resistance to gray blight and increased stem tenderness in transgenic Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the transient overexpression of CsmiR397a and CsLAC17 in tea leaves directly confirms the function of the CsmiR397a-CsLAC17 module in lignin biosynthesis and its effect on disease resistance. These results suggest that the CsmiR397a-CsLAC17 module is involved in balancing tenderness and gray blight resistance in young tea shoots by regulating lignin biosynthesis.

AB  - Information on long-term effects of postovulatory oocyte aging (POA) on offspring is limited. Whether POA affects offspring by causing oxidative stress (OS) and mitochondrial damage is unknown. Here, in vivo-aged (IVA) mouse oocytes were collected 9 h after ovulation, while in vitro-aged (ITA) oocytes were obtained by culturing freshly ovulated oocytes for 9 h in media with low, moderate, or high antioxidant potential. Oocytes were fertilized in vitro and blastocysts transferred to produce F1 offspring. F1 mice were mated with naturally bred mice to generate F2 offspring. Both IVA and the ITA groups in low antioxidant medium showed significantly increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial and fear learning/memory and hippocampal expression of anxiolytic and learning/memory-beneficial genes in both male and female F1 offspring. Furthermore, the aging in both groups increased OS and impaired mitochondrial function in oocytes, blastocysts, and hippocampus of F1 offspring; however, it did not affect the behavior of F2 offspring. It is concluded that POA caused OS and damaged mitochondria in aged oocytes, leading to defects in anxiety-like behavior and learning/memory of F1 offspring. Thus, POA is a crucial factor that causes psychological problems in offspring, and antioxidant measures may be taken to ameliorate the detrimental effects of POA on offspring.

AB  - Stress is a series of physical and psychological responses to external and internal environmental stimuli. Growing studies have demonstrated the detrimental impacts of acute restraint stress (ARS) and chronic restraint stress (CRS) on animal behavior. However, the related pathogenesis and therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Hence, the present study aimed to examine whether unfolded protein response (UPR) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway are associated with ARS- and CRS- induced abnormal behaviors of pain sensitivity and cognitive function. We here used four behavioral tests to evaluate pain sensitivity and cognitive function in ARS and CRS mice. CRS markedly decreased Paw Withdrawal Mechanical Threshold (PWMT) and Tail-flick Latency (TFL) scores, whereas ARS altered TFL but had no effect on PWMT scores. Additionally, CRS, but not ARS, significantly changed behaviors in nest building behavior and MWMT. Intriguingly, the expression of Keap1 and Nrf2 protein were decreased in the spinal cord and hippocampus in CRS mice, but not in ARS mice. Moreover, neither the ARS nor the CRS groups significantly differed from the control group in terms of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Taken together, this study demonstrated that CRS could induce abnormal pain sensitivity and cognitive function probably via Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in spinal cord and hippocampus. It is therefore likely that effective intervention of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway may contribute to preventing and treating hyperalgesia and cognitive dysfunction in CRS.

AB  - Background Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The delayed encephalopathy occurs a period after poisoning in patients without effective treatment. Simvastatin (Sim), a lipid-lowering drug, was reported to exert endothelial protective effects and inhibit inflammatory response. This research focused on the effects of Sim on delayed encephalopathy caused by CO poisoning. Objective The acute CO poisoning model was established by exposing rats to 2500 ppm CO gas for 40 min, then 3000 ppm for 30 min or until they lost consciousness. Rats in the treatment group were given Sim (20 mg/kg/day, ig.). The behavioral tests included the Morris water maze test and shuttle box. The pathological changes were evaluated by H and E staining. The inflammatory mediators were analyzed by ELISA. The expression levels of eNOS, iNOS and the NF-kappa B-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Results The results showed that Sim could alleviate CO-induced behavioral disorders and the hippocampal nerve cells apoptosis. Sim administration reversed the effects of CO on oxidative stress-related molecules. Sim could also inhibit the production of the inflammatory mediators induced by CO. The level of eNOS was decreased after CO exposure, while iNOS was increased. Sim could significantly inhibit the effects of CO. Furthermore, Sim inhibited the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha (an NF-kappa B inhibitory protein), i.e., the activation of NF-kappa B, which indicated that Simvastatin reduced the inflammatory response induced by CO poisoning partially through inhibiting the activation of NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Conclusion To sum up, our research indicated that Sim could attenuate the delayed encephalopathy induced by CO poisoning via regulating oxidative stress, inflammation and NF-kappa B pathway.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of epilepsy, and current antiepileptic drugs are ineffective in many patients. The endocannabinoid system has been associated with an on-demand protective response to seizures. Blocking endocannabinoid catabolism would elicit antiepileptic effects, devoid of psychotropic effects. We herein report the discovery of selective anandamide catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors with promising antiepileptic efficacy, starting from a further investigation of our prototypical inhibitor 2a. When tested in two rodent models of epilepsy, 2a reduced the severity of the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and the elongation of the hippocampal maximal dentate activation. Notably, 2a did not affect hippocampal dentate gyrus long-term synaptic plasticity. These data prompted our further endeavor aiming at discovering new antiepileptic agents, developing a new set of FAAH inhibitors (3a-m). Biological studies highlighted 3h and 3m as the best performing analogues to be further investigated. In cell-based studies, using a neuroblastoma cell line, 3h and 3m could reduce the oxinflammation state by decreasing DNA-binding activity of NF-kB p65, devoid of cytotoxic effect. Unwanted cardiac effects were excluded for 3h (Langendorff perfused rat heart). Finally, the new analogue 3h reduced the severity of the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus as observed for 2a.

AB  - The ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease (Clp) system has been reported to play an important role in plant growth, development, and defense against pathogens. However, whether the Clp system is involved in plant defense against herbivores remains largely unclear. We explore the role of the Clp system in rice defenses against brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens by combining chemical analysis, transcriptome, and molecular analyses, as well as insect bioassays. We found the expression of a rice Clp proteolytic subunit gene, OsClpP6, was suppressed by infestation of BPH gravid females and mechanical wounding. Silencing OsClpP6 enhanced the level of BPH-induced jasmonic acid (JA), JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and ABA, which in turn promoted the production of BPH-elicited rice volatiles and increased the resistance of rice to BPH. Field trials showed that silencing OsClpP6 decreased the population densities of BPH and WBPH. We also observed that silencing OsClpP6 decreased chlorophyll content in rice leaves at early developmental stages and impaired rice root growth and seed setting rate. These findings demonstrate that an OsClpP6-mediated Clp system in rice was involved in plant growth-defense trade-offs by affecting the biosynthesis of defense-related signaling molecules in chloroplasts. Moreover, rice plants, after recognizing BPH infestation, can enhance rice resistance to BPH by decreasing the Clp system activity. The work might provide a new way to breed rice varieties that are resistant to herbivores.

AB  - Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying anxiety and ethanol-related behaviors is crucial for developing effective therapeutic interventions. This study identifies a novel role for microRNA miR-181a and its target, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), in the hippocampus as contributors to anxiety-like behavior and voluntary ethanol intake. Using male and female C57BL/6 mice, we explored the causal relationship between hippocampal miR181a expression and these behaviors. Lentivirus vectors were delivered into the hippocampus for focal miR181a overexpression in mice. Then behaviors were observed by elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) tests. Results showed that the viral approach employed to overexpress miR-181a, in the hippocampus, resulted in increased anxiety-like behavior in the EPM and OF tests. Additionally, miR-181a overexpression exacerbated voluntary ethanol intake and preference in the two-bottle choice paradigm without affecting saccharin or quinine consumption. Mechanistically, miR-181a gain-of-function reduced SIRT-1 expression in the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that miR-181a upregulation in the hippocampus promotes anxiety and ethanol-related behaviors, likely through SIRT-1 repression. This work highlights miR-181a as a key molecular mediator in the epigenetic regulation of mood disorders and ethanol consumption.

AB  - This investigation aimed to assess the influence of birth weight on post-weaning fattening performance, meat quality, muscle fibre characteristics, and carcass traits in Karayaka lambs. The study categorized the lambs into three distinct groups based on birth weight: low birth weight (LBW), medium birth weight (MBW), and high birth weight (HBW). Throughout the fattening phase, the lambs were given ad libitum access to food and water, culminating in the slaughter at the end of the study. Following slaughter, warm and cold carcasses were weighted, and specific muscles (longissimus thoracis et lumborum [LTL], semitendinosus [ST], and semimembranosus [SM]) were isolated for the evaluation of muscle weights, muscle fibre types (Type I, Type IIA, and Type IIB), and muscle fibre numbers. Carcass characteristics were also determined, including eye muscle (LTL) fat, loin thickness, and meat quality characteristics, such as pH, colour, texture, cooking loss, and water-holding capacity. The statistical analysis revealed highly significant differences among the experimental groups concerning muscle weights and warm and cold carcass weights (p < 0.01), with the lambs in the HBW group exhibiting a notably higher carcass yield (in females: 45.65 +/- 1.34% and in males: 46.18 +/- 0.77%) and LTL, ST, and SM (except for female lambs) muscle weights than the lambs in LBW group (p < 0.01). However, apart from the texture of LTL and ST muscles, no significant differences in meat quality parameters were observed among the treatment groups (p > 0.05). Notably, the birth weight of lambs did not impart a discernible effect on the total number and metabolic activity of muscle fibres in LTL, ST, and SM muscles. Nonetheless, a noteworthy distinction in the fibre area of Type I fibres in the LTL muscle of male lambs (LBW: 30.4 +/- 8.9, MBW: 29.1 +/- 7.3 and HBW; 77.3 +/- 15.4) and in the ST muscle of female lambs (LBW: 44.1 +/- 8.1, MBW: 38.8 +/- 7.7 and HBW: 36.9 +/- 7.1) were evident among the birth weight groups (p < 0.05). The study also found that the mean fat thickness values of eye muscles in Karayaka lambs, as obtained by ultrasonic tests, were below the typical range for sheep. In synthesis, the outcomes of this study underscore the considerable impact of birth weight on slaughtered and carcass weights, emphasizing the positive association between higher birth weights and enhanced carcass yield. Remarkably, despite these pronounced effects on carcass traits, the birth weight did not demonstrate a statistically significant influence on meat quality or overall muscle fibre characteristics, except for the area of Type I fibres in the LTL muscle. This nuanced understanding contributes valuable insights into the intricate relationship between birth weight and various physiological and carcass parameters in Karayaka lambs undergoing post-weaning fattening.

AB  - The Chilocorini lady beetles Tenuisvalvae notata (Mulsant) and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant are important biological control agents being able to share their habitat and compete for their preferred prey, mealybugs. Whereas T. notata is native to South America, C. montrouzieri is an Australian species introduced in Brazil in a biological control program of mealybugs. This work investigated the cannibalism and intraguild predation between these species in the absence of prey. To test for intraguild predation, one individual larva (instars 1-4) from each species was confined for 24 h with another larva of the same instar or the next instar, in a total of 10 combinations. In addition, we measured predation of T. notata adults upon eggs, larvae, pre-pupae and pupa of C. montrouzieri, and vice versa. Cannibalism within the species was also tested across adults, larvae and eggs. Results showed asymmetric interactions in favour of C. montrouzieri, which acted as intraguild predator more than 80% of the time when paired with larvae of T. notata either of the same or different instar. In addition, C. montrouzieri adults preyed more upon larvae and eggs of T. notata than the contrary. There was no intraguild predation upon pre-pupae and pupae. Cannibalism was high upon eggs and first instar larvae of T. notata (89.5% and 65%) and C. montrouzieri (100% and 55%), respectively. Therefore, the exotic C. montrouzieri outcompeted the native T. notata and could become a threat to this endemic species in areas of simultaneous occurrence and under prey scarcity. Thus, the interactions between these lady beetles could affect the success of biological control of mealybugs.

AB  - Long-term exposure to excess manganese can lead to a condition known as manganism, which is characterized by irreversible neuropsychiatric and extrapyramidal dysfunction resembling Parkinson's disease. Excessive exposure to manganese not only increases manganese levels in the body, but can also disrupt the homeostasis of other trace elements. Elemental imbalance has been reported as a risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, and restoring elemental homeostasis may be a potential strategy to combat these conditions. We investigated the relationship between trace element dysregulation and cognitive function following different doses of manganese exposure in multiple tissues. Our results indicated that manganese exposure resulted in decreased learning and memory abilities, as well as impaired balance in rats. Manganese imbalance disrupted elemental homeostasis in several tissues. Hippocampal elemental dysregulation was associated with cognitive performance, and changes in aluminum levels in tissues also appeared to be closely related to cognitive function. Curcumin intervention ameliorated manganese-induced behavioural abnormalities and partially reversed manganese-induced elemental dysregulation, demonstrating its potential as a regulator of elemental homeostasis.

AB  - Objective Neuroscience research using laboratory animals has increased over the years for a number of reasons. Some of these studies require the use of anesthetics for surgical procedures. However, the use of anesthetics promotes several physiological changes that may interfere with experimental results. Although the anesthetics and methods of delivery used to vary, one of the most common is ketamine associated with another compound such as xylazine. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ketamine and xylazine (KX) on corticosterone levels and on the degree of phosphorylation of p44/42 (ERK1/2), Src kinases and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII). We also compared the effects of KX on sleep deprivation, which is known to affect the hormonal profile including corticosterone.

AB  - The need for objective methods to assess child neglect has intensified. However, no biological indicators have been established for this purpose. Recently, early-life environments such as maternal attachment have been shown to affect the activity of long-interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, L1) in human infants and mouse pups. Herein, we hypothesized that the L1 copy number may correlate with the duration of neglect stress. To test this hypothesis, we employed a well-established mouse model of maternal separation that simulates early-life neglect. C57BL6/J mouse pups were subjected to daily maternal separation for either three or 6 h for two weeks from postnatal day (PND) one. We minimized the potential confounding effects of variations in maternal care by designating half of the littermates as untreated controls. L1 copy number in DNA extracted from the hippocampus and amygdala tissues at PND15 was quantified using real-time PCR with two different genes (5srRNA and Pthlh) as references. The results showed significantly higher L1 copy numbers in the hippocampus of pups separated for 6 h than in untreated controls. In addition, maternal separation duration was found to be correlated with L1 copy number in the hippocampus (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the amplification of L1 in the hippocampus induced by 6 h of maternal separation was sustained until PND60. This study introduced a novel approach to understanding neglect-related L1 activity and highlighted the potential of L1 elements as an indicator in forensic medicine.

AB  - The glucose metabolism homeostasis in the follicular fluid microenvironment plays an important role in follicular maturation and ovulation, and excessively high or low glucose concentrations have adverse effects on the differentiation of follicular granulosa cells (GCs). However, a limited number of microRNAs (miRNA) have been reported to be involved in glucose-stimulated GCs differentiation. In this study, we characterized the miRNA expression profiles of sheep ovarian GCs cultured in high-glucose and optimal glucose concentrations and focused on a differentially expressed miRNA: miR-17-5p, which may be involved in regulating high-glucose-induced GC apoptosis by targeting KPNA2. We found that overexpression of miR-17-5p significantly promoted GCs proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis, while downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related makers (Bax, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bcl-2). In contrast to the classical mechanism of miRNA silencing target gene expression, miR-17-5p overexpression significantly upregulated the expression of target gene KPNA2. A dual luciferase reporter gene assay verified the targeted binding relationship between miR-17-5p and KPNA2 promoter. Meanwhile, overexpression of KPNA2 further promoted the downregulation of apoptosis-related genes driven by miR-17-5p mimics. Knockdown of KPNA2 blocked the inhibitory effect of miR-17-5p mimics on the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Our results demonstrated that miR-17-5p activated the KPNA2 promoter region and upregulated KPNA2 expression, thereby inhibiting GCs apoptosis under high glucose.

AB  - Cactus pear is an important source of fodder for herbivores, though its production is affected by soil salinity. This work aimed to evaluate the development of cactus pear clones subjected to salt stress as a measure of their salinity tolerance. The experimental design was a randomized block with 6 replications. Twenty genotypes of cactus pear were used from the Active Germplasm Bank, with variability in resistance to carmine cochineal [Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell)] as this insect species destroys many stands of cactus on farms. One cladode was planted per pot containing 12 kg of sandy soil. Water with a salinity of 3.6 dS/m was applied at 14-day intervals. The clones were scored at 28-day intervals for degree of damage to cladodes (1-5) and were harvested when they reached a score of 5, showing 100% damage (chlorosis and dehydration) to the whole plant. The Liso Forrageiro clone took 419 days to reach Score 5, indicating its greater tolerance to salinity. Highest dry matter yields were achieved by Orelha de Elefante Mexicana and Orelha de Elefante Africana clones with 51.5 and 50.8 g/plant, respectively, while Liso Forrageiro yielded only 36.1 g/plant, despite having similar surface area and weight of roots to these 2 clones. Further studies in the field involving these better-performing clones seem warranted to determine how the pot trial results are repeated in the field, especially in areas where carmine cochineal insect is prevalent.

AB  - Uranium mononitride (UN) is a nuclear fuel candidate for advanced reactor designs and an alternative being considered for light water reactors due to its higher thermal conductivity and uranium density than UO2. As with any nuclear fuel, swelling and fission gas release are important factors for safety, while also being some of the hardest phenomena to predict with a high degree of confidence. Getting a grasp on the gas swelling behavior and release is crucial to lower the barrier for UN utilization. An accelerated swelling rate at high temperatures observed experimentally, sometimes referred to as "breakaway swelling," further complicates the prediction of fuel performance of UN. A mechanistic model has been developed using a multiscale approach to describe the intragranular and intergranular fission gas behavior. Lower-length-scale calculations have been employed to inform models of the gas and self-diffusion behavior, resolution rate, and bubble shape. Leveraging previous work on high burnup UO2, two populations of intragranular bubbles are considered; small bulk bubbles and larger bubbles located along dislocations. The dislocation bubbles were found to be crucial to the overall swelling behavior, and the breakaway swelling transition was associated with the transition in the gas atom diffusion mechanism from an irradiation-induced athermal diffusion regime at lower temperatures to an intrinsic thermal equilibrium regime at higher temperatures, accelerating the growth of the dislocation bubbles. Similarly, the threshold for fission gas release was associated with the grain boundary vacancy diffusivity surpassing the gas atom diffusivity at sufficiently high temperatures, allowing the over-pressurized grain boundary bubble to grow in size and interconnect. Using thermo-mechanical models with the fission gas model, two integral fuel pin assessment cases were simulated. This work demonstrates the ability of a multiscale approach to accelerate the understanding of advanced fuel forms when experimental data is limited.

AB  - Both exogenous transcriptional factors and chemical-defined medium can transdifferentiate astrocytes into functional neurons. However, the regional preference for such transdifferentiation has not been fully studied. A previously reported 5C medium was infused into the mouse cortex and striatum to determine the regional preference for transdifferentiation from astrocytes to neurons. The numbers of NeuN(+)GFAP(+)EdU(+) cells (intermediates) and NeuN(+)EdU(+) cells (end products) were determined by immunofluorescence to explore the regional preference of transdifferentiation. In addition, to optimize the delivery of the transdifferentiation medium, three key growth factors, insulin, bFGF and transferrin, were loaded onto chitosan nanoparticles, mixed with gelatin methacryloyl and tested in animals with motor cortex injury. A higher transdifferentiation efficiency was identified in the mouse cortex. Differences in cellular respiration and the balance between glutaminase (Gls) and glutamine synthetase were confirmed to be key regulators. In addition, the sustained drug release system induced transdifferentiation of cortex astrocytes both in vivo and in vitro, and partially facilitated the behaviour recovery of mice with motor cortex injury. We also applied this method in pigs and obtained consistent results. In summary, low Gls and glycolysis can be used to predict high transdifferentiation efficiency, which may be useful to identify better indications for the current transdifferentiation system. In addition, the current drug delivery system has the potential to treat diseases related to cortex injuries.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) is specifically expressed in oocytes in pigs at all stages from early stages to ovulation and has an important role in oocyte maturation. However, there are few reports on the molecular mechanisms by which BMP15 affects oocyte maturation. In this study, we identified the core promoter region of BMP15 using a dual luciferase activity assay and successfully predicted the DNA binding motif of the tran-scription factor RUNX1. The effect of BMP15 and RUNX1 on oocyte maturation was examined using the first polar body extrusion rate, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay and total glutathione (GSH) content at three time points of 12, 24 and 48 h of in vitro culture of porcine isolated oocytes. Subsequently, the effect of the transcription factor RUNX1 on the TGF-beta signaling pathway (BMPR1B and ALK5) was further verified using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. We found that the overexpression of BMP15 significantly increased the first polar body extrusion rate (P < 0.01) and total glutathione content of oocytes cultured in vitro for 24 h and decreased reactive oxygen levels (P < 0.01), whereas interference with BMP15 decreased the first polar body extrusion rate (P < 0.01), increased reactive oxygen levels in oocytes cultured in vitro for 24 h (P < 0.01), and decreased glutathione content (P < 0.01). The dual luciferase activity assay and online software prediction showed that RUNX1 is a potential transcription factor binding to the core promoter region (-1203/-1423 bp) of BMP15. Overexpression of RUNX1 significantly increased the expression of BMP15 and oocyte maturation rate, while inhibition of RUNX1 decreased the expression of BMP15 and the oocyte maturation rate. Moreover, the expression of BMPR1B and ALK5 in the TGF-beta signaling pathway increased significantly after overexpression of RUNX1, whereas their expression decreased after inhibition of RUNX1. Overall, our results suggest that the transcription factor RUNX1 positively regulates the expression of BMP15 and influences oocyte maturation through the TGF-beta signaling pathway. This study provides a theoretical basis for further complementing the BMP15/TGF-beta signaling pathway to regulate mammalian oocyte maturation.

AB  - Introduction The amygdala subnuclei regulate emotional processing and are widely implicated in social cognitive impairments often seen in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dysregulated amygdala development has been reported in young children with ASD; less is known about amygdala maturation in later adolescence, a sensitive window for social skill development. Methods The macrostructural development of the amygdala subnuclei was assessed at two time points in a longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of adolescents with ASD (n = 23) and typically-developing adolescents (n = 15) . In adolescents with ASD, amygdala subnuclei growth was assessed in relation to ASD symptomatology based on standardized diagnostic assessments. Participants were scanned with MRI at median age of 12 years and returned for a second scan at a median age of 15 years. The volumes of nine amygdala subnuclei were extracted using an automatic segmentation algorithm. Results When examining the longitudinal data acquired across two time points, adolescents with ASD had larger basolateral amygdala (BLA) nuclei volumes compared to typically developing adolescents (B = 46.8, p = 0.04). When examining ASD symptomatology in relation to the growth of the amygdala subnuclei, reciprocal social interaction scores on the ADI-R were positively associated with increased growth of the BLA nuclei (B = 8.3, p < 0.001). Growth in the medial nucleus negatively predicted the communication (B = -46.9, p = 0.02) and social (B = -47.7, p < 0.001) domains on the ADOS-G. Growth in the right cortical nucleus (B = 26.14, p = 0.02) positively predicted ADOS-G social scores. Central nucleus maturation (B = 29.9, p = 0.02) was associated with the repetitive behaviors domain on the ADOS-G. Conclusions Larger BLA volumes in adolescents with ASD may reflect underlying alterations in cellular density previously reported in post-mortem studies. Furthermore, findings demonstrate an association between regional growth in amygdala subnuclei volumes and ASD symptomatology. Improved understanding of the developmental trajectories of the amygdala subnuclei may aid in identifying key windows for interventions, particularly for social communication, in adolescents with ASD.

AB  - Plant compounds associated with herbivore defence occur widely in floral nectar and can impact pollinator health. We showed previously that Rhododendron ponticum nectar contains grayanotoxin I (GTX I) at concentrations that are lethal or sublethal to honeybees and a solitary bee in the plant's non-native range in Ireland. Here we further examined this conflict and tested the hypotheses that nectar GTX I is subject to negative pollinator-mediated selection in the non-native range, but that phenotypic linkage between GTX I levels in nectar and leaves acts as a constraint on independent evolution. We found that nectar GTX I experienced negative directional selection in the non-native range, in contrast to the native Iberian range, and that the magnitude and frequency of pollinator limitation indicated that selection was pollinator-mediated. Surprisingly, nectar GTX I levels were decoupled from those of leaves in the non-native range, which may have assisted post-invasion evolution of nectar without compromising the anti-herbivore function of GTX I (here demonstrated in bioassays with an ecologically relevant herbivore). Our study emphasizes the centrality of pollinator health as a concept linked to the invasion process, and how post-invasion evolution can be targeted toward minimizing lethal or sub-lethal effects on pollinators.This article is part of the theme issue 'Natural processes influencing pollinator health: from chemistry to landscapes'.

AB  - Chromite ore processing tailing, a solid waste generated during the processing of chromite ore, is difficult to recover due to its ultra-fine size. The tailings generated from the process contains valuable chromite and iron-bearing minerals, loss of which is a matter of concern for the ferrochrome industry worldwide. Tailings generated from the processing plant is mainly dumped, causing space and environmental concerns. Researchers worldwide have carried out a rigorous study on the recovery of chromite from tailings, considering the low quantity of Cr-(T) and Fe-(T) in the ore. These processes are partially successful due to the further assimilation of waste in the form of tailings. In the present study, the tailings generated from a chromite ore beneficiary plant in India were investigated through a pyro-metallurgical route. The initial characterization confirmed the presence of nickel (0.5-0.9% Ni) in the ore, which led to the interest in smelting the ore to obtain nickel in the metal. The smelting behaviour of the tailings is studied under the submerged arc furnace and blast furnace condition, under varying basicity. A cost economic analysis of the process is evaluated to understand the feasibility of the real-time operation. The present investigation has revealed that the smelting of such tailings could result in a metal product with 79.23% Fe-(T), 12.94% chromium and 1.11% nickel with a recovery >94%. The produced slag is enriched with a higher quantity of amorphous phase with a glassy phase >89%. The suggested process is a cleaner and sustainable approach towards valorisation of such mining waste and realization through the concept of the circular economy. It is concluded that the carbothermal smelting of tailings generated during enrichment can be valorized through submerged arc furnace route at optimum basicity of 1 by promoting the concept of zero discharge.

AB  - In this article, optimized deep learning (DL) models with different algorithms are adopted to estimate the shear strength of rectangular ultra-high performance concrete beams (UHPC-Bs) in order to overcome the challenges in traditional mechanics-based approaches. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are chosen as the DL models, whereas the recent popular optimization algorithms are phasor particle swarm optimization (PPSO), dwarf mongoose optimization (DMO), mountain gazelle optimizer (MGO), and atom search optimization (ASO). A thorough and reliable dataset of 244 UHPC-Bs test results with ten input features has been used to construct the hybrid DL models. The performance of the optimized hybrid LSTM and GRU models with different algorithms is extensively assessed and compared based on various statistical metrics, error, and score analyses. Then, the model with the best estimation performance is determined and compared with the mechanics-based formulas in the current international design codes. Additionally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis is used to assist in the interpretability of DL models and to reveal the effects of input features that contribute to the model's estimation. According to the results of the present work, all DL models successfully estimate the shear strength of UHPC-Bs. Among these models, the MGO-LSTM model stands out compared to the other models in terms of several performance measures for both the training and testing phases, like a higher R-2 value, lower RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values, as well as a smaller error ratio and a higher final score. The performance of the algorithms applied to optimize the hyper-parameters of the LSTM and GRU models can be ranked as follows: MGO > DMO > PPSO > ASO. Moreover, a graphical user interface (GUI) was constructed based on the best estimation model that was built so that the shear strength of UHPC-Bs could be estimated in real-world situations without the need for any extra software or tools. This enables more users to quickly and easily estimate the shear strength of UHPC-Bs, optimize design processes, and decrease experimental testing costs.

AB  - The bird louse fly Ornithoctona laticornis (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), previously known only from Africa, has recently been recorded in Europe (Hungary) for the first time, raising questions about its potential range expansion. In this study, we document the first record of O. laticornis from the Syrian Woodpecker (Dendrocopos syriacus) in 2022 and another from the Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) in 2023, both in Romania. Morphological description and molecular analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene confirmed the species identity. The main morphological criteria for the identification of O. laticornis were used in the updated key for the European genera of Hippoboscidae. The recurring presence of O. laticornis in resident European birds suggests either overwintering survival or multiple introductions via migratory hosts. Given the ability of hippoboscid flies to act as vectors of pathogens, this discovery underscores the importance of continued surveillance of avian ectoparasites in Europe. Further studies are needed to assess the distribution of the species, its genetic diversity, host range, and its potential role as a vector.

AB  - Maladaptive repair of acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with a high risk of developing chronic kidney disease deemed irremediable even in present days. When AKI arises from ischemia-reperfusion injury, hypoxia usually plays a major role. Although both hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and yes-associated protein (YAP) have been proven to promote renal cell survival under hypoxia, there is a lack of research that studies the crosstalk of the two and its effect on kidney repair. In studying the crosstalk, CoCl2 was used to create a mimetic hypoxic environment. Immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays were performed to verify protein interactions. The results show that HIF-1 alpha interacts with YAP and promotes nuclear translocation of YAP at a high cell density under hypoxic conditions, suggesting HIF-1 alpha serves as a direct carrier that enables YAP nuclear translocation. This is the first study to identify HIF-1 alpha as a crucial pathway for YAP nuclear translocation under hypoxic conditions. Once translocated into a nucleus, YAP protects cells from DNA damage and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Since it is unlikely for YAP to translocate into a nucleus without HIF-1 alpha, any treatment that fosters the crosstalk between the two holds the potential to improve cell recovery from hypoxic insults.

AB  - Combining physical and cognitive training has been suggested to promote further benefits on brain and cogni-tion, which could include synergistic improvement of hippocampal neuroplasticity. In this paper, we investigated whether treadmill exercise followed by a working memory training in the water maze increase adult hippo-campal neurogenesis to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Our results revealed that ten days of scheduled running enhance cell proliferation/survival in the short-term as well as performance in the water maze. Moreover, exercised mice that received working memory training displayed more surviving dentate granule cells compared to those untreated or subjected to only one of the treatments. According to these findings, we suggest that combining physical and cognitive stimulation yield synergic effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis by extending the pool of newly-born cells and subsequently favouring their survival. Future research could take advantage from this non-invasive, multimodal approach to achieve substantial and longer -lasting enhancement in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which might be relevant for improving cognition in healthy or neurologically impaired conditions.

AB  - Multilevel social organizations necessitate close spatial proximity of social units, making dominance hierarchies between core units potentially important to control aggression. We examined whether an interunit dominance hierarchy was present for a Rwenzori Angolan colobus multilevel society (MLS) and its potential social correlates. We recorded the outcome of interunit interactions (IUIs, N = 167) over 59 days in a band of 14 core units at Nabugabo, Uganda. Core units were almost always closely clustered, so we defined IUIs as approaches that decreased the distance between units and lead to changes in behaviour. We assessed dominance using network-based ranking, because the hierarchy was not linear. Tiers of dominance were evident, and we examined these relative to demographics, clan identity (MLS tier 2), male anogenital distance (AGD - a correlate of in utero androgen exposure), and social network analyses (SNA) of interunit association. Unit displacements without aggression occurred in 31.7% of IUIs, and some aggression occurred in 64.7%. Dominance tier was not significantly associated with unit demographics, but units with males that had longer AGDs (more androgenized) tended to be more dominant. Social network analyses showed that higher-ranking units had greater strength, eigenvector centralities, and clustering coefficients than lower-ranking units. Interunit interactions between units in different clans were more aggressive than those within clans and clan identity correlated with dominance tier, indicating that one clan outranked the other. Overall, we demonstrate complex social and spatial factors determining priority-of-access to resources in a primate MLS.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is mainly determined by intramuscular preadipocyte adipogenesis. Epigenetic modifications are known to have a regulatory effect on IMF. As N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) is the most abundant epigenetic modification in eukaryotic RNAs. In the present study, we used m 6 A methylation and RNA sequencing (seq) to identify the m 6 A-modified RNAs associated with the adipogenic differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes. Among them, the expression and m 6 A level of phosphorylase kinase subunit G1 ( PHKG1 ) were found to be significantly changed during adipogenesis. Further studies revealed that knockdown of the methylase METTL3 decreased the m 6 A methylation of PHKG1 and led to a reduction in PHKG1 . Moreover, knockdown of PHKG1 promoted adipogenic differentiation by upregulating the expression of adipogenic genes. In addition, we found that the IMF content in the longissimus thoracis (LT) of Bamei (BM) pigs was greater than that in Large White (LW) pigs, whereas the m 6 A and PHKG1 expression levels were lower in BM pigs. These findings indicate that the m 6 A level and expression of PHKG1 were significantly correlated with IMF content and meat quality. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the mechanism by which m 6 A modification regulates IMF deposition.

AB  - Inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation without dysregulating endothelial cells (ECs) may provide an ideal therapy for in-stent restenosis. Due to its anti-proliferation effect on VSMCs and pro endothelium effect, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been used in a drug-eluting stent in a recent clinical trial. However, the underlying mechanism by which ATO achieves this effect has not been determined. In the present work, we showed that ATO induced apoptosis in VSMCs but not in ECs. Mechanistically, ATO achieved this through modulation of cellular metabolism to increase lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in VSMCs, while LPA concentration was stable in ECs. The elevated LPA facilitated the nuclear accumulation and initiated the transcriptional function of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in VSMCs. YAP regulated the transcription of N6Methyladenosine (m6A) modulators (Mettl14 and Wtap) to increase the m6A methylation levels of apoptosisrelated genes to induce their high expression and exacerbate VSMCs apoptosis. On the other hand, YAP nuclear accumulation in ECs was not observed. Collectively, our data exhibited the molecular process involved in selective apoptosis of VSMCs induced by ATO.

AB  - Outer retinal degenerative diseases (RDDs) and injuries leading to photoreceptor (PR) loss are prevailing causes of blindness worldwide. While significant progress has been made in the manufacture of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived PRs, robust production of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-PRs from swine, a popular preclinical large animal model, would provide an avenue to collect conspecific functional and safety data to complement human xenograft studies. Toward this goal, we describe the highly efficient generation of PR-dominant porcine induced PSC (piPSC)-derived retinal organoids (ROs) using modifications of our established hPSC-RO differentiation protocol. Porcine iPSC-ROs were characterized using immunocytochemistry (ICC) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which revealed the presence and maturation of major neural retina cell types, including PRs and retinal ganglion cells, which possess molecular signatures akin to those found in hPSC-ROs. In late piPSC-ROs, a highly organized outer neuroepithelium was observed with rods and cones possessing outer segments and axon terminals expressing pre-synaptic markers adjacent to dendritic terminals of bipolar cells. The existence of piPSC lines and protocols that support reproducible, scalable production of female and male ROs will facilitate transplant studies in porcine models of retinal injury and RDDs unconfounded by immunological and evolutionary incompatibilities inherent to human xenografts.

AB  - Background: Palliative surgery for the treatment of functionally univentricular heart malformations consists of a staged approach to separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulation, including the creation of a superior cavopulmonary connection. Literature on the superior cavopulmonary connection in porcine models lacks information on details of the procedure as well as data on its acute hemodynamic effects. In preliminary experiments, we were unable to reproduce an already published porcine model. Therefore, we used a conduit extension and cardiopulmonary bypass in order to achieve hemodynamic stability and still employ the commonly used straight downward pathway for the superior caval vein onto the right pulmonary artery, as in the human clinical setting. This model of a univentricular circulation utilising the superior cavopulmonary anastomosis is intended to be applied in the setting of unilateral diaphragmatic palsy. Hence, we aim to investigate the effect of unilateral diaphragmatic pacing in a reproducible model of univentricular physiology. Methods: Therefore, we constructed an anastomosis between the superior caval vein and the right pulmonary artery (RPA) in 14 pigs on cardiopulmonary bypass using a 12 mm expanded polytetrafluorethylene interposition graft. Six pigs received a bidirectional cavopulmonary connection with unrestricted atrial septal communication (BDCPC), while eight pigs received a unidirectional cavopulmonary connection (UDCPC) to the excluded RPA. Results: The BDCPC resulted in an impaired cardiopulmonary state (cardiac output dropped from 3.15 +/- 0.21 to 2.17 +/- 0.19 L/min; p < 0.01), mean arterial pressure plummeted (from 80.8 +/- 3.7 to 49.3 +/- 7.3 mmHg; p = 0.02), arterial lactate concentration rose (from 0.82 +/- 0.09 to 4.36 +/- 0.96 mmol/L; p = 0.01), arterial oxygen saturation dropped (from 95.8 +/- 1.1 to 60.9 +/- 10.4%; p < 0.01), and right ventricular function deteriorated (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion decreased from 12 +/- 0.7 to 5 +/- 0.7 mm; p < 0.01). In contrast, in the UDCPC group, the cardiopulmonary parameters indicated a stable condition. Conclusions: Consequently, a UDCPC is a more suitable acute model in pigs for a univentricular circulation. The model's reproducibility may aid in future research on partial cavopulmonary connection.

AB  - Connective tissues in vertebrates consist of many anisotropic structures formed by collagen and muscle fibers, which could also generate intense second harmonic (SH). In SHG based tissue imaging, the incident light, when subjected to birefringence and scattering, would lead to a rapid decrement in imaging depth. The work simulating polarized light propagating through a thick and highly-scattering semi-infinite medium using a polarization-sensitive Monte Carlo model find that circular polarization would achieve deeper penetration depth. Henceforth, we use polarization engineered SHG imaging to investigate fish scales and pig tendon/dermis of various thickness, as well as the corresponding depolarization effect as a function of the imaging depth in this work. Critically, we have verified quantitatively the previous simulation results and presented the possibility to greatly improve the imaging of thick anisotropic and scattering tissues through engineering polarization. In parallel to wavefront shaping that uses a spatial light modulator or a wavefront sensor based deformable mirror to increase the signal-to-background (SBR) ratio in imaging, our approach is simple, effective, and sensitive to tissue anisotropy.

AB  - Silver nanoparticle synthesis was achieved using waste tea produced from tea factories and investigated their anticancer activity. The waste material was heated with deionized water at 45 degrees C and then the solution was filtrated. The filtrate was reacted with silver nitrate to yield the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The structure of AgNPs was determined by spectroscopic analysis. The cytotoxic effect of extract and AgNPs were performed using the human lung carcinoma cell lines (A549), colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (DLD-1), and mouse fibroblasts (L929) cell lines by MTT assay. In UV-Vis measurement, the maximum absorption was observed at 445 nm. The nanoparticles morphology was established by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and particle size was determined as 17.6 nm. The structure of AgNPs was presented as a face-centered cubic structure by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. The high negative value of zeta potential (-31.3 mV) displayed the stability of the nanostructure. The yield of AgNPs was calculated by elemental analysis as 72.35%. AgNPs exhibited an outstanding effect on A549 and DLD-1 cell lines at 1.0 mg/mL with the lethal effect of 89.3% and 83% respectively. AgNPs synthesized from waste tea may be promising agents for cancer treatment. Since silver nanoparticles synthesized from waste tea revealed excellent cytotoxic effects against various cancer cells.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) will result in the significant elevation of thrombin production at lesion site via either breakage of blood-spinal cord barrier or upregulated expression within nerve cells. Thrombin-induced activation of the protease activated receptors (PARs) evokes various pathological effects that deteriorate the functional outcomes of the injured cord. The cellular consequences of thrombin action on the astrocytes, as well as the underlying mechanism are not fully elucidated by far. In the present study, SCI model of rats was established by contusion, and primary astrocytes were isolated for culture from newborn rats. The expression levels of thrombin and PAR1 receptor at lesion sites of the spinal cord were determined. The primary astrocytes cultured in vitro were stimulated with different concentration of thrombin, and the resultant morphological changes, inflammatory astrocytic responses, as well as PAR1-activated signal pathway of astrocytes were accordingly examined using various agonists or antagonists of the receptor. Thrombin was found to reverse astrocytic stellation, promote proliferation but inhibit migration of astrocytes. Furthermore, the serine protease was shown to facilitate inflammatory response of astrocytes through regulation of MAPKs/NF kappa B pathway. Our results have provided the morphological evidence of astrocytic reactivity in response to thrombin stimulation and its neuroinflammatory effects following SCI, which will be indicative for the fundamental insights of thrombin-induced neuropathology.

AB  - Soft tissue environments govern neuronal morphogenesis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying chemotropism-directed axonal growth cone movement in extremely soft environments remain unclear. Here, we show that drebrin, a growth cone T-zone protein, modulates growth cone turning in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) coated on a soft substrate. Structurally, axonal growth cones of rodent hippocampal neurons grown on 0.1 kPa hydrogels possess an expanded T zone in which drebrin is highly integrated with both F-actin and microtubules. Biochemically, we identify paxillin as interacting with drebrin in cells grown on 0.1 kPa hydrogels but not on glass coverslips. When grown on 0.1 kPa substrates, growth cones asymmetrically exposed to BDNF-bound stripes exhibit enhanced paxillin-drebrin interaction on the side facing the stripes, an activity that is PKA and AAK1 dependent but independent of Src kinase. Functionally, we show that BDNF-induced growth cone turning and force generation on soft substrates require drebrin phosphorylation and paxillin-drebrin association.

AB  - Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1-mGluRs) exert a host of effects on cellular functions, including enhancement of protein synthesis and the associated facilitation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and induction of long-term depression (LTD). However, the complete cascades of events mediating these events are not fully understood. Gp1-mGluRs trigger alpha-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, producing soluble amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPP alpha), a known regulator of LTP. However, the alpha-cleavage of APP has not previously been linked to Gp1-mGluR's actions. Using rat hippocampal slices, we found that the alpha-secretase inhibitor tumour necrosis factor-alpha protease inhibitor-1, which inhibits both disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and 17 (ADAM17) activity, blocked or reduced the ability of the Gp1-mGluR agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) to stimulate protein synthesis, metaplastically prime future LTP and elicit sub-maximal LTD. In contrast, the specific ADAM10 antagonist GI254023X did not affect the regulation of plasticity, suggesting that ADAM17 but not ADAM10 is involved in mediating these effects of DHPG. However, neither drug affected LTD that was strongly induced by either high-concentration DHPG or paired-pulse synaptic stimulation. Our data suggest that moderate Gp1-mGluR activation triggers alpha-secretase sheddase activity targeting APP or other membrane-bound proteins as part of a more complex signalling cascade than previously envisioned.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary taurine on lipid metabolism and liver injury in mice fed a diet high in oxidized fish oil. The ICR mice (six weeks old) were randomly assigned to six groups and fed different diets for 10 weeks: control (CON), normal plus 15% fresh fish oil diet (FFO), normal plus 15% oxidized fish oil diet (OFO), or OFO plus 0.6% (TAU1), 0.9% (TAU2) or 1.2% (TAU3) taurine. Compared to the CON group, OFO mice showed increased liver index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in serum (p < 0.05). In addition, OFO mice had increased cholesterol (CHOL)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreased HDL-C/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio in serum (p < 0.05) compared with CON mice. Notably, dietary taurine ameliorated the liver index and AST and MDA levels in serum and liver in a more dose-dependent manner than OFO mice. In addition, compared to OFO mice, decreased levels of CHOL and ratio of CHOL/HDL-C and n-6 PUFA/n-3 PUFA in serum were found in TAU3-fed mice. Supplementation with TAU2 and TAU3 increased the relative mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, adipose triglyceride lipase, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 in liver compared with the OFO group (p < 0.05). Moreover, impaired autophagy flux was detected in mice fed with the OFO diet, and this was prevented by taurine. These findings suggested that dietary taurine might provide a potential therapeutic choice against oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorder.

KW  - METABOLISM
AB  - The effectiveness of high-carbohydrate diets (HCD) on cognitive impairment is still being debated. To clarify the impact of HCD on the cognitive behavior of mice under low-pressure hypoxic conditions, we studied 24 mice in different environments while subjecting them to dietary intervention for 5 weeks, and conducting behavioral tests. Under low-pressure hypoxic conditions, HCD intervention reversed the decline in spatial learning and memory abilities in mice caused by hypoxia, ameliorated pathological brain damage, and restored the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. We also identified differences in the microbial community. Under low-pressure hypoxic conditions, the intestinal abundance of Parasutterella in mice decreased, the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Desulfovibrio increased, and apoptosis was more prevalent, possibly explaining the observed decreases in glutathione peroxidase activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the brain. HCD intervention increased the intestinal abundance of Bifidobacterium in hypoxic mice, reduced the abundances of Desulfovibrio and Faecalibaculum, and played antioxidant roles by lowering malondialdehyde levels and increasing superoxide dismutase activity in the brain by metabolizing amino acids and lipids. HCD also upregulated hippocampal BDNF levels and downregulated caspase 3. Collectively, these results are important because they help explain how HCD intervention can reduce hypoxia-induced damage to brain function.

AB  - Simple Summary Bile acids (BAs) play an essential role in nutrient absorption and intestinal development for piglets. However, there remains a lack of clarity on the metabolic changes in BAs in piglets after birth and their relationship with intestinal development. This study found significant changes in BA metabolism in piglets after birth. In comparison with newborn piglets (NPs), the total serum BA content was increased for suckling piglets (SPs). Furthermore, the metabolic changes in BAs were highly correlated with the expression of genes related to BA receptors and the regulation of intestinal proliferation and barrier integrity, thereby laying the groundwork for the nutritional regulation of suckling piglets. This can also provide more insights into how the economic benefits of pig farming could be increased.Abstract Bile acids (BAs) are crucial for maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis. However, the metabolic changes in BAs and the communication between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in infants after birth remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the BA profiles of newborn piglets (NPs) and suckling piglets (SPs), and to investigate their regulatory effects on IEC proliferation and barrier integrity, as well as the potential underlying mechanisms. In this study, compared with NPs, there were significant increases in serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, glucose, and albumin levels for SPs. The total serum BA content in SPs exhibited an obvious increase. Moreover, the expression of BA synthase cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) was increased, and the ileal BA receptor Takeda G-coupled protein receptor 5 (TGR5) and proliferation marker Ki-67 were upregulated and showed a strong positive correlation through a Spearman correlation analysis, whereas the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and occludin was markedly downregulated in SPs and also revealed a strong positive correlation. These findings indicate that the increased synthesis and metabolism of BAs may upregulate TGR5 and downregulate FXR to promote IEC proliferation and influence barrier function; this offers a fresh perspective and evidence for the role of BAs and BA receptors in regulating intestinal development in neonatal pigs.

AB  - The majority of excitatory synapses terminating on cortical neurons are found on dendritic spines. The geometry of spines, in particular the size of the spine head, tightly correlates with the strength of the excitatory synapse formed with the spine. Under conditions of synaptic plasticity, spine geometry may change, reflecting functional adaptations. Since the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to influence synaptic transmission as well as Hebbian and homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity, we speculated that TNF-deficiency may cause concomitant structural changes at the level of dendritic spines. To address this question, we analyzed spine density and spine head area of Alexa568-filled granule cells in the dentate gyrus of adult C57BL/6J and TNF-deficient (TNF-KO) mice. Tissue sections were double-stained for the actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein synaptopodin (SP), a molecular marker for strong and stable spines. Dendritic segments of TNF-deficient granule cells exhibited similar to 20% fewer spines in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus compared to controls, indicating a reduced afferent innervation. Of note, these segments also had larger spines containing larger SP-clusters. This pattern of changes is strikingly similar to the one seen after denervation-associated spine loss following experimental entorhinal denervation of granule cells: Denervated granule cells increase the SP-content and strength of their remaining spines to homeostatically compensate for those that were lost. Our data suggest a similar compensatory mechanism in TNF-deficient granule cells in response to a reduction in their afferent innervation.

AB  - Simple Summary Extruded cereals are largely used in newly weaned piglet diets to increase nutrient digestibility and palatability. Our findings showed that corn and broken rice extrusion diets generated negative effects on average daily feed intake (-63.5 g/day, p = 0.054) and average daily gain (-60.6 g/d, p = 0.015) in weaned piglets. Decreased feed intake was associated with increased plasma levels of the gut-derived hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), which may have been attributed to increased microbiota pathogen abundance, including Sarcina, Clostridium_sensu_strictio_1, and Terrisporobacter, and decreased short-chain fatty acid-producing microbiota, such as Lactobaillaceae and Bifidobateriaceae. Our results showed that extruded cereals should be used cautiously when formulating diets for newly weaned piglets. In this study, we investigated the effects of corn and rice extrusion diets on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and gut microbiota in weaned piglets. Animals were divided into four dietary groups and fed a controlled diet containing (1) 62.17% corn (CORN), 15% soybean, 10% extruded full-fat soybean, and 6% fishmeal (2) half the corn replaced by extruded corn (ECORN), (3) broken rice (RICE), and (4) extruded broken rice (ERICE) for 28 days. Rice supplementation increased dry matter total tract digestibility and gross energy. Extruded cereals generated a lower average daily feed intake (ADFI) at 15-28 and 1-28 days, decreased average daily growth (ADG) at 15-28 and 1-28 days, and a lowered body weight (BW) on day 28, regardless of cereal type. Dietary extruded cereals increased the appetite-regulating hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Piglets fed extruded cereals displayed low short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels in plasma and low Lactobaillaceae and Bifidobateriaceae levels in feces, whereas a higher abundance of the potential pathogens Sarcina, Clostridium_sensu_strictio_1 and Terrisporobacter was observed. Piglets fed extruded cereals displayed significantly lower gas and SCFA levels during in vitro fermentation. Combined, 50% corn substituted with extruded corn or broken rice decreased piglet growth performance, possibly by altering their microbiota.

AB  - The demand for natural dyes for imparting sustainable dyeing effects to textiles is increasing. Metal mordants generate an unstainable impact in the natural dyeing of textiles. In order to avoid the toxic effect due to the use of metal mordants, the present work uses enzyme for sustainable natural dyeing of wool. The current study is aimed at preparing multifunctional wool fabric using natural dye green tea (Camellia sinensis). Laccase (an enzyme) was used to polymerise the phenolic compounds of Camellia sinensisin situ on wool. The in situ colouration of wool fabric was performed at various varying dyeing conditions (temperature, time, and concentrations) using laccase. Colouration properties (colour values and strength) were examined to estimate the appearance of dyed fabrics. The evaluation of dyed fabrics for functional properties such as antibacterial, antioxidant, and UV protection was done. The efficient functional properties viz, antibacterial activity (> 75%), antioxidant property (> 90%), and excellent UV protection, were obtained. FTIR analysis of separately prepared polymeric dye and the dyed fabric was also done to confirm the laccase-assisted polymerisation. Thus, a novel approach of enzymatic functional natural dyeing of wool was explored.

AB  - G-quadruplexes are non-canonical DNA structures that are formed in regions with short runs of guanines. During the last decade they have gained considerable attention due to their involvement in basic cellular processes, linking them to several physiological processes and pathological conditions. Regulation of gene transcription is among the crucial roles that G-quadruplexes play in the cells. Several ways in which these structures affect transcription have been described, both negatively and positively. Recently, G-quadruplexes have been shown to be implicated in the three-dimensional rearrangement of the chromosomes that enables the interaction of enhancers and gene promoters during regulation of transcription. Sheep is a species for which almost no G-quadruplex-related studies have been conducted and thus research on this species is kept out from the progress that has been made in the G-quadruplex field. In this context, we investigated the DNA sequences with potential to form G-quadruplexes (G4-motifs) in the ovine enhancers and promoters. We describe the distribution of G4-motifs within the regulatory regions which is shown to be enriched in G4-motifs in a way similar to other mammals. Furthermore, our data suggest that G4-motifs promote promoter-enhancer interactions in sheep. The single nucleotide polymorphisms colocalizing with promoter- and enhancer-associated ovine G4-motifs constitute a considerable pool of polymorphism and given the crucial role of these specific G4-motifs on regulation of transcription, we suggest this polymorphism as an interesting target for ovine genetic studies.

AB  - Ascariasis is a global health problem for humans and animals. Adult Ascaris nematodes are long-lived in the host intestine where they interact with host cells as well as members of the microbiota resulting in chronic infections. Nematode interactions with host cells and the microbial environment are prominently mediated by parasite-secreted proteins and peptides possessing immunomodulatory and antimicrobial activities. Previously, we discovered the C-type lectin protein AsCTL-42 in the secreted products of adult Ascaris worms. Here we tested recombinant AsCTL-42 for its ability to interact with bacterial and host cells. We found that AsCTL-42 lacks bactericidal activity but neutralized bacterial cells without killing them. Treatment of bacterial cells with AsCTL-42 reduced invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by Salmonella. Furthermore, AsCTL-42 interacted with host myeloid C-type lectin receptors. Thus, AsCTL-42 is a parasite protein involved in the triad relationship between Ascaris, host cells, and the microbiota.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the influence of different microalgae used in green water culture on the intestinal morphology of the seahorse Hippocampus reidi during the first 15 days of life. Four treatments were tested in triplicate, consisting of two microalgae (Tisochrysis lutea-ISO and Chaetoceros muelleri-CHO), used either individually (TISO and TCHO) or combined (TIC 1:1) in larval rearing water, and a treatment without microalgae (TWM). Larvae (6.68 +/- 0.55 mm) were fed copepods (Parvocalanus crassirrostris; 2 ind mL(-1)) and rotifers (Brachionus rotundiformis; 8 ind mL(-1)) from the first to the seventh day, and from the eighth day onwards, with Artemia sp. nauplii (2 ind mL(-1)). For the analysis of intestinal histomorphometry, histological analysis of the tissue was performed on day 0 (initial) and after 7 and 15 days. The results demonstrate a significant increase in weight and weight gain of the larvae on the 15th day in the treatments with the addition of the microalgae T. lutea, whether alone or combination with other microalgae, compared to TWM. In relation the intestinal histomorphometry of larvae, the ANCOVA revealed that, on the 7th and 15th day, only the treatments with microalgae significantly affected the surface area of the intestinal villi. The intestinal histomorphometry of larvae from TISO showed higher values of villus height (85.29 +/- 1.23 mu m(2)) compared to TWM (69.42 +/- 2.82 mu m(2)) and TCHO (76.92 +/- 2.23 mu m(2)) (P < 0.05) but did not show significant differences compared to TIC (80.127 +/- 2.08 <mu>m(2)), which reflected on the villi surface area. Therefore, larvae from TISO (3603.43 +/- 151.31 mu m(2)) and TIC (3550.29 +/- 120.99 mu m(2)) showed significantly higher values of this parameter compared to TWM (3026.79 +/- 147.64 mu m(2)) and TCHO (3069.09 +/- 126.18 mu m(2)) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the protocol for H. reidi larvae rearing in a green water system with the addition of the microalgae T. lutea resulted in an increase in the intestinal absorption area, resulting in improved performance of the larvae.

AB  - To prevent endocochlear insertion trauma, the development of drug delivery coatings in the field of CI electrodes has become an increasing focus of research. However, so far, the effect of a polymer coating of PLLA on the mechanical properties, such as the insertion pressure and friction of an electrode array, has not been investigated. In this study, the insertion pressure of a PLLA-coated, 31.5-mm long standard electrode array was examined during placement in a linear cochlear model. Additionally, the friction coefficients between a PLLA-coated electrode array and a tissue simulating the endocochlear lining were acquired. All data were obtained at different insertion speeds (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm/s) and compared with those of an uncoated electrode array. It was shown that both the maximum insertion pressure generated in the linear model and the friction coefficient of the PLLA-coated electrode did not depend on the insertion speed. At higher insertion speeds above 1.0 mm/s, the insertion pressure (1.268 +/- 0.032 mmHg) and the friction coefficient (0.40 +/- 0.15) of the coated electrode array were similar to those of an uncoated array (1.252 +/- 0.034 mmHg and 0.36 +/- 0.15). The present study reveals that a PLLA coating on cochlear electrode arrays has a negligible effect on the electrode array insertion pressure and the friction when higher insertion speeds are used compared with an uncoated electrode array. Therefore, PLLA is a suitable material to be used as a coating for CI electrode arrays and can be considered for a potential drug delivery system.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) plays an important role in animal follicle development and ovulation. However, its regulatory effects on the different stages of the estrus cycle in ewes are unclear. In this study, bromocriptine (BCR, PRL inhibitor) was used to study the effect of PRL on the secretion of reproductive hormones and gene expressions in order to explore its regulatory effects on the sexual cycle of ewes. Eighty healthy ewes with the same parity and similar weights were randomly assigned to the control group (C, n = 40) and the treatment group (T, n = 40, fed bromocriptine). After estrus synchronization, thirty-one ewes with overt signs of estrus were selected from each group. Six blood samples were randomly obtained by jugular venipuncture to measure the concentration of PRL, estrogen (E-2), progesterone (P-4), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. At the same time, we collected the ovaries of the six ewes in vivo after anesthesia in order to detect follicle and corpus luteum (CL) counts and measure the expression of hormone-receptor and apoptosis-related genes. The results show that PRL inhibition had no significant effects on the length of the estrus cycle (p > 0.05). In proestrus, the number of large and small follicles, the levels of E-2, FSH, and GnRH, and the expressions of ER, FSHR, and the apoptotic gene Caspase-3 were increased (p < 0.05); and the number of middle follicles and the expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 were decreased (p < 0.05) in the T group. In estrus, the number of large follicles, the levels of E-2 and GnRH, and the expressions of the StAR, CYP19A1, and Bcl-2 genes were increased (p < 0.05), and the number of middle follicles was decreased (p < 0.05) in the T group. In metestrus, the number of small follicles and the expression of LHR (p < 0.05) and the pro-apoptotic gene Bax were increased (p < 0.05); the number of middle follicles was decreased (p < 0.05) in the T group. In diestrus, the number of large follicles, middle follicles, and CL, the level of P-4, and the expressions of PR, 3 beta-HSD, StAR, Caspase-3, and Bax were increased (p < 0.05); the number of small follicles and the expression of Bcl-2 were decreased (p < 0.05) in the T group. In summary, PRL inhibition can affect the secretion of reproductive hormones, the follicle count, and the gene expression during the estrus cycle. These results provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the ewe estrus cycle by PRL.

AB  - The quality of Assam tea seed oil obtained by supercritical CO2 extraction was evaluated and compared to that of tea obtained using a screw press. Supercritical CO2 extraction produced a higher oil yield (12.94-16.53 % w/w) compared to the screw press method (9.96-12.18 % w/w). Using a higher temperature for supercritical CO2 and screw press extraction caused a decrease in the saponin content from 32.12 to 25.07 mg saponin equivalents/g oil and from 39.28 to 35.60 mg saponin equivalents/g oil, respectively, and for supercritical CO2 extraction also increased the flavonoid content from 0.84 to 1.75 mg/mL quercetin equivalents but did not affect the flavonoid yield for screw press extraction (1.02-1.07 mg/mL quercetin equivalents). The tannin content obtained from supercritical CO2 and screw press extraction was not significantly different (31.67-36.30 and 29.49-32.12 mg/ mL tannin equivalents, respectively). Increasing the temperature of supercritical CO2 extraction resulted in a decrease in acid value and free fatty acids. No significant differences in acid value or free fatty acids were observed for oil extracted using the screw press method. Iodine and saponification values of oil obtained by supercritical CO2 extraction decreased when the extraction temperature increased, and screw press oil had higher iodine and saponification values when the temperature was increased. All of the extracted Assam tea seed oils, obtained by both methods, overwhelmingly contained oleic acid (48.55-50.14 %), linoleic acid (24.14-25.52 %), and palmitic acid (18.74-19.95 %). In addition, an increase in temperature promoted the extraction of phenolic compounds for both extraction methods (9.21-22.01 mg GAE/100 g oil), resulting in an increase in the antioxidant capacity of the extracted oil. These results indicate that supercritical CO2 extraction could be competitive with the screw press method, providing an environmental approach and enhancing the quality of the oil obtained.

AB  - Neural oscillations in the theta range (4-8 Hz) are thought to underlie associative memory function in the hippocampal-cortical network. While there is ample evidence supporting a role of theta oscillations in animal and human memory, most evidence is correlational. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can be employed to modulate cortical oscillatory activity to influence brain activity, and possibly modulate deeper brain regions, such as hippocampus, through strong and reliable cortico-hippocampal functional connections. We applied focal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 6 Hz over left parietal cortex to modulate brain activity in the putative cortico-hippocampal network to influence associative memory encoding. After encoding and brain stimulation, participants completed an associative memory and a perceptual recognition task. Results showed that theta tACS significantly decreased associative memory performance but did not affect perceptual memory performance. These results show that parietal theta tACS modulates associative processing separately from perceptual processing, and further substantiate the hypothesis that theta oscillations are implicated in the cortico-hippocampal network and associative encoding.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Dartmoor Estate Tea plantation in Devon, UK, is renowned for its unique microclimate and varied soil conditions, which contribute to the distinctive flavours and chemical profiles of tea. The chemical diversity of fresh leaf samples from various garden locations was explored within the plantation. Methods: Fresh leaf, which differed by location, cultivar, time of day, and variety, was analysed using Flow Infusion Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (FIE-MS). Results: Random forest classification revealed no significant differences between Georgian N2 cultivar garden locations. However, a significant degree of variability was observed within four tri-clonal variants (Tocklai Variety) with TV9 exhibiting greater similarity to the Georgian N2 cultivar compared to TV8 and TV11, while TV11 was found to be most like TV1. The intraclass variability in leaf composition was similar between the varieties. We explored the metabolic changes over the day in one variant (Camellia assamica Masters), yielding a model with a significant R2 value of 0.617 (p < 0.01, 3000 permutations). Starch and sucrose metabolism was found to be significant where the abundance of these chemical features increased throughout the day and then began to decrease at night. Conclusions: This research highlights the complex interplay of cultivars, geographical location, and temporal factors on the chemical composition of tea. It provides insightful data on the metabolic pathways influencing tea cultivation and production and underscores the importance of these variables in determining the final chemical profile and organoleptic characteristics of tea products.

AB  - Bee pollen, an apicultural product collected by honeybees from flower stamens, is attracting attention as a functional food material. Our previous studies have shown that the major components of Australian bee pollen are hydroxycinnamoyl acid amides (HCAAs) (<bold>1-4</bold>) and flavonoids (<bold>5-8</bold>). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effectiveness of Australian bee pollen. Australian bee pollen extracts and their main compounds were tested for their inhibition of hyaluronidase activity and leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) release. HCAAs strongly inhibited hyaluronidase activity and LTB4 release. Subsequently, the anti-allergy effects of Australian bee pollen extracts were studied using a guinea pig rhinitis model. Administration of Australian bee pollen inhibited nasal secretion in the guinea pig rhinitis model. Australian bee pollen, which likely exhibits anti-allergic properties, is anticipated to be highly valuable for use.

AB  - Objective In the present study, the in vitro and in vivo effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of Neolentinus ponderosus (EHNP) on L-3 larvae of Haemonchus contortus was evaluated. Material and methods The N. ponderosus fungus was cultivated in potato dextrose liquid medium for 7 days at 120 rpm and 25 degrees C. Subsequently, the EHNP was obtained; in vitro bioassays were performed in 96-well plates. Furthermore, an in vitro confrontation with different concentrations of EHNP was carried out at 72 h against L3 larvae of H. contortus. The controls used were distilled water and ivermectin at 5 mg/mL. Subsequently, the in vivo activity of EHNP was evaluated using the gerbil against H. contortus L3 larvae as an experimental model. The experimental design consisted of four groups with: (1) distilled water, (2) fenbendazole at 20 mg/kg of body weight, (3) EHNP at a dose of 81 mu g/mL, and (4) EHNP at a dose of 40 mu g/mL. Results In vitro study showed 97% mortality of the parasite H. contortus at a concentration of 3.4 mg/mL and a lethal concentration (LC90) of 2 mg/mL EHNP. In the in vivo assessment the highest mortality was (49%) at 72 h at a concentration of 81 mu g/mL bw. Conclusion The result of the present study shows that EHNP has nematicidal activity in vitro and in vivo tests (close to 97% and 50%, respectively), the fungus N. ponderosus should be considered in future tests to elucidate the secondary metabolites through spectroscopic studies.

T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE

KW  - PIGS
AB  - Tracking the behaviour of animals in group-housed situations is a critical area of study for precision livestock farming, but it poses challenges in diverse and crowded environments. Existing methods often struggle with false positives and false negatives due to the complexities of these scenarios. In this study, we propose a robust computer vision algorithm for long-term (>10mins) animal tracking, with a primary focus on group-housed pigs. Our method addresses the limitations of current approaches by effectively handling errors from the detector in challenging environments. Our approach integrates Graph Convolutional Networks.(GCNs) with deep learning-based object detection techniques. We represent the data as a graph structure, with nodes corresponding to multiple animal detections over several frames. Edges connect the detections that do not appear in the same frame. The model's objective is to perform edge classification, where each edge is associated with a scalar representing the probability of being the same object. To enhance the robustness of edge classification, we combine the classifier with an ensemble predictor, enabling accurate tracking of animal identities for extended periods. Notably, our graph convolutional model achieves accurate re identification of non-consecutive animal detections in real-time without the need for trajectory prediction or ID association. We evaluate our method by comparing its performance against other tracking methods, including DeepSORT-a state-of-the-art animal tracking method that relies on a Kalman filter, a deep appearance descriptor, and the Hungarian algorithm for trajectory prediction and ID association. Our comparison demonstrates the advantages of our method, as it (1) improves the IDF1 score, indicating enhanced ID association accuracy, by 1.72%; (2) mitigates 93% of errors resulting from ID-switch and deviation; (3) extends the tracking duration of each animal by approximately 66% in challenging conditions; and (4) achieves a processing speed that is 1000 times faster than DeepSORT when operating at 22fps with the detector. The potential applications of our method extend to various aspects of livestock management. By accurately tracking individual animals, we can monitor behaviours such as feeding, drinking, and aggressive interactions. This information can lead to improvements in animal welfare, resource allocation, and breeding strategies.

AB  - Butyrate and its derivatives may influence inflammatory status and physiology in a variety of organisms and organ systems. Inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as post-weaning diarrhea, negatively impact swine. Dietary intervention with butyrate-based compounds should be considered a strategy to improve disease resistance in pigs. We aimed to assess the properties of different forms of butyrate treatments using porcine cell culture experiments. This assessment may inform future in vivo feed experiments designed to determine its potential application of the dietary supplements for pigs. An intestinal porcine enterocyte cell line, IPEC-J2, was seeded at 5 x 10(3) cells/mL in 96-well plates to confirm cell viability by MTT assay for each dose range used in the current experiments (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 mM butyric acid or tributyrin; 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 mM sodium butyrate or monobutyrin). For transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) analysis, IPEC-J2 was seeded at 5 x 10(5) cells/mL in 12-well transwell inserts and treated with 5 levels of each butyrate derivative after adherence (n = 5). TEER was measured at 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment to quantify intestinal barrier integrity of IPEC-J2 monolayers. Butyric acid, sodium butyrate, and monobutyrin significantly increased (p < 0.05) TEER in IPEC-J2 at different time points compared with control. Further, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were harvested from donor weaned piglets (n = 6) via bronchoalveolar lavage and isolated for primary culture (6 x 10(5) cells/well, 6-well plates). PAMs were treated with five levels of each butyrate derivative with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mu g/mL) challenge. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in cell culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Butyric acid and sodium butyrate treatments reduced the production of TNF-alpha in LPS-challenged PAMs (linear; p < 0.05). Different butyrate derivatives exerted anti-inflammatory properties and improved intestinal barrier integrity.

AB  - Rauvolfia serpentina produces a number of indole alkaloids and has long been used in the traditional treatment of arrhythmia. Given the shortage of natural resources, the K-27M strain of R. serpentina tissue culture was established. The aim was to evaluate the antiarrhythmic activity of extracts with different compositions and ratios of indole alkaloids derived from the cell biomass of the K-27M strain. Chemical analysis was conducted using HPLC-MS. Adrenaline-induced (rats) and ischemia-reperfusion arrhythmia (isolated guinea pig hearts) models were used to study the antiarrhythmic activity of the extracts. Extracts were obtained from dry (extracts 1, 2, and 3) and fresh biomass (fractions 1 and 2 of extract 4). Extract 1 contained ajmaline and acetylajmaline (the total indole alkaloid content (TIAC) was 2.2% of the dry biomass); extract 2-ajmaline, acetylajmaline, and raucaffricine (TIAC 6.4%); extract 3-ajmaline and raucaffricine (TIAC 29.0%). Fraction 1 of extract 4 was dominated by vomilenine, methylajmalicine, ajmalicine, and raufloridine (TIAC 65.0%), and fraction 2 of extract 4 contained acetylajmaline (TIAC 47.4%). Extracts 1 and 2 containing negligible amounts of indole alkaloids showed a weak proarrhythmic effect. Fractions 1 and 2 of extract 4 had a pronounced antiarrhythmic effect in the adrenaline-induced arrhythmia model. In addition, fraction 2 of extract 4 had an antiarrhythmic effect in the ischemia-reperfusion arrhythmia model. The level of this activity depended on the composition and ratio of alkaloids in the extract. Thus, the K-27M strain of R. serpentina tissue culture is a promising source of indole alkaloids with antiarrhythmic activity.

AB  - Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the MECP2 gene, is characterized by severe motor, cognitive, and emotional impairments. Some of the deficits may result from changes in cortical connections, especially downstream projections of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may also be targets of restoration following rearing conditions such as environmental enrichment that alleviate specific symptoms. Here, using a heterozygous Mecp2+/- female mouse model closely analogous to human Rett syndrome, we investigated the impact of early environmental enrichment on behavioral deficits and PFC connectivity. Behavioral analyses revealed that enriched housing rescued fine motor deficits and reduced anxiety, with enrichment-housed Mecp2+/- mice performing comparably to wild-type (WT) controls in rotarod and open field assays. Anatomical mapping of top-down anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) projections demonstrated altered PFC connectivity in Mecp2+/- mice, with increased axonal density in the somatosensory cortex and decreased density in the motor cortex compared to WT controls. ACA axons revealed shifts in hemispheric distribution, particularly in the medial network regions, with Mecp2+/- mice exhibiting reduced ipsilateral dominance. These changes were unaffected by enriched housing, suggesting that structural abnormalities in PFC connectivity persist despite behavioral improvements. Enriched housing rescued brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus but failed to restore BDNF levels in the PFC, consistent with the persistent deficits observed in prefrontal axonal projections. These findings highlight the focal nature of changes induced by reduction of MeCP2 and by exposure to environmental enrichment and suggest that environmental enrichment starting in adolescence can alleviate behavioral deficits in Mecp2+/- mice without reversing abnormalities in large-scale cortical connectivity.

AB  - GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain that can mediate depolarizing responses during development or after neuropathological insults. Under which conditions GABAergic membrane depolarizations are sufficient to impose excitatory effects is hard to predict, as shunting inhibition and GABAergic effects on spatiotemporal filtering of excitatory inputs must be considered. To evaluate at which reversal potential a net excitatory effect was imposed by GABA (E-GABA(Thr)), we performed a detailed in-silico study using simple neuronal topologies and distinct spatiotemporal relations between GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs.
   These simulations revealed for GABAergic synapses located at the soma an E-GABA(Thr) close to action potential threshold (E-AP(Thr)), while with increasing dendritic distance E-GABA(Thr) shifted to positive values. The impact of GABA on AMPA-mediated inputs revealed a complex temporal and spatial dependency. E-GABA(Thr) depends on the temporal relation between GABA and AMPA inputs, with a striking negative shift in E-GABA(Thr) for AMPA inputs appearing after the GABA input. The spatial dependency between GABA and AMPA inputs revealed a complex profile, with E-GABA(Thr) being shifted to values negative to E-AP(Thr) for AMPA synapses located proximally to the GABA input, while for distally located AMPA synapses the dendritic distance had only a minor effect on E-GABA(Thr). For tonic GABAergic conductances E-GABA(Thr) was negative to E-AP(Thr) over a wide range of g(GABA)(tonic) values. In summary, these results demonstrate that for several physiologically relevant situations E-GABA(Thr) is negative to E-AP(Thr), suggesting that depolarizing GABAergic responses can mediate excitatory effects even if E-GABA did not reach E-AP(Thr).

Therefore, this study aimed to compare the learning outcome of 3D scans and 2D images of horse and pig skulls. Furthermore, the relationship between spatial ability and learning outcome was analyzed when using the different learning materials. Second-year veterinary medicine students participated in a practical anatomy course using 3D scans or 2D images as learning material and performed a test to determine their spatial ability. Independently of the learning material, all groups displayed high learning outcomes with no significant differences between the groups. In addition, it could not be stated that 3D scans support students with lower spatial ability. Nevertheless, students preferred 3D scans, finding them more motivating, although they did not necessarily improve learning outcomes.Abstract Students often struggle with interpreting traditional textbook images and translating them to anatomical structures. This study aimed to compare the impact of 3D scans versus 2D images on students' learning outcomes when learning anatomical structures on skulls from horses and pigs. Furthermore, the correlation between spatial ability and learning outcomes using 3D scans or 2D images was examined. Second-year veterinary medicine students either used 3D scans or 2D images, annotated with arrows or numbers as learning material. Students' anatomical knowledge was tested before and after the learning session, and spatial ability was assessed using the mental rotation test. All groups improved significantly in the post-test. However, the differences between groups were not significant, suggesting that 3D scans do not necessarily lead to higher learning outcomes. The analysis of the correlation between spatial ability and learning outcomes did not prove that students with weaker spatial ability benefit from 3D scans. Students preferred 3D scans over 2D images despite similar outcomes, suggesting they are valuable for learning. However, results show that the introduction of novel learning materials likely amplified the impact of reduced learning time on the 3D group, as these materials necessitated additional time for effective comprehension and integration.

AB  - Epigenetic status of fetal fibroblasts (FFs) is one of the crucial factors accounted for the success of somatic cell nuclear transfer and gene editing, which might inevitably be affected by passaging. But few systematic studies have been performed on the epigenetic status of passaged aging cells. Therefore, FFs from large white pig were in vitro passaged to the 5, 10, and 15 (F5, F10, and F15) passages in the present study to investigate the potential alteration of epigenetic status. Results indicated the senescence of FFs occurs with the passaging, as assessed by the weakened growth rate, increased & beta;-gal expression, and so on. For the epigenetic status of FFs, the higher level both of DNA methylation and H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3 was observed at F10, but the lowest level was observed at F15. However, the fluorescence intensity of m6A was significantly higher in F15, but lower (p < 0.05) in F10, and the related mRNA expression in F15 was significantly higher than F5. Further, RNA-Seq indicated a considerable difference in the expression pattern of F5, F10, and F15 FFs. Among differentially expressed genes, not only the genes involved in cell senescence were changed, but also the upregulated expression of Dnmt1, Dnmt3b, Tet1 and dysregulated expression of histone methyltransferases-related genes were detected in F10 FFs. In addition, most genes related to m6A such as METTL3, YTHDF2, and YTHDC1 were significantly different in F5, F10, and F15 FFs. In conclusion, the epigenetic status of FFs was affected by being passaged from F5 to F15.

AB  - Adipose tissue has many important functions including metabolic energy storage, endocrine functions, thermoregulation and structural support. Given these varied functions, the microvascular characteristics within the tissue will have important roles in determining rates/limits of exchange of nutrients, waste, gases and molecular signaling molecules between adipose tissue and blood. Studies on skeletal muscle have suggested that tissues with higher aerobic capacity contain higher microvascular density (MVD) with lower diffusion distances (DD) than less aerobically active tissues. However, little is known about MVD in adipose tissue of most vertebrates; therefore, we measured microvascular characteristics (MVD, DD, diameter and branching) and cell size to explore the comparative aerobic activity in the adipose tissue across diving tetrapods, a group of animals facing additional physiological and metabolic stresses associated with diving. Adipose tissues of 33 animals were examined, including seabirds, sea turtles, pinnipeds, baleen whales and toothed whales. MVD and DD varied significantly (P < 0.001) among the groups, with seabirds generally having high MVD, low DD and small adipocytes. These characteristics suggest that microvessel arrangement in short duration divers (seabirds) reflects rapid lipid turnover, compared to longer duration divers (beaked whales) which have relatively lower MVD and greater DD, perhaps reflecting the requirement for tissue with lower metabolic activity, minimizing energetic costs during diving. Across all groups, predictable scaling patterns in MVD and DD such as those observed in skeletal muscle did not emerge, likely reflecting the fact that unlike skeletal muscle, adipose tissue performs many different functions in marine organisms, often within the same tissue compartment.

AB  - Biomaterials able to promote neuronal development and neurite outgrowth are highly desired in neural tissue engineering for the repair of damaged or disrupted neural tissue and restoring the axonal connection. For this purpose, the use of either electroactive or micro- and nanostructured materials has been separately investigated. Here, the use of a nanomodulated conductive poly-(3,4-ethylendioxithiophene) poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) substrate that exhibits instructive topographical and electrical cues at the same time was investigated for the first time. In particular, thin films featuring grooves with sizes comparable with those of neuronal neurites (NanoPEDOT) were fabricated by electrochemical polymerization of PEDOT/PSS on a nanomodulated polycarbonate template. The ability of NanoPEDOT to support neuronal development and direct neurite outgrowth was demonstrated by assessing cell viability and proliferation, expression of neuronal markers, average neurite length, and direction of neuroblastoma N2A cells induced to differentiate on this novel support. In addition to the beneficial effect of the nanogrooved topography, a 30% increase was shown in the average length of neurites when differentiating cells were subjected to an electrical stimulation of a few microamperes for 6 h. The results reported here suggest a favorable effect on the neuronal development of the synergistic combination of nanotopography and electrical stimulation, supporting the use of NanoPEDOT in neural tissue engineering to promote physical and functional reconnection of impaired neural networks.

AB  - Corn straw and corncobs contain large amounts of crude fibers and are widely used in mutton sheep husbandry in northwest China. The aim of this study was to determine whether feeding with corn straw or corncobs affects lamb testis development. A total of 50 healthy Hu lamb at two-month-old (average body weight of 22.3 +/- 0.1 kg) were randomly and equally divided into two groups, and the lambs were equally allocated to five pens in each group. The corn straw group (CS) received a diet containing 20% corn straw, whereas the corncobs group (CC) received a diet containing 20% corncobs. After a 77-day feeding trial, the lambs, except the heaviest and lightest in each pen, were humanely slaughtered and investigated. Results revealed no differences in body weight (40.38 +/- 0.45 kg vs. 39.08 +/- 0.52 kg) be-tween the CS and CC groups. Feeding diet containing corn straw significantly (P < 0.05) increased testis weight (243.24 +/- 18.78 g vs. 167.00 +/- 15.20 g), testis index (0.60 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.04), testis volume (247.08 +/- 19.99 mL vs. 162.31 +/- 14.15 mL), diameter of seminiferous tubule (213.90 +/- 4.91 mm vs. 173.11 +/- 5.93 mm), and the number of sperm in the epididymis (49.91 +/- 13.53 x 108/g vs. 19.34 +/- 6.79 x 108/g) compared with those in the CC group. The RNA sequencing results showed 286 differentially expressed genes, and 116 upregulated and 170 downregulated genes were found in the CS group compared with the CC group. The genes affecting immune functions and fertility were screened out. Corn straw decreased the mtDNA relative copy number in the testis (P < 0.05). These results suggest that compared with corncobs, feeding corn straw in the early reproductive development stage of lambs increased the testis weight, diameter of seminiferous tubule and the number of cauda sperm.

AB  - PurposeTotal body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is used in pre-clinical research to generate mouse chimeras that allow to study the function of a protein specifically on immune cells. Adverse consequences of irradiation on the juvenile body and brain are well described and include general fatigue, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Yet, the long-term consequences of TBI/BMT performed on healthy adult mice have been poorly investigated.Material and MethodsWe developed a robust protocol to achieve near complete bone marrow replacement in mice using 2x550cGy TBI and evaluated the impact of the procedure on their general health, mood disturbances, memory, brain atrophy, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability 2 and/or 16 months post-BMT.ResultsWe found a persistent decrease in weight along with long-term impact on locomotion after TBI and BMT. Although the TBI/BMT procedure did not lead to anxiety- or depressive-like behavior 2- or 16-months post-BMT, long-term spatial memory of the irradiated mice was impaired. We also observed radiation-induced impaired neurogenesis and cortical microglia activation 2 months post-BMT. Moreover, higher levels of hippocampal IgG in aged BMT mice suggest an enhanced age-related increase in BBB permeability that could potentially contribute to the observed memory deficit.ConclusionsOverall health of the mice did not seem to be majorly impacted by TBI followed by BMT during adulthood. Yet, TBI-induced alterations in the brain and behavior could lead to erroneous conclusions on the function of a protein on immune cells when comparing mouse chimeras with different genetic backgrounds that might display altered susceptibility to radiation-induced damage. Ultimately, the BMT model we here present could also be used to study the related long-term consequences of TBI and BMT seen in patients.

AB  - Krill oil (KO) has been described as having the potential to ameliorate the detrimental consequences of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the aging brain, though the magnitude and mechanism of this benefit is unclear. We thus hypothesized that dietary KO supplementation could counteract the effects of cognitive aging and an HFD on spatial learning, neuroinflammation, neurogenesis, and synaptic density in the cortex and hippocampus of aged rats. Sixteen-month-old Sprague Dawley rats were fed for 12 weeks while being divided into four groups: control (CON); control with KO supplementation (CONKO); high-fat diet (HF); and high-fat diet with KO supplementation (HFKO). We measured food consumption, body mass, spatial memory (Morris water maze), microglia, neurogenesis, cytokine concentrations, and synaptic markers (post-synaptic density-95 and synaptophysin). Predictably, an HFD did induce significant differences in body weights, with the high-fat groups gaining more weight than the low-fat controls. However, KO supplementation did not produce significant changes in the other quantified parameters. Our results demonstrate that the dietary KO dose provided in the current study does not benefit hippocampal or cortical functions in an aging model. Our results provide a benchmark for future dosing protocols that may eventually prove to be beneficial.

AB  - Carbapenem- and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli (CCREC) cause high mortality rates and health costs, and have become serious health concerns. Total 1764 samples were collected from 60 animal farms in 2019 and 2021, including worker and animal faeces, wastewater, well water, air, vegetables, human hands, object surfaces, throat swabs, soil, and flies to investigate the prevalence and potential transmission pathways of CCREC. Eleven CCREC were detected: 9 (5 in 2019 and 4 in 2021) from 5 worker faeces, 3 animal faeces, 1 wastewater, and 2 from 1 flies sample. Chicken farms had the highest number of CCREC (n = 9). The detection rate was low (<1.1%) overall, and there was no significant difference in both years, indicating that CCREC existed stably after 4 years of colistin ban. The combinations of chromosomes and plasmids harbouring blaNDM and mcr-1.1 were divided into 4 patterns: IncX3 plasmid-blaNDM & chromosome-mcr.1.1 (n = 5); IncX3 plasmid-blaNDM & IncHI2 plasmid-mcr.1.1 (n = 3); IncFII plasmid-blaNDM & IncI2 plasmid-mcr.1.1 (n = 2); both chromosome (n = 1). The blaNDM located on plasmids was surrounded by similar genetic structures: Tn3-IS-blaNDM-bleMBL-TrpF-DsbD-IS. The genetic contexts of mcr-1.1 were highly similar, with 'ISApl1-mcr-1.1-PAP2' and 'mcr-1.1-PAP2'. All plasmids can be successfully transferred into E. coli J53, except for the IncHI2 plasmids with the transfer rate of 33.3%. The IncFII and IncI2 plasmids from same strain of flies could be co-transferred. The clonal spread of CCREC from humans to humans occurred on the same pig farm (P4) or different chicken farms (BC9 and LH7). This study suggested that flies, chromosomes, and plasmids jointly contribute to the steady existence of CCREC.

AB  - Over the past few decades, species distribution modelling has been increasingly used to monitor invasive species. Studies herein propose to use Cellular Automata (CA), not only to model the distribution of a potentially invasive species but also to infer the potential of the method in risk prediction of Reticulitermes grassei infestation. The test area was mainland Portugal, for which an available presence-only dataset was used. This is a typical dataset type, resulting from either distribution studies or infestation reports. Subterranean termite urban distributions in Portugal from 1970 to 2001 were simulated, and the results were compared with known records from both 2001 (the publication date of the distribution models for R. grassei in Portugal) and 2020. The reported model was able to predict the widespread presence of R. grassei, showing its potential as a viable prediction tool for R. grassei infestation risk in wooden structures, providing the collection of appropriate variables. Such a robust simulation tool can prove to be highly valuable in the decision-making process concerning pest management.

AB  - Regulation of aquaporin-2 (Aqp2) gene is essential for body water homeostasis. This study investigated how TAZ (a transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, Wwtr1) controls vasopressin-driven AQP2 expression. AQP2 expression was studied using collecting duct-specific TAZ-knockout (TAZf/f; HoxB7Cre) mice and siRNA-mediated knockdown of TAZ in vasopressin-responsive mpkCCDc11 cells. Downstream factors of TAZ were identified using transcriptomics and bioinformatics. The TAZf/f; HoxB7Cre mice demonstrated polyuria and a significant decrease in AQP2 abundance in the kidney cortex and the outer medulla. dDAVP treatment (10-9 M, 24 h) on mpkCCDc11 cells significantly increased AQP2 mRNA and protein levels. However, siRNA-mediated TAZ knockdown (TAZ-KD) markedly attenuated these effects without affecting cAMP levels. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a substantial decrease in AQP2 immunolabeling intensity in TAZ-KD cells following dDAVP stimulation. RNA sequencing analysis identified 1370 and 1985 differentially expressed genes in TAZ-KD cells under basal conditions and after dDAVP treatment, respectively. Among 17 previously identified transcription factor (TF) candidates, seven (Nr4a1, Cebpb, Mef2d, Elf3, Klf5, Junb, Stat3) were significantly upregulated by dDAVP in either control or TAZ-KD conditions. Among them, RT-qPCR analysis identified Nr4a1 as a TAZ-dependent TF, and immunoblotting revealed reduced NR4A1 protein levels in TAZ-KD cells upon dDAVP stimulation. This finding suggests its role as a TAZ-regulated target in dDAVP response pathway. Accordingly, Nr4a1-KD reduced the dDAVP-induced upregulation of Aqp2 mRNA and protein. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that HIF-1 signaling and glycolysis as central pathways affected by TAZ. TAZ-NR4A1 axis acts as a novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism in controlling vasopressin-mediated AQP2 expression.

AB  - Percutaneous catheterization is currently utilized for central venous access in adult and adolescent porcine models; however, neonatal models require a cut down to gain venous access. This approach requires general anesthesia and can result in systemic inflammation, which can confound studies investigating other inflammatory triggers. Here we present the first successful series of percutaneous, ultrasound-guided, durable central venous access in newborn piglets weighing 1 kg with a novel method of tunneling the catheter subcutaneously using a needle. Catheters (3-5 Fr, single- or double-lumen) were successfully placed in the right jugular vein of eight piglets weighing 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg (mean +/- standard deviation) with an average duration of catheter patency of 4.5 +/- 2.1 days. There were no adverse events from catheter placement, though one catheter was inadvertently removed. This technique is a safe, minimally invasive method for obtaining secure central venous access in a neonatal porcine model.

AB  - Introduction Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) provide a unique model for studying cloning in large mammals. As an endangered species with declining populations and limited oocyte availability, interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) combined with transcriptomic analysis holds promise for advancing iSCNT embryonic arrest development and further facilitating applications in conservation efforts, therapeutic cloning, and regenerative medicine.Methods This study conducted low-input RNA sequencing analyses on transgenic Asian elephant-pig (AE-P) inter-order cloned embryos expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the 2- and 4-cell stages. Differential gene expressions, pathway enrichment, and hub gene analyses were performed to identify the molecular mechanisms and core genes influencing normal and arrest development.Results and Discussion Approximately 25% of clean reads successfully aligned with the Asian elephant genome. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that inter-order cloned embryos with earlier cleavage at the 2- and 4-cell stages exhibited signs of residual transcriptomic memory and incomplete epigenetic reprogramming, while arrested embryos showed indications of nucleocytoplasmic incompatibility and nDNA-mtDNA mismatch. Hub gene analyses indicated core genes such as NDUFC2, NDUFS3, NDUFAB1, SDHC, SDHB, NUP54, NUP43, NUP37, NDC1, CDK1, and CCNB1 linked to energy production, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and cell cycle regulation highlighting the overall challenges in cloning Asian elephant inter-order embryos. Altogether, the analysis of high-throughput sequencing enhances the reliability of iSCNT production in this study, advancing our understanding of cellular reprogramming and molecular roadblocks in AE-P inter-order cloned embryos. Transcriptomic analyses have identified key factors contributing to developmental barriers in iSCNT, offering valuable insights into the complexities of these challenges.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is one of the most important toxic elements in the natural environment. Currently, although the assessment of the potential health risks of chronic arsenic poisoning has received great attention, the research on the effects of arsenic on the brain is still limited. It has been reported that dictyophora polysaccharide (DIP), a common bioactive natural compound found in dietary plants, could reduce arsenic toxicity. Following behavioral research, comparative proteomics was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of arsenic toxicity to the hippocampi of SD (Sprague Dawley) rats and the protective effect of DIP. The results showed that exposure to arsenic impaired the spatial learning and memory ability of SD rats, while DIP treatment improved both the arsenic-exposed rats. Proteomic analysis showed that arsenic exposure dysregulated the expression of energy metabolism, apoptosis, synapse, neuron, and mitochondria related proteins in the hippocampi of arsenic-exposed rats. However, DIP treatment reversed or restored the expression levels of these proteins, thereby improving the spatial learning and memory ability of arsenic-exposed rats. This study is the first to use high-throughput proteomics to reveal the mechanism of arsenic neurotoxicity in rats as well as the protective mechanism of DIP against arsenic neurotoxicity.

AB  - 'Huangjinya' is a novel light-sensitive albino tea cultivar. Previously we have found that the leaves exhibit varying degrees of yellow coloration after being exposed to different light qualities, including red light (RL), blue light (BL), red + blue light (RB) and white light (WL). To understand the transcriptional response of different light qualities in leaf coloration of 'Huangjinya', RNA-seq analysis with three biological replicates was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in pigment metabolism pathways. With regard to porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, the protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) was upregulated and chlorophyllase (Chlase) was downregulated under RL compared with WL, which contributed to high chlorophyll content in 'Huangjinya'. The upregulated POR and magnesium chelatase H subunit (CHLH) were identified under RB. BL significantly promoted carotenoid biosynthesis, accompanied by the related upregulated genes. However, upregulated xanthoxin dehydrogenase (ABA2) reduced carotenoid content under BL. Zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) was upregulated and ABA2 was downregulated under RB, resulting in high accumulation of carotenoid content. BL and RL upregulated expressions of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in 'Huangjinya'. Differential expressions of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis was considered as the results of leaf color change. In addition, the genes related to photosynthesis were downregulated under RL, whereas these were upregulated under BL when compared with WL. In conclusion, the effect of light quality on the leaf coloration of 'Huangjinya' was mainly dependent on chlorophyll content by altering corresponding genes expressions. RL may promote the accumulation of chlorophyll in 'Huangjinya' leaves by upregulating the expression of genes related to chlorophyll synthesis (e.g., POR) and downregulating expression of genes related to chlorophyll degradation (e.g., Chlase). BL could upregulate the expression of genes related to both biosynthesis (e.g., POR, hemA) and degradation (e.g., Chlase) of chlorophyll, resulting in little change in leaf color of 'Huangjinya' under blue light when compared with white light. Upregulated genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis (e.g., POR, CHLH) induced greener color of 'Huangjinya' treated with RB.

AB  - Dicamba, a traditional highly effective and low toxicity herbicide, has gained new life with the development of dicamba-tolerant transgenic crops in recent years. However, dicamba is highly volatile and therefore easy to cause drift damage to sensitive crops. The development of efficient and sensitive detection methods is essential for monitoring of trace dicamba in the environment. Nanobody-based immunoassay plays an important role in on-site detection of pesticides. However, now rapid and sensitive immunoassay methods based on nanobody for dicamba detection were lacking. In this study, the nanobodies specifically recognizing dicamba were successfully obtained by immunising camels and phage display library construction, and then an indirect competitive immunoassay based on Nb-242 was constructed with IC50 of 0.93 mu g/mL and a linear range of 0.11-8.01 mu g/mL. Nb-242 had good specificity with no cross-reactivities against the dicamba analogs other than 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid and the developed immnoassay had a good correlation with the standard HPLC in the spike-recovery studies. Finally, the key amino acid Ala 123, Tyr 55, Tyr 59 and Arg 72 of Nb-242 that specifically recognizing and binding with dicamba were identified by homologous modeling and molecular docking, laying an important foundation for further structural modification of Nb-242. This study has important guiding significance for constructing immunoassay method of dicamba based on nanobody and provides a sensitive, specific, and reliable detection method that is suitable for the detection of dicamba in the environment.

AB  - Antibiotics in aquaculture prevent bacterial infection of fish, but their misuse is a public health risk and contributes to the unintentional creation of multiresistant pathogens. Regulatory agencies cannot do the rigorous, expensive testing required to keep up with the volume of seafood shipments. Current rapid test kits for these drugs enable the increase in testing needed for adequate monitoring of food supply chains, but they lack a high degree of accuracy. To combat this, we set out to discover and engineer single-domain antibodies (VHHs) that bind to small molecule antibiotics, and that can be used in rapid test kits. The small size, solubility, and stability of VHHs are useful properties that can improve the reliability and shelf-life of test kits for these adulterants. Here, we report a novel anti-chloramphenicol VHH (Chl-VHH) with a disassociation constant of 57 nM. This was achieved by immunizing a llama against a chloramphenicol-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate and screening for high affinity binders through phage display. The crystal structure of the bound-VHH to chloramphenicol was key to identifying a mutation in the binding pocket that resulted in a 16-fold improvement in binding affinity. In addition, the structure provides new insights into VHH-hapten interactions that can guide future engineering of VHHs against additional targets.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of the human macrophage (MP) secretome in cellular xenograft rejection. The role of human nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (hNME1), from the secretome of MPs involved in the neuronal differentiation of miniature pig adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mp AD-MSCs), was evaluated by proteomic analysis. Herein, we first demonstrate that hNME1 strongly binds to porcine ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 1 (pST8SIA1), which is a ganglioside GD3 synthase. When hNME1 binds with pST8SIA1, it induces degradation of pST8SIA1 in mp AD-MSCs, thereby inhibiting the expression of ganglioside GD3 followed by decreased neuronal differentiation of mp AD-MSCs. Therefore, we produced nanobodies (NBs) named NB-hNME1 that bind to hNME1 specifically, and the inhibitory effect of NB-hNME1 was evaluated for blocking the binding between hNME1 and pST8SIA1. Consequently, NB-hNME1 effectively blocked the binding of hNME1 to pST8SIA1, thereby recovering the expression of ganglioside GD3 and neuronal differentiation of mp AD-MSCs. Our findings suggest that mp AD-MSCs could be a potential candidate for use as an additive, such as an immunosuppressant, in stem cell transplantation.

AB  - The developing chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) was studied between embryonic days 16 (E16) and E37. Egg masses and volumes were estimated prior to harvesting of the CAM. CAM volumes were obtained before the CAM was sampled for histology and transmission electron microscopy analysis. Stereological methods were used to estimate volume densities and absolute volumes of CAM structural components. Growth rate estimates of the CAM and its major components were obtained. At E16, the three layers of the CAM were clearly delineated, but large parts still had not developed the blood-gas barrier (BGB) portions. By E37, chorionic blood capillaries had assumed a superficial position with thin BGB portions covering most of the chorionic surface. On regression analyses, the CAM had two growth phases, namely phase I that occurred between E16 and E25, when the CAM grew rapidly from a volume of 5.55 +/- 1.27 to 28.82 +/- 5.62 cm3 to then decrease to 25.18 +/- 4.79 cm3 during phase II (E25-E37). The latter decline was attributed to changes in the chorionic and allantoic layers, while regression in the mesoderm mainly characterized blood and lymphatic vessels.This article is part of the theme issue 'The biology of the avian respiratory system'.

AB  - Eogystia hippophaecolus (Hua, Chou, Fang et Chen) is a drilling pest that damages sea buckthorn, leading to substantial ecological and economic losses in areas where sea buckthorn is cultivated in China. Pheromone lures are widely used to monitor and trap male moths; however, the olfactory recognition mechanisms in male moths require further investigation. In this study, we characterized odorant receptor genes using phylogenetics, gene expression, sequence analyses and molecular docking. A phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method revealed that odorant receptor co-receptor (EhipOrco) genes clustered with other lepidopteran Orco genes, while pheromone receptor (EhipPR) genes clustered with other lepidopteran PR genes, suggesting that these genes have similar functions. The expression levels of 27 odorant receptor (EhipOR) genes in five tissues of male adults were analyzed using qPCR. Nine EhipOR genes were specifically expressed in the antennae, while several EhipOR genes were highly expressed in the head, feet, and external genitalia. As determined using molecular docking, EhipPR1-3 bound strongly to the primary sex pheromone components of E. hippophaecolus. Additionally, EhipPR1-3 demonstrated a strong binding affinity for longifolene among sea buckthorn volatiles. This study provides a foundation for future functional research on EhipORs and the olfactory recognition mechanisms of E. hippophaecolus.

AB  - This study aimed to extend the body of preclinical research on prototype dual-acting compounds combining the pharmacophores relevant for inhibiting cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10A) and serotonin 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor (5-HT1AR/5-HT7R) activity into a single chemical entity (compounds PQA-AZ4 and PQA-AZ6). After i.v. administration of PQA-AZ4 and PQA-AZ6 to rats, the brain to plasma ratio was 0.9 and 8.60, respectively. After i.g. administration, the brain to plasma ratio was 5.7 and 5.3, respectively. An antidepressant-like effect was observed for PQA-AZ6 in the forced swim test, after chronic 21-day treatment via i.p. administration with 1 mg/kg/day. Both compounds revealed an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Moreover, PQA-AZ4 and PQA-AZ6 completely reversed (+)-MK801-induced memory disturbances comparable with the potent PDE10 inhibitor, compound PQ-10. In the safety profile that included measurements of plasma glucose, triglyceride, and total cholesterol concentration, liver enzyme activity, the total antioxidant activity of serum, together with weight gain, compounds exhibited no significant activity. However, the studied compounds had different effects on human normal fibroblast cells as revealed in in vitro assay. The pharmacokinetic and biochemical results support the notion that these novel dual-acting compounds might offer a promising therapeutic tool in CNS-related disorders.

AB  - A concentration of 11% of glycerol is the standard one for sperm cryopreservation in chickens, however, the presence of just 2% glycerol already causes severe fertility reduction, suggesting the necessity of removing glycerol before artificial insemination (AI). The major approach developed for this purpose is serial dilution followed by centrifugation (SDC), which demands special equipment (such as a refrigerate room) to maintain post-thaw semen at 4.C, besides being time consuming. Therefore, we attempted to develop a simple method to remove glycerol from chicken frozen-thawed semen based on a colloidal gel, Percoll, which is ordinarily used to select motile and viable sperm in mammals as well as in fresh chicken semen. In this study, we used a Percoll based glycerol removal solution (GRS) containing sucrose to avoid frozen-thawed sperm suffering from osmotic stress. Subsequently, several conditions including GRS compositions (GRS A, B, C and D) and centrifugation temperatures (4 and 20 degrees C) were compared by their influence on sperm in vitro parameters. Afterwards, GRS A and D were selected for fertility evaluation, compared to conventional SDC method. Our results showed that the fertility with GRS A at both 4 and 20 degrees C were higher than GRS D (p < 0.05) and similar or even superior to the fertility obtained with SDC method. Altogether, our novel GRS protocol is a valuable method for chicken sperm cryobanking policy, supported by its notable results of fertility as well as saving 44% of time, with a simple equipment at flexible operation temperatures of 4 or 20 degrees C.

AB  - The field of computer vision is characterized by computationally intensive algorithms and techniques with strict real-time requirements. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are based on a concurrent paradigm which allows the design of efficient hardware architectures and has positioned FPGAs as an ideal device for implementing compute-intensive applications. For this reason, FPGA technology has had a great impact in areas such as computer vision, where one of the main objectives for researchers working in this field is to create efficient automatic object recognition systems. Therefore, the need to provide undergraduates with the necessary skills to design FPGA-based object recognition systems is evident. With this aim in mind, it is essential that specialization courses related to the design of these systems include the required resources for the student to apply the theoretical knowledge in solving practical problems. In this article, we present a development tool designed to help students, teachers, and researchers during the design-modeling-implementation process of object recognition systems based on FPGAs. The proposed tool operates under a modular approach as this facilitates the working on any of the phases of a recognition system and it is considered as a hybrid because the other phases can be developed using a software language. An empirical evaluation involving undergraduates enrolled in a Computer Engineering program was conducted to create a hardware architecture for the DAISY descriptor that uses the homogeneous features of objects immersed in images to produce an efficient representation. By considering similar descriptors such as Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), DAISY is computed by convolving orientation maps instead of using weighted sums of gradient norms, which offers the same kind of invariance at a lower computational cost for the dense case. The results obtained during such an evaluation indicated that students consider this FPGA-based tool to be an alternative to receiving practical training on designing systems for solving problems related to the area of object recognition.

AB  - BackgroundSulfur mustard (SM) is a chemical warfare vesicant that severely injures exposed eyes, lungs, and skin. Mechlorethamine hydrochloride (NM) is widely used as an SM surrogate. This study aimed to develop a depilatory double-disc (DDD) NM skin burn model for investigating vesicant pharmacotherapy countermeasures. MethodsHair removal method (clipping only versus clipping followed by a depilatory), the effect of acetone in the vesicant administration vehicle, NM dose (0.5-20 mu mol), vehicle volume (5-20 mu l), and time course (0.5-21 days) were investigated using male and female CD-1 mice. Edema, an indicator of burn response, was assessed by biopsy skin weight. The ideal NM dose to induce partial-thickness burns was assessed by edema and histopathologic evaluation. The optimized DDD model was validated using an established reagent, NDH-4338, a cyclooxygenase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor prodrug. ResultsClipping/depilatory resulted in a 5-fold higher skin edematous response and was highly reproducible (18-fold lower %CV) compared to clipping alone. Acetone did not affect edema formation. Peak edema occurred 24-48 h after NM administration using optimized dosing methods and volume. Ideal partial-thickness burns were achieved with 5 mu mol of NM and responded to treatment with NDH-4338. No differences in burn edematous responses were observed between males and females. ConclusionA highly reproducible and sensitive partial-thickness skin burn model was developed for assessing vesicant pharmacotherapy countermeasures. This model provides clinically relevant wound severity and eliminates the need for organic solvents that induce changes to the skin barrier function.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent mental disorder with high morbidity and mortality and its pathogenesis remains exactly unclarified. However, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are two highly dynamic organelles that perform an indispensable role in the development of depression. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress are recognized as vital pathological hallmarks in depression. The changes of intracellular activities such as mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, energy metabolism and ER stress are closely correlated with the progression of depression. Moreover, organelles interactions are conducive to homeostasis and cellular functions, and mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) serve as signaling hubs of the two organelles and the coupling of the pathological progression. The main roles of MAMs are involved in metabolism, signal transduction, lipid transport, and maintenance of its structure and function. At present, accumulating studies elucidated that MAMs have gradually become a novel therapeutic target in treatment of depression. In the review, we focus on influence of mitochondria dysfunction and ER stress on depression. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying role of MAMs in depression and highlight natural products targeting MAMs as potential antidepressants to treat depression.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly common emergency disease that usually leads to prolonged physical and cognitive impairments. In this study, we investigated if sevoflurane could induce cognitive improvement in TBI rats. Rats were subjected to head trauma induced by a fluid percussion device. A two-hour exposure to 3% sevoflurane was performed in a chamber immediately after TBI. Sevoflurane inhalation reduced the neurological and cognitive deficits induced by TBI with ameliorated synaptic injuries in the hippocampus. Moreover, after sevoflurane treatment, the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the hippocampus was enhanced 1 d after TBI and maintained at high levels 14 days later, and oxidative stress induced by TBI was inhibited. However, the HO-1 inhibitor, Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), used to demonstrate the involvement of HO-1, suppressed the protective effect of sevoflurane. These results indicate that sevoflurane administered immediately after TBI may protect against TBI-induced synaptic and cognitive impairments by promoting the antioxidant Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway. Sevoflurane may be a promising anesthetic for patients with TBI.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with early-life origins. Maternal obesity has been associated with increased ASD risk, yet the mechanisms and timing of susceptibility remain unclear. Using a mouse model combining in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer, we separated the effects of pre-conception and gestational obesity. We found that maternal high fat diet (HFD) exposure prior to conception alone was sufficient to induce ASD-like behaviors in male offspring-including altered vocalizations, reduced sociability, and increased repetitive grooming-without anxiety-related changes. These phenotypes were absent in female offspring and those exposed only during gestation. Cortical transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation and isoform shifts in genes implicated in ASD, including Homer1 and Zswim6. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of hippocampal tissue showed hypomethylation of an alternative Homer1 promoter, correlating with increased expression of the short isoform Homer1a, which is known to disrupt synaptic scaffolding. This pattern was specific to mice with ASD-like behaviors. Our findings show that pre-conceptional maternal obesity can lead to lasting, isoform-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in the offspring's brain. These results underscore the importance of maternal health before pregnancy as a critical and modifiable factor in ASD risk.

AB  - PM2.5 is recently identified as a kind of material possessing severe biohazard. It can enter human body and exerts pathological effects on lung, eyes, and the central nervous system (CNS). Maternal exposure to PM2.5 can affect neural development and cause cognitive decline in offspring, with the underlying mechanisms unclear, however. The inflammasome monitors and responds to biological stressors, with HMGB1-NLRP3 inflammatory axis as an essential pathophysiological player outside the brain. The present work is to investigate its role in cognitive impairment induced by gestational exposure to PM2.5 in mice offspring. We found that HMGB1-NLRP3 pathway was activated in the hippocampus of mice offspring by gestational exposure to PM2.5 in a dose-dependent manner, with protein levels of HMGB1, NLRP3, and cleaved caspase-1 as approximately three times as high as those of control. And down-regulating HMGB1 during pregnancy could alleviate the resultant impairment on learning and working memory as well as hippocampal neurons, up-regulate the synapse related proteins of SYP and PSD-95 and correct the increased expression of 5-HT2A to comparable levels to control, as well as inhibiting the activation of microglia and decreasing the expression of HMGB1 and Iba1/HMGB1 double positive cells in the hippocampus of mice offspring. Meanwhile, protein levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1 beta and IL-18, as well as TLR4, phosphorylated NF-Kappa B, and MAPKs, were almost down-regulated to those of control. Therefore, HMGB1 intervention inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated hippocampal inflammatory response through TLR4/MAPKs/NF-Kappa B signaling pathway, alleviating PM2.5-induced cognitive dysfunction. Further in vitro results suggest that PM2.5 can activate microglia and HMGB1-NLRP3 inflammatory axis. Pretreatment with HMGB1 inhibitor significantly reduced the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-Kappa B, and inhibited the inflammatory response mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome similarly to those in vivo. These results suggest that PM2.5 exposure promotes the inflammatory response in hippocampus mediated by HMGB1-NLRP3 inflammatory axis in microglia, resulting in cognitive dysfunction in offspring, which could be alleviated by simultaneous HMGB1 suppression. These findings provide a theoretical basis for preventing cognitive impairment in offspring caused by environmental pollution during pregnancy.

AB  - The effectiveness of predators in suppressing prey populations is known to be influenced by the predator-prey release ratio. The efficacy of Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) against Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergand) in the presence or absence of Tetranychus urticae Koch and Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot on rose plants was evaluated in the present study. The decrease of F. occidentalis populations was compared at the six predator:prey ratios of 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, and 1:100 in the laboratory, and at the three release rates of 20, 40, and 100 predators per m2 in microcosm conditions. The plants without predators were considered as controls. All treatments with the release of N. cucumeris resulted in a significant decrease in F. occidentalis larval population compared to the control. The most suppression (84.5%) of F. occidentalis larvae was observed in the release rate of 100 adults of N. cucumeris per m2 in 30 days after the release of the predator. Predator ratios of 1:2 and 1:5 of N. cucumeris: F. occidentalis resulted in a 94.6 and 93.4% decrease in F. occidentalis larvae after 24 hours, respectively. The presence of T. urticae (as a competitor herbivore) and P. persimilis had no effect on the efficiency of N. cucumeris in the suppression of F. occidentalis. The dense webs of T. urticae decreased the efficiency of N. cucumeris at predator:prey ratios of 1:5 and 1:10 more than1:2. This study showed that the release of 100 adults of N. cucumeris per m2 would be sufficient to control F. occidentalis larvae on rose plants. Moreover, we demonstrated that higher release rates of N.cucumeris are needed when T. urticae's dense webs are present.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) can enhance the biomass and feeding quality of forage crops and advance the growth of the herbivorous livestock industry. Investigating the N fertilizer dynamics in the soil-crop-livestock system is important for resource-use efficiency and environmental safety. By using the N-15-labeled technology and the in vitro incubation technique, an experiment was conducted in the North China Plain (NCP) in 2015-2016 to quantify the migration and distribution of N fertilizer in the soil-forage triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack)-dairy cow system. The results showed that 34.1-37.3% of the applied N fertilizer was absorbed by forage triticale, in which 35.9-39.6% N accumulated in the stems and 60.4-64.1% accumulated in the leaves. In addition, 36.3-39.1% of the applied N fertilizer remained in the 0-100 cm soil layer, in which 81.8-91.3% was distributed in the 0-40 cm soil layer. The remaining 24.6-26.8% of the applied N fertilizer was lost in various ways and 28.1-31.3% of the N fertilizer could be utilized by dairy cows. When N fertilizer was applied between 0-225 kg N ha(-1), the increased application of N fertilizer improved the biomass yield from 14.0 to 17.5 t ha(-1) and enhanced the N content of the forage triticale from 1.3% to 1.4%; however, it did not significantly affect the distribution rate of N fertilizer in the soil-forage triticale-dairy cow system. The optimum N fertilizer application rate for forage triticale is less than 225 kg N ha(-1) to maintain high-efficient N use in the soil-crop-livestock system and reduce the environmental risks in the NCP. Our results quantified the N fertilizer dynamics in the soil-forage triticale-dairy cow system and provided a significant reference for guiding rational strategies of forage triticale cultivation.

AB  - Sleep deprivation, which is a common problem in modern society, impairs memory function , emotional behavior. TRPV1, a subfamily of transient receptor potential cation channels, is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and is associated with animal behavior. In this article, we report that TRPV1 deficiency in mice alleviates sleep deprivation-induced abnormal behaviors. We found that in the sleep-deprived mice, TRPV1 knockout increased the duration and visits in the central area in the open field task and increased visits to the open arms in the elevated plus maze. The TRPV1-/-mice performed better during the test stage in the Morris water maze phase after sleep deprivation. In the mPFC and hippocampus regions, western blotting results showed that TRPV1-/-attenuated sleep deprivation-induced increases in GFAP, NLRP3 , ASC and increased the expression of the mitochondrial marker Tom20. Immunofluorescence results showed that the action of TRPV1 knockout on NLRP3 was negatively correlated with Tom20 after sleep deprivation. Our results confirm that TRPV1 knockout attenuates sleep deprivation-induced behavioral disorders. The effect of TRPV1 on the behavior of sleep-deprived mice may be related to the neuroinflammation associated with mitochondria in the mPFC and hippocampus.

AB  - Introduction This study mainly investigated the role of miR-199a-5p in depression. Methods qRT-PCR and western blotting were employed to detect the expressions of miR-199a-5p, CREB and BDNF. Sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test were performed to evaluate depression-related symptoms. MTT assays and flow cytometry were used to examine the cell reproduction and apoptotic cells of hippocampal neuron. Results The data demonstrated that the expression levels of miR-199a-5p in the cerebrospinal fluids and serums of depression patient and the hippocampus of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse were significantly increased. However, the expressions of WNT2, p-CREB, and BDNF were inhibited. In addition, miR-199a-5p-inhibitor enhanced sucrose preferences of CUMS mouse and decreased immobile time in sucrose preference test and forced swimming test. Knockdown of WNT2 attenuated the effects of miR-199a-5p-inhibitor on cell reproduction and apoptotic cells of hippocampal neuron and the expression of WNT2, p-CREB, and BDNF. Conclusion MiR-199a-5p can target WNT2 to enhance the development of depression through regulation of the CREB/BDNF signaling. Trial registration: JNU-Hos-49284.

AB  - In 2021, the northward migration of Asian elephants in southwestern China's Yunnan Province attracted significant public attention. Exploring the behavior of Asian elephants will help to better protect this endangered species and further realize the harmonious coexistence of humans and elephants. Based on the news texts regarding the northward migration of Asian elephants, this study used network text analysis, social network analysis, and grounded theoretical research methods to explore the behavioral characteristics and internal motivations of Asian elephants during their northward migration. The results indicate that: (1) during the northward migration of Asian elephants, moving and foraging are their most frequent behaviors, and foraging may be the chief purpose of the migration. (2) Different behaviors of Asian elephants hide their behavioral choice preferences, including environmental, time, and behavioral preferences. During the migration, Asian elephants mostly move in low-altitude areas, often foraging or migrating around farmland in the afternoon or at night, returning to the mountains to rest in the early morning. Corn, rice, and other crops are their primary food; the change in their eating habits is influenced by the lack of herbs and woody plants inside the protected area. (3) The northward migration behavior of elephant herds is influenced by various factors, such as elephant population expansion, habitat change, and species migration characteristics, and the relationship between conservation and development needs to be balanced.

AB  - One of the factors responsible for less pregnancy rates is the use of frozen semen in sheep due to the oxidative stress created by the process. The aim of this experiment was to test the effects of adding coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ10) to the seminal extender on sperm quality and the pregnancy rate of sheep. In this study, ejaculates from eight Dorper rams of reproductive age were used and tested in four treatments: Control (pure BotuBov (R)), C1 (175 mu M of CoQ10), C3 (350 mu M of CoQ10), and C7 (700 mu M of CoQ10). Samples were collected in triplicate from each animal, and sperm analysis was performed by CASA after thawing at 0 h and 2 h. The samples were also analyzed by flow cytometry for plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity, stability, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial potential, and superoxide anion production. In total, 198 ewes were inseminated by laparoscopy and divided into two groups: control (n=98) and C7 (n=100). Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at 30 days. Coenzyme Q10 proved to be safe for semen cryopreservation, not altering sperm kinetic values between the groups post-thawing. In flow cytometry, the C1 and C7 groups achieved a better index of plasma membrane integrity and membrane stability (P<0.05). A increased pregnancy rate was observed in C7 (52 %) compared to the control (38 %). In conclusion, coenzyme Q10 assists in the cryopreservation process, protecting the sperm cell and improving pregnancy rates in ewes.

AB  - As an important Ca2+ sensor, calmodulin (CaM) and calmodulin-like protein (CML) play core roles in plant growth, development, and response to environmental stimuli. The CaM/CML gene family has been well characterized in various plant species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and tomato; however, in the tea plant, the CaM/CML gene family has not been systematically and comprehensively characterized. In the present study, a total of 5 CsCaM and 60 CsCML proteins were identified from the tea plant genome, which were unevenly distributed on the 14 chromosomes of the tea plant. All the proteins contained two to four EF-hand domains. Meanwhile, an integrated analysis of physicochemical properties, sequence structure, motif identification, phylogeny, gene duplication, promoter cis-elements, and RNA-seq expression profiles in the CsCaM/CML gene family was performed. Transcriptome analysis revealed that CsCaM/CMLs were differentially expressed in different tissues of the tea plant, suggesting their potential roles in plant growth and development. The expression profiles associated with various stress treatments revealed that CsCaM/CML genes were involved in a wide range of abiotic factors, including cold and drought stress. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was also used to validate the differences in expression under abiotic stress. Overall, these findings enhanced our understanding of CsCaM/CML genes and provided useful information for further research into their molecular functions in abiotic stress response, and in multiple physiological processes in the tea plant.

AB  - One of the primary tools for cooperatively managing animal populations within the Association of Zoos and Aquariums is through Breeding and Transfer Plan (BTP) recommendations. These recommendations consider population demographics, genetics, husbandry, and institutional needs and aim to improve population viability and long-term sustainability. However, fulfilling (i.e., completing) recommendations can be complicated by biological and logistical challenges. We examined institutional reasons for unfulfilled Breed With, Do Not Breed, Hold, and Send To recommendations collected in surveys in PMCTrack, software for tracking recommendation fulfillment, using descriptive and text-mining methods. Overall, 73 Animal Programs used PMCTrack to distribute 2335 surveys and accrued responses from 167 zoos and aquariums from 2007 to 2019, with a response rate of 56% (n = 1307). For Breed With recommendations, common reasons were related to an individual animal's status and a pair's breeding behavior; for all other recommendation types, reasons were often management or logistical factors. Most Breed With recommendations were attempted (>= 55%) but did not result in detectable pregnancy/eggs or offspring, due to pair incompatibility or not enough time to successfully produce offspring. Hold and Do Not Breed recommendations were often unfulfilled because the BTP recommendation was replaced with an interim (i.e., updated) recommendation during the inter-planning period. Our results support the importance of some common population management practices, such as maintaining breeding pairs/groups for multiple BTPs to improve mate familiarity, examining husbandry mechanisms to promote breeding success, and making a concerted effort to adhere to planning timelines to facilitate transfers in alignment with breeding seasons.

AB  - Chronic sleep deprivation and lack of physical exercise may have detrimental effects on overall health, particularly in terms of brain health, with significant implications for cognitive function and well-being. This review explores the impact of chronic sleep deprivation and physical exercise on brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drawing insights from 40 selected studies, the review synthesizes evidence on these lifestyle factors' correlations with neurodegenerative changes. Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts circadian rhythms and neurochemical pathways, potentially accelerating brain atrophy, while physical exercise preserves brain structure by enhancing vascular health, reducing inflammation, and supporting synaptic plasticity, particularly in regions like the hippocampus. Results highlight distinct patterns of brain atrophy in AD and MCI, underscoring the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. Understanding the relationship between sleep disruption and brain health provides insights into strategies for possibly delaying neurodegenerative diseases like MCI, which represents a milder form of Alzheimer's, and AD. The findings underscore the potential utility of integrating sleep therapy and physical exercise interventions in clinical practice for early detection of mild cognitive impairment and potentially delaying disease progression. This integrated approach has been found to promote healthy aging, reduce atrophy rates, and enhance cognitive resilience across aging populations.

AB  - The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) has been widely related to spatial and contextual memory. However, we recently demonstrated that the anterior part of the RSC (aRSC) is required for object recognition (OR) memory consolidation. In this study, we aimed to analyze the requirement of dopaminergic inputs into the aRSC for OR memory consolidation in male rats. We observed amnesia at 24-h long-term memory when we infused SCH23390, a D1/D5 dopamine receptors antagonist, into aRSC immediately after OR training session. However, the same infusion had no effect on OR short-term memory. Then, we analyzed whether the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is necessary for OR consolidation. VTA inactivation by intra-VTA administration of muscimol, a GABA(A) agonist, immediately after an OR training session induced amnesia when animals were tested at 24 h. Moreover, we observed that this VTA inactivation-induced amnesia was reversed by the simultaneous intra-aRSC delivery of SKF38393, a D1/D5 receptor agonist. Altogether, our results suggest that VTA dopaminergic inputs to aRSC play an important modulatory role in OR memory consolidation.

AB  - Sprouts are increasingly present in the human diet, being tasty and healthy foods high in antioxidant compounds. Although there is a body of literature on the sprouting of many plant species, Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz has not yet been studied for this purpose. This study aimed to characterize the main bioactive compounds and antioxidant potential of seeds and sprouts of five different Camelina cultivars (ALBA, CO46, CCE43, JOELLE, and VERA). In particular, the contents of phenolic compounds (PCs), phenolic acids (PAs), and glucosinolates (GLSs) were investigated. PCs, PAs, GLSs, and the antioxidant activity of seeds differed among cultivars and were greatly increased by sprouting. A PCA analysis underlined both the effect of the cultivar (PC2) and the germination (PC1) on the nutritional properties of Camelina. The best nutritional properties of seeds were observed for ALBA and CCE43, while the best nutritional properties of sprouts were recorded for CCE43 and JOELLE, since the latter cultivar showed a greater enhancement in phytochemical content and antioxidant activity with sprouting. Finally, a UHPLC-UV procedure for the analysis of GLSs in Camelina was developed and validated. The performance criteria of the proposed method demonstrated that it is useful for the analysis of GLSs in Camelina.

AB  - Gas-permeable membrane (GPM) technology is gaining interest to recover nitrogen from residual effluents due to its effectiveness, simple operation and capacity of producing a nutrient rich product with fertilising value. In this study, a GPM contactor was used at 25 degrees C to recover total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) from swine slurry as a concentrated (NH4)2SO4 solution. Firstly, a synthetic solution was tested on a wide pH range (6-12). Results showed that the ammonia mass transfer constants (Km) increased from 7.9 center dot 10-9 to 1.2 center dot 10-6 m/s as the pH increased. The reagent consumption to control the pH per mole nitrogen recovered had a minimum at pH 9, which showed a Km value of 3.0 center dot 10-7 m/s. Secondly, various pH control strategies were tested using swine slurry, including (i) no pH control, (ii) pH control at 8.5, 9.0 and 10.0, and (iii) an initial spike of the NaOH equivalent to the required to control the pH at 9. The test without pH control reached a TAN recovery of around 60%, which could be an interesting strategy when high nitrogen recoveries or short operating times are not required. The pH control at 9 stood out as the most favourable operating condition due to its high Km and lower reagent consumption. Thirdly, several feed-to-trapping volume ratios ranging from 1:1 to 15:1 were tested using swine slurry at pH 9. These assays revealed that a GPM process with a high feed-to-trapping volume ratio fastens the recovery of 99% of TAN as a high purity (NH4)2SO4 solution containing 40 g N/L.

AB  - We developed this whole blood immunophenotyping panel with the aim to monitor and quantify major lymphocyte subsets (CD4+, CD8+, CD4+CD8+ alpha beta T cells, gamma delta-T cells, B and NK cells) and monocytes in pigs. The panel involved the use of commercially available reagents, avoiding secondary antibody staining or in-house antibody conjugations, with the aim to make the assay accessible and reproducible across laboratories. The assay is accurate, robust and represents a useful tool for immune monitoring of swine in the pharmacology and toxicology fields, or to monitor the immune status in response to vaccination and diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease manifests as a complex pathological condition, with neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and cholinergic dysfunction being a few of the many pathological changes. Due to the complexity of the disease, current therapeutic strategies aim at a multitargeted approach, often relying on a combination of substances with versatile and complementary effects. In the present study, a unique combination of alpha-lipoic acid, citicoline, extracts of leaves from olive tree and green tea, vitamin D3, selenium and an immune-supporting complex was tested in scopolamine-induced dementia in rats. Using behavioral and biochemical methods, we assessed the effects of the combination on learning and memory, and elucidated the mechanisms of these effects. Our results showed that, compared to its components, the experimental combination was most efficient in improving short-and long-term memory as assessed by the step-through method as well as spatial memory as assessed by T-maze and Barnes maze underlined by decreases in AChE activity (p < 0.05) and LPO (p < 0.001), increases in SOD activity in the cortex (p < 0.05) and increases in catalase (p < 0.05) and GPx (p < 0.01) activities and BDNF (p < 0.001) and pCREB (p < 0.05) levels in the hippocampus. No significant histopathological changes or blood parameter changes were detected, making the experimental combination an effective and safe candidate in a multitargeted treatment of AD.

AB  - The primary objective of this study is to formulate a comprehensive digital and physical model, at a scaled level, for a social housing unit utilizing the open-source Wikihouse system. The construction industry is currently grappling with the dual challenges of a real estate crisis and climate change. In response to this scenario, the integration of industrialized methods in construction processes is advocated to enhance the overall quality of the end product, streamline construction timelines, and curtail production costs. The algorithm developed for this purpose leverages Rhino and Grasshopper programs, thereby optimizing material efficiency when compared to traditional individual pieces. Noteworthy among the features of the Wikihouse system is its remarkable versatility, allowing implementation in diverse locations. This flexibility stems from its efficient assembly characteristics, which liberate it from the constraints of rigid modular structures, contributing significantly to architectural design flexibility. The paramount finding of this research is the demonstrated efficiency of the proposed system, requiring 44% less time compared to conventional construction practices and exhibiting a commendable 29% reduction in costs. These outcomes position the Wikihouse-based approach as an appealing and competitive alternative within the real estate sector.

AB  - In the heart, the specific 3D structure of myocardial layers produces an efficient ejection of blood. When myocardial infarction strikes, this architecture is disrupted, adding a disarranged contraction to the decreased availability of pumping units (cardiomyocytes, CMs). In this work, the alignment of cardiac fibers in a large animal model (pig) is characterized and employ melt electrowriting (MEW) to fabricate a bio-inspired scaffold with diamond-shaped pores. Using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs and cardiac fibroblasts, human cardiac tissues with a biomimetic in-plane contraction are generated. MEW-diamond tissues beat macroscopically for over 1 month, with significantly faster kinetics, increased force, and higher conduction velocity than those based on square or rectangular pores. The diamond design induces a specific hiPSC-CM alignment resulting in the observed in-plane contraction. Transcriptomic analysis using bulk RNA-seq reveals diamond-MEW tissues present features of maturation as compared to traditional 2D cultures. Finally, the bio-inspired cardiac tissues are employed to treat an infarction model in athymic rats, showing a significant benefit on systolic function and remodeling, tied to the presence of large grafts of human cells remuscularizing the ventricular wall. All in all, it is demonstrated that the new design generates superior human cardiac tissues with therapeutic capacity.

AB  - Deacetylated chitin derivatives have been widely studied for tissue engineering purposes. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of an injectable product containing a 50% deacetylated chitin derivative (BoneReg-Inject (TM)) and an existing product (chronOS Inject(R)) serving as a predicate device. A sheep model with a critical size drill hole in the tibial plateau was used. Holes of 8 mm diameter and 30 mm length were drilled bilaterally into the proximal area of the tibia and BoneReg-Inject (TM) or chronOS Inject(R) were injected into the right leg holes. Comparison of resorption and bone formation in vivo was made by X-ray micro-CT and histological evaluation after a live phase of 12 weeks. Long-term effects of BoneReg-Inject (TM) were studied using a 13-month live period. Significant differences were observed in (1) amount of new bone within implant (p < 0.001), higher in BoneReg-Inject(TM), (2) signs of cartilage tissue (p = 0.003), more pronounced in BoneReg-Inject(TM), and (3) signs of fibrous tissue (p < 0.001), less pronounced in BoneReg-Inject(TM). Mineral content at 13 months postoperative was significantly higher than at 12 weeks (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, for implant core and rim, respectively). The data demonstrate the potential of deacetylated chitin derivatives to stimulate bone formation.

AB  - On their dorsal surface, bat tongues show a raised muscular structure called mediodorsal lobe (MDL) or lingual prominence. It exhibits different mechanical papillae across species, which we hypothesized are linked to foraging strategies. We predicted that tall MDLs and prominent papillae pointing frontward would effectively trap prey items caught on the wing by aerial hawkers. We examined 904 high-resolution, close-up images of 239 individual bats from 24 European species, focusing on MDL height and morphology and arrangement of MDL papillae. Aerial hawkers such as Tadarida teniotis, Nyctalus lasiopterus, Miniopterus schreibersii, and pipistrelles displayed prominent forward-pointing papillae and taller MDLs, adaptations suited to high-speed aerial foraging. These traits may be part of a broader "ecomorphological syndrome", facilitating efficient prey capture in open-space foragers. In contrast, gleaning and trawling species lacked these specializations, exhibiting flatter MDLs and less prominent papillae. Phylogenetic analysis indicated evolutionary convergence in MDL morphology among aerial hawkers, with M. schreibersii showing similarities to vespertilionids despite its phylogenetic distance. This convergence highlights the influence of evolutionary pressures arising from foraging requirements on tongue morphology. Although possessing tall MDLs, rhinolophids are outliers, possibly reflecting their unique perch-hunting strategy or echolocation. If the patterns we found are confirmed for a larger number of species, MDL morphology could predict foraging style across bat species and be included in future descriptions of foraging guilds.

AB  - As an important part of tumor microenvironment, neutrophils are poorly understood due to their spatiotemporal heterogeneity in tumorigenesis. Here we defined, at single-cell resolution, CD44(-)CXCR2(-) neutrophils as tumor-specific neutrophils (tsNeus) in both mouse and human gastric cancer (GC). We uncovered a Hippo regulon in neutrophils with unique YAP signature genes (e.g., ICAM1, CD14, EGR1) distinct from those identified in epithelial and/or cancer cells. Importantly, knockout of YAP/TAZ in neutrophils impaired their differentiation into CD54(+ )tsNeus and reduced their antitumor activity, leading to accelerated GC progression. Moreover, the relative amounts of CD54(+ )tsNeus were found to be negatively associated with GC progression and positively associated with patient survival. Interestingly, GC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy had increased numbers of CD54(+ )tsNeus. Furthermore, pharmacologically enhancing YAP activity selectively activated neutrophils to suppress refractory GC, with no significant inflammation-related side effects. Thus, our work characterized tumor-specific neutrophils in GC and revealed an essential role of YAP/TAZ-CD54 axis in tsNeus, opening a new possibility to develop neutrophil-based antitumor therapeutics.

AB  - As a critical signaling molecule, ABA plays an important role in plant growth, development, and stresses response. However, tea plant (Camellia sinensis), an important economical perennial woody plant, has not been systematically reported in response to ABA signal transduction in vivo. In this study, we mined and identified the gene structure of CsPYL/CsPP2C-A/CsSnRK gene families in ABA signal transduction pathway through the genome-wide analysis of tea plant. Spatiotemporal expression and stress response (drought, salt, chilling) expression patterns were characterized. The results showed that most members of CsPYLs were conserved, the gene structures of members of A type CsPP2Cs were highly similar, while the gene structure of CsSnRK2s was highly variable. The transcription levels of different family members were differentially expressed with plant growth and development, and their response to stress signal patterns was highly correlated. The expression patterns of CsPYL/CsPP2C-A/CsSnRK2 gene family members in different tissues of tea plant cuttings after exogenous ABA treatment were detected by qRT-PCR, and the hierarchical model of ABA signaling was constructed by correlation analysis to preliminarily obtain three potential ABA-dependent signaling transduction pathways. Subsequently, the protein interaction of the CsPYL4/7-CsPP2C-A2-CsSnRK2.8 signaling pathway was verified by yeast two-hybrid and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, indicating that there is specific selectivity in the ABA signaling pathway. Our results provided novel insights into ABA-dependent signal transduction model in tea plant and information for future functional characterizations of stress tolerance genes in tea plant.

AB  - Tea plant roots can uptake both inorganic nitrogen (NH4+ and NO3-) and organic nitrogen (amino acids) from the soil. These amino acids are subsequently assimilated into theanine and transported to young shoots through the xylem. Our previous study showed that CsLHT1 and CsLHT6 transporters take up amino acids from the soil, and CsAAPs participate in the transport of theanine. However, whether other amino acid transporters are involved in this process remains unknown. In this study, we identified two new CsAAPs homologous to CsAAP7, named CsAAP7.1 and CsAAP7.2. Heterologous expression of CsAAP7.1 and CsAAP7.2 in the yeast mutant 22 Delta 10 alpha showed that CsAAP7.2 had the capacity to transport theanine and other amino acids, whereas CsAAP7.1 had no transport activity. Transient expression of the CsAAP7.2-GFP fusion protein in tobacco leaf epidermal cells confirmed its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Tissue-specific analysis showed that CsAAP7.2 was highly expressed in roots and stems. In addition, CsAAP7.2 overexpression lines were more sensitive to high concentrations of theanine due to the high accumulation of theanine in seedlings. Taken together, these findings suggested that CsAAP7.2 plays an important role in the uptake of amino acids from soil and the long-distance transport of theanine. These results provide valuable tools for nitrogen nutrition studies and enrich our understanding of theanine transport in tea plants.

AB  - Selenium is an important indicator for the evaluation of tea quality. However, the relationship between selenium uptake by tea plants (Camellia sinensis) and soil properties, as well as selenium transport and distribution in a tea plantation soil-tea plant-tea infusion production system, remain unclear. In this study, 12 tea plantations situated in a typical selenium-rich area of China were selected, and the characteristics and crucial factors influencing the uptake and transport of selenium were analyzed using a plantation soil-tea plant-tea infusion production system. The soil total selenium content ranged from 1.12 to 6.67 mg kg-1, with an average of 2.57 mg kg-1. The average available selenium content was 53.56 mu g kg-1, and the activation rate of soil selenium was 2.27%. Soil-available selenium was significantly positively correlated with total selenium, available potassium, and soil organic matter contents, and was significantly negatively correlated with soil pH. The selenium content in old leaves ranged from 0.29 to 2.73 mg kg-1, which met the standard for selenium-rich tea, whereas only 33% of young leaves met this standard. The selenium enrichment factor was highest in the fibrous root and lowest in the young leaves. The average selenium transport factors from fibrous roots to main roots, from main roots to main stems, from main stems to lateral stems, from lateral stems to young leaves, and from lateral stems to old leaves were 0.53, 0.92, 0.67, 0.97, and 2.30, respectively. The selenium concentration of tea infusion ranged from 1.88 to 12.49 mu g L-1, and the average selenium dissolution rate was 22.62% after one brewing. This study identified critical factors that influence soil-selenium availability. The selenium content in tea plant organs is indicated to be strongly associated with the selenium content in the main roots.

AB  - MicroRNA166 (miR166) is a highly conserved plant miRNA that plays a crucial role in plant growth and the resistance to various abiotic stresses. However, the miR166s in tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) have not been comprehensively identified and analyzed. This study identified 30 mature miR166s and twelve pre-miR166s in tea plants. An evolutionary analysis revealed that csn-miR166s originating from the 3 ' arm of their precursors were more conserved than the csn-miR166s derived from the 5 ' arm of their precursors. The twelve pre-miR166s in tea were divided into two groups, with csn-MIR166 Scaffold364-2 separated from the other precursors. The Mfold-based predictions indicated that the twelve csn-MIR166s formed typical and stable structures comprising a stem-loop hairpin, with minimum free energy ranging from -110.90 to -71.80 kcal/mol. An analysis of the CsMIR166 promoters detected diverse cis-acting elements, including those related to light responses, biosynthesis and metabolism, abiotic stress defenses, and hormone responses. There was no one-to-one relationship between the csn-miR166s and their targets, but most csn-miR166s targeted HD-Zip III genes. Physiological characterization of tea plants under drought stress showed that leaf water content proportionally decreased with the aggravation of drought stress. In contrast, tea leaves' malondialdehyde (MDA) content proportionally increased. Moreover, the cleavage site of the ATHB-15-like transcript was identified according to a modified 5 ' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The RT-qPCR data indicated that the transcription of nine csn-miR166s was negatively correlated with their target gene.

AB  - Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) has been widely used in soil reinforcement and other fields. Aiming at the problems of accumulation and resource utilization of tailings sand, which is a special kind of sand, we enriched the urease-producing microorganism Sporosarcina pasteurii (S. pasteurii) from soil and applied it to the field of tailings solidification in this study. Based on single-factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM), the effects of temperature, pH and urea concentration on the growth of S. pasteurii were investigated and the optimum growth conditions of S. pasteurii were determined. CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O and Ca (CH3COO)(2)center dot H2O were used as calcium sources, combined with SEM-EDS, XRD, FTIR and XPS detection, the effect and mechanism of Ca2+ bio-cementation by S. pasteurii was investigated. By comparing the effect of bio-cemented tailings sand by soaking method, stirring method and stratification method, we optimized the method of S. pasteurii bio-cemented tailings. The results indicated that the activity of S. pasteurii mixed bacteria enriched in soil was significantly better than that of single S. pasteurii standard strain. In particular, the S. pasteurii mixed bacteria (1# bacteria) enriched from the soil around the pig manure pile had the strongest activity. The results of RSM showed that the optimum growth conditions of 1# bacteria were: at 31 degrees C culturing temperature, pH = 9.07, which urea concentration was 0.5 mol/L. Compared with temperature and pH value, urea concentration had the most obvious effect on the activity of 1# bacteria. Compared with the soaking method and the stirring method, the layered solidification method using Ca(CH3COO)(2)center dot H2O as the bio-cemented calcium source was more suitable for S. pasteurii mixed bacteria (1# bacteria) enriched from soil bio-cementing tailings.

AB  - This study explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in supporting students preparing for mathematical competitions, focusing on the Mathematical Kangaroo competition in the context of the Serbian-speaking region. The research analyzed tools such as ChatGPT-free, ChatGPT-paid, AI Math Solver, Math Mentor, and o1-preview, assessing their accuracy and efficiency in solving tasks of varying difficulty levels and domains (algebra, geometry, logic, and numbers), as well as different formats (text and image-based). Testing included tasks in both Serbian and English, allowing for the evaluation of language barriers in tool performance. The results indicate that tools perform better with text-based task formats, with o1-preview standing out for its exceptionally high accuracy in this format. All tools achieve the highest precision in numbers and algebra, while results are significantly lower in geometry and logic, highlighting challenges in processing visual information and logical reasoning. The conclusions of this study emphasize the importance of generative AI in improving mathematics education but highlight the need for further development of tools that can better handle visual tasks, support local languages, and be more specialized in solving mathematical problems in general.

AB  - Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and prolonged exposure to PD fluids (PDF) induce peritoneal membrane (PM) fibrosis and hypervascularity, leading to functional PM degeneration. 2-deoxy-glucose (2 -DG) has shown potential as PM antifibrotic by inhibiting hyper-glycolysis induced mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT). We investigated whether administration of 2 -DG with several PDF affects the permeability of mesothelial and endothelial barrier of the PM. The antifibrotic effect of 2 -DG was confirmed by the gel contraction assay with embedded mesothelial (MeT5A) or endothelial (EA.hy926) cells cultured in Dianeal (R) 2.5 % (CPDF), BicaVera (R) 2.3 % (BPDF), Balance (R) 2.3 % (LPDF) with/without 2 -DG addition (0.2 mM), and qPCR for alpha SMA, CDH2 genes. Moreover, 2 -DG effect was tested on the permeability of monolayers of mesothelial and endothelial cells by monitoring the transmembrane resistance (RTM), FITC-dextran (10, 70 kDa) diffusion and mRNA expression levels of CLDN-1 to -5, ZO1, SGLT1, and SGLT2 genes. Contractility of MeT-5A cells in CPDF/2-DG was decreased, accompanied by alpha SMA (0.17 +/- 0.03) and CDH2 (2.92 +/- 0.29) gene expression fold changes. Changes in alpha SMA, CDH2 were found in EA.hy926 cells, though alpha SMA also decreased under LPDF/2-DG incubation (0.42 +/- 0.02). Overall, 2 -DG mitigated the PDFinduced alterations in mesothelial and endothelial barrier function as shown by RTM, dextran transport and expression levels of the CLDN-1 to -5, ZO1, and SGLT2. Thus, supplementation of PDF with 2 -DG not only reduces MMT but also improves functional permeability characteristics of the PM mesothelial and endothelial barrier.

AB  - Dermal exposure to metal(loid)s from contaminated soils has received less attention than oral and inhalation exposure. Still, it can be a relevant pathway for some contaminants. Comparison of synthetic sweats (donor solutions), the influence of sebum, and the characterization of diffusion parameters through a synthetic membrane (acting as skin surrogate) in the permeation of metal(loid)s (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and, Zn) from polluted soils is missing. The dermal bioaccessibility tests were performed using two sweat compositions [EN 1811, pH 6.5 (sweat A) and NIHS 96-10, pH 4.7 (sweat B)]. Diffusion parameters of soluble metal(loid)s using the Franz cell methodology were calculated using the Strat-M membrane. The influence of synthetic sebum in the permeation of metal(loid)s was also investigated. The metal(loid) bioaccessibility percentage was higher for sweat B (pH 4.7) compared to sweat A (pH 6.5), attributed to lower pH of sweat B. Among the six elements tested, only chromium and copper permeated the membrane. Permeation coefficient (K-p) was higher for chromium in sweat A (0.05-0.11 cm h(-1)) than sweat B (0.0007-0.0037 cm h(-1)) likely due to a higher pH and thus more permeable Cr species. The presence of sebum increased lag times for copper permeation. Additional studies regarding speciation of metal(loid)s following extractions in synthetic sweat and comparison of synthetic membrane Strat-M and human skin in the permeation of metal(loid)s are recommended.

AB  - Introduction: The mechanical obstruction and pulmonary vasoconstriction are major determinants of the sudden right ventricular (RV) afterload increases observed during acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APT). Vasodilators and antioxidants agents have been shown to mitigate pulmonary hypertension. We examined whether sodium nitrite and the antioxidant tempol combination could be advantageous in an APT sheep model. Methods: APT was induced in anesthetized sheep by autologous blood clots (250 mg/kg) into the right atrium. Thirty minutes after APT induction, the animals received a continuous infusion of tempol (1.0 mg/kg/min), increasing sodium nitrite infusion (5, 15, and 50 mu mol/kg), or a simultaneous combination of both drugs. Saline was used as a control treatment. Hemodynamic measurements were carried out every 15 min. Also, whole blood nitrite and serum 8-isoprostanes levels were measured. Results: APT induced sustained pulmonary hypertension, increased dp/dtmax, and rate pressure product (RPP). Nitrite or tempol treatments attenuated these increases (P < 0.05). When both drugs were combined, we found a robust reduction in the RV RPP compared with the treatments alone (P < 0.05). The sole nitrite infusion increased blood nitrite concentrations by 35 +/- 6 mu M (P < 0.05), whereas the nitrite and tempol combination produced higher blood nitrite concentrations by approximately 54 +/- 7 mu M. Tempol or nitrite infusions, both alone or combined, blunted the increases in 8-isoprostane concentrations observed after APT. Conclusions: Nitrite and tempol combination protects against APT-induced RV wall stress. The association of both drugs may offer an advantage to treat RV failure during severe APT.

AB  - Dystocia, a prolonged or non-progressive birth event, is the main contributor to lamb mortality in Australia and across the world. Dystocia can cause neonatal hypoxia, central nervous system (CNS) damage leading to increased risk of starvation, exposure and mismothering, and death. These prolonged birth events can also cause fatigue, injury and death in the ewe. Dystocia may interrupt the expression of maternal behaviour and the strength of the ewe-lamb bond, and consequently lamb survival. This study focused on the effect of dystocia on ewe behaviour in the 2 h post-lambing. A total of 18 ewes were chosen for continuous behaviour annotation and analysis (dystocic (n = 9) and eutocic (n = 9)) based on the quality of video recordings, length of stage 2 parturition and classification by a single experienced observer. Dystocic ewes showed significantly lower expression of maternal behaviours and a significantly greater expression of avoidance behaviours compared to eutocic ewes. Additionally, dystocic ewes performed fewer behaviours in total compared to eutocic ewes. Dystocia can significantly affect the quality and quantity of ewe maternal behaviour expression, leading to increased avoidance of the lamb, increased risk of maternal disinterest, and increased risk of death for the lamb. If dystocic events can be identified quickly and accurately, measures can be taken to ensure the ewe and lamb recover successfully. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mature mammalian oocytes arrest meiosis in metaphase II (MII). If the oocyte is not fertilized, it can spontaneously break the MII arrest. Spontaneous activation and postovulatory aging hinder precisely timed and regulated embryonic development. To elucidate the role of Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) in porcine oocyte MII arrest, activation, and aging, we used a specific SFK inhibitor and immunolocalization. The 24h-prolonged oocyte culture in the presence of SFK inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP2) increased (P < 0.05) the proportion of spontaneously activated porcine oocytes compared to controls. Further culture with PP2 inhibitor led to an increase (P < 0.05) in the parthenogenetic embryos and a decrease (P <0.05) in lytic oocytes. SFK inhibition did not affect (P > 0.05) the proportion of ionophore A23187activated oocytes. SFKs were localized in the perichromosomal region, in the pronuclei, in the cytoplasm, and on the plasma membrane of oocytes and parthenogenetic embryos after 24, 48, and 72 h of prolonged in vitro culture. The greatest SFKs fluorescence was detected after a 24h-prolonged culture on the plasma membrane of MII oocytes. In embryos and fragmented oocytes, intense fluorescence was detected in the cleavage furrow region and on the membrane of apoptotic vesicles, respectively. Our results reveal the involvement of SFKs in MII arrest maintenance, though they don't appear to modulate the early processes of ionophore-stimulated parthenogenetic activation. Changes in the distribution of SFKs during prolonged culture suggest their role in signaling cascades associated with actin filament cytoskeleton organization.

AB  - Protection of nursery areas where newborn survival is successful is critical to recovery of endangered mammals. In Kenya, 2014 to 2022, we surveyed Endangered Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) on the Siria Plateau at Oloirien Group Ranch (OGR) and Oloisukut Conservancy (OC), and in the Rift Valley's Mara Triangle Conservancy (MTC). MTC and OC have high lion densities while OGR does not. Using counts and photographic mark-recapture (PMR), we estimated percentages of newborn (<3 months) and juvenile giraffe calves (<1 year) per adult female and per total giraffes sampled. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models were used to estimate annual survival of giraffes at OGR. The mean percentage of newborn calves: adult female at OGR (similar to 18%) was significantly higher than at OC (3.3%) and MTC (0%). The mean juvenile: adult female percentage at the Siria Plateau sites was 62 +/- 12.8% versus 12% in MTC. Total juvenile calves averaged 22% on the plateau, four times higher than MTC (5.3%). At OGR, giraffe survival for all ages and sexes was 0.86, higher than protected areas with lions. Only one female giraffe in 229 used both plateau sites, suggesting independent matrilines. Human-populated savannah next to reserves contributes to giraffe recovery, but nursery areas like OGR need robust protection.

AB  - Neuroinflammation and cognitive decline are the key pathological features in aging that bring detrimental impacts upon quality of life. However, there is no effective anti-aging pharmacological therapy thus far. Dietary supplements in particular essence of chicken (EC) has been found to be an effective remedy for alleviating mental stress and improving memory. In addition, a novel hydrolyzed chicken extract, ProBeptigen/CMI-168 (PB), showed beneficial effects on cognitive ability. However, the antiaging effect and possible mechanism of PB and EC are still unknown. Here, we investigated the antiaging effects of PB and EC on hippocampus-related cognitive decline and neuroinflammation in aged mice. PB and EC were administered for 16 weeks in 10-month-old mice. Both PB and EC treatments ameliorated age-related deterioration of learning and memory, and attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation in the hippocampus. These results were associated with decreased inflammatory cytokine levels and increased neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus. The overall effects of improving aging-induced cognitive decline were more robust in PB-treated mice, while EC was effective in decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, alterations in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota in aged mice were also regulated by both PB and EC, which induced distinguished features in the gut microbiota and their related functions. This study showed that PB exerts neuroprotective effects in aged mice, the mechanism of which might be different from that of EC. Therefore, PB has a potential as dietary supplement for ameliorating cognitive dysfunction and neuroinflammation in elderly individuals.

AB  - Catechin is a biological compound in green tea (Camellia sinesis), which has anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and attenuated effects in different experimental models. Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide, has resulted in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in zebrafish. The goal of this study is to assess whether catechin can alleviate CPF-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the early developmental stage of zebrafish. According to the results, we observed that 200 mu g/L CPF exposure could induce oxidative stress, ROS production and changing the antioxidant-related enzymes and genes in larval zebrafish. Interestingly, catechin had the potential to reduce the oxidative dam -age and cell apoptosis caused by CPF exposure in larval zebrafish at different endpoints. Especially, catechin could promote the contents of GSH and activity of GST in zebrafish larvae injured by CPF, suggesting that catechin could repair oxidative damage at a certain degree by regulating the activities and gene transcription of some key enzymes related to GSH pathway in zebrafish. In addition, at transcriptional levels, a high concen-tration of catechin exposure reduced the expression genes of Mn-SOD, Cat, gst, and GPX induced by CPF in larval zebrafish. These genes mainly reflected the degree of oxidative damage of zebrafish, which was basically consistent with the enzyme activity. Catechin also could reduce the transcription of p53 and bax, which are tightly related to the apoptosis induced by CPF in zebrafish larvae. The expression of genes was consistent with ROS production, which proved that catechin could alleviate the apoptosis induced by CPF. This study discovered that catechin had some antioxidant effects in aquatic animals to reduce the toxicity caused by pesticides and offered the scientific basis for the utilization and development of catechin.

AB  - Background: Stressed animals may perform depression-like behavior insomuch as stressprovoking blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, central immune activation, and autophagic flux changes. This study was undertaken to assess whether adult mice having (executive) vs. lacking (yoke) of behavioral control in otherwise equivalent stress magnitude condition, may display differences in their BBB integrity, ventral hippocampal (VH) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and autophagic flux level and VH-related depression-like behavior. To further understand the causative relation of enhanced autophagic flux and stress-primed depression-like behavior, we assessed the effects of bilateral intra-VH 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagic flux inhibitor, infusion in stressed mice.Methods: Adult mice used had comparable genetic background and housing condition. Executive/yoke pairs of mice received a 10-day (1 h/day) footshock stressor regimen. Throughout the regimen, the ongoing footshock was terminated immediately contingent on the executive mouse', while irrelevant to the respective yoke mouse' voluntary behavior, or lasting for 7 s. Each dyad's cage-mate receiving no such regimen served as no stressor controls.Results: Yoke mice displayed disrupted BBB integrity (escalated Evans blue extravasation and decreased VH ZO-1, claudin-5 expression), increases in VH autophagic flux (increased LC3II/LC3I and decreased p62) and immobility duration in forced swimming test. Most of these indices remained unaltered in executive mice. Administration of 3-MA did not affect immobility duration in control mice, while prevented the increases in immobility duration in yoke mice.Conclusions: (1) stress susceptibility may be determined by their differences in stress-coping results; (2) VH autophagic flux increase plays a permissive role in priming the stressed animals susceptible to exhibit depression-like behavior.

AB  - The Sustainable Value methodology was used to compare and rank eight combinations of waste biomass types and conversion technologies on a common assessment basis to produce energy, energy vectors and advanced biofuels. The studied combinations included agricultural and agro-industrial residues, slurries and effluents, pulp and paper mill sludge, piggery effluents and organic fractions of municipal solid waste, to produce biodiesel by (trans)esterification, biogas by anaerobic digestion, ethanol by fermentation, hydrogen by dark fermentation, electricity and heat by combustion, biogas and synthesis gas by gasification, and bio-oils by pyrolysis or hydrothermal liquefaction. The numerator "Functional Performance" of the Sustainable Value indicator was estimated according to 14 criteria of process technology, material and energy inputs and outputs, and acceptance by the stakeholders. The performance of the technologies was classified based on the values of relative importance (phi) and level of satisfaction (S) attributed to each criterion. The gasification of residues from the olive-oil industry reached the highest "Functional Performance", followed by anaerobic digestion of chestnut processing residues and pig-rearing effluents. The Sustainable Value denominator "Costs" depended mainly on the degree of maturity of the technologies, which penalised pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction and dark fermentation. The final ranking of the Sustainable Value indicator was gasification> combustion> anaerobic digestion> (trans)esterification> pyrolysis and fermentation to ethanol> hydrothermal liquefaction> dark fermentation, respectively for the most adequate waste biomass types under study. Thermochemical conversions were mainly impacted by process and input criteria, while output and social acceptance criteria were more decisive for the biochemical conversions.

AB  - Overexposure to manganese (Mn) is conducive to neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injury. Persistent activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) has a substantial impact on the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders by interfering with intracellular homeostasis. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism through which ISR engages in Mn-related neurotoxicity remains unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a typical NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, which is known to participate in Mn-induced neuronal damage. Therefore, the aim of our study was to clarify how SIRT1 regulates persistent ISR activation in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22 cells) exposed to various concentrations of Mn. We discovered that persistent ISR activation was engaged in Mn-triggered mitochondrial and exogenous apoptotic signaling pathways, which was attributed to the excessive phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) is known to be responsible for down-regulating the phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha. However, Mn promoted GADD34 protein expression and its acetylation level. We further investigated the effect of SIRT1 on the acetylation of GADD34 by overexpressing and silencing SIRT1. We discovered that SIRT1 activation significantly declined the acetylation level of GADD34, thus alleviating persistent ISR activation-mediated neuronal apoptosis in HT-22 cells-treated with Mn. In summary, these results suggested that Mn induced persistent activation of the ISR by inhibition of SIRT1 on deacetylation of GADD34.

AB  - Geomyoid rodents provide a great study system for the analysis of sexual dimorphism. They are polygynic and many inhabit harsh arid environments thought to promote sexual dimorphism. In fact, there has been extensive work published on the sexual size dimorphism of individual populations and species within this rodent clade. However, little work has been undertaken to assess the evolutionary patterns and processes associated with this sexual dimorphism. We use multivariate analyses of cranial measurements in a phylogenetic framework to determine the distribution of size and shape dimorphism among geomyoids and test for Rensch's rule. Our results suggest that sexual dimorphism is more common in geomyids than heteromyids, but it is not in fact universal. There is evidence for variation in sexual dimorphism across populations. Additionally, in many taxa, geographic variation appears to overwhelm existing sexual dimorphism. We find support for the repeated independent evolution of shape and size dimorphism across geomyoid taxa, but we do not find support for an association between size and shape dimorphism. There is no evidence for Rensch's rule in geomyoids, whether at the superfamily or family level. Together, our findings suggest that there is no single explanation for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in geomyoids and that, instead, it is the product of numerous evolutionary events. Future studies incorporating phylogenetic relationships will be necessary to paint a more complete picture of the evolution of sexual dimorphism in geomyoids.

AB  - A major route for the influx of calcium ions into neurons uses the STIM-Orai1 voltage-independent channel. Once cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) elevates, it activates mitochondrial and endoplasmic calcium stores to affect downstream molecular pathways. In the present study, we employed a novel drug, carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler, to explore the role of mitochondria in cultured neuronal morphology. CCCP caused a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i and, quite surprisingly, a massive increase in the density of dendritic filopodia and spines in the affected neurons. This morphological change can be prevented in cultures exposed to a calcium-free medium, Orai1 antagonist 2APB, or cells transfected with a mutant Orai1 plasmid. It is suggested that CCCP activates mitochondria through the influx of calcium to cause rapid growth of dendritic processes.

AB  - Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are a widely distributed group of small oxidoreductases that play an important role in responding to oxidative stress and maintaining redox homeostasis in living organisms. However, there has been no report on the GRX gene family in tea plants (Camellia sinensis). In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of the CsGRX gene family in tea plants and identified a total of 86 CsGRX genes. Based on phylogenetic and conserved active site analyses, these genes were classified into four categories: CC-type, CPYC-type, CGFS-type, and GRL-type. These subtypes showed distinct characteristics in terms of gene structure, conserved motif, chromosome distribution, subcellular localization, cis-regulatory elements, and expression pattern, indicating functional differences among CsGRX family members. Collinearity analysis showed that the CsGRX family may have undergone member expansion using tandem and segmental duplication along with overwhelmingly strict purifying selection. Protein tertiary structure analysis supported the conserved site-specific binding of CsGRX family members to glutathione. Protein interaction network analysis revealed that CsGRX may interact with glutathione reductase (GR), 2-Cys Peroxiredoxin BAS1, TGA3, and others to participate in the oxidative stress response in tea plants. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses also supported the important role of the CsGRX family in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis. Expression analysis based on RNA-seq revealed differential expression patterns of CsGRX genes under drought, cold stress, and in different tissues, which were further confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis, indicating their broad-spectrum functionality. This study provides a new perspective for further exploring the evolution and molecular functions of specific CsGRX genes.

AB  - All development indices are changing due to increased exploitation of nature and growing economies in developing countries. This situation may increase the intensity of conflict between humans and wild species, such as large carnivores. Despite the increasing intensity of human-wildlife conflicts and the existing compensation scheme that compensates for the loss, most losses to human-wildlife conflicts are not reported to authorities. Thus, this study was conducted in the Banke National Park of Nepal to explore possible factors influencing the propensity to report losses. All 197 surveyed participants reported suffering from crop raids by wild animals, and 80 respondents (40.60 %) reported livestock depredation. Results revealed that socio-economic factors, such as age (beta = 1.99, SE = 1.61), gender (beta = -0.56, SE = 0.28), employment (beta = -1.10, SE = 0.68), family size (beta = 1.54, SE = 0.54), and conflict with certain species including Bengal tiger (beta = 0.48, SE 0.24), leopard (beta = 0.92, SE 0.35), elephant (beta = 0.58, SE 0.34), and monkey (beta = 0.56, SE 0.27), were statistically significant at p values <= 0.01, <= 0.05, and <= 0.10, in influencing the likelihood of reporting a loss. Except for gender and employment, all other factors positively influenced the likelihood of reporting a loss. These findings could be considered while formulating/executing policy guidelines for compensation or any policy related to protected areas to improve reporting rates. This study can also initiate future studies in other protected or forested areas globally.

AB  - Studies have reported on the regulation of clonal growth in Chinese sea buckthorn in response to environmental resource availability, but these studies have been limited to external mechanisms. In this report, we controlled irrigation to generate a soil moisture gradient in order to examine the photosynthetic physiological mechanisms regulating clonal growth in this species. The results indicated that as irrigation intensity increased, the soil water content increased vertically and tissue water content first increased and then decreased. Furthermore, Rubisco activase (RCA) and Mg-chelatase H subunit (CHLH) gene expression levels, photosynthetic capacity (net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance), and clonal growth (ramet growth, clonal proliferation, clonal propagation) all showed a quadratic parabolic change (i.e., first increasing and then decreasing). In addition, gene expression levels and tissue water content, photosynthetic capacity and gene expression levels, and clonal growth and photosynthetic capacity were all significantly positively correlated. When irrigation intensity (soil water content) is exceedingly low or high, the tissue water content is also low, RCA and CHLH gene expression levels are low, photosynthetic capacity is weak, clonal growth ability is inhibited, and clonal growth layout tends toward the "guerrilla type." This type manifests as fewer and smaller clonal daughter ramets that are sparsely distributed with reduced clonal organ extension ability and branching intensity. When irrigation intensity (soil water content) is moderate, the tissue water content, gene expression levels, and photosynthetic capacity is high, clonal growth ability is completely uninhibited, and the clonal growth layout tends toward the "aggregated type." This type is associated with numerous large clonal daughter ramets that are densely distributed with high clonal organ extension ability and branching intensity. Therefore, as irrigation intensity continuously changes from inordinately low to moderate to exceedingly high, Chinese sea buckthorn regulates clonal growth by photosynthetic capacity through photosynthetic gene expression. This results in a clonal growth layout continuum of "guerrilla-aggregated guerrilla" that depends on irrigation intensity.

AB  - Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe disorder of unknown etiology with no definite time frame of onset. Recent studies suggest that middle age is a critical period for the relevant pathological processes of AD. Nonetheless, sufficient data have accumulated supporting the hypothesis of "neurodevelopmental origin of neurodegenerative disorders": prerequisites for neurodegeneration may occur during early brain development. Therefore, we investigated the development of the most AD-affected brain structures (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) using an immunohistochemical approach in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats, which are considered a suitable model of the most common-sporadic-type of AD. We noticed an additional peak of neurogenesis, which coincides in time with the peak of apoptosis in the hippocampus of OXYS rats on postnatal day three. Besides, we showed signs of delayed migration of neurons to the prefrontal cortex as well as disturbances in astrocytic and microglial support of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex during the first postnatal week. Altogether, our results point to dysmaturation during early development of the brain-especially insufficient glial support-as a possible "first hit" leading to neurodegenerative processes and AD pathology manifestation later in life.

AB  - Maturation of oocytes and early embryo development are regulated precisely by numerous factors at transcriptional and posttranslational levels through precise mechanisms. N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most common modification in mRNA which regulates RNA metabolism and gene expression. However, the role of RNA m(6)A on porcine oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we found that oocytes treated with cycloleucine (CL), an RNA m(6)A inhibitor, express impaired cumulus expansion, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria, and delayed maturation of oocytes by disrupting spindle organization and chromosome alignment. Also, CL halted the development of embryos at the 4-cell stage and resulted in low-quality blastocysts. Furthermore, CL treatment decreased the RNA m(6)A, H3K4me3, and H3K9me3 levels, but increased the acetylation level of H4K16 during parthenogenetic embryonic development in pigs. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis further revealed that CL treatment dramatically up-regulated the expression of metabolism-related genes (SLC16A1, and MAIG3 etc.) and maternal related genes, including BTG4, WEE2, and BMP15 among others, at the blastocyst stage. Taken together, inhibition of RNA m(6)A by CL impaired meiosis of oocytes and early embryonic development of porcine via RNAm(6)A methylation, histone modifications, and altering the expression of metabolism-related genes in blastocysts.

AB  - Hippocampal neurogenesis persists across the lifespan in many species, including rodents and humans, and is associated with cognitive performance and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric disorders. Neurogenesis is modulated by steroid hormones that change across development and differ between the sexes in rodents and humans. Here, we discuss the effects of stress and glucocorticoid exposure from gestation to adulthood as well as the effects of androgens and estrogens in adulthood on neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Throughout the review we highlight sex differences in the effects of steroid hormones on neurogenesis and how they may relate to hippocampal function and disease. These data highlight the importance of examining age and sex when evaluating the effects of steroid hormones on hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - In recent years, with the active use of Mn-containing high-tensile strength steels as an automotive body material, it has become increasingly difficult to recycle Mn-containing high tensile strength steel scrap as raw material to produce cast iron, due to the fact that Mn is known as an element promoting the chilling tendency of cast iron melt. Therefore, in this study, the effect of Mn on the fatigue limit of flake graphite cast iron was investigated for the purpose of increasing the strength of cast iron and recycling high tensile strength steel. Flake graphite cast irons with different Mn contents (0.5 mass % and 2.0 mass %, the carbon equivalent corresponding to FC200, FC300 and FC400 of JIS specification (G 5501)) were prepared for plane bending fatigue test. For melting, pig iron and electrolytic iron were used as iron sources, Fe-Si, Fe-Mn, and Fe-S were used as component adjusting materials, and Ca-Si was used as an inoculant. The melting temperature was 1803 K, the inoculation temperature was 1753 K, and the mold was poured at 1723 K.Due to the addition of Mn, the Mn/S ratio increases, resulting in the crystallization of A-Type graphite in high-manganese flake graphite cast iron. With the increase of Mn content, the graphite fraction decreases, the lamellar layer becomes denser and homogeneous, the matrix structure is strengthened, and the tensile strength and fatigue limit of high-manganese flake graphite cast iron are improved. Therefore, it was suggested that high-manganese flake graphite cast iron can be used for thin-walled parts as a cast iron with excellent fatigue strength. In addition, in this thin-walled flake graphite cast iron, Mn acts as a matrix structure strengthening element rather than a chilling promoting element.

AB  - The advent of nanotechnology in the field of animal reproduction has led to the development of safer and more efficient therapies. The use of nanotechnology allows us to avoid the detrimental effects of certain traditional antioxidants, such as Vitamin E. Its hydrophobic nature makes mandatory the use of organic solvents, which are toxic to sperm cells. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of vitamin E nanoemulsions (NE) on ram (Ovis aries) spermatozoa. For this purpose, the effect of three NE concentrations (6, 12, and 24 mM) were assessed on sperm of 10 mature rams of the Manchega breed. Sperm samples were collected by artificial vagina, pooled, and diluted in Bovine Gamete Medium. The samples were stored at 37 degrees C and assessed at 0, 4, 8, and 24 h under oxidative stress conditions (100 mu M Fe2+/ascorbate). Motility (CASA), viability (YO-PRO/IP), acrosomal integrity (PNA-FITC/IP), mitochondrial membrane potential (Mitotracker Deep Red 633), lipoperoxidation (C-11 BODIPY 581/591), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA status (SCSA (R)(R)) were assessed. A linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the effects of time, NE, and oxidant (fixed factors) on sperm parameters, and a random effect on the male was also included in the model with Tukey's post hoc test. Protection of ram spermatozoa with NE resulted in a more vigorous motility under oxidative stress conditions with respect Control and Free vitamin E, while preventing the deleterious effects of oxidative stress coming from the production of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. These results ascertain the high relevance of the use of delivery systems for sperm physiology preservation in the context of assisted reproduction techniques.

AB  - Developmental amnesia (DA) is associated with early hippocampal damage and subsequent episodic amnesia emerging in childhood alongside age-appropriate development of semantic knowledge. We employed fMRI to assess whether patients with DA show evidence of ?cortical reinstatement?, a neural correlate of episodic memory, despite their amnesia. At study, 23 participants (5 patients) were presented with words overlaid on a scene or a scrambled image for later recognition. Scene reinstatement was indexed by scene memory effects (greater activity for previously presented words paired with a scene rather than scrambled images) that over -lapped with scene perception effects. Patients with DA demonstrated scene reinstatement effects in the para-hippocampal and retrosplenial cortex that were equivalent to those shown by healthy controls. Behaviourally, however, patients with DA showed markedly impaired scene memory. The data indicate that reinstatement can occur despite hippocampal damage, but that cortical reinstatement is insufficient to support accurate memory performance. Furthermore, scene reinstatement effects were diminished during a retrieval task in which scene information was not relevant for accurate responding, indicating that strategic mnemonic processes operate normally in DA. The data suggest that cortical reinstatement of trial-specific contextual information is decoupled from the experience of recollection in the presence of severe hippocampal atrophy.

AB  - Pine needle blight of Pinus massoniana caused by pathogens of the Pestalotiopsis genus is a destructive disease worldwide, especially in young forests. Chemical fungicides accelerate the formation of resistant strains among plant pathogenic fungi, which makes microbial biocontrol particularly important. In this study, we identified Neopestalotiopsis camelliae-oleiferae as a new pathogen of pine needle blight in P. massoniana via pathogen isolation, inoculation, pathogenicity assays, morphology observations, and multilocus phylogenetic analyses of the ITS, TEF1, and TUB2 regions. PSM-6, an endophytic bacterium, was subsequently isolated from pine needles and was shown to have excellent antagonistic activity against N. camelliae-oleiferae in vitro. Based on the morphology, physiology, and molecular analysis, we identified this strain as P. silvicola. The extracellular secondary metabolites of PSM-6 were further proven to cause the shrinkage and collapse of pathogen hyphae. The decreased disease index and mortality indicated that pretreatment with PSM-6 may effectively protect pine seedlings from pathogen infection. In addition, PSM-6 exhibited broad-spectrum antifungal activity in several phytopathogenic fungi, including Fusarium graminearum, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. These findings establish PSM-6 as a promising biocontrol agent, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical fungicides for managing pine needle blight and other fungal diseases.

AB  - Background: The expression of secretory proteins is involved in each stage of biomass from fetal development to the immune response. As an animal model for the study of human diseases, the study of protein secretion in pigs has strong application prospects.Objective: Although secretory proteins play an important role in cell activities, there are no machine learning-based approaches for the prediction of pig secretory proteins. This study aims to establish a prediction model for identifying the secretory protein in Sus scrofa.Methods Based on the pseudo composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs feature encoding method and support vector machine algorithm, a prediction model was established for the identification of the secretory protein in Sus scrofa.Results: The model produced the AUROC of 0.885 and 0.728 on the training set and independent testing set, respectively. In addition, we discussed features used for the prediction.Conclusion: In this study, we proposed the first classification model to identify secretory proteins in Sus scrofa. By learning the characteristic of secretory proteins, it may become feasible to design and produce secretory proteins with distinctive properties that are currently unavailable.

AB  - Prinsepia utilis, a wild-growing Himalayan shrub, is a good source of phytoceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and antioxidants. The present study is an attempt to investigate the effect of altitude and edaphic factors on phenolics and antioxidant activity in fruit pulp of Prinsepia utilis. The ripened fruits and soil samples were collected for detailed investigation. The fruits (pulp) were extracted in methanol for analyzing total phenolics and antioxidant activity using a spectrophotometric method and phenolic compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Similarly, standard methods for soil analysis were used. Results reveal that altitude negatively correlated with total phenolics and flavonoid contents determined by a spectrophotometric method and with specific phenolic compounds determined by HPLC. For instance, Dwarahat population (PU-1) at lower altitude (1400 m asl) exhibited higher values of total phenolics and flavonoids, while total tannin was higher at Nainital (PU-6) population (2000 m asl). The antioxidant activity measured by 2, 2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was found higher in Narayan Ashram (PU-9) population (2750 m asl), while ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was significantly higher in Badechena (PU-2) population (1600 m asl). Soil nutrients (edaphic factors) showed a good correlation among measured parameters. Neighbor-joining and principal component analysis identified phenolics and antioxidant-rich populations that can be utilized for collection of fruits from these populations.

AB  - To develop a submucosal injection material with sustained submucosal lifting for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), this study designed and prepared a novel composite thermosensitive hydrogel system with high pH chitosan-polyvinylpyrrolidone-beta-glycerophosphate (HpHCS-PVP-GP). HpHCS improved the injectability of the hydrogels and retained the rapid gelation ability at low concentrations. The modification of PVP significantly improved the stability of low-temperature hydrogel precursor solutions and the integrity of hydrogels formed at 37 degrees C through hydrogen bonds between PVP and HpHCS. A mathematical model was established using response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate the synergistic effect of HpHCS, GP, and PVP concentrations on gelation time. This RSM model and submucosal lifting evaluation using in vitro pig esophageal models were used to determine the optimal formula of HpHCS-PVP-GP hydrogels. Although the higher PVP concentration (5 % (w/v)) prolonged gelation time, it improved hydrogel mechanical strength, resulting in better submucosal lifting performance. The experiments of Bama mini pigs showed that the heights of the cushions elevated by the HpHCS-5% PVP-GP hydrogel remained about 80 % 1 h after injection. Repeated injections were avoided, and the hydrogel had no cytotoxicity after electric cutting. Therefore, the HpHCS-PVP-GP thermosensitive hydrogel might be a promising submucosal injection material for ESD.

AB  - H1N1 and H3N2 are the two most common subtypes of swine influenza virus (SIV). They not only endanger the pig industry, but are also a huge risk of zoonotic diseases. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory network of pigs (hosts) against influenza virus infection are still unclear. In this study, porcine alveolar macrophage cell (3D4/21) models infected by swine influenza virus (H1N1 and H3N2) were constructed. The expression profiles of miRNAs, mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs after H1N1 and H3N2 infected 3D4/21 cells were revealed in this study. Then, two ceRNAs (TCONS_00166432-miR10391-MAN2A1 and novel_circ_0004733-miR10391-MAN2A1) that regulated H1N1 and H3N2 infection in 3D4/21 cells were verified by the methods of bioinformatics analysis, gene overexpression, gene interference, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), dual luciferase activity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). In addition, the important candidate molecules (miR-10391, TCONS_00166432, and novel_circ_0004733) were identified by qPCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the regulatory effect and possible molecular mechanism of the target gene MAN2A1 were identified by the methods of gene interference, qPCR, Western blot and ELISA. The results of this study suggested that TCONS_00166432 and novel_circ_0004733 could competitively bind miR-10391 to target the MAN2A1 gene to regulate swine influenza virus infecting 3D4/21 cells. This study reported for the first time the ceRNA networks involved in the regulation of the swine influenza virus infecting 3D4/21 cells, which provided a new insight into the molecular mechanism of 3D4/21 cells against swine influenza virus infection.

AB  - Environmental change may lead to new memories or modify old ones, but the underlying neural mechanisms are largely unclear. We recorded hippocampal place cells simultaneously from CA1 and CA3 in a virtual reality environment. Compared with CA1, place cells in CA3 are more tolerant of individual landmark changes but undergo orthogonal changes to code distinctively different environments. As visual noise (virtual fog) is intro-duced to a visually enriched environment, place cells in CA1 split into two subpopulations: in one, place cells maintain their field locations while changing their firing rates to reflect sensory changes; in the other, place cells exhibit global remapping in response to the contextual change. In contrast, place cells in CA3 exhibit mainly rate remapping under the same conditions. Our results suggest that CA1 may simultaneously repre-sent heterogeneous maps of the same environment when subtle visual noise induces both sensory and contextual changes.

AB  - Understanding how experiences affect females' behaviors and neuronal plasticity is essential for uncovering the mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders. The study explored how neonatal maternal deprivation (MD) and post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE) impacted the CA1 and DG's neuronal plasticity in the dorsal hippocampus, and its relationships with passive avoidance, local corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) levels, and oxytocin receptor (OTR) levels in female BALB/c mice. The results showed that MD damaged passive avoidance induced by foot shock and hotness, and EE restored it partially. In the CA1, MD raised CRF levels and OTR levels. Parallelly, MD increased synaptic connection levels but reduced the branches' numbers of pyramidal neurons. Meanwhile, in the DG, MD increased OTR levels but lowered CRF levels, DNA levels, and spine densities. EE did not change the CA1 and DG's CRF and OTR levels. However, EE added DG's dendrites of granular cells. The additive of MD and EE raised CA1's synaptophysin and DG's postsynaptic density protein-95 and OTR levels, and meanwhile, shaped avoidance behaviors primarily similar to the control. The results suggest that experience-driven avoidance change and hippocampal neuronal plasticity are associated with local CRF and OTR levels in female mice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), which predominantly affects women, involves at its onset a metabolic deregulation associated with a synaptic failure. Here, we performed a behavioral, neurophysiological and neurochemical characterization of 9-month-old female APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice as a model of early AD. These animals showed learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze, increased thigmotaxis and anxiety-like behavior and showed signs of fear generalization. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but not in the CA1 hippocampus or amygdala. This was associated with a decreased density of sirtuin-1 in cerebrocortical synaptosomes and a decreased density of sirtuin-1 and sestrin-2 in total cerebrocortical extracts, without alterations of sirtuin-3 levels or of synaptic markers (syntaxin, synaptophysin, SNAP25, PSD95). However, activation of sirtuin-1 did not affect or recover PFC-LTP deficit in APP/PS1 female mice; instead, inhibition of sirtuin-1 increased PFC-LTP magnitude. It is concluded that mood and memory dysfunction in 9-month-old female APP/PS1 mice is associated with a parallel decrease in synaptic plasticity and in synaptic sirtuin-1 levels in the prefrontal cortex, although sirtiun1 activation failed to restore abnormal cortical plasticity.

AB  - Cuttage is the preferred approach for rapid propagation of many species including tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Leaf serves as a key part of nodal cutting, but there is a lack of systematic research on its role in the cutting process. In this study, 24 tea cultivars were employed to prove the necessity of leaf and light during cuttage. Further leaf physiological parameters found that lower net photosynthesis rate probably promoted rooting. Phytohormone content detection showed that auxin content and composition pattern were related to rooting ability. Leaf transcriptome analyses of cuttings from a representative easy-to-root cultivar (cv. Echa 10) revealed that genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction, metabolite biosynthesis and transportation were differentially expressed during the rooting process. CsTSA1, CsYUC10, CsAUX1s, CsPIN3 and CsPIN5 were selected as the candidate genes, which possibly regulate the rooting of nodal cuttings. These results illustrate the necessity of the leaf in cuttage and provide molecular evidence that leaf is an important place for signal transduction, metabolite synthesis and transport during the rooting process.

AB  - Background Liver metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Emerge evidence suggests that circular RNA (circRNA) is a pivotal player in cancer progression. However, its role in CRC liver metastasis remains largely unknown. Methods Circ-YAP expression was detected by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. The function of circ-YAP was tested by wound healing, transwell and CCK-8 assays. RNA immunoprecipitation, pull-down, luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to investigate the mechanism underlying circ-YAP promoting CRC liver metastasis. CRC liver metastasis animal model was established to assess the effect of circ-YAP in vivo. Results Circ-YAP was notably upregulated in CRC with liver metastasis, which was associated with dismal prognosis. Circ-YAP promoted CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro, and facilitated liver metastasis in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-YAP encoded a novel truncated protein containing 220 amino acids, termed as YAP-220aa, which competitively bound to LATS1, resulting in YAP dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby activating a cohort of metastasis-promoting genes. Importantly, N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification orchestrated efficient initiation of circ-YAP translation, requiring m6A reader YTHDF3 and eIF4G2 translation initiation complex. Intriguingly, circ-YAP was transcriptionally enhanced by YAP/TEAD complex, thus forming a positive regulatory feed-forward loop. Conclusions Our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized oncoprotein encoded by circ-YAP, implying a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC patients with liver metastasis.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Lantana camara (Verbenaceae) is a plant used in Cameroonian traditional medicine to treat dementia, epilepsy, and sleeping disorders. Hence, this study aimed to assess the antiepileptic-like effects of an aqueous extract of L. camara leaves on seizures induced by kainate in mice, and possible mechanisms of action. Methods: Mice were divided into two groups: a normal control group treated with 0.9% saline (10 ml/kg, i.p.), and a kainate group treated with kainate (10 mg/kg, i.p.). All mice that developed status epilepticus were individually observed for spontaneous seizures. Eighteen days after the induction of status epilepticus, mice that exhibited spontaneous seizures were further divided into 6 groups of 7 mice each and treated as follows: a kainate group treated with 0.9% saline (10 ml/kg, p.o.), two positive control groups either treated with sodium valproate (300 mg/kg, p.o.) or with piracetam (200 mg/kg, p.o.), and three test groups received the extract (230, 460, and 917 mg/kg, p.o.). The control group was treated with 0.9% saline (10 ml/kg, p.o.). These treatments lasted 14 days and the animals were observed 6 h per day for behavioral seizures. Subsequently, the animals were evaluated for anxiety disorders and memory impairment. Animals were then sacrificed and the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex was collected for histological and biochemical analyses. Furthermore, the dilacerates of the hippocampi were stored for white blood cell count. Results: The aqueous extract of L. camara (460 mg/kg) remarkably decreased (p < 0.001) the number and duration of seizures compared to sodium valproate. Also, it significantly increased the level of GABA both in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and protected these organs from oxidative stress. Furthermore, the extract (230 mg/kg) induced the highest reduction in the number of white blood cells in the hippocampus. Finally, the extract (917 mg/kg) significantly attenuated neuronal loss in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. All these compared to the negative control. Conclusion: These results suggest that the aqueous extract of L. camara has an antiepileptic-like effect comparable to that of sodium valproate. This, therefore, warrants further investigation into the effect of bioactive molecules present in the extract using in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A distinct family of plant-specific WRKY transcription factors plays a crucial role in modulating responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this investigation, we unveiled a signaling pathway activated in the desert shrub Ammopiptanthus nanus during feeding by the moth Spodoptera exigua. The process involves a Ca2+ flux that facilitates interaction between the protein kinase AnCIPK12 and AnWRKY29. AnWRKY29 directly interacts with the promoters of two key genes encoding AnPDF1 and AnHsfB1, involved in the biosynthesis of plant defensins. Consequently, AnWRKY29 exerts its transcriptional regulatory function, influencing plant defensins biosynthesis. This discovery implies that A. nanus can bolster resistance against herbivorous insects like S. exigua by utilizing this signaling pathway, providing an effective natural defense mechanism that supports its survival and reproductive success.

AB  - Microglial dysfunction has been reported in the valproic acid (VPA)-induced autism spectrum disorder (ASD) rat models. However, how does prenatal VPA exposure affect microglia remains to be elucidated. The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is revealed to be implicated in a range of microglia functions. However, reports on the association between TREM2 and VPA-induced ASD rat models are scarce. Our results showed that prenatal VPA exposure induced autistic-like behaviors, downregulated the levels of TREM2, upregulated microglial activation, dysregulated microglial polarization, and altered synapse in offspring. TREM2 overexpression partly ameliorated microglia dysfunction and autistic-like behaviors in prenatal VPA-exposed rats. Our findings demonstrated that prenatally VPA exposure is likely to cause autistic-like behavior in the rat offspring via TREM2 down-regulation to affect the microglial activation, microglial polarization and synaptic pruning of microglia for the first time.

AB  - The zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses continues to pose a considerable threat to humans. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a bat coronavirus related to HKU2, causes severe economic losses in the pig industry and has the potential to trigger outbreaks in humans. However, our understanding of how SADS-CoV evades the host's innate immunity remains limited, hindering effective responses to potential human outbreaks. In this study, we demonstrate that the SADS-CoV envelope protein (E) inhibits type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling by inducing the degradation of STAT2 via the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway. Mechanistically, the E protein evades host innate immunity by promoting STAT2 degradation through autophagy, mediated by the NBR1 and OPTN receptors. Notably, ubiquitination of E protein is required for the autophagic degradation of STAT2. Additionally, lysine residue K61 of the E protein is crucial for its stable expression; however, it is not involved in its ubiquitination. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which the E protein disrupts IFN-I signaling by targeting STAT2 via autophagy, enhancing our understanding of SADS-CoV's immune evasion strategies and providing potential drug targets for controlling viral infections.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; ATG: autophagy related; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CALCOCO2/NDP52: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CC: coiled-coil; CHX: cycloheximide; Co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DBD: DNA-binding domain; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; E, Envelope.

AB  - Both animals and humans have been studied to explore the impact of acute physical exercise (PE) on memory. In rats, a single session of PE enhances the persistence of novel object recognition (NOR) memory, which depends on dopamine and noradrenaline activity in the hippocampus. However, limited research has examined the involvement of other brain regions in this phenomenon. In this study, we investigated the role of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC) in modulating the persistence of NOR memory induced by acute PE. After NOR training, some animals underwent a 30 min treadmill PE session, followed by infusion of either vehicle (VEH) or muscimol (MUS) in either the VTA or LC. Other animals did not undergo PE and only received VEH, MUS, or NMDA within the same time window. We evaluated memory recall 1, 7, and 14 days later. Acute PE promoted memory persistence for up to 14 days afterward, similar to NMDA glutamatergic stimulation of the VTA or LC. Moreover, only the LC region was required for the memory improvement induced by acute PE since blocking this region with MUS impaired NOR encoding. Our findings suggest that acute PE can improve learning within a closed time window, and this effect depends on LC, but not VTA, activity.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) represents an important public health concern in many developing countries, including Africa. Transmission of HEV to humans by contaminated drinking water is the most important mode of transmission in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to assess the presence of HEV in the environment in Cameroon through molecular analysis of sewage samples. Retrospectively, a total of 157 sewage samples collected between January 2018 and December 2019 were randomly selected and analyzed by molecular techniques to detect and characterize the HEV followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Three samples (1.9%) collected from North, Far North, and Adamawa regions were positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerization chain reaction. Among these, 2 samples were positive for HEV ribonucleic acid by nested reverse transcription polymerization chain reaction and only one yielded a good sequencing product. Phylogenetic analysis of this unique HEV strain showed that this HEV strain belonged to genotype 3, subtype 3a, and clustered with swine HEV strains from Cameroon, Argentina, and the USA. This study provides preliminary data on the circulation of HEV in wastewater in Cameroon. Further studies will be needed to assess the overall situation in Cameroon.

AB  - In recent years sensorineural hearing loss was found to affect not exclusively, nor at first, the sensory cells of the inner ear. The sensory cells' synapses and subsequent neurites are initially damaged. Auditory synaptopathies also play an important role in cochlear implant (CI) care, as they can lead to a loss of physiological hearing in patients with residual hearing. These auditory synaptopathies and in general the cascades of hearing pathologies have been in the focus of research in recent years with the aim to develop more targeted and individually tailored therapeutics. In the current study, a method to examine implanted inner ears of guinea pigs was developed to examine the synapse level. For this purpose, the cochlea is made transparent and scanned with the implant in situ using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Three different preparation methods were compared to enable both an overview image of the cochlea for assessing the CI position and images of the synapses on the same specimen. The best results were achieved by dissection of the bony capsule of the cochlea.

AB  - Although rooster semen cryopreservation is an efficient procedure to spread qualified semen samples for reproductive goals, some post-thawed qualified semen samples resulted in poor fertility rate that could be related to epigenetic modifications during the cryopreservation process. This research was conducted to investigate the effect of reduced glutathione (GSH) in different cryopreservation extenders (Lake and Beltsville) on preservation of epigenetic modifications, fertility potential and other quality parameters of rooster sperm after thawing. Semen samples were collected and diluted in Lake and Beltsville extenders as follows: L-0: Lake without GSH, L-G: Lake with GSH, B-0: Beltsville without GSH, and B-G: Beltsville with GSH. After freeze-thawing process, sperm motility, membrane functionality, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, viability, apoptosis status, lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, ROS concentration, epigenetic modifications and fertility potential were evaluated. In results, the type of extender had no effect (P > 0.05) of post-thawed sperm quality. The treatments containing GSH presented higher (P <= 0.05) total motility, progressive motility, membrane functionality, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, viability, DNA methylation, fertility as well as lower (P <= 0.05) lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and ROS concentration than other treatments. Extender supplementation with GSH had no effect (P > 0.05) on histone methylation, histone acetylation and hatching rate. In conclusion, supplementation of rooster sperm cryopreservation extender with GSH could be an effective strategy to preserve post-thawed sperm DNA methylation, fertility and other quality parameters during reproductive programs.

AB  - Nepeta nuda L. is a medicinal plant enriched with secondary metabolites serving to attract pollinators and deter herbivores. Phenolics and iridoids of N. nuda have been extensively investigated because of their beneficial impacts on human health. This study explores the chemical profiles of in vitro shoots and wild-grown N. nuda plants (flowers and leaves) through metabolomic analysis utilizing gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Initially, we examined the differences in the volatiles' composition in in vitro-cultivated shoots comparing them with flowers and leaves from plants growing in natural environment. The characteristic iridoid 4a-alpha,7-beta,7a-alpha-nepetalactone was highly represented in shoots of in vitro plants and in flowers of plants from nature populations, whereas most of the monoterpenes were abundant in leaves of wild-grown plants. The known in vitro biological activities encompassing antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial potentials alongside the newly assessed anti-inflammatory effects exhibited consistent associations with the total content of phenolics, reducing sugars, and the identified metabolic profiles in polar (organic acids, amino acids, alcohols, sugars, phenolics) and non-polar (fatty acids, alkanes, sterols) fractions. Phytohormonal levels were also quantified to infer the regulatory pathways governing phytochemical production. The overall dataset highlighted compounds with the potential to contribute to N. nuda bioactivity.

AB  - Designing sustainable farming systems in mountainous regions is particularly challenging because of complex economic, social, and environmental factors. Production models prioritizing sustainability and environmental protection require integrated assessment methodologies that can address multiple criteria and incorporate diverse stakeholders' perspectives while ensuring accuracy and applicability. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) are two complementary approaches that support "eco-design" strategies aimed at identifying the most sustainable options, including on-farm transformation processes. This study presents an integrated application of LCA and MAMCA to four supply chains: rye bread, barley beer, cow cheese, and goat cheese. The results show that cereal-based systems have lower environmental impacts than livestock systems do, although beer's required packaging significantly increases its footprint. The rye bread chain emerged as the most sustainable and widely preferred option, except under high-climatic risk scenarios. In contrast, livestock-based systems were generally less favorable because of greater impacts and risks but gained preference when production security became a priority. Both approaches underline the need for a deep understanding of production performance. Future assessments in mountain contexts should integrate logistical aspects and cooperative models to enhance the resilience and sustainability of short food supply chains.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The use and efficacy of Gynostemma [ Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino], a versatile traditional Chinese herb, was first documented in the renowned pharmacopoeia, "Compendium of Materia Medica". Gypenosides (Gps), saponin components are the primary constituents responsible for its biological activities and clinical effects, which include antioxidant, immunoregulatory, antitumor, and neuroprotective properties. Pharmacological studies have shown that Gps has the potential to combat depression. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects remain unclear. Aim of the study: This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of Gps through antioxidative stress, utilizing an integrated approach that includes network pharmacology, molecular simulations, and experimental validation. Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and were orally administered doses of Gps (50 and 100 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg). The regulatory effects of Gps on depression-like behaviors in CUMS rats and their impact on oxidative stress levels in the hippocampus region were evaluated. Network pharmacology was used to investigate the mechanisms by which Gps affects oxidative stress in depression, and was accompanied by molecular docking and dynamics simulations. CUMS rats were treated orally with Gps (100 mg/kg) and injected with EX527 for rescue experiments to validate the role of SIRT1 in antioxidative stress and evaluate the impact of Gps on mitophagy. Results: Gps ameliorated depression-like behaviors induced by CUMS in rats. The improvements observed included an increased sucrose preference, reduced immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim tests, and an increased movement distance in the open-field test. Additionally, Gps effectively reduced reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine '-deoxyguanosine levels in the hippocampus, while increasing the contents of ATP, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione, indicating an increased capacity for anti- oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Furthermore, Gps increased the number of neuronal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region and the level of mitochondrial autophagy, with SIRT1 as a potential key target. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression by exposure to EX527 reversed the beneficial effects of Gps, further validating the critical role of SIRT1 in the regulation of oxidative stress and improving depression-like behavior. Conclusion: Gps improved the antioxidative stress capacity of the hippocampus and promoted mitophagy in CUMS rats through SIRT1, thus protecting hippocampal neurons and improving depression-like behavior.

AB  - The efficiency of establishing pig pluripotent embryonic stem cell clones from blastocysts is still low. The transcription factor Nanog plays an important role in maintaining the pluripotency of mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Adequate activation of Nanog has been reported to increase the efficiency of establishing mouse embryonic stem cells from 3.5 day embryos. In mouse, Nanog starts to be strongly expressed as early as the morula stage, whereas in porcine NANOG starts to be strongly expressed by the late blastocyst stage. Therefore, here we investigated both the effect of expressing NANOG on porcine embryos early from the morula stage and the efficiency of porcine pluripotent embryonic stem cell clone formation. Compared with intact porcine embryos, NANOG overexpression induced a lower blastocyst rate, and did not show any advantages for embryo development and pluripotent embryonic stem cell line formation. These results indicated that, although NANOG is important pluripotent factor, NANOG overexpression is unnecessary for the initial formation of porcine pluripotent embryonic stem cell clones in vitro.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of the replacement of AGPs by a probiotic in diets for piglets in the nursery stage. The dietary treatments were as follows: CON-basal diet (BD); ANT-BD+antibiotic; and PRO-BD+probiotic. From d 35-42 of age, the piglets that received ANT-BD showed a higher average daily weight gain (ADWG) (p = 0.0296), followed by those that received PRO and the control. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) was higher (p = 0.0224) for PRO- and ANT-fed piglets when compared to CON. From d 43-56, the ADWG was the highest (p = 0.0207) in piglets fed ANT. The ADFI was also higher (p = 0.0258) in ANT and PRO. Final body weight (BW) was also influenced (p = 0.0291), whereas ANT-fed animals, followed by PRO, showed a higher BW compared to CON. For overall nursery performance, PRO showed the highest (p = 0.046) ADFI compared to all other treatments. Piglets fed PRO and ANT also showed the highest (p = 0.05) end weights. There was no significant difference in the fecal concentration of Escherichia coli. Concentrations for the sugar absorption test were higher on days 34 and 49 (p < 0.05). The inclusion of B. subtilis DSM 32315 does not replace the use of antibiotics with the same level of results but can provide benefits compared to diets without the use of antibiotics.

AB  - In this study, a new skin preservation method using Clerodendrum viscosum leaf has been explored to find out an efficient alternative to the most popular salted preservation in leather processing. The effectiveness of the preservation systems was evaluated on a regular interval by measuring parameters like organoleptic properties, moisture content, bacterial count, and hydrothermal stability of preserved skins. After preservation, the goatskins were processed into crust leather and compared with different strength properties of corresponding conventionally preserved skins. The cross-sectional fiber structure was found undamaged by assessing scanning electron microscopy images. The salt-free preservation method in this study could reduce the total dissolved solids and chloride in the soaking liquor by 74% and 98% respectively. In contrast, the less-salt preservation method could reduce the total dissolved solids and chloride by 57% and 59%respectively. The overall results of this study revealed that the leaf of Clerodendrum viscosum plant can be used to preserve skin. The strength properties of the produced leathers also fulfilled the requirements of shoe upper leather. The proposed Eco-friendly preservation techniques are found comparable to a great extent with the traditional salt curing approaches. So, these can be used as viable alternative options for skin preservation in the leather processing industries.

AB  - The diversity of vertebrate body plans is dizzying, yet stunning for the many things they have in common. Vertebrates have inhabited virtually every part of the earth from its coldest to warmest climates. They locomote by swimming, flying, walking, slithering, or climbing, or combinations of these behaviors. And they exist in many different sizes, from the smallest of frogs, fish and lizards to giraffes, elephants, and blue whales. Despite these differences, vertebrates follow a remarkably similar blueprint for the establishment of their body plan. Within the relatively small amount of time required to complete gastrulation, the process through which the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm are created, the embryo also generates its body axis and is simultaneously patterned. For the length of this axis, the genes that distinguish the neck from the rib cage or the trunk from the sacrum are the Hox genes. In vertebrates, there was evolutionary pressure to maintain this set of genes in the organism. Over the past decades, much has been learned regarding the regulatory mechanisms that ensure the appropriate expression of these genes along the main body axes. Genetic functions continue to be explored though much has been learned. Much less has been discerned on the identity of co-factors used by Hox proteins for the specificity of transcriptional regulation or what downstream targets and pathways are critical for patterning events, though there are notable exceptions. Current work in the field is demonstrating that Hox genes continue to function in many organs long after directing early patterning events. It is hopeful continued research will shed light on remaining questions regarding mechanisms used by this important and conserved set of transcriptional regulators.

AB  - The larvae of black soldier fly (BSFL) convert organic waste into insect proteins used as feedstuff for livestock and aquaculture. BSFL production performance is considerably reduced during winter season. Herein, the intraspecific diversity of ten commercial BSF colonies collected in China was evaluated. The Bioforte colony was subjected to selective breeding at 12 degrees C and 16 degrees C to develop cold-tolerant BSF with improved production performance. After breeding for nine generations, the weight of larvae, survival rate, and the dry matter conversion rate significantly increased. Subsequently, intestinal microbiota in the cold-tolerant strain showed that bacteria belonging to Morganella, Dysgonomonas, Salmonella, Pseudochrobactrum, and Klebsiella genera were highly represented in the 12 degrees C bred, while those of Acinetobacter, Pseudochrobactrum, Enterococcus, Comamonas, and Leucobacter genera were significantly represented in the 16 degrees C bred group. Metagenomic revealed that several animal probiotics of the Enterococcus and Vagococcus genera were greatly enriched in the gut of larvae bred at 16 degrees C. Moreover, bacterial metabolic pathways including carbohydrate, lipid, amino acids, and cofactors and vitamins, were significantly increased, while organismal systems and human diseases was decreased in the 16 degrees C bred group. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the upregulated differentially expressed genes in the 16 degrees C bred groups mainly participated in Autophagy-animal, AMPK signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway at day 34 under 16 degrees C conditions, suggesting their significant role in the survival of BSFL. Taken together, these results shed lights on the role of intestinal microflora and gene pathways in the adaptation of BSF larvae to cold stress.

AB  - Research conducted over the last several decades implicates ovarian estrogens as important modulators of hippocampal function. More recently however, the importance of estrogens synthesized in the brain de novo for hippocampal function has been recognized. These brain-derived neuroestrogens act in the hippocampus to regulate dendritic spine dynamics and synaptic plasticity as well as hippocampus-dependent memory. The current report provides an overview of research conducted in model systems elucidating the actions of neuroestrogens in the hippocampus and the subsequent consequences for cognition. We highlight the relationship between ovarian estrogens and brain-derived estrogens and discuss implications for female cognitive aging of the putative decline in hippocampal levels of neuroestrogens following loss of ovarian function. Finally, we propose a model of menopause in which a short-term period of midlife estradiol treatment changes the trajectory of hippocampal neuroestrogen production long-term, resulting in sustained interactions of neuroestrogens, insulinlike growth factor-1, and estrogen receptor signaling in the hippocampus, interactions that support successful brain and cognitive aging.

AB  - In an era when population aging is increasing the burden of neurodegenerative conditions, deciphering the mechanisms underlying brain senescence is more important than ever. Here, we present a spatial metabolomics analysis of age-induced neurochemical alterations in the mouse brain using negative ionization mode mass spectrometry imaging. The age-dependent effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine were simultaneously examined. For ultrahigh mass resolution analysis, we utilized a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometer. To complement this, a trapped ion mobility spectrometry time-of-flight analyzer provided high speed and lateral resolution. The chosen approach facilitated the detection and identification of a wide range of metabolites, from amino acids to sphingolipids. We reported significant, age-dependent alterations in brain lipids which were most evident for sulfatides and lysophosphatidic acids. Sulfatide species, which are mainly localized to white matter, either increased or decreased with age, depending on the carbon chain length and hydroxylation stage. Lysophosphatidic acids were found to decrease with age in the detailed cortical and hippocampal subregions. An age-dependent increase in the glutamine/glutamate ratio, an indicator of glia-neuron interconnection and neurotoxicity, was detected after tacrine administration. The presented metabolic mapping approach was able to provide visualizations of the lipid signaling and neurotransmission alterations induced by early aging and can thus be beneficial to further elucidating age-related neurochemical pathways.

AB  - Arsenic exposure is well-established to cause neurotoxicity, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of early-life arsenic exposure on the nervous system of offspring. Female mice were exposed to NaAsO2, and alterations in learning, memory, and hippocampal lesions in offspring were assessed. Transcriptome analysis, protein interaction studies, and cellular experiments were integrated to identify key regulatory factors in arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. Arsenic interacts with HUWE1, significantly downregulating its protein expression. HUWE1 inhibition enhances GPX8 stability by reducing its ubiquitination. GPX8 disrupts histone epigenetic modifications by promoting GSH synthesis and arsenic methylation, leading to elevated H3K9 levels. HUWE1 also interacts with KDM3A, and its inhibition reduces KDM3A-mediated H3K9me1/me2 demethylation, amplifying H3K9me2-mediated transcriptional repression of LARS2 and triggering PANoptosis. This study provides novel molecular insights into arsenic-induced neurotoxicity and highlights potential therapeutic targets to mitigate arsenic-related nervous system damage.

AB  - The object of the present study was to investigate some hematological responses to shearing stress. Thirty Ile De France ewes were selected from an experimental herd according to their hematocrit level and were allocated into 3 groups as follows: low hematocrit (LHct) group (hematocrit range 19.7-27.9%), high hematocrit (HHct) group (hematocrit range 32.0-36.9%) and mean hematocrit (MHct) group (hematocrit range 28.3-29.8%). The traits investigated were lactate and hematological indices. The experiment was conducted at the end of the first month after artificial insemination. Daily minimum and maximum ambient temperatures during the whole experimental period were 13.4 and 24.2 degrees C, respectively. Blood samples were taken by jugular venipuncture before shearing, immediately after shearing, at 3h and 24h after shearing.
   Shearing resulted in an increase in blood values of red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit as well as a decrease in plasma volume in all ewes. Nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) count and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) declined significantly in LHct ewes only. Low hematocrit ewes had higher percent of hematocrit (P > 0.05) and lactate (P > 0.05) increase in response to shearing, compared to HHct ewes. All blood parameters returned to normal values at 3 h after shearing. There was a significant correlation between the rates of NRBC and plasma volume decline (r = -0.66779) in response to shearing. Blood lactate levels increased in HHct and MHct ewes at 48 h after shearing compared to the respective levels at 3 h after shearing.
   The data reported herein suggests that LHct ewes, unlike HHct ewes have higher capacity to cope with acute stress-induced increase in oxygen and energy demand.

AB  - Intramuscular fat development is regulated by a series of complicated processes, with non-coding RNA (ncRNA) such as microRNA (miRNA) having a critical role during intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation in pigs. In the present study, the miRNA expression profiles of intramuscular preadipocytes from the longissimus dorsi muscle of Chinese Guizhou Congjiang Xiang pigs were detected by RNA-seq during various differentiation stages, namely, day 0 (D0), day 4 (D4), and day 8 (D8). A total of 67, 95, and 16 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were detected between D4 and D0, D8 and D0, and D8 and D4, respectively. According to gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes analysis, target genes of DE miRNAs were enriched in categories and pathways related to lipid metabolic process, lipid biosynthetic process, as well as the PI3K-Akt, AMPK, and MAPK signalling pathways. Notably, miR-148a-3p was differentially expressed, with highest expressed abundance in D0, D4, and D8. Overexpression of miR-148a-3p in intramuscular preadipocytes increased cell proliferation and differentiation, and decreased apoptosis, in comparison to the knockdown of miR-148a-3p in intramuscular preadipocytes. Luciferase activity assays, quantitative polymerase-chain reaction, and western blot analysis confirmed that miR-148a-3p regulated adipogenesis by repressing PPARGC1A expression. Accordingly, the effect of miR-148a-3p mimic was attenuated by overexpression of PPARGC1A intramuscular preadipocytes. Furthermore, miR-148a-3p promoted intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation by inhibiting the AMPK/ACC/CPT1C signalling pathway. Taken together, we identified expression profiles of miRNAs in intramuscular preadipocytes and determined that miR-148a-3p acted as a promoter of adipogenesis.

AB  - Background: Muscarinic or 5-HT1A receptors are crucial in learning and memory processes, and their expression is evident in the brain areas involved in cognition. The administration of the activators of these receptors prevents the development of cognitive dysfunctions in animal models of schizophrenia induced by MK-801 (N-methyl-D- aspartate receptor antagonist) administration. GABAergic dysfunction is considered as one of the most important causes of MK-801-induced spatial learning deficits. Methods: Novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were used to study the antiamnestic effect of the biased 5-HT1A receptor agonist (F15599) alone or in combinations with VU0357017 (M1 receptor allosteric agonist), VU0152100 (M4 receptor positive allosteric modulator), and VU0238429 (M5 receptor positive allosteric modulator) on MK-801-induced dysfunctions. The compounds were administered for 5 consecutive days. Animals tested with the MWM underwent 5-day training. Western blotting was used to study the expressions of 5-HT1A receptors and the level of GAD65 in the frontal cortices (FCs) and hippocampi of the animals. Results: F15599 prevented the amnestic effect induced by MK-801 in the MWM at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The co- administration of the compound with muscarinic receptors activators had no synergistic effect. The additive effect of the combinations was evident in the prevention of declarative memory dysfunctions investigated in NOR. The administration of MK-801 impaired 5-HT1A expression in the hippocampi and decreased GAD65 levels in both the FCs and hippocampi. The administration of muscarinic ligands prevented these MK-801-induced deficits only in the hippocampi of MWM-trained animals. No effects of the compounds were observed in untrained mice. Conclusion: Our results indicate that F15599 prevents schizophrenia-related spatial learning deficits in the MWM; however, the activity of the compound is not intensified with muscarinic receptors activators. In contrast, the combined administration of the ligands is effective in the NOR model of declarative memory. The muscarinic receptors activators reversed MK-801-induced 5-HT1A and GAD65 dysfunctions in the hippocampi of MWMtrained mice, but not in untrained mice.

AB  - The ecological relationship among plants, rhizobacteria and plant consumers has attracted the attention of researchers due to its implications in field crops. It is known that, the rhizosphere is occupied not only by rhizobacteria which grant benefits to the plants but also by bacteria which are detrimental for them. In this work, we construct and analyze a plants-rhizobacteria-plant consumers system. In the modeling process, it is assumed that there is a conditioned interaction between plants and bacteria in the rhizosfera such that there is a mutualistic relationship at low densities of rhizobacteria and the relationship is parasitic or competitive at higher densities of them. Benefits granted by rhizobacteria include mechanisms that increase the plant growth and defense mechanisms against plant consumers. From the analysis of the model and its simplified version, we show that scenarios of coexistence of all populations can occur for a wide range of values of the parameters which describe biotic or abiotic factors; however, these scenarios are in risk since scenarios of exclusion of species can occur simultaneously due to the presence of bistability phenomena. The results obtained can be useful for the decision makers to design interventions strategies on field crops when plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria are used.

AB  - As one of the most popular beverages around world, factors influencing transfer of heavy metals from soil to tea leaves is crucial to investigate and assess health risk through tea drinking. Parent material (PM), soil and tea samples from Anhui province, typical tea producing area in China were collected in this study. To find out distribution characteristics of heavy metals in tea and soil, and influencing factors for transfer process, variables of plantation factors, soil properties and geological background were taken into account. The results showed that weathering pedogenic process could be the main release source of heavy metals in soil under the acid environment for tea growth. More than 75% of soil Cd, Hg, Pb and Zn exceeded background. However heavy metals in tea samples were below the limits of China, WHO and EU standards. Soil organic matter and redox process influenced the distribution and transfer of As, Pb, Cd and Hg in soil and tea. While geochemical behaviours of Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were mainly related to soil pH and iron oxides in tea garden. The method of classification and regression trees (CART) showed clones of tea type, bedrock type, soil texture, soil organic and fertilizer application were identified as the main factors influencing transfer factors of heavy metals from soil to tea. The specific types of tea grown in the soil with sandy clay and bedrock of granite/granodiorite and shale should be given more monitoring. The non-carcinogenic hazard quotients (HQ) and cancer risk (Risk) through tea drinking were primarily caused by Pb and Cd respectively. To reduce the potential health risk from tea, application of organic and/or compound fertilizer were thought to be the effective management strategy for tea plantation.

AB  - Animal slurry storage is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia (NH3) emissions. pH is a basic but key factor that could pose great influence on gas emissions, but the simultaneous evaluation of its influence on GHG and NH3 emissions and the understanding of its underlying mechanism are not enough. In this work, pH was adjusted between 5.5 and 10.0 by a step of 0.5 unit by adding lactic acid and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) properly and frequently to the stored slurry during a 43-day storage period. The cumulative NH3 emissions were linearly correlated with the slurry pH, with R2 being 0.982. Maintaining the slurry pH at 5.5-6.0 could reduce NH3 emissions by 69.4%-85.1% compared with the non-treated group (CK). The pH ranges for maximum methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 7.5-8.5 and 6.5-8.5, respectively, and the slurry under pH 7.5-8.5 showed the highest GHG emissions. Acidification to pH 5.5 helped reduce the CH4, N2O, and total GHG emissions by 98.0%, 29.3%, and 81.7%, respectively; while alkalinization to pH 10.0 helped achieve the mitigation effects of 74.1%, 24.9%, and 30.6%, respectively. The Pearson's correlation factor between CH4 and the gene copy of mcrA under different pH values was 0.744 (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the correlation factors between N2O and the gene copies of amoA, narG, and nirS were 0.644 (p < 0.05), 0.719 (p < 0.05), and 0.576 (p = 0.081), respectively. The gene copies of mcrA, amoA, narG, and nirS were maintained at the lowest level under pH 5.5. These results recommended keeping slurry pH lower than 5.5 with lactic acid can help control GHG and NH3 emissions simultaneously and effectively.

AB  - Intrinsic exploratory biases are an innate motivation for exploring certain types of stimuli or environments over others, and they may be associated with cognitive, emotional, and even personality-like traits. However, their neurobiological basis has been scarcely investigated. Considering the involvement of the hippocampus in novelty recognition and in spatial and pattern separation tasks, this work researched the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in intrinsic exploratory bias for a perceptually complex object in mice. Spontaneous object preference tasks revealed that both male and female C57BL/6J mice showed a consistent unconditioned preference for exploring "complex"-irregular-objects over simpler ones. Furthermore, increasing objects' complexity resulted in an augmented time of object exploration. In a different experiment, male mice received either vehicle or the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) for 4 weeks, a pharmacological treatment that reduced AHN as evidenced by immunohistochemistry. After assessment in a behavioral test battery, the TMZ-treated mice did not show any alterations in general exploratory and anxiety-like responses. However, when tested in the spontaneous object preference task, the TMZ-treated mice did not display enhanced exploration of the complex object, as evidenced both by a reduced exploration time-specifically for the complex object-and a lack of preference for the complex object over the simple one. This study supports a novel role of AHN in intrinsic exploratory bias for perceptual complexity. Moreover, the spontaneous complex object preference task as a rodent model of "curiosity" is discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary The conservation of wild and zoo-housed Asian elephants partly depends on developing our understanding of male elephant social behavior. Once thought to be solitary, we now know that male elephants can display rich social exchanges with both males and females. However, these interactions are expected to change with age and around the sexually active state of "musth." We used behavioral data from wild and zoo-housed elephant populations to investigate how age, musth, and environmental factors influence how male elephants socialize and associate with group members. In Sri Lanka, only male elephants of older age (>20 years) exhibited signs of musth, but even some of the youngest zoo-housed elephants underwent musth (as young as 11 years). Additionally, we found that age and musth status predicted whether a wild male elephant associated with females, other males or was alone, as well as the number of conspecifics (males and females) in the same group with which a male was observed. Finally, rates of aggression, prosocial behavior (affiliative behaviors that promote positive social bonds between elephants), and submissive behavior exhibited by wild and zoo-housed male elephants were associated with age, musth status, the number of elephants presented, and group type (all-male or mixed sex). These results provide motivation for future studies of social behavior in male Asian elephants, as they will contribute to the reproduction and conservation of this endangered species. Asian elephants are endangered, and the long-term viability of the species depends on integrative approaches to address the sustainability of in-situ and ex-situ populations. Growing evidence shows that male elephants exhibit extensive and flexible social behavior that rivals the complexity of that of females. Male elephant sociality is expected to change dramatically around the unique sexual state of musth. However, data related to male Asian elephant sociality is lacking. Here, we conducted complementary observations in Wasgamuwa National Park, Sri Lanka, and North American zoos of male Asian elephant social behavior. Age and musth status, along with other factors, were associated with variation in social behavior and group formation of males. In wild male elephants, both musth status and age impacted elephant associations within all-male and mixed-sex groups: non-musth elephants were generally sighted less often in mixed-sex groups as they aged, while the inverse occurred with musth elephants. Musth status interacted with age to predict the number of conspecifics with which a wild male elephant associated: younger males were observed with more females during non-musth (but the opposite was true during musth), and male elephants between 20 and 30 years were observed with the highest number of male conspecifics except during musth. Finally, we found variation in aggression, prosocial behavior, and submissive behavior was influenced by intrinsic (age and musth status) and extrinsic factors (group size and type) in similar ways in both populations; prosocial behavior was most common and was influenced by the number of conspecifics present (both populations), and age, group type, and musth status (zoo population), while aggression was rare, especially among older elephants. We suggest that longitudinal studies of this threatened species will be particularly helpful to promote the reproduction and conservation of Asian elephants in in-situ and ex-situ environments.

AB  - Wildlife food provisioning may benefit tourism as it can increase sightings of cryptic species, bringing economic returns to local communities. However, food-conditioned animals can become dangerous, resulting in the injury and death of wildlife, people or both. These negative impacts counteract potential benefits. Here, we examine the observed and potential impacts of food provisioning on wild Asian elephants by tourists to evaluate whether it can become a regulated activity. We present observations of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Udawalawe National Park (UNP) Sri Lanka, between 2007 and 2024 and the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR) in southern India between 2007 and 2022, documenting negative outcomes of food-provisioning by tourists. We also describe a successful de-habituation effort for one elephant in the NBR. At UNP, 66 male elephants (9%-15% of the estimated male population) were observed seeking food from people at a boundary electric fence. Fourteen were seen at the fence in 11 or more years, and 52 were seen in 8 or fewer years. There were significant positive correlations between the tendency to be seen at the fence and the overall number of sightings per individual across years. Fatalities of at least three elephants and one person occurred near the fence. At NBR, 11 males were food habituated by tourists out of which four died through anthropogenic causes. We describe behavioural changes across years by one male at UNP and one male at NBR. Practical implications. Considering the possible social transmission of problematic behaviours, there is an urgent need to curb them before they spread among wild animal populations. We maintain that food provisioning of wild elephants by tourists cannot be a regulated activity and bans must be strictly enforced. In the long term, working with local stakeholders to educate tourists and habitat restoration are needed to discourage food provisioning by people and food seeking by elephants.

AB  - We aimed to determine the effects of maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) on the DNA methylation and gene expression patterns associated with metabolism and immunopoiesis in the thymuses of fetal Wagyu cattle. Pregnant cows were allocated to two groups: a low-nutrition (LN; 60% nutritional requirement; n = 5) and a high-nutrition (HN; 120% nutritional requirement, n = 6) group, until 8.5 months of gestation. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing were used to analyze DNA methylation and gene expression, while capillary electrophoresis-Fourier transform mass spectrometry assessed the metabolome. WGBS identified 4566 hypomethylated and 4303 hypermethylated genes in the LN group, with the intergenic regions most frequently being methylated. Pathway analysis linked hypoDMGs to Ras signaling, while hyperDMGs were associated with Hippo signaling. RNA sequencing found 94 differentially expressed genes (66 upregulated, 28 downregulated) in the LN group. The upregulated genes were tied to metabolic pathways and oxidative phosphorylation; the downregulated genes were linked to natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Key overlapping genes (GRIA1, CACNA1D, SCL25A4) were involved in cAMP signaling. The metabolomic analysis indicated an altered amino acid metabolism in the MNR fetuses. These findings suggest that MNR affects DNA methylation, gene expression, and the amino acid metabolism, impacting immune system regulation during fetal thymus development in Wagyu cattle.

AB  - Flooding is a serious natural hazard. It causes considerable impact on human life, the environment, and property, worldwide. Building a highly accurate flood susceptibility map can reduce disaster damage; it has become the main approach in flood risk management. The objective of this research is to build flood susceptibility maps for Binh Dinh province in Vietnam, applying modern machine learning and remote sensing methods, namely deep neural networks (DNN) and swarm-based optimization algorithms such as aquila optimizer algorithm (AO), sea lion optimization (SLnO), elephant herding optimization (EHO), the naked mole-rat algorithm (NMRA), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The geospatial distribution analysis approach was used to construct the input data, including 1883 sample points and 12 conditioning factors. Several well-known algorithms were used as reference models to compare the accuracy of each proposed model. The statistical indices root mean square error (RMSE), area under curve (AUC), mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy, and F1 score were used to validate the proposed model. The results show that five optimization algorithms successfully in buiding flood susceptibility maps and these models performed well with an AUC value of more than 0.97. The DNN-NMRA model came first (RMSE = 0.16, AUC = 0.99), followed by DNN-SLnO (RMSE = 0.39, AUC = 0.99), DNN-EHO (RMSE = 0.41, AUC = 0.99), DNN-AO (RMSE = 0.46, AUC = 0.97), and DNN-SGD (RMSE = 0.49, AUC = 0.93) respectively. Furthermore, the results show that the precision of new models (DNN-NMRA, DNN-SlnO, DNN-EHO, DNN-AO) surpassed the standard model DNN-SGD. The results of this study are useful in the construction of appropriate flood management strategies in at-risk regions.

AB  - BackgroundZeugodacus cucuribitae is a major agricultural pest that causes significant damage to varieties of plants. Vision plays a critical role in phototactic behavior of herbivorous insects. However, the effect of opsin on the phototactic behavior in Z. cucuribitae remains unknown. The aim of this research is to explore the key opsin genes that associate with phototaxis behavior of Z. cucurbitae. ResultsFive opsin genes were identified and their expression patterns were analyzed. The relative expression levels of ZcRh1, ZcRh4 and ZcRh6 were highest in 4-day-old larvae, ZcRh2 and ZcRh3 were highest in 3rd-instar larvae and 5-day-old pupae, respectively. Furthermore, five opsin genes had the highest expression levels in compound eyes, followed by the antennae and head, whereas the lower occurred in other tissues. The expression of the long-wavelength-sensitive (LW) opsins first decreased and then increased under green light exposure. In contrast, the expression of ultraviolet-sensitive (UV) opsins first increased and then decreased with the duration of UV exposure. Silencing of LW opsin (dsZcRh1, dsZcRh2, and dsZcRh6) and UV opsin (dsZcRh3 and dsZcRh4) reduced the phototactic efficiency of Z. cucurbitae to green light by 52.27%, 60.72%, and 67.89%, and to UV light by 68.59% and 61.73%, respectively. ConclusionThe results indicate that RNAi inhibited the expression of opsin, thereby inhibiting the phototaxis of Z. cucurbitae. This result provides theoretical support for the physical control of Z. cucurbitae and lays the foundation for further exploration of the mechanism of insect phototaxis. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Bauhinia ungulata is a plant used in Brazilian traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Phytochemical studies revealed flavonoids and the saccharide pinitol related to hypoglycemic activity of the Bauhinia species. To determine the effects of water deficit on ecophysiological parameter and metabolite fingerprints of B. ungulata, specimens were treated with the following water regimens under greenhouse conditions: daily watering (control), watering every 7 days (group 7D), and watering every 15 days (group 15D). Metabolite profiling of the plants subjected to water deficit was determined by LC-HRMS/MS. An NMR-based metabolomics approach applied to analyze the extracts revealed increased levels of known osmoprotective and bioactive compounds, such as D-pinitol, in the water deficit groups. Physiological parameters were determined by gas exchange in planta analysis. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in gas exchange under severe drought stress, while biomass production was not significantly different between the control and group 7D under moderate stress. Altogether, the results revealed that primary and specialized/secondary metabolism is affected by long periods of severe water scarcity downregulating the biosynthesis of bioactive metabolites such as pinitol, and the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol. These results may be useful for guiding agricultural production and standardizing medicinal herb materials of this medicinal plant.

AB  - Phloem loading and transport of sugar from leaves to sink tissues such as fruits are crucial for yield formation. Camellia oleifera is an evergreen horticultural crop with high value; however, its low production limits the development of the C. oleifera industry. In this study, using a combination of ultrastructural observation, fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) and inhibitor treatment, we revealed that C. oleifera leaves mainly adopt a symplastic loading route from mesophyll cells to the surrounding vascular bundle cells in minor veins. HPLC assays showed that sucrose is the main sugar transported and only a small amount of raffinose or stachyose was detected in petioles, supporting a passive symplastic loading route in C. oleifera leaves. Compared to leaves grown this year (LT), the carbohydrate synthesis capacity in leaves grown last year (LL) was decreased while LL retained more soluble sugar, suggesting a decrease in transport capacity with leaf ageing. TEM and tissue staining showed that a reduction in plasmodesmata density leads to a decline in the degree of cellular coupling and is responsible for the weakening transport capacity in older leaves. RNA-seq revealed several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including CoPDCB1-1, CoSUT1 and CoSWEET12, which are likely involved in the regulation of phloem loading and sugar transport. An expression correlation network is constructed between PD-callose binding protein genes, sugar transporter genes and senescence-associated genes. Collectively, this study provides the evidence of the passive symplastic phloem loading pathway in C. oleifera leaves and constructs the correlation between sugar transport and leaf ageing.

AB  - Relative susceptibility of tadpoles of Uperodon taprobanicus (Anura: Microhylidae) and Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Anura: Bufonidae) to predacious Hoplobatrachus tigerinus (Anura: Dicroglossidae) tadpoles: significance of refugia and swimming speed in predator avoidance. The relative susceptibility of two closely associated herbivorous tadpole species (Uperodon taprobanicus and Duttaphrynus melanostictus) to their natural carnivorous predatory tadpole, Hoplobatrachus tigerinus and the significance of refugia in predator avoidance was studied in the laboratory. In a total of 50 trials, 10 tadpoles each of U. taprobanicus and D. melanostictus of comparable sizes were exposed to starved H. tigerinus. Twenty-five trials included refugia while 25 did not. The results of this study showed that in both the presence and absence of refugia, D. melanostictus tadpoles fell prey to H. tigerinus more frequently than U. taprobanicus tadpoles. A key difference between the two prey species is the speed of swimming; Vmax of D. melanostictus (13.58 cm/s) tadpoles is significantly lower than that of U. taprobanicus (24.89 cm/s) tadpoles. This is likely to be the main reason why more D. melanostictus tadpoles were preyed upon than were U. taprobanicus tadpoles. It is important to note that the Vmax of the predator (60.21 cm/s) is much greater than those of the two prey species. However, predation risk of both prey tadpole species was affected significantly by the presence of refugia. The susceptibility of both prey tadpole species was lower where refugia were available. The present study clearly demonstrates that the more efficient avoidance of predation by U. taprobanicus tadpoles could be due to better use of refugia and their faster rate of movement.

AB  - Ceruloplasmin, a multicopper oxidase essential for copper metabolism and oxidative defense, from blood serum of domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) has been purified to homogeneity by using three steps of column chromatography. The purified goat ceruloplasmin (gCP) protein has an estimated molecular weight of approximately 141 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. ICP-AES analysis indicates that each molecule of the protein contains 5.6 +/- 0.2 atoms of copper. The optimum pH of catalysis for gCP was found to be pH 5.5. Using the Hill equation, the Km and Vmax values for gCP are estimated to be 0.41 +/- 0.01 mM and 0.35 +/- 0.01 mu mol/min/mg, respectively. The enzyme has an average of 3.3 +/- 0.33 substrate binding sites per molecule. Both, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies and computational analysis using PDBsum reveals that gCP is primarily composed of beta-strands distinguishing it from the alpha-helix-rich human ceruloplasmin. Also, computational analysis of gCP reveals six copper-binding sites, composed of histidine (his), methionine (Met), and cysteine (cys). Cyclic voltammetry studies of gCP immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode indicate the presence of Type 1 and Type 2/3 copper centers within the protein identified by two unique redox potential values of +294 mV and -250 mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. The positive redox potential site that probably acts as the electron-transfer center had a slightly lower redox potential compared to that reported in other ceruloplasmin. The negative redox potential site of the protein possibly corresponds to the catalytic site containing trinuclear copper center proposed earlier. The redox potential of the Type 1 center aligns closely with azurin, suggesting evolutionary homology and suitability for direct electron transfer (DET). The distinct electrochemical properties of gCP may enhance applications in biofuel cells, biosensors, and other bioelectronic devices due to its efficient electron-transfer capabilities. This study provides valuable insights into the functional versatility of ceruloplasmin across species and highlights the biotechnological potential of this unique variant.

AB  - Wider implementation of AI in sheep in the field condition has not been possible till date due to very poor conception rate after cervical insemination with cryopreserved semen. Poor cervical penetrability in ewe and diminished sperm functions in cryopreserved semen are considered responsible for it. In the present study, effect of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) on post-thaw qualities of ram semen was investigated. Ejaculates from eight adult Malpura rams were pooled and diluted (800 x 106 sperm mL-1) with TES-Tris-fructose-egg yolk extender having either 5 or 6% glycerol and supplemented with 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0% (w/v) CMC and packaged into 0.25 mL French mini straws. The straws were progressively cooled to 5 degrees C inside a cold cabinet (5 degrees C) and then equilibrated for 22 h inside a refrigerator (2-5 degrees C). Straws were frozen at -25 degrees C min-1 up to -125 degrees C using a programmable cell freezer (Planer Biomed R-204, UK) and finally plunged into liquid nitrogen. The post-thaw progressive motility was higher (P < 0.05) in 0.75% CMC-treated group compared to control. Overall, both pre-freeze and post-thaw sperm kinetics was comparable between CMC-treated and control groups. The postthaw sperm viability, acrosomal integrity and sperm with high mitochondrial membrane potential (hMMP) were relatively higher while sperm with high membrane cholesterol was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in presence of 0.25% CMC compared to the control. Both sperm having hMMP and non-capacitated sperm were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in presence of 5% glycerol than 6% glycerol. Similarly, functional membrane integrity (FMI) was higher in presence of 5% glycerol than 6% glycerol when CMC was added at 0.5% to extender. In conclusion, both 0.25% CMC and 5% glycerol resulted in improvement in several post-thaw sperm functions in cryopreserved ram semen. Thus CMC demonstrated cryoprotective effect on ram sperm in a synergistic manner with glycerol.

AB  - Aim of study: To demonstrate if a population of Pyrenean chamois Rupicapra p. pyrenaica can live at low altitudes all year long. This could enlarge dramatically its potential habitat.Area of study: A hunting ground in Sobrarbe County, Pyrenees, Spain, in 2022.Materials and methods: We interviewed local hunters to find out when the presence of the subspecies in the area dates back. We performed block counts from April to December in the target area for calculating the size of the population. Main results: There was a presence of at least 15 years of the subspecies living at 600 m asl. The population was at least 18 animals, reproduces, and shows a normal demographic structure of kids, yearlings, adult females, and adult males.Research highlights: Low-altitude chamois populations living in forests could be a result of important ecological changes in high mountain pastures producing migrations to newly suitable areas as low-altitude forests. The potential habitat of the subspecies should be broadened.

AB  - Skeletal muscle is one of the largest tissues in the body. It is of great significance to analyze the molecular mechanism of skeletal muscle development for the further study of meat quality improvement and muscle diseases. CircRNA has been reported to be involved in many biological processes, but further research is needed in skeletal muscle. In this study, we detected the authenticity, stability, and spatio-temporal expression characteristics of circHOMER1 and its effect on the proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation of muscle cells, and analyzed its possible molecular mechanism. The results showed that circHOMER1 exists in the skeletal muscle of the Ningxiang pig, is more stable than linear RNA, and is significantly upregulated in adipose tissue and during the early growth of myoblasts. In terms of function, overexpression of circHOMER1 significantly promoted the expression levels of proliferation marker genes and proteins and significantly increased the EdU positive cell rate, optical density (OD) value (at 450 nm), and proportion of S-phase cells. Overexpression of circHOMER1 also significantly promoted the expression levels of apoptosis marker genes and proteins and significantly increased the proportions of cells in Q2 (with late apoptosis) and Q3 (with early apoptosis). Overexpression of circHOMER1 significantly inhibited the expression levels of differentiation marker genes and proteins, significantly inhibited the differentiation index, and decreased the proportion of 5-nucleus muscle fibers. Conversely, opposite results were obtained after circHOMER1 interference. In terms of molecules mechanism, subcellular localization analysis showed that circHOMER1 was mainly distributed in cytoplasm, and mechanism analysis showed that circHOMER1 participated in myoblast development by forming a 4-element interaction network with 4 miRNAs, 2 lncRNAs, and 20 mRNAs, and possibly regulated myoblast development by encoding 79 amino acids. To sum up, we verified that circHOMER1 promoted the proliferation and apoptosis of myoblasts and inhibited their differentiation. It may regulate the development of myoblasts through ceRNA or by encoding small peptides. These results provided a reference for the regulation mechanism of muscle development and the breeding of Ningxiang pigs.

AB  - Ceruloplasmin (CP) plays an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis. Cp gene knockout (Cp-/-) mice develop a neurodegenerative disease with aging and show iron accumulation in the brain. However, iron deficiency has also been observed in 3 M Cp-/- mice. The use of systemic Cp gene knockout is insufficient to reveal specific functions for CP in the central nervous system. Considering recent discoveries that astrocytes synthetize the majority of brain CP, we generated astrocyte conditional Cp knockout (Cp(Gfap)cKO) mice, and found that iron contents decreased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of young (6 M) and old (18 M) Cp(Gfap)cKO mice. Further experiments revealed that 6 M Cp(Gfap)cKO mice exhibited impaired learning and memory function, while 18 M Cp(Gfap)cKO mice exhibited improved learning and memory function. Our study demonstrates that astrocytic Cp deletion blocks brain iron influx through the blood-brain-barrier, with concomitantly increased iron levels in brain microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in brain iron deficiency and down-regulation of ferritin levels in neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes. At the young age, the synapse density, synapse-related protein levels, 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine, hippocampal neurogenesis and myelin formation were all decreased in Cp(Gfap)cKO mice. These changes affected learning and memory impairment in young Cp(Gfap)cKO mice. In old Cp(Gfap)cKO mice, iron accumulation with aging was attenuated, and was accompanied by the alleviation of the ROS-MAPK-apoptosis pathway, Tau phosphorylation and beta-amyloid aggregation, thus delaying age-related memory decline. Overall, our results demonstrate that astrocytic Cp deletion has divergent effects on learning and memory function via different regulatory mechanisms induced by decreased iron contents in the brain of mice, which may present strategies for the prevention and treatment of dementia.

AB  - The current contribution investigates the mechanics of helically-braided, load-bearing structures crafted from plant and animal-based natural materials, including goat hair, coconut, palm, manila (abaca) fibers, and palm leaves. The constituent fibers are subjected to chemical analysis through spectroscopy, while geometric and material density attributes are assessed. Their static and cyclic mechanical attributes are analyzed, identifying primal differences among the fiber types for each loading type case. Manila fiber-based structures yield the highest effective static properties, with peak stress values above 70 MPa and energy absorptions up to 30 J/mm3, followed by coconutfiber structures with corresponding values of 33 MPa and 7.3 J/mm3. These values are approximately an order of magnitude higher that those recorded for animal-fiber-based, helicallybraided structures. The associated cyclic loading characteristics differ significantly from the corresponding static properties. Moderate static strength coconut fiber structures exhibit substantially higher hysteresis loss values (above 0.04 J/MPa after several loading cycles) in comparison to the stiffer, manila-based designs. Furthermore, the ratio of the hysteretic loss energy to the total energy differs, with low-strength palm leaf fiber structures to yield a comparable performance with the high static strength, manila-fiber designs. In all cases, the evolution of the hysteretic energy loss magnitude as a function of the loading cycle is characterized, deriving correlations among the structural composition and the recorded cyclic response performance. Moreover, Ashby-type classifications are conducted with respect to a wide range of natural materials, highlighting the distinctive energy absorption capacity of manila and coconut fiber designs, approaching 1000 kJ/kg, values that are several times higher than those recorded for metallic helically-braided structures.

AB  - Animal production requires efficiency, safety and environmental sustainability. Bioactive compounds from tropical plants could modulate ruminal fermentation, providing an alternative method to antibiotic treatment and addressing concerns about antibiotic resistance. In this study, the aim was to determine the effects of Tithonia diversifolia extract (TDE) on performance, intake, digestibility and blood parameters [i.e., glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] in crossbreed sheep. The main biocompounds of the TDE include caffeic acid (CA), quercetin (QCT), luteolin (LT) and apigenin (AP). Experiment 1: An in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) study was conducted to determine the optimal inclusion levels. The IVDM values were 73.09a, 82.03b, 81.01b, 73.20a and 74.51a for the control, 5, 10, 15 and 20 g/kg for the DM treatments, respectively (R-Sq adj = 0.857). The levels of 5 and 10 g were selected for the in vivo experiment. Experiment 2: Twenty-eight male crossbred hair lambs were assigned to four treatments (n = 7): control, 20 mg monensin/day, 5 g TDE/day and 10 g TDE/day groups. No differences in animal performance were observed, including body weight and feed conversion (p > 0.05). The TDE at 10 g/day improved NDF digestibility) (61.32%) and reduced the ruminal acetate to propionate ratio. The total digestible nutrients (TDN) were higher in 10 g TDE treatment with 66.41% and the lowest acetate production (67.82%) (p = 0.042), and propionate production (21.07%) were observed. The TDE were safe at 5 g and 10 g/day for liver function and exhibited lower BUN levels suggesting an improvement in protein metabolism. TDE extract at 10 g/day (TDE10), showed improvements in total tract digestibility of NDF and reduced the ruminal acetate to propionate ratio. However, due to TDE10 reducing the DM intake, the improvements in digestibility and ruminal fermentation were not reflected in growth performance improvements.

AB  - The rapid development of 5G communication technology has increased public concern about the potential adverse effects on human health. Till now, the impacts of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) from 5G communication on the central nervous system and gut-brain axis are still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 3.5 GHz (a frequency commonly used in 5G communication) RFR on neurobehavior, gut microbiota, and gutbrain axis metabolites in mice. The results showed that exposure to 3.5 GHz RFR at 50 W/m2 for 1 h over 35 d induced anxiety-like behaviour in mice, accompanied by NLRP3-dependent neuronal pyroptosis in CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus. In addition, the microbial composition was widely divergent between the sham and RFR groups. 3.5 GHz RFR also caused changes in metabolites of feces, serum, and brain. The differential metabolites were mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis. Further correlation analysis showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with differential metabolites. Based on the above results, we speculate that dysfunctional intestinal flora and metabolites may be involved in RFR-induced anxiety -like behaviour in mice through neuronal pyroptosis in the brain. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of 5G RFR-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is an emerging persistent organic pollutant, and its potential impact on cognitive function remains unclear. We adopted the C57BL/6J mouse model to investigate the effect of PFOS on cognitive function, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Subchronic exposure was performed by administering PFOS via drinking water for 6 months (at doses of 0, 0.2, and 2.0 mg/kg/day), starting from 10.5 months old. The object recognition ability was tested at 2, 4, and 6 months of exposure, and spatial learning and memory were assessed at endpoint. The apoptosis of neurons and astrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus was analyzed, as well as the potential apoptotic signaling pathways. Our results showed that exposure to PFOS for 6 months caused a decrease in object recognition ability and a decline in learning and spatial memory. PFOS selectively increased apoptosis in neurons of the cerebral cortex and specifically activated the endoplasmic reticulum stress PERK/CHOP signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results confirmed that subchronic exposure to PFOS can lead to cognitive impairment in mice, which might be closely associated with the specific activation of an endo-plasmic reticulum stress-induced pro-apoptosis pathway in the cerebral cortex neurons.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance can reduce the neuroinflammation caused by high fat maternal diets; however, there are no reports that have evaluated the effects of prenatal LPS exposure on the memories of the offspring of high-fat diet fed dams. This study evaluated the effects of prenatal LPS exposure on the inflammatory parameters and redox status in the brain, as well as the object recognition memory of adolescent offspring of Wistar rat dams that were treated with a high-fat diet during gestation and lactation. Female pregnant Wistar rats randomly received a standard diet (17.5% fat) or a high-fat diet (45.0% fat) during gestation and lactation. On gestation days 8, 10, and 12, half of the females in each group were intraperitoneally treated with LPS (0.1 mg. kg(-1)). After weaning, the male offspring were placed in cages in standard conditions, and at 6 weeks old, animals underwent the novel object recognition test (for short-and long-term memory). The offspring of the high-fat diet fed dams showed increased hippocampus IL-6 levels (21-days-old) and impaired short-term memories. These effects were avoided in the offspring of high-fat diet fed dams submitted to prenatal LPS exposure, which showed greater hippocampus IL-10 levels (at 21-and 50-days-old), increased antioxidant activity (50-days-old) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, without memory impairments (short-and long-term memory). IL-6 has been consistently implicated in memory deficits and as an endogenous mechanism for limiting plasticity, while IL-10 regulates glial activation and has a strong association with improvements in cognitive function. Prenatal LPS exposure preventing the increase of IL-6 in the hippocampus and the impairment to short-term object recognition memory caused by the high-fat maternal diet.

AB  - Evidence indicates that inhalative anesthetics enhance the beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE) activity, increase amyloid beta 1-42 (A beta(1-42)) aggregation, and modulate dendritic spine dynamics. However, the mechanisms of inhalative anesthetics on hippocampal dendritic spine plasticity and BACE-dependent APP processing remain unclear. In this study, hippocampal slices were incubated with equipotent isoflurane (iso), sevoflurane (sevo), or xenon (Xe) with/without pretreatment of the BACE inhibitor LY2886721 (LY). Thereafter, CA1 dendritic spine density, APP processing-related molecule expressions, nectin-3 levels, and long-term potentiation (LTP) were tested. The nectin-3 downregulation on LTP and dendritic spines were evaluated. Sevo treatment increased hippocampal mouse A beta(1-42) (mA beta(1-42)), abolished CA1-LTP, and decreased spine density and nectin-3 expressions in the CA1 region. Furthermore, CA1-nectin-3 knockdown blocked LTP and reduced spine density. Iso treatment decreased spine density and attenuated LTP. Although Xe blocked LTP, it did not affect spine density, mA beta(1-42), or nectin-3. Finally, antagonizing BACE activity partly restored sevo-induced deficits. Taken together, our study suggests that sevo partly elevates BACE activity and interferes with synaptic remodeling, whereas iso mildly modulates synaptic changes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. On the other hand, Xe does not alternate dendritic spine remodeling.

AB  - Although word predictability is commonly considered an important factor in reading, sophisticated accounts of predictability in theories of reading are lacking. Computational models of reading traditionally use cloze norming as a proxy of word predictability, but what cloze norms precisely capture remains unclear. This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can fill this gap. Contextual predictions are implemented via a novel parallel-graded mechanism, where all predicted words at a given position are pre-activated as a function of contextual certainty, which varies dynamically as text processing unfolds. Through reading simulations with OB1-reader, a cognitive model of word recognition and eye-movement control in reading, we compare the model's fit to eye-movement data when using predictability values derived from a cloze task against those derived from LLMs (GPT-2 and LLaMA). Root Mean Square Error between simulated and human eye movements indicates that LLM predictability provides a better fit than cloze. This is the first study to use LLMs to augment a cognitive model of reading with higher-order language processing while proposing a mechanism on the interplay between word predictability and eye movements.
   Reading comprehension is a crucial skill that is highly predictive of later success in education. One aspect of efficient reading is our ability to predict what is coming next in the text based on the current context. Although we know predictions take place during reading, the mechanism through which contextual facilitation affects oculomotor behaviour in reading is not yet well-understood. Here, we model this mechanism and test different measures of predictability (computational vs. empirical) by simulating eye movements with a cognitive model of reading. Our results suggest that, when implemented with our novel mechanism, a computational measure of predictability provides better fits to eye movements in reading than a traditional empirical measure. With this model, we scrutinize how predictions about upcoming input affects eye movements in reading, and how computational approaches to measuring predictability may support theory testing. Modelling aspects of reading comprehension and testing them against human behaviour contributes to the effort of advancing theory building in reading research. In the longer term, more understanding of reading comprehension may help improve reading pedagogies, diagnoses and treatments.

AB  - The lipid composition of eye lens fiber cell membranes varies among species, and these differences increase as a function of lifespan. However, the way in which the lipids of the fiber cell membranes are organized in different animals has not yet been studied in detail. This study compares how the structure, properties, and organization of lipids change during the lifespan of the mouse, pig, and human. These species were chosen because of the wide range of lifespans and significant differences in lipid composition. Models were made of phospholipid compositions resembling those of the lens fiber cell membranes of a mouse, pig, and human aged of 3, 23, and 70 years, respectively. To separate the effects of phospholipids and cholesterol, membranes were investigated for samples without cholesterol, with a cholesterol content close to the cholesterol saturation limits, and with a cholesterol content close to the cholesterol solubility thresholds. Membrane physical properties were obtained using EPR spin labeling methods. No significant differences in the physical properties of the membranes of any of the models were detected for membranes without and those in the presence of a saturating cholesterol concentration. Thus, not only cholesterol but also the appropriate phospholipid composition is a significant factor in maintaining eye lens homeostasis.

AB  - We grew three yellow Camellia species (the calcifuge C. nitidissima and C. tunghinensis, and the calcicole C. pubipetala) in acidic and calcareous soils for 7 months and assessed their photosynthetic physiological characteristics, growth performance, and element concentrations in this developmental context. The calcifuge C. nitidissima and C. tunghinensis species exhibited poor growth with leaf chlorosis, growth stagnation, and root disintegration in calcareous soils, and with their P n, G s, T r, F v/F m, phi PSII, ETR, qP, leaf Chla, Chlb, and Chl(a + b) concentrations, and root, stem, leaf, and total biomass being significantly lower when grown in calcareous soils relative to in acidic soils. In contrast, the calcicole C. pubipetala grew well in both acidic and calcareous soils, with few differences in the above parameters between these two soil substrates. The absorption and/or transportation of nutrient elements such as N, K, Ca, Mg, and Fe by the two calcifuge Camellia species plants grown in calcareous soils were restrained. Soil type plays a major role in the failure of the two calcifuge Camellia species to establish themselves in calcareous soils, whereas other factors such as competition and human activity are likely more important limiting factors in the reverse case. This study furthers our understanding of the factors influencing the distribution of these rare and endangered yellow Camellia species, allowing for improved management of these species in conservation projects and horticultural production.

AB  - Very large floating structures represent a relatively new frontier in offshore engineering, offering diverse opportunities for ocean utilization and management. These structures, characterized by their sizable dimensions and relatively low bending stiffness, are often constructed modularly and connected flexibly. Consequently, studying very large modular floating structure (MFS) requires considering both multibody hydrodynamics and connector dynamics. This study experimentally investigates the hydrodynamic behavior of MFS in waves, examining configurations ranging from a single module to three modules, with the measurements of their motions and deformations. Various wavelengths are considered, and the wave-induced loads on the hinge connections between floating modules are also recorded. Results show that attaching additional modules to an existing module decreased surge responses, while heave and pitch responses remained relatively unaffected. Examination of wave-induced deformations reveals that maximum deformations occur when the wavelength approximated the module length, consistent with hogging and sagging phenomena. Notably, the middle module experienced the most pronounced deformations due to constraints from both front and rear modules. Furthermore, the analysis of forces exerted on hinge joints reveals strong nonlinear characteristics. Forces at different harmonic components varied with wavelength, with the contribution from higher harmonics posing a risk of fatigue damage to the connectors. Serving as an experimental benchmark, these results contribute to the development and validation of numerical methods and offer guidance for the structural design of hinged connectors in floating bodies.

AB  - An inventory of ladybirds was carried out in cereal fields in Zaghouan over three years to evaluate their seasonal apparition and their efficiency in decreasing aphid populations. Only two species, Coccinella algerica and Hippodamia variegata were identified. The delegation of Mograne was the most populated by ladybirds (64%). As the main result of the correlation analysis, the relationship between ladybirds and temperature was strong, especially during 2018 and 2019. The frequencies of morphs differed among years and seasons, and the number of individuals was more considerable with the aphids' increased populations, especially in the spring (April and May). It coincides with the development of weeds in fields. H. variegata manifested with eighteen different morphs. According to the morphological criteria, the most common morph has 9 spots. Comparing the morphological criteria and genitalia, a sexual inversion was encountered, reaching 16.67% for males and 2.13% for females. It is supposed that the chemicals' use and the temperature were the main factors that induce polymorphism and sexual inversion with H. variegata. The limited use of chemicals enhances the presence of ladybirds in fields in the Mograne region.

AB  - beta-Catenin (CTNNB) is a core downstream mediator in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a role in immune regulation and cell differentiation. In the present study, two CTNNB genes were identified by genomic analysis of Hippocampus erectus and named He-CTNNB1 and He-CTNNB2. He-CTNNB1 was more conserved than He-CTNNB2. The full length of He-CTNNB1 was 2369 bp, including an open reading frame of 2275 bp that encoded 737 amino acids containing 12 armadillo repeats. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that He-CTNNB1 clusters had homologs in other bony fishes. Tissue distribution analysis showed the highest mRNA expression of He-CTNNB1 in the ovary, liver, and kidney of the lined seahorse under normal physiological conditions. The transcription level of He-CTNNB1 was significantly increased in the liver and kidney in response to LPS, poly I:C, and Edwardsiella tarda challenge (p < 0.05). In vitro overexpression of He-CTNNB1 significantly upregulated the expression of key genes of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, such as axin2, cMyc, and cyclinD (p < 0.05), which increased cell proliferation during the wound-healing process. Taken together, our results suggest that He-CTNNB1 is essential for cell proliferation and the innate immune response in H. erectus.

AB  - Deciphering the cellular composition in genome-wide spatially resolved transcriptomic data is a critical task to clarify the spatial context of cells in a tissue. In this study, we developed a method, CellDART, which estimates the spatial distribution of cells defined by single-cell level data using domain adaptation of neural networks and applied it to the spatial mapping of human lung tissue. The neural network that predicts the cell proportion in a pseudospot, a virtual mixture of cells from single-cell data, is translated to decompose the cell types in each spatial barcoded region. First, CellDART was applied to a mouse brain and a human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue to identify cell types with a layer-specific spatial distribution. Overall, the proposed approach showed more stable and higher accuracy with short execution time compared to other computational methods to predict the spatial location of excitatory neurons. CellDART was capable of decomposing cellular proportion in mouse hippocampus Slide-seq data. Furthermore, CellDART elucidated the cell type predominance defined by the human lung cell atlas across the lung tissue compartments and it corresponded to the known prevalent cell types. CellDART is expected to help to elucidate the spatial heterogeneity of cells and their close interactions in various tissues.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including motility disorders, metabolic deficiencies, and changes in gut microbiota following spinal cord injury (SCI), are associated with poor outcomes. After SCI, the autonomic nervous system becomes unbalanced below the level of injury and can lead to severe GI dysfunction. The SmartPill (TM) is a non-invasive capsule that, when ingested, transmits pH, temperature, and pressure readings that can be used to assess effects in GI function post-injury. Our minipig model allows us to assess these post-injury changes to optimize interventions and ultimately improve GI function. The aim of this study was to compare pre-injury to post-injury transit times, pH, and pressures in sections of GI tract by utilizing the SmartPill (TM) in three pigs after SCI at 2 and 6 weeks. Tributyrin was administered to two pigs to assess the influences on their gut microenvironment. We observed prolonged GET (Gastric Emptying Time) and CTT (Colon Transit Time), decreases in contraction frequencies (Con freq) in the antrum of the stomach, colon, and decreases in duodenal pressures post-injury. We noted increases in Sum amp generated at 2 weeks post-injury in the colon, with corresponding decreases in Con freq. We found transient changes in pH in the colon and small intestine at 2 weeks post-injury, with minimal effect on stomach pH post-injury. Prolonged GETs and CTTs can influence the absorptive profile in the gut and contribute to pathology development. This is the first pilot study to administer the SmartPill (TM) in minipigs in the context of SCI. Further investigations will elucidate these trends and characterize post-SCI GI function.

AB  - Trade in elasmobranch products is a circum-global practice negatively impacting elasmobranch populations. Although Asia is at the centre of the shark fin trade, countries like Bangladesh, remain data-poor regarding trade dynamics. In the Bay of Bengal region, Bangladesh has a long-standing history of producing and trading products from vulnerable and protected elasmobranchs both nationally and internationally. A limited understanding of trade currently precludes Bangladesh from enforcing regulations effectively and taking timely conservation actions. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized elasmobranch trade by identifying stakeholders involved in national and international trade, routes used, trade hubs, and ports in Bangladesh. We found that most of the trade remains unreported and violates the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012 and CITES mandates. We identified the south-eastern region as a trade hub with a syndicate of traders annually exporting elasmobranch products predominantly to China via Myanmar. High-quality fins and dried meat drive international trade, including products from Critically Endangered sawfish (Pristidae), guitarfishes (Glaucostegidae, Rhinobatidae), wedgefishes (Rhinidae), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrnidae), and large requiem sharks (Carcharhinidae). Also prevalent is a substantial national demand for elasmobranchs for consumption and traditional medicinal uses. Apart from limited alternatives, a low efficiency of acquiring maximum profits in trading other fishery products, an inequality of profit sharing and limited awareness of laws amongst traders results in their noncompliance towards the Wildlife Act, 2012. Along with amendments to this national Act, it is essential to protect threatened species beyond just legal regimes. Enhanced monitoring and inclusive policies are essential for disincentivizing traders to trade such products.

AB  - Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a major polymer in bacterial cell walls and may constrain gut functionality and lower intestinal efficiencies in livestock. Citral has been reported to exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory biological activities, improving the gastrointestinal function of swine. However, the protective effect of citral against PGN-elicited cellular responses and possible underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, the porcine jejunal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) was challenged with PGN from Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) or Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) to explore PGN-induced inflammatory responses. Our data showed that the inflammatory response stimulated by PGN from harmful bacteria (S. aureus) was more potent than that from commensal bacteria (B. subtilis) in IPEC-J2 cells. Based on the inflammatory model by PGN from S. aureus, it was demonstrated that PGN could significantly induce inflammatory cytokine production and influence nutrient absorption and barrier function in a dose-dependent manner. However, the PGN-mediated immune responses were remarkably suppressed by citral. In addition, citral significantly attenuated the effect of PGN on the intestine nutrient absorption and barrier function. The expression of TLR2 was strongly induced by PGN stimulation, which was suppressed by citral. All data nominated that citral downregulated PGN-induced inflammation via TLR2-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway in IPEC-J2 cells. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the PGN degradation through the inclusion of enzymes (e.g., muramidase) as well as the inclusion of citral for attenuating inflammation may improve pig gut health and functionality.

AB  - Introduction Plants containing aristolochic acid and its derivatives are nephrotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic to humans; chronic diet poisoning caused by the aristolochic acid is the cause of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy and related cancers. Objective To develop a colloidal gold immunochromatographic test strip (ICS) based on the competitive format for the rapid detection of aristolochic acid A (AA-A) in herbal medicinal materials. Materials and methods For the ICS based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the antigen [AA-A-bovine serum albumin (BSA)], and goat anti-mouse IgG were drawn on the nitrocellulose membrane as the test line (T line) and the control line (C line), respectively. Monoclonal antibody (MAb)-AuNP conjugates were sprayed onto the conjugate pad. The sensitivity of the ICS was 6 ng/mL, and the test was completed in 10 min. The analysis of AA-A in traditional Chinese medicine samples showed that the ICS results were in good agreement with those obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Conclusion These results demonstrated that the ICS test could be used as a reliable, rapid, cost-effective, and convenient qualitative tool for on-site screening techniques to detect AA-A in herbal medicinal materials without any special instrumentation.

AB  - Perinatal asphyxia is a peripartum event that can cause permanent sequelae to the newborns, affecting the brain development. Recently, it has been demonstrated that epigenetics mechanisms play an important role in this injury and that folic acid (FA) supplementation during pregnancy can affect these epigenetics modifications as well as gene expression. We have identified both positive and negative effects of FA treatment in rats submitted to a model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Considering that FA supplementation is already used in pregnant women and that HI occurs in the peripartum period, this study was designated to evaluate how gestational FA supplementation and neonatal HI affect: apoptosis (caspase-3) and expression of synaptic proteins (synapsin and PSD-95) and the methylation of histone H3 lysine (K) 4 and 27 in the rat hippocampus. Pregnant Wistar rats were divided according to the diets: standard (SD), supplemented with 2 mg/kg of FA or with 20 mg/kg of FA. HI procedure was performed at the 7th PND. Protein expression and H3 methylation were evaluated at the 60th PND in the rats' hippocampus. Neonatal HI increased caspase-3 expression decreased synapsin expression and reduced H3K4me2, -me3 and H3K27me2, -me3 in the ipsilateral hippocampus. FA only prevented the augment in caspase-3 expression. In conclusion, neonatal HI caused lasting effects on caspase-3-mediated cell death (prevented by the FA) and synaptic proteins in the rats' hippocampus. This is the first study to show that histone modifications may contribute to these pathological findings in the hippocampus of HI animals.

AB  - PurposeThe Hippo pathway in the tumorigenesis and progression of PDAC, with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) regulating the Hippo pathway to facilitate cancer progression. However, the impact of the Hippo signaling pathway on tumor repopulation in PDAC remains unreported.MethodsDirect and indirect co-culture models to investigate gemcitabine-induced apoptotic cells can facilitate the repopulation of residual tumor cells. Mass spectrometry analysis was conducted to assess the impact of gemcitabine treatment on the lipid metabolism of pancreatic cancer cells. ELISA assays confirmed gemcitabine promotes the release of LPA from apoptotic pancreatic cancer cells. The expression of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) elucidated the underlying mechanism by which dying cells induce tumor repopulation using qRT-PCR and Western blot. We studied the biological function of pancreatic cancer cells using CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell invasion assays in vitro. Co-culture models were used to validate the impact of Hippo pathway on tumor repopulation, while flow cytometry was employed to assess the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine in the context of Hippo pathway.ResultsGemcitabine-induced dying cells released LPA in a dose-dependent manner, which promoted the proliferation, clonal formation, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistic studies showed that gemcitabine and LPA facilitated the translocation of YAP1 and induced the inactivation of the Hippo pathway. YAP1 overexpression significantly enhanced the activity of autotaxin, leading to stimulated pancreatic cancer cells to secrete LPA. This mechanism orchestrated a self-sustaining LPA-Hippo feedback loop, which drove the repopulation of residual tumor cells. Simultaneously, it was observed that suppressing LPA and YAP1 expression enhanced the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.ConclusionOur investigation indicated that targeting the LPA-YAP1 signaling pathway could serve as a promising strategy to augment the overall therapeutic efficacy against PDAC.

AB  - This study reports on the influence of lactic acid fermentation on the proteomic and peptidomic profiles of spirulina protein isolate (SPI)-fortified, freeze-dried powders containing living Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) cells during in vitro digestion. For comparison, powders fortified with whey protein isolate (WPI) and pea protein isolate (PPI) were also evaluated. Prior to freeze-drying, the powder precursors were either non-treated or fermented. Capillary SDS-PAGE electropherograms revealed a mild proteolytic effect due to fermentation. C-phycocyanin (SPI) and beta-lactoglobulin (WPI) showed the highest resistance to pepsinolysis. All samples were responsive to pancreases, with fermented WPI showing the lowest responsiveness. Fermentation enhanced the degree of hydrolysis (DH) in gastric chymes, whereas in intestinal chymes, DH followed the order SPI > PPI > WPI, with fermentation showing no significant impact. A total of 6, 11, and 52 potential bioactive peptide sequences, associated with various beneficial activities, were identified in the SPI, PPI, and WPI digesta, respectively. The highest amino acid bioaccessibilities were observed for cysteine and methionine in SPI, isoleucine and arginine in PPI, and glycine in WPI. In conclusion, fortifying probiotic formulations with protein isolates offers secondary health benefits, stemming from the release of bioactive peptides and bioaccessible essential amino acids.

AB  - Osteosarcopenia, characterized by concurrent bone loss and muscle wasting, significantly impacts mobility and quality of life. While age-related primary osteosarcopenia is well-studied, secondary osteosarcopenia (SOS) caused by chronic diseases remains poorly understood, particularly in young individuals. The present study aimed to comprehensively characterize musculoskeletal alterations associated with SOS using a juvenile porcine model of cerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis. Femoral bone analysis included densitometry, mechanical testing, histomorphometry, and serum bone turnover markers. The quadriceps femoris muscle was evaluated through histological analysis and gene expression profiling of antioxidant enzymes and apoptotic regulators. Animals with SOS showed significantly reduced femoral BMD compared to controls, with altered cortical geometry and compromised mechanical properties. Trabecular bone analysis revealed classic osteoporotic changes with decreased bone volume fraction. Negative changes were also observed in the growth plate morphology, indicating impaired endochondral ossification. Bone turnover markers indicated elevated bone resorption and altered formation. Muscle analysis demonstrated sarcopenic changes with selective atrophy of fast-twitch type II fibers and increased fiber density. At the molecular level, SOS muscles exhibited downregulated expression of CAT and CASP3, suggesting muscle atrophy predominantly mediated by oxidative stress and caspase-independent proteolysis rather than classical apoptosis. In conclusion, chronic pancreatitis in young pigs induces coupled bone and muscle degeneration consistent with secondary osteosarcopenia, demonstrating that muscle-bone crosstalk dysfunction occurs early in chronic inflammatory disease.

AB  - Pseudorabies is an acute, highly contagious infectious disease caused by the pseudorabies virus (PRV). Since 2011, several pathogenic mutant strains of PRV have emerged, and the efficacy of existing vaccines has been inadequate in providing full protection, leading to considerable economic losses in the pig industry. Cistanche deserticola polysaccharides (CDP) exhibits a range of biological activities. However, its antiviral effects remain under-explored. In this study, we demonstrated that CDP possesses antiviral activities against PRV/XJ5, notably, at the concentration of 1000 mu g/mL, the inhibitory rate of PRV-infected PK15 B6 cells attained about 90 %. CDP inhibited the adsorption, entry, and replication of PRV/XJ5 in PK15 B6 cells in a dose-dependent manner when introduced at various stages of the viral life cycle. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed to reduce by almost 50 % at the highest recorded concentration. While simultaneously enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, thereby mitigating oxidative stress induced by PRV/XJ5. Additionally, high dose of CDP (200 mg/kg) was found to offer complete protection against PRV in mouse model when the mice were inoculated with lethal doses of PRV via nasal drops. These results suggested that CDP may serve as promising antiviral agent for the prevention and management of PRV variant infections.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Artemisia annua L. belongs to the Asteraceae family and has a long history of clinical application in China. It has been widely used for centuries to treat fever, malaria, jaundice and some skin diseases (such as scabies and sores). Modern pharmacological studies have shown that it has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimalarial and antibacterial effects.
   Aim of study: This study aimed to investigate the anti-eczema effect of A. annua aqueous extract (AAE), profile its potential bioactive components and try to explore its possible underlying mechanisms.
   Materials and methods: The MTT assay was employed to assess the cytotoxicity of AAE. The anti-eczema effect of AAE was evaluated using both an in vitro 3D epidermal inflammation model and an in vivo guinea pig itching model. The bioactive components of AAE were characterized by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with the UNIFI platform.
   Results: In this study, we found that AAE is safe for primary human skin keratinocytes at concentrations ranging from 31.3 mu g/mL to 250 mu g/mL. Further investigations indicate that AAE can increase the itching threshold, inhibit the expression of the inflammatory cytokine TSLP, and promote the expression of FLG mRNA. Additionally, the utilization of UPLC-QTOF/MS and UNIFI platform enabled us to identify 61 potential bioactive components of AAE, with sesquiterpenes and phenolic acids being the most abundant components.
   Conclusions: In this study, the anti-inflammatory and anti-itch effects of the A. annua extract were revealed, along with sesquiterpenes and phenolic acids were identified as potential bioactive components according to literature. The AAE extract holds potential for utilization in the treatment of eczema.

AB  - In this paper, a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction method is proposed to study ship hydroelastic responses. A two-way coupling of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and MBD (Multi-Body Dynamics) solvers is applied to the numerical study of a 20,000 TEU containership. The flow field is solved using the RANS equations in OpenFOAM, while the structural dynamic responses are calculated using a beam model in MBDyn. Another opensource library, preCICE, is utilized for data exchange between the fluid and structural components in the coupling algorithm. The numerical results for the Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) of ship motion and vertical bending moment (VBM) at midship are validated against experimental data under different wavelengths. Additionally, the hydroelastic responses are analyzed. The longitudinal distribution trends of the VBM under different wavelengths show a consistent pattern, with maximum hogging and sagging values occurring around the midship area. The maximum VBM responses are observed under conditions of lambda/L = 0.8 and lambda/L = 0.9, exhibiting significant high-frequency harmonic components. The comparison between numerical predictions of VBM for elastic and rigid ship body structures reveals a significant underestimation of VBM for rigid ships, even in relatively low sea conditions. This finding demonstrates the necessity of considering elasticity in the calculations of hydroelastic responses for ultra-large container ships.

AB  - Simple Summary Observing the health and wellness of livestock is time consuming and costly. Sensor technologies can identify changes in animal activity, providing the potential to remotely monitor livestock health status and welfare. As part of another study, 10 ewes in a pen setting were monitored with near real-time accelerometers manufactured by Herddogg. Ewes were inadvertently fed moldy corn silage. The moldy feed was removed the following day and ewes displaying symptoms, such as reduced intake and difficulty walking, were treated under the direction of a veterinarian. Accelerometers showed a distinct decrease in activity for 4 days after the ewes were exposed to moldy feed. Accelerometers also showed an increase in activity of symptomatic ewes after treatment. Real-time and near real-time accelerometers have the potential to remotely detect changes in sheep activity that occur when animals become ill from mold contaminated feed and perhaps other illnesses, which could help producers monitor livestock health and provide a more timely response when they become ill. Sensor technologies can identify modified animal activity indicating changes in health status. This study investigated sheep behavior before and after illness caused by mold-contaminated feed using tri-axial accelerometers. Ten ewes were fitted with HerdDogg biometric accelerometers. Five ewes were concurrently fitted with Axivity AX3 accelerometers. The flock was exposed to mold-contaminated feed following an unexpected ration change, and observed symptomatic ewes were treated with a veterinarian-directed protocol. Accelerometer data were evaluated 4 days before exposure (d -4 to -1); the day of ration change (d 0); and 4 days post exposure (d 1 to 4). Herddogg activity index correlated to the variability of minimum and standard deviation of motion intensity monitored by the Axivity accelerometer. Herddogg activity index was lower (p < 0.05) during the mornings (0800 to 1100 h) of days 2 to 4 and the evening of day 1 than days -4 to 0. Symptomatic ewes had lower activity levels in the morning and higher levels at night. After accounting for symptoms, activity levels during days 1 to 4 were lower (p < 0.05) than days -4 to 0 the morning after exposure. Results suggest real-time or near-real time accelerometers have potential to detect illness in ewes.

AB  - Intestinal organoids are innovative in vitro tools to study the digestive epithelium. The objective of this study was to generate jejunum and colon organoids from suckling and weaned piglets in order to determine the extent to which organoids retain a location-specific and a developmental stage-specific phenotype. Organoids were studied at three time points by gene expression profiling for comparison with the transcriptomic patterns observed in crypts in vivo. In addition, the gut microbiota and the metabolome were analyzed to characterize the luminal environment of epithelial cells at the origin of organoids. The location-specific expression of 60 genes differentially expressed between jejunum and colon crypts from suckling piglets was partially retained (48%) in the derived organoids at all time point. The regional expression of these genes was independent of luminal signals since the major differences in microbiota and metabolome observed in vivo between the jejunum and the colon were not reproduced in vitro. In contrast, the regional expression of other genes was erased in organoids. Moreover, the developmental stage-specific expression of 30 genes differentially expressed between the jejunum crypts of suckling and weaned piglets was not stably retained in the derived organoids. Differentiation of organoids was necessary to observe the regional expression of certain genes while it was not sufficient to reproduce developmental stage-specific expression patterns. In conclusion, piglet intestinal organoids retained a location-specific phenotype while the characteristics of developmental stage were erased in vitro. Reproducing more closely the luminal environment might help to increase the physiological relevance of intestinal organoids.

AB  - The sustainability of vascular access for hemodialysis is limited by frequent interventions and the inability of synthetic grafts to self-heal. Tissue engineering offers a solution through biodegradable grafts that remodel into autologous tissue. Here we assess electrospun polycarbonate-bis urea (PC-BU) vascular scaffolds (6mm-inner-& Oslash;), reinforced with 3D-printed polycaprolactone coils, in a goat model, and compared them to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) controls. The tissue-engineered grafts were repeatedly cannulated starting two weeks after implantation and were evaluated using computed tomography and histological analyses. By 12 weeks, the PC-BU grafts remodel into autologous tissue while maintaining structural integrity, maintaining integrity without dilations, ruptures, or aneurysms. Cannulation does not interfere with scaffold degradation or neo-tissue formation. Although the patency rate is lower for the PC-BU grafts (50%) compared to ePTFE (100%), the engineered grafts exhibit a self-healing response not seen in ePTFE. These findings demonstrate the potential of PC-BU tissue-engineered grafts as healing, functional vascular access solutions for hemodialysis, supporting cannulation during tissue transformation.

AB  - Simple Summary Early weaning is used to improve efficiency in pig production. However, early weaning may trigger liver oxidative stress in piglets. In this study, we evaluated the effects of early weaning on the development and antioxidant function of the liver in piglets. Our findings show that early weaning significantly decreases piglet body weight and suppresses liver development. We find that early weaning also suppresses the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (p < 0.05). It could be concluded that weaning may reduce the growth performance and liver antioxidant function of piglets. This study examined the impact of early weaning on antioxidant function in piglets. A total of 40 Duroc x Landrace x Large White, 21-day-old piglets (half male and half female) were divided into suckling groups (SG) and weaning groups (WG). Piglets in WG were weaned at the 21st day, while the piglets in SG continued to get breastfed. Eight piglets from each group were randomly selected and slaughtered at 24th-day (SG3, WG3) and 28th-day old (SG7, WG7). The body weight, liver index, hepatocyte morphology, antioxidant enzymes activity, gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, and Nrf2 signaling in the liver of piglets were measured. The results showed that weaning caused decreased body weight (p < 0.01), lower liver weight (p < 0.01), and decreased the liver organ index (p < 0.05) of piglets. The area and size of hepatocytes in the WG group was smaller than that in the SG group (p < 0.05). We also observed that weaning reduced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (p < 0.05) in the liver of piglets. Relative to the SG3 group, the gene expression of GSH-Px in liver of WG3 was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The gene expression of Nrf2 in the SG3 group was higher than that in the WG3 group (p < 0.01). The gene expression of NQO1 in the SG7 group was higher than that in the WG7 group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, weaning resulted in lower weight, slowed liver development, and reduced antioxidant enzymes activity, thereby impairing liver antioxidant function and suppressing piglet growth.

AB  - Atherosclerosis (AS) is considered to be one of the main pathogenic factors of coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction and peripheral vascular disease. Oxidative stress and inflammation run through the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular events. Muscone is a natural extract of deer musk and also the main physiological active substance of musk. This study investigated the impact of muscone on atherosclerosis. ApoE-/- mice were used to establised AS model and injected with low-dose (4 mg/kg/day) or high-dose (8 mg/kg/day) of muscone intraperitoneally for 4 weeks. Then aortic tissues were collected, and pathological sections of the aorta were prepared for oil red staining, HE and masson staining. The changes of MDA, SOD, VCAM-1, NF-kappa B, and TNF-alpha were observed by Western blotting or immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that high-dose muscone could effectively reduce the plaque area/aortic root area and relative atherosclerotic area, reduce the collagen composition in plaque tissue. In addition, we also found that high-dose muscone can effectively increase MDA level, reduce the level of SOD, and inhibit the expression of VCAM-1, NF-kappa B/p65, TNF-alpha in arterial plaques. Our results indicate that the administration of muscone has the benefit of inhibiting atherosclerosis. The potential mechanisms may be associated with antioxidant effect and inhibition of inflammatory reaction in arterial plaques. With the increasing understanding of the relationship between muscone and atherosclerosis, muscone has high potential value as a new drug to treat atherosclerosis.

AB  - The present study aimed to obtain an efficient liquid nitrogen fertilizer from the by-product of anaerobic digestion for its subsequent use in the production of cyanobacteria (Spirulina). A simple recovery technology was tested based on the stripping and acid absorption, modifying temperature (50 and 70 degrees C) and pH (10 and 12), of the ammonia nitrogen contained in the digestate produced in a large-scale plant treating livestock manure and grass silage. The results demonstrated how, at a relatively low temperature (50 degrees C), using sulfuric and citric acid solution, it is possible to recover nitrogen from a digestate in the form of ammonium sulfate and ammonium citrate with yields of 70% and 72.1% respectively. By carrying out Spirulina growth tests, promising results were obtained under semicontinuous production, with a maximum dry biomass daily productivity of 0.344 g L-1 day(-1) with ammonium sulfate and 0.246 gDW L-1 day(-1) with ammonium citrate. The results showed that nitrogen can be efficiently recovered on site by using the organic acid, digestate and waste heat from anaerobic digestion for Spirulina biomass production.

AB  - To understand how brain regions form and work, it is important to explore the spatially variable genes (SVGs) enriched in specific brain regions during development. Spatial transcriptomics techniques provide opportunity to select SVGs in the high-throughput way. However, previous methods neglected the ranking order and combinatorial effect of SVGs, making them difficult to automatically select the high-priority SVGs from spatial transcriptomics data. Here, we proposed a novel computational pipeline, called SVGbit, to rank the individual and combinatorial SVGs for marker selection in various brain regions, which was tested in different kinds of public datasets for both human and mouse brains. We then generated the spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry data from mouse brain at critical embryonic and neonatal stages. The results show that our ranking and clustering scheme captures the key SVGs which coincide with known anatomic regions in the developing mouse brain. More importantly, SVGbit can facilitate the identification of multiple gene combination sets in different brain regions. We identified three dynamical sub-regions which can be segregated by the staining of Sox2 and Calb2 in thalamus, and we also found that Nr4a2 expression gradually segregates the neocortex and hippocampus during the development. In summary, our work not only reveals the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual and combinatorial SVGs in developing mouse brain, but also provides a novel computational pipeline to facilitate the selection of marker genes from spatial transcriptomics data.

AB  - Simple Summary Dietary fat intake is substantially high in Western countries, resulting in overweight, obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among consumers. One way to reduce the incidence of CVD is to change food consumption and food intake with a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet. Meat and meat products are considered to be the main source of dietary fats, especially as a source of saturated fatty acids. The aim of this study was to increase the proportion of PUFAs and, conversely, to decrease the proportion of saturated fatty acids in fat of pork meat. Flaxseed with a concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) at 57% was used in the swine diet. Flaxseed supplementation at two inclusion levels (5% and 10%) in two time intervals (3 and 6 weeks before slaughter) was evaluated. The aim was to increase the proportion of n-3 PUFAs, especially ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and to improve the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in produced pork meat. The storage conditions and oxidation stability of the produced meat under refrigerator temperature (+4 degrees C) were also observed. Flaxseed is a common ingredient used for livestock feed. The aim of this work was to study the effect of a diet supplemented with flaxseed at 5% and 10% concentrations in the intervals of 3 and 6 weeks prior slaughter on fatty acid profile and oxidative stability of pork meat. Meat samples were collected after slaughter from each animal (five groups, n = 6). Samples of the musculus longissimus dorsi (MLD) and the musculus gluteobiceps (MGB) were selected. Chemical composition, fatty acid profile and oxidative stability during the storage of meat under chilling conditions (4 degrees C, 7 days) was analyzed. The addition of flaxseed significantly affected the composition of fatty acid profile and the shelf life of the produced meat. The fat content was changed in the experimental groups with 10% flaxseed supplementation (10.84% in MGB and 9.56% MLD) versus the control group. Despite the different concentrations of flaxseed, the best EPA/AA ratio was observed in the experimental groups fed with flaxseed supplementation for 3 weeks. The worst oxidative stability of meat samples (p < 0.05) was recorded in the experimental groups with the addition of flaxseed for 6 weeks, which was related to higher PUFA content in samples of the experimental groups and higher susceptibility of PUFAs to lipid oxidation. The oxidative stability of meat in the experimental group fed 5% flaxseed supplementation for 3 weeks was not affected.

AB  - The increase of cholesterol synthesis after a status epilepticus may lead to excitotoxic processes, neuronal loss and favor the appearance of spontaneous epileptic seizures. Lowering cholesterol content could be a neuroprotective strategy.Here, we evaluated the protective effect of simvastatin administrated daily for 14 days, after the induc-tion of a status epilepticus by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid in mice. The results were com-pared to those obtained from mice showing a kainic acid-induced status epilepticus, treated daily with a saline solution, and from mice injected with a control phosphate-buffered solution without any status epilepticus. We first assessed the antiseizure effects of simvastatin by performing video-electroencephalographic recordings during the first three hours after kainic acid injection and continu-ously between the fifteenth and the thirty-first days. Mice treated with simvastatin had significantly fewer generalized seizures during the first three hours without a significant effect on generalized seizures after two weeks. There was a trend for fewer hippocampal electrographic seizures after two weeks. Secondly, we evaluated the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin by measuring the fluorescence of neuronal and astrocyte markers on the thirtieth day after status onset. We found that simvastatin reduced CA1 reactive astrocytosis, demonstrated by a significant 37% decrease in GFAP-positive cells, and that simvastatin prevented the neuronal loss in CA1, demonstrated by a significant 42% increase in the NeuN-positive cells, as compared to the findings in mice with kainic acid-induced sta-tus epilepticus treated by a saline solution.Our study confirms the interest of cholesterol-lowering agents, and in particular simvastatin, in status epilepticus and paves the way for a clinical pilot study to prevent neurological sequelae after status epilepticus.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The stems of Ephedra sinica and the fruits of Terminalia chebula are combined using in traditional Mongolian medicine formula "Gurigumu-7" for liver diseases. E. sinica stems contains ephedrine with broncho-dilatory activity. However, ephedrine can pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and excite the central nervous system (CNS) to cause insomnia and restlessness.Aim of the study: The present study was to investigate the structures and bioactivities of new compounds formed in vivo after co-administration of E. sinica stems and T. chebula fruits.Materials and methods: Pharmacokinetic investigation was carried out in rats. A parallel artificial membrane permeability measurement system was used to determine BBB permeability. Ex vivo experiments using tracheal rings of guinea pig was performed to examine the tracheal relaxation effect. In vivo hepatoprotective tests were carried out in Tg (fabp10a: dsRed) liver transgenic zebrafish. The fluorescent probe, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, was used to measure reactive oxygen species, and UHPLC-MS was used to determine glutathione concentrations after derivatization with N-ethylmaleimide.Results: New ephedrine derivatives (1 and 2) formed in vivo and reached their maximum serum concentrations at 0.5 h after administration of the two herbal drugs. Compounds 1 and 2 showed lower BBB permeability than ephedrine, suggesting that they have less adverse effects on the CNS. Compounds 1 and 2 relaxed the tracheal rings and had strong hepatoprotective effect on transgenic zebrafish with liver specific expression of RFP. Compounds 1 and 2 significantly reduced the level of reactive oxygen species while increasing that of glutathione in thioacetamide-treated zebrafish, which might be the hepatoprotective mechanism.Conclusion: These results provided evidences that the chemical constituents in various herbal drugs in a medicinal formula can interact to generate new compounds with fewer side effects and increased or additive bioactivity.

AB  - The present study investigates whether predator scent-stress (PSS) shifts the microglia from a quiescent to a chronically activated state and whether morphological alterations in microglial activation differ between individuals displaying resilient vs. vulnerable phenotypes. In addition, we examined the role that GC receptors play during PSS exposure in the impairment of microglial activation and thus in behavioral response. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to PSS or sham-PSS for 15 min. Behaviors were assessed with the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and acoustic startle response (ASR) paradigms 7 days later. Localized brain expression of Iba-1 was assessed, visualized, and classified based on their morphology and stereological counted. Hydrocortisone and RU486 were administered systemically 10 min post PSS exposure and behavioral responses were measured on day 7 and hippocampal expression of Ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) was subsequently evaluated. Animals whose behavior was extremely disrupted (PTSD-phenotype) selectively displayed excessive expression of Iba-1 with concomitant downregulation in the expression of CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) in hippocampal structures as compared with rats whose behavior was minimally or partially disrupted. Changes in microglial morphology have also been related only to the PTSD-phenotype group. These data indicate that PSS-induced microglia activation in the hippocampus serves as a critical mechanistic link between the HPA-axis and PSS-induced impairment in behavioral responses.

AB  - Turnover of cardiac pacemaker cells may occur during the lifetime of the body, and we recently raised the hypothesis that specialized cardiac cells have in common the potential to generate cardiomyocytes from fibroblasts. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed the ability of atrioventricular node cells (AVNCs) to generate functional cardiomyocytes in long-term culture. AVNCs were isolated from adult guinea pig hearts and cultured for up to three weeks. Under phase-contrast microscopic observation over time, it was found that within a week, a number of fibroblasts gathered around the AVNCs and formed cell clusters, and thereafter the cell clusters started to beat spontaneously. The nascent cell clusters expanded their area gradually by three weeks in culture and expressed specific cardiac genes and proteins. Maturation of newly formed cardiomyocytes seems to be slow in cultures of AVNCs compared with those of sinoatrial node cells. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors with acetylcholine induced a beating rate decrease which was blocked by atropine, and activation of adenylate cyclase activity with forskolin increased the beat rate, while stimulation of beta adrenoceptors by isoproterenol had no effect. These results indicate that AVNCs form a cluster of cells with properties of functional cardiomyocytes and provide evidence to support the hypothesis.

AB  - Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) has shown promising but limited efficacy in the treatment of drug -resistant epilepsy. The clinical utility of RNS is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mech-anism behind its therapeutic effects. Thus, assessing the acute effects of responsive stimulation (AERS) based on intracranial EEG recordings in the temporal lobe epilepsy rat model may provide a better under-standing of the potential therapeutic mechanisms underlying the antiepileptic effect of RNS. Furthermore, clarifying the correlation between AERS and seizure severity may help guide the optimiza-tion of RNS parameter settings. In this study, RNS with high (130 Hz) and low frequencies (5 Hz) was applied to the subiculum (SUB) and CA1.To quantify the changes induced by RNS, we calculated the AERS during synchronization by Granger causality and analyzed the band power ratio in the classic power band after different stimulations were delivered in the interictal and seizure onset periods, respectively. This demonstrates that only targets combined with an appropriate stimulation frequency could be efficient for seizure control. High -frequency stimulation of CA1 significantly shortened the ongoing seizure duration, which may be cau-sally related to increased synchronization after stimulation. Both high-frequency stimulation of the CA1 and low-frequency stimulation delivered to the SUB reduced seizure frequency, and the reduced sei-zure risk may correlate with the change in power ratio near the theta band. It indicated that different stimulations may control seizures in diverse manners, perhaps with disparate mechanisms. More focus should be placed on understanding the correlation between seizure severity and synchronization and rhythm around theta bands to simplify the process of parameter optimization.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: The role of inhaled nitric oxide in the treatment of shock remains controversial and further translational research is needed. Long-term observation studies using a model of endotoxin-induced shock to assess the effect of inhaled nitric oxide on platelet aggregation have not yet been reported.
   Approach and results: The tests were carried out in an animal model of shock in two 10-h periods. During the first 10 h, endotoxin was infused and the inhibition of platelet aggregation was evaluated; following the termination of endotoxin infusion, the restoration of platelet aggregation was assessed for 10 h. A total of 30 pigs were used (NO group, N = 14; control, N = 16). In the NO group, nitric oxide inhalation (30 ppm) was started 3 h after endotoxin infusion and continued until the end of the study. Treatment with NO selectively decreased pulmonary artery pressure at 4 (p = 0.002) and 8 h (p = 0.05) of the experiment as compared to the control. Endotoxin significantly reduced platelet aggregation, as indicated by the decreased activity of platelet receptors: ASPI, ADP, collagen, and TRAP during the experiment (p < 0.001). Endotoxin had no significant effect on changes in the response of the receptor after ristocetin stimulation. After stopping endotoxin infusion, a significant restoration of receptor activity was observed for collagen and TRAP, while ASPI and ADP remained partially depressed. Inhaled nitric oxide did not cause additional inhibition of platelet aggregation, either during or after endotoxin challenge.
   Conclusions: A profound reduction in platelet aggregation was observed during endotoxic shock. After stopping endotoxin infusion a restoration of platelet receptor activity was seen. The inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by endotoxin infusion was not intensified by nitric oxide, indicating there was no harmful effect of inhaled nitric oxide on platelet aggregation.

AB  - To better understand the size differentiation mechanism of adult male prawn Macrobrachium nipponense, transcriptome sequencing was performed from the second pereiopod, hepatopancreas, and muscle of adult male prawn M. nipponense with significant differences in size (large: 1.47 +/- 0.12 g; small: 0.28 +/- 0.04 g). A total of 46,557 unigenes with an average length of 1,312 bp were obtained. Based on pereiopod of large male (LP) versus pereiopod of small male (SP), muscle of large male (LM) versus muscle of small male (SM), and hepatopancreas of large male (LH) versus hepatopancreas of small male (SH), a total of 805, 473, and 1,037 significantly upregulated DEGs were identified, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis indicated that pathways such as the PI3K-Akt pathway, the cAMP pathway, the Hippo pathway, and the Ras signaling pathway were enriched in all three comparisons, which may be key size regulators in adult male prawn M. nipponense. Furthermore, as potential candidates for size differentiation in adult male prawns, twenty-eight DEGs involved in these four pathways were screened out, and their expressions were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results of this study preliminarily elucidate the molecular mechanism of male M. nipponense in size differentiation and provide a theoretical reference for improving the commercial size of cultured male prawn M. nipponense.

AB  - Simple Summary Piglet welfare on commercial farms is negatively affected by the routine husbandry procedure of surgical castration. Objective identification of pain is necessary to improve on-farm piglet welfare and for the development of proper pain management. The Piglet Grimace Scale (PGS) is a method of pain assessment using an ordinal scale that quantifies changes in facial expression induced by acute pain. This study evaluated the application of 3D landmark geometric morphometrics in refining existing PGS methods. To determine if these methods could objectively identify alterations in pig facial shape through landmark analysis, piglet images were taken using a multi-camera rig. Images were then used to construct 3D facial models using photogrammetry (structure from motion). Neither established nor refined PGS methods were able to detect pain-induced facial expressions. Further research is warranted to refine the PGS. Proper methods of assessment to objectively identify pain are essential for welfare improvements of piglets undergoing surgical castration on commercial farms. The Piglet Grimace Scale (PGS) is used to identify changes in facial expressions caused by acute pain in piglets undergoing tail docking and castration. However, subjective scoring methods are a concern for the validation of the PGS. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and refine the PGS through 3D landmark geometric morphometrics. Male piglets (n = 88) were randomly allocated to one of two treatments: castration and sham-castration. Piglet facial images were taken at four time points (before treatment, immediately post-treatment, 1 h post-treatment, and 4 h post-treatment) using a photogrammetry rig. Images were scored by four raters using five facial action units (FAUs): orbital tightening, ear position, temporal tension, lip contraction, and nose bulge/cheek tension. Three-dimensional facial models were generated and landmarked denoting 3 FAUs (orbital tightening, lip contraction, and nose bulge/cheek tension). Results suggest that orbital tightening and ear position may be reliable FAUs for the PGS. However, neither the PGS nor 3D landmark-based geometric morphometrics were able (both p > 0.10) to reliably identify facial indicators of pain in piglets undergoing castration.

AB  - Strategies aimed at enhancing the capacity of neural stem cells (NSCs) to generate multipotential, proliferative, and migratory cell populations capable of efficient neuronal differentiation are crucial for structural repair following neurodegenerative damage. The role of Forkhead-box gene 1 (FOXG1) in pattern formation, cell proliferation, and specification has been established. However, its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the association between Foxg1 gene variants and AD-like behavioral deficits, amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregate formation, as well as p21 expression. Furthermore, we explored whether targeting the FOXG1-regulated cell cycle contributes to the promotion of adult neurogenesis in the context of AD. In this study, we successfully induced overexpression of FOXG1 in the hippocampus of AD brains through adeno-associated virus-Foxg1 infusion. Activation of FOXG1 rescued spatial learning disabilities, short-term memory deficits, and sensorimotor gating impairments observed in AD transgenic animals. By inhibiting p21 WAF1/cyclin-dependent kinase interacting protein 1 (p21cip1/waf1)-mediated cell cycle arrest, FOXG1 facilitates the activation and proliferation of NSCs. Additionally, the Foxg1 gene promotes an increase in precursor population size and enhances neuroblast differentiation. These combined effects on proliferation and differentiation lead to the generation of postmitotic neurons within the hippocampus in AD animals. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of cooperation between FOXG1 and p21 for maintaining NSC self-renewal while facilitating neuronal lineage progression and contributing to endogenous neurogenesis during AD. Elevating levels of FOXG1 either pharmacologically or through alternative means could potentially serve as a therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

AB  - According to the efficient coding hypothesis, sensory neurons are adapted to provide maximal information about the environment, given some biophysical constraints. In early visual areas, stimulus-induced modulations of neural activity (or tunings) are predominantly single-peaked. However, periodic tuning, as exhibited by grid cells, has been linked to a significant increase in decoding performance. Does this imply that the tuning curves in early visual areas are sub-optimal? We argue that the time scale at which neurons encode information is imperative to understand the advantages of single-peaked and periodic tuning curves, respectively. Here, we show that the possibility of catastrophic (large) errors creates a trade-off between decoding time and decoding ability. We investigate how decoding time and stimulus dimensionality affect the optimal shape of tuning curves for removing catastrophic errors. In particular, we focus on the spatial periods of the tuning curves for a class of circular tuning curves. We show an overall trend for minimal decoding time to increase with increasing Fisher information, implying a trade-off between accuracy and speed. This trade-off is reinforced whenever the stimulus dimensionality is high, or there is ongoing activity. Thus, given constraints on processing speed, we present normative arguments for the existence of the single-peaked tuning organization observed in early visual areas.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe psychiatric disorder with uncertain causes. Recent studies have indicated correlations between circular RNAs (circRNAs) and psychiatric disorders. However, the potential role of circRNAs in MDD remains largely unknown. Methods: We investigated the expression and diagnostic significance of circRNA protein tyrosine kinase 2 (circPTK2) by recruiting 50 MDD patients and 40 healthy subjects. Additionally, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model was established in animal experiments. QRT-PCR was adopted for circPTK2 and miR-182-5p levels. To investigate the role of circPTK2 in MDD, we utilized microinjection of circPTK2 adenoassociated virus into the mouse hippocampus. Depressive-like behaviors of mice were assessed through forced swim test and open field test. Additionally, the interaction between circPTK2 and miR-182-5p was validated using a dual luciferase reporter assay. Results: Decreased expression of circPTK2 was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MDD patients and in hippocampus of CUMS mice, which was useful for distinguishing MDD patients from healthy subjects. Notably, overexpression of circPTK2 was associated with depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS. Further mechanism research demonstrated that circPTK2 functioned as the sponge for miR-182-5p, which may contribute to the beneficial effect of circPTK2. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings suggest the participation of circPTK2 and its underlying mechanism in MDD, which might provide a potential target for MDD therapy.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that lasts lifelong and causes noticeably higher premature mortality. Although the core symptoms and other behavioral deficits of ASD can persist or be deteriorated from early development to old age, how aging affects the behaviors and brain anatomy in ASD is largely unknown. DOCK4 is an ASD risk gene highly expressed in the hippocampus, and Dock4 knockout (KO) mice display ASD-like behaviors in adulthood (4- to 6-month-old). In this study, we evaluated the behavioral and hippocampal pathological changes of late-middle-aged (15- to 17-month-old) Dock4 male KO mice. Aged Dock4 KO mice continuously showed similar social deficit, elevated anxiety, and disrupted object location memory as observed in the adulthood, when compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Notably, Dock4 KO mice displayed an age-related decline of hippocampal dependent spatial memory, showing decreased spatial memory in Barnes maze than their WT littermates at late middle age. Morphological analysis from WT and Dock4 KO littermates revealed that Dock4 deficiency led to decreased mature neurons and oligodendrocytes but increased astrocytes in the hippocampus of late-middle-aged mice. Together, we report that ASD-like behaviors mostly persist into late-middle age in Dock4 KO mice, with specific alterations of spatial memory and hippocampal anatomy by age, thus providing new evidence for understanding age differences in behavioral deficits of ASD.

AB  - Plant lipids are an essential energy source for diets and are a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based fuels and feedstocks. Fatty acid breakdown during seed germination is crucial for seedling establishment but unexpected during seed filling. Here, we demonstrate that the simultaneous biosynthesis and degradation of fatty acids begins early and continues across all phases of oil filling and throughout the photoperiod. Tests in camelina, rapeseed, and an engineered high-oil tobacco line confirmed that concomitant synthesis and breakdown in oil-producing tissues over development is the rule rather than the exception. Furthermore, we show that transgenics, designed to elevate fatty acid biosynthesis, failed to achieve anticipated increases in storage lipid levels due to increased degradation, potentially explaining the underperformance of engineered lines compared to expectations more generally.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may help protect plants against herbivores; however, their use for the pest control of woody plants requires further study. Here, we investigated the effect of Glomus mosseae colonization on the interactions between gypsy moth larvae and Populus alba x P. berolinensis seedlings and deciphered the regulatory mechanisms underlying the mycorrhizal-induced resistance in the leaves of mycorrhizal poplar using RNA-seq and nontargeted metabolomics. The resistance assay showed that AM fungus inoculation protected poplar seedlings against gypsy moth larvae, as evidenced by the decreased larval growth and reduced larval survival. A transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis (lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide dehydratase, and allene oxide cyclase) and signal transduction (jasmonate-ZIM domain and transcription factor MYC2) and identified the genes that were upregulated in mycorrhizal seedlings. Except for chalcone synthase and anthocyanidin synthase, which were downregulated in mycorrhizal seedlings, all DEGs related to flavonoid biosynthesis were upregulated, including 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonol synthase, and leucoanthocyanidin reductase. The metabolome analysis showed that several metabolites with insecticidal properties, including coumarin, stachydrine, artocarpin, norizalpinin, abietic acid, 6-formylumbelliferone, and vanillic acid, were significantly accumulated in the mycorrhizal seedlings. These findings suggest the potential of mycorrhiza-induced resistance for use in pest management of woody plants and demonstrate that the priming of JA-dependent responses in poplar seedlings contributes to mycorrhiza-induced resistance to insect pests.

AB  - As a forceful nematicide, fosthiazate has been largely applied in the management of root-knot nematodes and other herbivorous nematodes. However, the toxicity of fosthiazate to nontarget nematodes is unclear. To explore the toxicity and the mechanisms of fosthiazate in nontarget nematodes, Caenorhabditis elegans was exposed to 0.01-10 mg/L fosthiazate. The results implied that treatment with fosthiazate at doses above 0.01 mg/L could cause injury to the growth, locomotion behavior, and reproduction of the nematodes. Moreover, L1 larvae were more vulnerable to fosthiazate exposure than L4 larvae. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipofuscin accumulation were fairly increased in 1 mg/L fosthiazate-exposed nematodes. Treatment with 0.1 mg/L fosthiazate significantly inhibited the activity of acetylcholinesterase (p < 0.01). Furthermore, subacute exposure to 10 mg/L fosthiazate strongly influenced the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, reproduction, and nerve function (e.g., gst-1, sod-1, puf-8, wee-1.3, and ace-1 genes). These findings suggested that oxidative stress, reproduction and nerve disorders could serve as key endpoints of toxicity induced by fosthiazate. The cyp-35a family gene was the main metabolic fosthiazate in C. elegans, and the cyp-35a5 subtype was the most sensitive, with a change in expression level of 2.11-fold compared with the control. These results indicate that oxidative stress and neurological and reproductive disorders played fundamental roles in the toxicity of fosthiazate in C. elegans and may affect the abundance and function of soil nematodes.

AB  - Simple Summary Using bypass protein in ruminants' diets is crucial as it allows essential amino acids, like lysine, to escape rumen degradation and be absorbed in the intestine. This improves protein utilization and enhances growth, milk production, and overall animal health, leading to more efficient and sustainable livestock farming. This study explores the use of beeswax (BW) and carnauba wax (CW) lipid matrices to create bypass lysine (Lys) for ruminants, with tannins from Mimosa tenuiflora hay enhancing the protection of Lys. The research tested eight microencapsulated treatments with varying tannin levels (0%, 1%, 2%; 3%) using the fusion-emulsification technique. The results showed that adding tannins improved the microencapsulation yield and efficiency. Among the treatments, CWLys3% demonstrated the highest efficiency in retaining Lys and provided superior protection against rumen degradation. Our study demonstrated the efficiency of encapsulating the material (bypass protein) and making it available for the nutrition and growth of sheep. Future studies should determine what levels can be added to the diet and the consequences of using Lys bypass on the digestion and metabolism of sheep.Abstract Tannins are compounds present in forage plants that, in small quantities in the diet of ruminants, produce protein complexes that promote passage through the rumen and use in the intestine. This study tested the hypothesis that beeswax (BW) and carnauba wax (CW) lipid matrices are effective encapsulants for creating bypass lysine (Lys) for ruminants, with tannin extracted from the Mimosa tenuiflora hay source enhancing material protection. Microencapsulated systems were made using the fusion-emulsification technique with a 2:1 shell-to-core ratio and four tannin levels (0%, 1%, 2%; 3%). The following eight treatments were tested: BWLys0%, BWLys1%, BWLys2%, BWLys3%, CWLys0%, CWLys1%, CWLys2%, and CWLys3%. Tannin inclusion improved microencapsulation yield and efficiency. CWLys3% had the highest microencapsulation efficiency and retained Lys. Lysine in BW and CW matrices showed higher thermal stability than in its free form. Material retention was greater in BW than CW. Rumen pH and temperature remained unaffected, indicating that BW and CW as the shell and tannin as the adjuvant are efficient encapsulants for Lys bypass production. The formulation CWLys3% is recommended as it is more efficient in protecting the lysin amino acid from rumen degradation.

AB  - Background: Associations between early traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure and respiratory and allergic morbidity in adolescents are inconsistent. However, sub-groups might be more vulnerable to the health effects of this exposure.
   Objectives: We investigated associations between early exposure to TRAP and respiratory and allergic morbidity at age 13 years in the PARIS birth cohort, and potential modifying effects of sex, parental allergy, stressful family event and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI).
   Methods: This study deals with data from 732 children of the PARIS birth cohort followed up using repeated questionnaires until 13 years of age. Prenatal TRAP exposure was assessed by measuring daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide at the nearest station to mother's home. Early postnatal TRAP exposure was calculated for each child during the first year of life by a nitrogen oxides (NOx) air dispersion model taking into account both residence and daycare. Associations between TRAP exposures and asthma, rhinitis and related symptoms were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors. Effect modification was explored by testing multiplicative interactions.
   Results: An increase in interquartile range (17.0 mu g/m(3)) of early postnatal NOx exposure was positively related to current asthma (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 1.21; 95% confidence interval CI: 1.02, 1.43), severe wheeze (aOR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) and persistent asthma at 13 years old (aOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.55) and tended to be associated with asthma ever. Parental history of allergy, asthma, early stressful family event and LRTI modified these associations with TRAP exposure. No relationship with rhinitis was found. Prenatal TRAP exposure did not show any association with respiratory and allergic morbidity.
   Discussion: This study is one of the first to show several modifiers of the association between early postnatal TRAP exposure and asthma at adolescence. Not all adolescents seem equally affected by early postnatal TRAP exposure: those presenting parental history of allergy, especially asthma, those with early stressful family event or LRTI appear to be more vulnerable.

AB  - Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been recognized as a potential additive for aquafeeds due to its beneficial biological functions. In order to evaluate the potential application of EGCG in Chinese rice field eel (Monopterus albus), six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets containing 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg EGCG were formulated and were fed to Monopterus albus (M. albus) for 9 weeks. The results showed that M. albus fed diets containing 0 and 100 mg/kg EGCG presented higher weight again and specific growth rate than the other groups. Fish fed with 25, 50, and 400 mg/kg EGCG displayed lower whole-body lipid content. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentration significantly decreased in EGCG treated groups with the exception of 100 mg/kg group. Hepatic catalase (CAT) activity and glutathione (GSH) concentration decreased as EGCG level increased while malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration showed an opposite trend. EGCG supplementation resulted in a promoted lysozyme (LZM) activity and immunoglobulin M (IgM) level in the liver of M. albus. Furthermore, transcription of three immune related genes including major histocompatibility complex (mhc-2 alpha), hepcidin, and interleukin-8 (il-8) mRNAs was upregulated by EGCG treatment; while transcription of interleukin-6 (il-6) and nuclear factor kappa-B (nf-kb) genes was downregulated. Results also showed a linear relation between EGCG inclusion level and parameters of AST, CAT, GSH, MDA, LZM, IgM, and immune-related genes transcriptions. In summary, it could be suggested that EGCG supplementation enhanced the nonspecific immune response of the Chinese rice field eel. Based on the broken-line regression analysis of IgM, the optimal dietary EGCG supplementation for M. albus was estimated to be 109.81 mg/kg.

AB  - Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin illness characterized by excessive growth of skin cells, causing substantial discomfort and a lower quality of life for those affected. The studies aim to develop and test an ethosomal gel formulation for the effective treatment of psoriasis by combining ethosomes improved skin permeability with the controlled release features of a hydrogel matrix. Phospholipids and ethanol were used to generate the ethosomal gel, which encapsulates proven anti-psoriatic medications. These ethosomes were incorporated into hydrogels formulated with varying concentrations of Carbopol 940 (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%). The ethogels were assessed for their physicochemical characteristics, including appearance, pH, viscosity, spreadability, and drug content uniformity. Among the formulations, eG2 (1.0% Carbopol) demonstrated optimal spreadability, homogeneity, and drug content distribution. Ex vivo permeation studies using goat ear skin indicated that EG2 achieved the highest steady-state flux, permeability coefficient was 2.06cm/h, and cumulative drug permeation was 36.18mg/cm2 over 24 hours. The results suggest that ethosomes-loaded gels significantly enhance the permeability and stability of topical betamethasone valerate, providing a promising formulation strategy for psoriasis treatment. Further clinical evaluations are warranted to substantiate these findings and explore broader dermatological applications.

AB  - Objective: To assess seizure frequency and quality of life (QOL) in a group of adults with temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) before and after 10 weeks of systemic acupuncture sessions and compare the results with a group of patients with TLE-HS not undergoing acupuncture. Methods: The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) and the initial and final seizure frequency of 26 adult patients with TLE-HS who underwent acupuncture sessions for 10 consecutive weeks were assessed. The data were compared to those of 26 patients with TLE-HS not submitted to acupuncture, with p < 0.05. Results: There was a clinically significant effect in reducing the mean number of seizures per month in the follow-up period of patients submitted or not to acupuncture (no intervention group and intervention group, effect size:-0.94 and-1.01, respectively). In the last four weeks of follow-up, there was a significant difference between the no intervention and intervention groups (0.5 [0-2] and 0 [0-4]; p = 0.018). When using minimally important change (MIC) threshold data for the QOLIE-31 between the final and initial scores, with the Cantril Ladder Scale as anchoring, it was observed that, in the intervention group, large clinically significant effects were seen for all dimensions, except for cognitive function, medication effect, and social function, which presented medium effects. In the follow-up, the variation of the QOLIE31 scores was positive for both groups; however, it was higher in all dimensions in the intervention group, indicating a better QOL. Conclusion: There was a reduction in the mean number of seizures per month in all patients during the follow-up period. Acupuncture significantly reduced the number of seizures in the intervention group in the final phase of the study. QOL improvements occurred in all patients, however, more significantly in the intervention group. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This trial investigated the influence of dietary extruded linseed combined with plant extract on pig performance, blood lipid profiles, meat quality, oxidative stability and the fatty acid composition of meat and backfat. Four-hundred and eighty crossbred pigs were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments, namely, a control diet (T1), the control diet supplemented with extruded linseed (T2) and identical T2 diet supplemented with thymol powder (T3) or green tea extract (T4). The extruded linseed supplementation decreased blood triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and improved fatty acid composition of meat and backfat by increasing n-3 PUFA content and decreasing the n-6/n-3 ratio (p < .05). However, it led to decrease the oxidative stability of blood and meat, while supplementation with thymol powder or green tea extract increased the oxidative stability of blood (27.08 and 27.53% in T3 and T4 compared with T2, respectively) and meat (40.15 and 41.21% in T3 and T4 compared with T2, respectively; p < .01). The findings conclude that dietary extruded linseed combined with thymol powder or green tea extract has the potential to produce functional pork.

AB  - Poor cervical sperm transport in some ewe breeds following cervical artificial insemination using frozen-thawed semen could be due to differences in cervical sialic acid composition and the proportion of neutral and sialylated O-glycans.
   Sialic acid occupies terminal positions on O-glycans of cervical mucins, where they contribute to the increased viscosity of mucin thereby regulating sperm transport. This study characterized the sialylated cervical mucins from follicular phase mucus of six European ewe breeds with known differences in pregnancy rates following cervical artificial insemination (AI) using frozen-thawed semen at both synchronized and natural estrus cycles. These were Suffolk (low fertility) and Belclare (medium fertility) in Ireland, Ile de France and Romanov (both with medium fertility) in France, and Norwegian White Sheep (NWS) and Fur (both with high fertility) in Norway. Expression of mucin and sialic acid related genes was quantified using RNA-sequencing in cervical tissue from Suffolk, Belclare, Fur, and NWS only. Cervical tissue was also assessed for the percentage of cervical epithelial populated by mucin secreting goblet cells in the same four ewe breeds. Biochemical analysis showed that there was an effect of ewe breed on sialic acid species, which was represented by Suffolk having higher levels of Neu5,9Ac(2) compared with NWS (P < 0.05). Suffolk ewes had a lower percentage of goblet cells than Fur and NWS (P < 0.05). Gene expression analysis identified higher expression of MUC5AC, MUC5B, ST6GAL1, and ST6GAL2 and lower expression of ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4, and SIGLEC10 in Suffolk compared with high fertility ewe breeds (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that specific alterations in sialylated mucin composition may be related to impaired cervical sperm transport.

AB  - Stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea) are a moderately diverse order that comprises almost 3,500 extant species of large to very large often impressively camouflaged nocturnal herbivores. The order also stands out as one of the few insect orders that have until lately lacked a robust higher-level phylogeny and still the relationships between many New World taxa in particular remain unknown.The Diapheromerinae is one of the main lineages of the Occidophasmata and comprises a bulk of the diversity of New World stick insects. The clade is endemic to the Americas and includes the longest insects of that region. During the past 25 years Diapheromerinae has experienced various often inconsistent attempts of a classification, which have resulted in a complicated history that has meanwhile constituted a heterogenous mixture of historical and contemporary views. To counter these challenges workers have made use of rank-free taxa to provisionally group supposedly monophyletic clades. Currently the Diapheromerinae are sub-divided into the two tribes Diapheromerini and Oreophoetini and recent molecular analyses have shown taxa of the Cladomorphinae G & uuml;nther, 1953 to belong to Diapheromerinae. Certainly, the clade still deserves much work to delimit meaningful sub-groups within Diapheromerinae reflective of their evolutionary history and the results of the latest comprehensive molecular-based phylogenetic studies already imply sub-divisions within the Diapheromerini. The rank-free taxon Cladomorformia tax. n. is established to comprise former Cladomorphini, Cranidiini, Otocrania Redtenbacher, 1908 as well as sections of Diapheromerini sensu Robertson et al., 2018, which are the genera that have previously been placed in the "Phanocles group" sensu Zompro, 2001 as well as two genera of the "Bacteria group" and one genus of the "Clonistria group": Alienobostra, Bostriana, Calynda, Globocalynda, Laciphorus, Phanocles, Phanocloidea and Trychopeplus. The genus Cranidium and all genera of Cladomorphini sensu Hennemann et al., 2016 are here formally transferred to Diapheromerinae, this is Aplopocranidium, Cladomorphus, Jeremia, Jeremiodes, Otocraniella and Xylodus. A holistic review of Cladomorformia at the genus level is conducted herein and new diagnoses, differentiations and keys to all 25 genera that are now contained in that clade are presented. Lists of species are provided for all genera, which include detailed type data, synonymies and distributional records. Moreover, identification keys to all 163 known valid species are provided to render identification of species within the 25 known genera possible. In total, 232 species are covered if the 69 synonymous taxa are included.The subfamily Haplopodinae is introduced to comprise all genera of the tribes Haplopodini, Hesperophasmatini and Pterinoxylini as classified by Hennemann et al. (2016) as well as the recently described Teruelphasmini. Renaming former Cladomorphinae sensu Robertson et al. (2018) into Haplopodinae is necessary, because the type-genus Cladomorphuscan no longer be considered a member of that lineage and belongs in Diapheromerinae. Haplopodinae is the only New World clade that belongs into the Old World Oriophasmata.Bostranova Villet, 2023 has been introduced to replace the preoccupied Bostra St & aring;l, 1875. The type-species of Bostranova, Bacteria turgida Westwood, 1859, however is here shown to belong in Phanocloidea Zompro, 2001. Thus, Bostranova is synonymised under Phanocloidea (n. syn.) and all species are transferred to Phanocloidea and other genera.
   Paraphanocles Zompro, 2001 (Type-species: Mantis keratosqueleton Olivier, 1792) is synonymised with Phanocles St & aring;l, 1875 (syn. n.).Seven new genera are described: Globocraniagen. n. (Type-species: Bacteria emesa Westwood, 1859), Hirtuleiodesgen. n. (Type-species: Phibalosoma gibbosa Chopard, 1911), Lanceobostragen. n.

AB  - The proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) are responsible for the development of skeletal muscle. In our previous study, circ_002156 was found to be highly expressed in caprine Longissimus Dorsi muscle, but the regulatory role of the circular RNAs (circRNA) in goat SMSCs remains unclear. In this study, the authenticity of circ_002156 was validated, and its structurally characteristic and cellular localization as well as tissue expression of circ_002156 and its parent genes were investigated. Moreover, the effects of circ_002156 on the viability, proliferation, and differentiation of SMSCs were also studied. The circ_002156 is located on caprine chromosome 19 with a length of 36,478. The circRNA structurally originates from myosin heavy chain 2 (MYH2), MYH1, and MYH4 as well as intergenic sequences among the parent genes. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the authenticity of circ_002156. Most circ_002156 (55.5%) was expressed in the nuclei of SMSCs, while 44.5% of circ_002156 was located in the cytoplasm. The circ_002156 and its three parent genes had higher expression levels in the triceps brachii, quadriceps femoris, and longissimus dorsi muscle tissues than in the other five tissues. The expression of circ_002156 and its parent genes MYH1 and MYH4 reached the maximum on day 8 of differentiation, while MYH2 in expression reached the peak on day 4 after differentiation. The Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that circ_002156 had moderate or high positive correlations with the three parent genes in the expression of both quadriceps femoris muscle and SMSCs during different differentiation stages. The small interfering RNA circ_002156 (named si-circ_002156) remarkably increased the viability of the SMSCs. The si-circ_002156 also increased the number and parentage of Edu-labeled positive SMSCs as well as the expression levels of four cell proliferation marker genes. These suggest that circ_002156 inhibited the proliferation of SMSCs. Meanwhile, si-circ_002156 decreased the area of MyHC-labeled positive myotubes, the myotube fusion index, and myotube size as well as the expression of its three parent genes and four cell differentiation marker genes, suggesting a positive effect of circ_002156 on the differentiation of SMSCs. This study contributes to a better understanding of the roles of circ_002156 in the proliferation and differentiation of SMSCs.

AB  - Neuronal excitability is a critical feature of central nervous system development, playing a fundamental role in the functional maturation of brain regions, including the hippocampus, cerebellum, auditory and visual systems. The present study aimed to determine the mechanism by which hypoxia causes brain dysfunction through perturbation of neuronal excitability in a hypoxic neonatal mouse model. Functional brain development was assessed in humans using the Gesell Development Diagnosis Scale. In mice, gene transcription was evaluated via mRNA sequencing and quantitative PCR; furthermore, patch clamp recordings assessed potassium currents. Clinical observations revealed disrupted functional brain development in 6- and 18-month-old hypoxic neonates, and those born with normal hearing screening unexpectedly exhibited impaired central auditory function at 3 months. In model mice, CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibited reduced spontaneous activity, largely induced by excitatory synaptic input suppression, despite the elevated membrane excitability of hypoxic neurons compared to that of control neurons. In hypoxic neurons, Kcnd3 gene transcription was upregulated, confirming upregulated hippocampal K(v)4.3 expression. A-type potassium currents were enhanced, and K(v)4.3 participated in blocking excitatory presynaptic inputs. Elevated K(v)4.3 activity in pyramidal neurons under hypoxic conditions inhibited excitatory presynaptic inputs and further decreased neuronal excitability, disrupting functional brain development in hypoxic neonates.

AB  - To investigate the association between chronic high temperature exposure and brain structure and how the association influences mental health, we conducted cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies within a sample of 41,552 UK Biobank participants. Chronic temperature exposure was assessed for each participant based on their residential histories and gridded reanalysis temperature data and defined as the percentage of days with a maximum temperature exceeding 27 degrees C over the last 20 years. Generalized additive models and difference-in-differences approaches were used to estimate the association between chronic high temperature exposure and neuroimaging outcomes obtained via brain MRI. Mediation analysis was performed to assess whether neuroimaging changes mediated the relationship between chronic high temperature exposure and behavioral decline. We observed chronic high temperature exposure was associated with widespread reduced brain volume, including global grey volume (-5859.32 mm3, 95% CI -6631.82 to -5086.83), white matter volume (-5482.47 mm3, 95% CI -6192.92 to -4772.03), regional grey matter volumes (especially in the cerebellum and brainstem), and subcortical structure volumes (especially in the accumbens, hippocampus, and thalamus). Furthermore, the association mediated depression and declined cognition. Chronic high temperature exposure also enhances age-related brain atrophy. Alterations in white matter tracts were also observed. In conclusion, our study provides multimodal MRI evidence of the adverse effects of chronic high temperature exposure on brain structure and mental health.

AB  - Background: Sleep curtailment is a serious problem in many societies. Clinical evidence has shown that sleep deprivation is associated with mood dysregulation, formation of false memory, cardio-metabolic risk factors and outcomes, inflammatory disease risk, and all-cause mortality. The affective disorder dysregulation caused by insufficient sleep has become an increasingly serious health problem. However, to date, not much attention has been paid to the mild affective dysregulation caused by insufficient sleep, and there is no clear and standard therapeutic method to treat it. The Xiaoyao Pill is a classic Chinese medicinal formula, with the effect of dispersing stagnated hepatoqi, invigorating the spleen, and nourishing the blood. Therefore, it is most commonly used to treat gynecological diseases in China. In the present study, the effects of the Xiaoyao Pill on affective dysregulation of sleep-deprived mice and its underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Methods: Forty adult female mice were used in the present study. The sleep deprivation model was established by improving the multi-platform water environment method. After 7 consecutive days of sleep deprivation, the mice were administrated low (LXYP, 0.32mg/kg) and high (HXYP, 0.64 mg/kg) doses of the Xiaoyao Pill for two weeks. Then, the body weight, behavioral deficits, and histopathology were evaluated. Meanwhile, the expression of c-fos protein and the concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were determined after two weeks of treatment. Results: Xiaoyao Pill treatment significantly increased body weight and sucrose consumption and decreased the irritability scores of the sleep-deprived mice. Meanwhile, Xiaoyao Pill treatment prevented brain injury and inhibited the expression of c-fos protein in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In addition, HXYP treatment significantly upregulated the levels of NE in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (p < 0.01). LXYP treatment significantly up-regulated the levels of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex. Meanwhile, both HXYP and LXYP treatment significantly up-regulated the levels of DA in the prefrontal cortex (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) of sleep-deprived mice. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that Xiaoyao Pill treatment prevented the behavioral deficits of mice induced by sleep deprivation by promoting the recovery of brain tissue injury and up-regulating the levels of NE, 5-HT, and DA in the brain tissue.

AB  - Exosomes are membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by cells, containing a variety of biologically active ingredients including proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of the exosomes and underlying mechanisms in a miniature pig model of ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (I/R-AKI). The exosomes were extracted from cultured human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) and infused into a miniature pig model of I/R AKI. Our results showed that 120 min of unilateral ischemia followed by reperfusion and contralateral nephrectomy resulted in renal dysfunction, severe kidney damage, apoptosis and necroptosis. Intravenous infusion of one dose of exosomes collected from about 4 x 10(8) hUC-MSCs significantly improved renal function and reduced apoptosis and necroptosis. Administration of hUC-MSC exosomes also reduced the expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, decreased infiltration of macrophages to the injured kidneys and suppressed the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, two transcriptional factors related to inflammatory regulation. Moreover, hUC-MSC exosomes could promote proliferation of renal tubular cells, angiogenesis and upregulation of Klotho and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7, two renoprotective molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor A and its receptor. Collectively, our results suggest that injection of hUC-MSC exosomes could ameliorate I/R-AKI and accelerate renal tubular cell repair and regeneration, and that hUC-MSC exosomes may be used as a potential biological therapy for Acute kidney injury patients.

AB  - Food adulteration is a serious problem all over the world. Establishing an accurate, sensitive and fast detection method is an important part of identifying food adulteration. Herein, a sequence-specific ladder-shape melting temperature isothermal amplification (LMTIA) assay was reported to detect soybean-derived components using proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage (named Proofman), which could realize real-time and visual detection without uncapping. The results showed that, under the optimal temperature of 57 degrees C, the established Proofman-LMTIA method for the detection of soybean-derived components in dairy products was sensitive to 1 pg/mu L, with strong specificity, and could distinguish soybean genes from those of beef, mutton, sunflower, corn, walnut, etc. The established Proofman-LMTIA detection method was applied to the detection of actual samples of cow milk and goat milk. The results showed that the method was accurate, stable and reliable, and the detection results were not affected by a complex matrix without false positives or false negatives. It was proved that the method could be used for the detection and identification of soybean-derived components in actual dairy products samples.

AB  - Solid-state fermentation (SSF) of green tea waste (GTW) and black tea waste (BTW) was evaluated to assess microbial effects on extractable caffeine content. A significant caffeine increase was observed, with GTW fermented at 45 degrees C and 55 % water content for 6 days yielding the higher caffeine content (similar to 13.7134 mg/g dry mass via high-temperature extraction, similar to 5.098 mg/g dry mass higher than control, unfermented GTW on day 0). SSF also enhanced caffeine extraction at room temperature with minimal solvent, offering an energy-efficient advantage. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analysis by the proton transfer reaction-time of a flight-mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) and microbial profiling by DNA sequencing analysis revealed key VOCs (m/z 59, m/z 61, m/z 89) linked to microbial activity. Dominant bacteria (Bacillus, Paenibacillus) and fungi (Aspergillus) in fermented GTW likely contributed to improved caffeine extractability. These findings highlight microbial transformations in tea waste SSF and its potential for sustainable caffeine extraction as a value-added product.

AB  - Ruminants play a crucial role in dairy farming, pharmaceuticals, and embryonic stem cell research; thus, it is vital to prevent pregnancy loss and improve reproductive outcomes through a better understanding of placental development. Paternally-expressed gene 10 (PEG10) is a conserved gene essential for placental development in mammals, but its function in ruminants is not well understood. To develop insights into its role in placental development, this study investigated the gene structure and expression of PEG10 in cattle and goats. We found that PEG10's structure was conserved across species, and in the placenta, it retained the ability to bind to its own mRNA. Transcript analysis revealed differential expression patterns of PEG10 at early and late stages of placental development. We identified 70 proteins potentially interacting with PEG10 that were involved in biological processes like metabolism, signal transduction, cell proliferation, and immune responses. These proteins were grouped into seven clusters, associated with pathways such as amino acid degradation, the TCA cycle, longevity regulation, cardiomyopathy, proteasome function, and biosynthesis. Our findings suggest that PEG10 regulates placental development in ruminants by interacting with key proteins like CAST, ITGA6, and FTL, which are responsible for critical cellular processes in placental function.

AB  - The growth and development of skeletal muscle is regulated by many factors, and recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) can participate in this process. The model of porcine skeletal muscle injury was constructed to search for circRNAs that can regulate the growth and development of skeletal muscle in pigs. Using whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, a novel circRNA (circCSDE1) was screened out, which is highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Functional studies in C2C12 cells demonstrated that circCSDE1 could promote proliferation and inhibit myoblast differentiation, while opposing changes were observed by circCSDE1 knockdown. A dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that circCSDE1 directly targeted miR-21-3p to regulate the expression of the downstream target gene (Cyclin-dependent kinase 16, CDK16). Moreover, miR-21-3p could inhibit proliferation and promote myoblast differentiation in C2C12 cells, opposite with the effects of circCSDE1. Additionally, the rescue experiments offered further evidence that circCSDE1 and its target, miR-21-3p, work together to regulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation. This study provides a theoretical basis for further understanding the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs.

AB  - BackgroundCutibacterium acnes(C. acnes), a Gram-positive anaerobe and a dominant bacterium species in the sebaceous follicles of the face was detected in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. It has been found that C. acnes activates non-specifically the innate immune system by producing proinflammatory cytokines and can participate in brain inflammation. We hypothesise that C. acnes could influence the brain through the structural alteration in axons and dendrites of neurons.MethodsIn this regard, the hippocampus of rats was infected with C. acnes, and memory retention, amyloid-beta (A beta 1-42) deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau) formation, and expression levels of MAP2 and beta-tubulin proteins in the hippocampus tissues were investigated.ResultsC. acnes-infected rats displayed memory deficits and A beta 1-42 deposits were detected in their hippocampus tissue up to 7 days post-infection. C. acnes was neurotoxic and exerted detrimental effects on MAP2 and beta-tubulin proteins, which are required for normal neuronal function. An elevated level of p-Tau was also identified in infected animals.ConclusionBased on these results, we propose that C. acnes infection of the brain participates in the initiation of the pathogenesis of sporadic AD through degeneration of axons and dendrites.

AB  - Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) reportedly provides a close connection between oocyte maturation and mitochondrial function in pigs. N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine (melatonin) is known to be a representative antioxidant with the ability to rehabilitate meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes. However, the ability of melatonin to recover Mdivi-1-mediated disruption of spindle formation during meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation (IVM) has not been studied. Here, we first investigated changes in mitochondrial length, such as fragmentation and elongation form, in mature porcine oocytes during IVM. Mature oocytes require appropriate mitochondrial fission for porcine oocyte maturation. We identified a dose-dependent reduction in meiotic maturation in porcine oocytes following Mdivi-1 treatment (50, 75, and 100 mu M). We also confirmed changes in mitochondrial fission protein levels [dynamin-related protein 1 phosphorylation at serine 616 (pDRP1-Ser616) and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)], mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production in 75 mu M Mdivi-1-treated oocytes. As expected, Mdivi-1 significantly reduced mitochondrial function and DRP1 protein levels and increased spindle abnormalities in porcine oocytes. In addition, we confirmed that melatonin restores abnormal spindle assembly and reduces meiotic maturation rates by Mdivi-1 during porcine oocyte maturation. Interestingly, the expression levels of genes that reduce DNA damage and improve tubulin formation were enhanced during porcine meiotic maturation. Taken together, these results suggest that melatonin has direct beneficial effects on meiotic maturation through tubulin formation factors during porcine oocyte maturation.

AB  - With the ever-growing demands for flexible smart interactive electronics, it remains highly desirable yet challenging to design and fabricate interactive ionic skin with multiple signal synergistic outputs. Herein, high-performance photonic ionogels (PIGs) with excellent stability and synergy sensitivity are designed by locking a non-volatile and non-hygroscopic ionic liquid (IL), that is, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIm][TFSI]), into photonic elastomers based on polymer networks of poly(ethylene glycol) phenyl ether acrylate (PEGPEA). Through manipulating the degree of crosslinking, PIGs exhibit high sensitivity that can output distinct and intuitive color change in visual with the mechanochromic sensitivity of approximate to 1.76 nm per percent strain and clear electrical signal with the gauge factor of 1, in response to a tiny stretch of millimeter scale. Thanks to the stable photonic elastomers and IL employed, the PIGs developed in this study exhibit good performance under harsh and complex environmental conditions, including high/low temperature (from -35 degrees C to 100 degrees C), dry/wet air, and high vacuum. This study provides a novel strategy for developing integrated, stable, and multifunctional photonic ionogels for ionic skin sensors and flexible interactive devices with synergistically optical and electrical output.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1:10000 newborn girls and is primarily caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. Due to reduced brain monoamine levels in RTT, antidepressants have been explored as potential therapies. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the antidepressant mirtazapine (MTZ) alleviates symptoms in Mecp2-mutant mice and RTT adult patients. However, the mechanism of action of MTZ, a racemic mixture that binds to multiple receptors, remains unclear. This study introduces a computational approach to screen the "human pocketome," comprising over 25 K ligand-bound pockets derived from more than 210 K human protein structures available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, aiming to identify binding pockets with high affinity for each MTZ enantiomer. Novelty concerns the approach to compare the two enantiomers of MTZ to other drugs experimentally determined as inactive for RTT. This approach introduces a new metric, the ZZscore, which ranks tested proteins and pockets based on their degree of interaction with the tested drugs. This enables the identification of potential drug-protein interactions relevant to the disease and/or phenotypic traits under study. Initial relaxed settings and thresholds parameters suggested over 30 potential targets, among which the RASH/SOS1 complex, but in vitro experiments on cultured hippocampal neurons from Mecp2-KO mice excluded any MTZ effect on it. Thus, we refined the procedure with more stringent parameters and identified 16 protein targets for S(+)MTZ and 14 for R(-)MTZ, with 5 common targets. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed 25 pathways for S(+)MTZ and 24 for R(-)MTZ, with 11 common pathways, many related to MeCP2 functions disrupted in RTT, such as epigenetic chromatin regulation, intracellular signaling, energy metabolism, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, and catecholamine biosynthesis. Overall, the presented computational modeling strategy for target identification allowed us to hypothesize new mechanisms of action for the two MTZ enantiomers. image

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryoablation is less invasive for certain selected and inoperable pulmonary lesions, which can be treated via percutaneous or transbronchial approaches. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of percutaneous cryoablation using an porcine lung parenchyma model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nitrogen-cooled cryoprobe was inserted into the posterior lobe of the peripheral lung parenchyma of six healthy female pigs percutaneously under CT guidance. Double and triple freeze- thaw cycles were performed on the left lung and the right lung, respectively. CT images were obtained before, during and after cryoablation. Blood samples were collected at various time points for testing. Tissue samples from the ablation zone were obtained after cryoablation for histopathological analysis. Data from the percutaneous study were compared with previously published transbronchial cryoablation data. RESULTS: The cryoablation outcomes and inflammatory responses observed in the percutaneous group were largely consistent as compared to those previously published in the transbronchial groups. Similar trends in the histopathological transition from the center to the periphery of the ablation zone and tissue repair process was exhibited between two groups within 4 weeks. Two cases of pneumothorax occurred in the percutaneous group. CONCLUSION: Cryoablation of the peripheral lung parenchyma by both percutaneous and transbronchial methods is safe and effective. Transbronchial approach demonstrates a lower complication rate than the percutaneous method. Two approaches complement one another for minimally invasive treatment of lung cancers.

AB  - In human pregnancy, metformin administered to the mother crosses the placenta resulting in metformin exposure to the fetus. However, the effects of metformin exposure on the fetus are poorly understood and difficult to study in humans. Pregnant sheep are a powerful large animal model for studying fetal physiology. The objective of this study was to determine if maternally administered metformin at human dose-equivalent concentrations crosses the ovine placenta and equilibrates in the fetal circulation. To test this, metformin was administered to the pregnant ewe via continuous intravenous infusion or supplementation in the drinking water. Both administration routes increased maternal metformin concentrations to human dose-equivalent concentrations of similar to 10 mu M, yet metformin was negligible in the fetus even after 3-4 days of maternal administration. In cotyledon and caruncle tissue, expression levels of the major metformin uptake transporter organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) were < 1% of expression levels in the fetal liver, a tissue with abundant expression. Expression of other putative uptake transporters OCT2 and OCT3, and efflux transporters multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1 and MATE2were more abundant. These results demonstrate that the ovine placenta is impermeable to maternal metformin administration. This is likely due to anatomical differences and increased interhaemal distance between the maternal and umbilical circulations in the ovine versus human placenta limiting placental metformin transport.

AB  - Chronic wounds are considered a worldwide public health problem, affecting millions yearly. The application of nanofibers associated with drugs and photopharmaceuticals is a promising alternative to meet the clinical needs of sterilization and tissue repair. Thus, aiming at the development of a smart dressing to improve the treatment and healing of these wounds, in the present work, the production of nanofibers containing the mixture of polymers F-127 and PCL with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and curcumin (CUR) was proposed and successfully performed, through a design of a photoactive nanoscaffold. A careful study on the optimization of conductivity and viscosity parameters of complex electrospinning nanosuspensions was carried out to obtain homogeneous nanofibrous (NM) matrices with controlled size also incorporated with photodrugs. Several analysis techniques were employed such as Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy, indicating diameters of approximately 900 nm and providing images of the AgNPs formed and distributed along the nanofibers with diameters around 12 +/- 4 nm. Micro-Raman demonstrates the presence of the SERS effect, also evidencing the interaction of photodrug CUR with AgNPs within the nanofibers. Thermogravimetric analyses indicate the samples' thermal stability. In addition to the contact angle measurements, proved the hydrophilization of the nanofibers with angle zero, and mechanical properties indicate the elasticity suitable for topical application. Furthermore, swelling studies were performed in simulated wound fluid (FSF), which quantification of CUR incorporated in NM was performed. Subsequently, the in vitro drug release in FSF was also studied, as well as their release kinetics, to evaluate the release of CUR from the nanofiber and determine its first-order kinetics process. The experiment involving photoacoustic spectroscopy was also carried out, evaluating the permeation of drugs in human biomimetic skin system from pig ears, therefor corroborating the results obtained in the in vitro drug release studies, in which CUR delivery from the NM and assisted in permeation is majority modulated by the AgNPs. Finally, the Candida albicans inhibition study showed that the nanosuspensions used in electrospinning as well as the NM were effective in controlling fungal growth, with emphasis on the nanofiber with the AgNPs/CUR combination at pH 8, considered wound pH.

AB  - Background: Ruminants possess a rich repository of natural antimicrobial peptides(AMPs) within their bodies, surpassing those found in humans and mice. These peptides, including Defensin, Cathelicidin, and Lysozyme, are integral to the body's innate and adaptive immune responses and represent promising alternatives to antibiotics with significant application potential. Results: In the present study, we conducted a systematic analysis of 40 Defensins, 38 Cathelicidins, and 61 Lysozymes in cattle and sheep. Our findings revealed that these peptides have retained functional integrity through the evolutionary history of these species. However, they exhibit unique gene duplication and expansion events when compared to humans and mice, indicating their potent roles in cattle and sheep. Notably, the Cathelicidin gene family experienced the most substantial expansion in these ruminants. The newly expanded genes were highly expressed in tissues and organs such as the tongue surface, intestine, mammary gland, and others, exhibiting tissue-specific preferences. This expression pattern is associated with the unique behaviors and high lactation capacity of ruminants. An in vitro bacterial inhibition assay demonstrated that EBD, LALBA, LYSB, and CATHL4 exhibited significant broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Additionally, loci dB1, dB5, cB2, cB3, and yB1 were pinpointed as key co-regulatory elements in the antimicrobial peptide motifs within cattle mammary epithelial cells. Conclusions: This research illuminates the structure-function relationship and antimicrobial potency of natural AMP genes in cattle and sheep, providing a theoretical foundation for the development of novel veterinary drugs to treat common bacterial diseases in ruminants and for enhancing animal health care. The identified transcriptional regulatory sites offer a new perspective on the molecular regulation of AMP genes expression, which can be leveraged to improve the disease resistance of domestic animals. This work contributes to a broader understanding of the evolution and regulation of AMP genes, with potential applications for animal health and breeding programs.

AB  - BackgroundAmong all the coconut pests, rhinoceros beetle causes acute and serious damage to coconut palm. Management of this pest is very difficult due to its nocturnal activity, and also, it damages the emerging leaf inside the bud. Management of rhinoceros beetle using entomopathogens will be of great importance as it is economical and ecofriendly. Studies were carried out to decipher the biocontrol potential of indigenous entomopathogenic bacterium (Bacillus thuringiensis) and entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium robertsii and M. majus) against Oryctes rhinoceros in the field, individually as well as in combination, by soil drench as well as by topical spray method.ResultsThe study showed that B. thuringiensis strain NBAIR-BTAN4 showed 24.8% mortality at 5th week in soil drench method and 24% mortality in topical spray method. M. robertsii showed 24% mortality at 5th week in soil drench method as well as topical spray method. Similarly, M. majus showed 24% mortality in soil drench method and 23.2% in topical spray method at 5th week. In combination, NBAIR-BTAN4 + M. robertsii showed 40.8 and 44% in soil drench and topical spray method at 5th week, respectively. Combination of NBAIR-BTAN4 + M. majus showed 44.8 and 40.8% in soil drench and topical spray method at 5th week, respectively. Combination of NBAIR-BTAN4 + M. robertsii + M. majus showed 52.8 and 57.6% mortality at 5th week in soil drench and topical spray method, respectively.ConclusionThe present study showed application B. thuringiensis in combination with M. robertsii and M. majus is effective in management rhinoceros beetle in coconut orchard. Study also indicated that soil drench method is more promising strategy than topical spray method in managing larval population of the beetles and also confirmed that B. thuringiensis, M. robertsii and M. majus are compatible and they seemed to have a synergistic effect in controlling the pest in coconut orchard.

AB  - Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is an epigenetic factor associated with the neurodevelopmental disorders Rett Syndrome and MECP2 duplication syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated that knocking out MeCP2 globally in the central nervous system leads to an obese phenotype and hyperphagia, however it is not clear if the hyperphagia is the result of an increased preference for food reward or due to an increase in motivation to obtain food reward. We show that mice deficient in MeCP2 specifically in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons have an increased preference for high fat diet as measured by conditioned place preference but do not have a greater motivation to obtain food reward using a progressive ratio task, relative to wildtype littermate controls. We also demonstrate that POMC-Cre MeCP2 knockout (KO) mice have increased body weight after long-term high fat diet exposure as well as elevated plasma leptin and corticosterone levels compared to wildtype mice. Taken together, these results are the first to show that POMC-specific loss -of -function Mecp2 mutations leads to dissociable effects on the rewarding/motivational properties of food as well as changes to hormones associated with body weight homeostasis and stress.

AB  - Cognitive decline is a common clinical symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Fluoxetine (FLU), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can improve cognitive deficits in demented patients. The present study investigated the effects of FLU on spatial learning and memory cognitions in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Morris water maze (MWM) test showed that FLU significantly improved spatial cognitive deficits in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA injection at 4 and 7 weeks after 6-OHDA injection. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that the number and duration of high voltage spindles(HVSs)in the ipsilateral hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats were decreased by the administration of FLU. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of per frequency revealed increases in delta and theta rhythm power and decreases in alpha, beta and gamma rhythm power in the ipsilateral hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats in contrast to the saline-treated rats. Acute FLU treatment can reduce delta and theta rhythm power, and enhance alpha, beta and gamma rhythm power in the ipsilateral hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats. These findings suggest that FLU improves impaired cognition by tuning oscillatory activities in the hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats.

AB  - Post-stroke depression (PSD) is one of the most familiar complications of stroke, which refers to stroke patients who have varying degrees of depression (lasts for >2 weeks). SET domain-containing 3 (SETD3) is a conserved histone H3 methyltransferase, and the role of SETD3 in some diseases is increasingly being explored. However, the effects of SETD3 in PSD remain unclear. In this study, the PSD rat model was firstly constructed by Endothelin-1 injection combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress, and we discovered that SETD3 expression was up-regulated in PSD rat model. Additionally, SETD3 knockdown relieved the depressive symptom of PSD. Moreover, SETD3 knockdown promoted proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Due to the critical role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in antidepressant and SETD3 can negatively regulate VEGF, we speculated that SETD3 may regulate PSD progression through VEGF. Our results demonstrated that SETD3 knockdown up-regulated VEGF expression. Furthermore, SETD3 modulated the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs through regulating VEGF expression. In conclusion, our study indicated that up regulation of SETD3 contributed to PSD progression in rats through negatively regulating VEGF expression. The findings of this work suggest that SETD3 may be a promising target for treating PSD in the future.

AB  - Amino acids can affect protein synthesis by activating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Amino acid transporters SLC38A9 on the lysosomal membrane not only transport amino acids, but also can sense amino acids and activate mTORC1 signaling pathway. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) can promote the expression of amino acid transporters by binding with amino acid response element (AARE). In this study, two AAREs were found in the SLC38A9 promoter region of pig, and both of them bound to ATF4. The AARE in the first intron was located in the core promoter region of SLC38A9. ATF4 regulated mRNA expression level of SLC38A9 in porcine skeletal muscle cells. In the absence of amino acids, the expression of ATF4 decreased and the expression of SLC38A9 increased. After leucine addition, the expression levels of ATF4 and SLC38A9 increased. It suggested that in the absence of amino acids, the expression of SLC38A9 was increased via binding of ATF4 to AARE binding factors in SLC38A9 promoter fragment; after the addition of leucine, ATF4 was activated, resulting in the increase of SLC38A9 expression.

AB  - Selective elimination of cancer cells without causing deleterious effects on normal cells is an ideal anti-cancer strategy. Here, using Drosophila cancer model, we performed an in vivo RNAi screen for anti-cancer targets that selectively eliminate tumors without affecting normal tissue growth. In Drosophila imaginal epithelium, clones of cells expressing oncogenic Ras with simultaneous mutations in the cell polarity gene scribble (Ras(V12)/scrib(-/-)) develop into malignant tumors. We found that knockdown of Crk, the Drosophila ortholog of human CRK (CT10 regulatory kinase) and CRKL (Crk-like) adapter proteins, significantly suppresses growth of Ras(V12)/scrib(-/-) tumors by inducing c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated apoptosis, while it does not affect growth of normal epithelium. Mechanistically, Crk inhibition blocks Yorkie (Yki)/YAP activity by impairing F-actin accumulation, an upstream event of Yki/YAP activation in tumors. Inhibition of Yki/YAP in tumors causes intracellular JNK signaling to be used for apoptosis induction. Given that molecules and signaling pathways identified in Drosophila are highly conserved and activated in human cancers, our findings would provide a novel, to the best of our knowledge, anti-cancer strategy against YAP-activated cancers.

AB  - Site -specific manure application is a promising approach to optimise manure use by accounting for spatial variability of soil nutrients within the field. Traditionally, variable -rate management can be achieved by the map -based approach and the sensor -based approach, which account for the soil or manure characteristics, respectively. In this work, a new map -sensor -based methodology for variable -rate manure application (VRMA) is presented and implemented, which relies on combining a predefined soil phosphorous (P) map, and real-time measured liquid manure (pig) P2O5 using visible and near -infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy sensors. An on-line manure sensing device based on a retrofitted vis-NIR sensor mounted on a drag -hose liquid manure injection machine was designed and manufactured. Meanwhile, software for loading the on-line measured soil P map, parsing global positioning system (GPS) messages, controlling on-line manure sensing device, and calculating the target manure application rate was developed in the LabVIEW programming environment. Using the developed hardware and software, a phosphorus -map -sensor -based VRMA was evaluated on two commercial fields in the Flemish part of Belgium with wheat. Each field was divided into parallel strips that were divided among VRMA treatment and the uniform -rate manure application (URMA) treatment. Experimental results showed that VRMA did not reduce the amount of manure applied, while slightly increased yield, compared to URMA. Manure consumption in the VRMA treatment generally depended on the fertilisation prescription, nitrogen (N):P2O5 ratio in manure, measured P2O5 in manure, and the proportion of rich, medium, and poor P areas in a field.

AB  - BACKGROUND Pork is an important food for humans and improving the quality of pork is closely related to human health. This study was designed to investigate the effects of balanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-supplemented protein-restricted diets on meat quality, muscle fiber types, and intramuscular fat (IMF) in finishing pigs. RESULTS The results showed that, compared with the normal protein diet (160 g kg(-1) crude protein), the reduced-protein diet (120 g kg(-1) crude protein) supplemented with BCAAs to the ratio of 2:1:2 not only had higher average daily gain (P < 0.05) and carcass weight (P < 0.05) but also improved meat tenderness and juiciness by decreasing shear force (P < 0.05) and increasing water-holding capacity (P < 0.05). In particular, this treatment showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (P-ACC) and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma), and lower (P < 0.05) levels of P-adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (P-AMPK), increasing the composition of IMF and MyHC I (P < 0.05) in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM). In terms of health, this group increased eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (P < 0.01) and desirable hypocholesterolemic fatty acids (DHFA) (P < 0.05), and decreased atherogenicity (AI) (P < 0.01) and hypercholesterolemic saturated fatty acids (HSFA) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest a novel role for a balanced BCAA-supplemented restricted protein (RP) diet in the epigenetic regulation of more tender and healthier pork by increasing IMF deposition and fiber type conversion, providing a cross-regulatory molecular basis for revealing the nutritional regulation network of meat quality.

AB  - Chromosomal instability (CIN) is common in solid tumours and fuels evolutionary adaptation and poor prognosis by increasing intratumour heterogeneity. Systematic characterization of driver events in the TRACERx non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort identified that genetic alterations in six genes, including FAT1, result in homologous recombination (HR) repair deficiencies and CIN. Using orthogonal genetic and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that FAT1 alterations are positively selected before genome doubling and associated with HR deficiency. FAT1 ablation causes persistent replication stress, an elevated mitotic failure rate, nuclear deformation and elevated structural CIN, including chromosome translocations and radial chromosomes. FAT1 loss contributes to whole-genome doubling (a form of numerical CIN) through the dysregulation of YAP1. Co-depletion of YAP1 partially rescues numerical CIN caused by FAT1 loss but does not relieve HR deficiencies, nor structural CIN. Importantly, overexpression of constitutively active YAP15SA is sufficient to induce numerical CIN. Taken together, we show that FAT1 loss in NSCLC attenuates HR and exacerbates CIN through two distinct downstream mechanisms, leading to increased tumour heterogeneity.

AB  - Hypoxia is a state in which the body or a specific part of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level. Sojourners involved in different activities at high altitudes (> 2500 m) face hypobaric hypoxia (HH) due to low oxygen in the atmosphere. HH is an example of generalized hypoxia, where the homeostasis of the entire body of an organism is affected and results in neurochemical changes. It is known that lower O-2 levels affect catecholamines (CA), severely impairing cognitive and locomotor behavior. However, there is less evidence on the effect of HH-mediated alteration in brain Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels and its role in neurobehavioral impairments. Hence, this study aimed to shed light on the effect of acute HH on CA and BH4 levels with its neurobehavioral impact on Wistar rat models. After HH exposure, significant alteration of the CA levels in the discrete brain regions, viz., frontal cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum was observed. HH exposure significantly reduced spontaneous motor activity, motor coordination, and spatial memory. The present study suggests that the HH-induced behavioral changes might be related to the alteration of the expression pattern of CA and BH4-related genes and proteins in different rat brain regions. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the role of BH4 and CA in HH-induced neurobehavioral impairments.

AB  - The pulmonary endothelium is a dynamic and metabolically active monolayer of endothelial cells. Dysfunction of the pulmonary endothelial barrier plays a crucial role in the acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), frequently observed in the context of viral pneumonia. Dysregulation of tight junction proteins can lead to the disruption of the endothelial barrier and subsequent leakage. Here, the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) served as an ideal model for studying ALI and ARDS. The alveolar lavage fluid of pigs infected with HP-PRRSV, and the supernatant of HP-PRRSV infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages were respectively collected to treat the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) in Transwell culture system to explore the mechanism of pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier leakage caused by viral infection. Cytokine screening, addition and blocking experiments revealed that proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, secreted by HP-PRRSV-infected macrophages, disrupt the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier by downregulating claudin-8 and upregulating claudin-4 synergistically. Additionally, three transcription factors interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (ILF2), general transcription factor III C subunit 2 (GTF3C2), and thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 3 (THRAP3), were identified to accumulate in the nucleus of PMVECs, regulating the transcription of claudin-8 and claudin-4. Meanwhile, the upregulation of ssc-miR-185 was found to suppress claudin-8 expression via post-transcriptional inhibition. This study not only reveals the molecular mechanisms by which HP-PRRSV infection causes endothelial barrier leakage in acute lung injury, but also provides novel insights into the function and regulation of tight junctions in vascular homeostasis.

AB  - Intrauterine inflammation is a significant cause of early preterm birth and fetal injury. There is a lack of effective interventions for intrauterine inflammation. This study aimed to determine whether direct fetal treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1RA), specifically anakinra (competitive IL-1RA) or rytvela (allosteric IL-1RA), could reduce intrauterine inflammation caused by intraamniotic injection of E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in a sheep model of pregnancy. We hypothesized the fetal intramuscular administration of IL1-RA therapy would comprehensively resolve intrauterine inflammation caused by LPS in the pregnant sheep model. Date-mated Merino ewes carrying single fetuses were randomized into four groups: LPS Group (10 mg intraamniotic LPS injection followed by saline), RYTVELA Group (10 mg LPS injection followed by 5 mg rytvela), ANAKINRA Group (LPS injection followed by 100 mg anakinra), and SALINE Group (saline injection followed by saline). All LPS-exposed fetuses had elevated bilirubin levels, leukopenia, and increased inflammatory mediators IL-1 beta, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in amniotic fluid and lung tissue. Both anakinra and rytvela treatments reduced immunocyte infiltration in chorioamniotic membranes and lungs, and microglial staining, and increased the oligodendrocyte staining, but did not significantly resolve overall inflammation compared to the SALINE Group. In conclusion, fetal intramuscular administration of anakinra and rytvela did not effectively resolve intrauterine inflammation but showed potential in reducing tissue invasion and brain injury markers. These findings suggest that modest inflammation reduction may protect against brain injury and preterm birth, though no additional benefit was observed compared to intraamniotic IL-1RA treatment.

AB  - Sleep architecture alterations, among which sleep fragmentation is highly prevalent, represent risk factors for a variety of diseases, ranging from cardiovascular to brain disorders, including anxiety. What mediates anxiety occurrence upon sleep fragmentation is still a matter of debate. We hypothesized that the sleep fragmentation effects on anxiety are dependent on its duration and mediated by increased oxidative stress and alterations in the number of parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons in the hippocampus. Sleep was fragmented in rats by the treadmill method during a period of 14 days (SF group). Rats with undisturbed sleep in the treadmill (TC group) and those receiving equal amounts of treadmill belt motion (EC group) served as controls. To assess anxiety, we subjected rats to the open field, elevated plus maze, and light-dark tests on the 0, 7(th), and 14(th) day. Upon the last test, brain structures were sampled for oxidative stress assessment and PV+ interneuron immunohistochemistry. The results of ethological tests of anxiety-linked behavior suggested duration-dependent anxiogenic potential of sleep fragmentation. Rats' anxiety-linked behavior upon sleep fragmentation significantly correlated with oxidative stress. The rats with fragmented sleep (SF) showed significantly higher oxidative stress in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex, compared to controls (TC and EC), while the antioxidant enzymes' activity was significantly decreased. No significant differences were observed in hippocampal PV+ interneurons among these groups. Our results showed that duration of sleep fragmentation is a significant determinant of anxiety-linked behavior, and these effects are mediated through oxidative distress in the brain. Herein, it is revealed that the sleep fragmentation-oxidative stress-anxiety axis contributes to our better understanding of pathophysiological processes, occurring due to disrupted sleep patterns.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a significant threat to endangered Hawaiian wildlife including birds and marine mammals. To estimate the prevalence of T. gondii in stranded cetaceans from 1997 to 2021 in Hawai'i, we tested tissues from 37 stranded spinner dolphins Stenella longirostris and 51 stranded individuals that represented 18 other cetacean species. DNA from cetacean tissue extracts were screened using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting the Toxoplasmatinae internal transcribed spacer 1 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. A positive result was obtained in 9 tissues examined for each of 2 spinner dolphins out of 525 tissue samples analyzed by PCR. The PCR-positive spinner dolphins had disseminated acute toxoplasmosis with necrosis, inflammation, and intralesional protozoal cysts and tachyzoites in multiple organs. Discrete positive immunostaining for T. gondii was observed in all tissues tested including the adrenal gland, brain, liver, and lung. Both positive spinner dolphins were negative for cetacean morbillivirus. The T. gondii genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) based on 10 genetic markers. The PCR-RFLP analysis revealed the T. gondii belonged to PCR-RFLP-ToxoDB genotype #24, previously detected in wild pig Sus scrofa in O'ahu, bobcats Lynx rufus from Mississippi, USA, and chickens Gallus gallus from Costa Rica and Brazil. These cases represent the first report of this genotype in aquatic mammals and the second and third reports of fatal disseminated T. gondii infection in stranded spinner dolphins from Hawai'i. Nearshore species, like spinner dolphins, may be at increased risk of mortality from this parasite in marine coastal waterways via sewage systems, storm water drainage, and freshwater runoff.

AB  - Bibi and Tyler analyse the morphometric variation in the skulls of 96 species across Bovidae, using 3D geometric morphometrics and ecological variables. They show that ecological variables alone appear to have little connection to shape disparity in bovid skulls, instead discovering a deeply conserved association between size and shape that is linked to dietary selection.
   The role of environmental selection in generating novel morphology is often taken for granted, and morphology is generally assumed to be adaptive. Bovids (antelopes and relatives) are widely differentiated in their dietary and climatic preferences, and presumably their cranial morphologies are the result of adaptation to different environmental pressures. In order to test these ideas, we performed 3D geometric morphometric analyses on 141 crania representing 96 bovid species in order to assess the influence of both extrinsic (e.g. diet, habitat) and intrinsic (size, modularity) factors on cranial shape. Surprisingly, we find that bovid crania are highly clumped in morphospace, with a large number of ecologically disparate species occupying a very similar range of morphology clustered around the mean shape. Differences in shape among dietary, habitat, and net primary productivity categories are largely non-significant, but we found a strong interaction between size and diet in explaining shape. We furthermore found no evidence for modularity having played a role in the generation of cranial differences across the bovid tree. Rather, the distribution of bovid cranial morphospace appears to be mainly the result of constraints imposed by a deeply conserved size-shape allometry, and dietary diversification the result of adaptation of existing allometric pathways.

AB  - The trichomes of Arabidopsis thaliana serve as accumulation sites for heavy metals such as Cd2+, and thereby both help plants cope with heavy metal stress and detoxify the soil. These trichomes are also believed to prime plant defenses against insect herbivores in response to mechanical stimulation. Because Cd2+ in such trichomes may be beneficial for plant defenses, we hypothesized that mechanical stimulation would enhance sequestration of Cd2+ in trichomes. We quantified the distribution and concentration of Cd2+ in leaves of A. thaliana, of the glabrous mutant gl1-1 of A. thaliana, and Brassica rapa L. subsp. pekinensis (Lour.) Hanelt (Chinese cabbage) and examined how these changed following mechanical stimulation of the trichomes or leaves. Light brushing or exposure to caterpillars of Spodoptera exigua led trichomes of both A. thaliana and Chinese cabbage to accumulate Cd2+ complexes more rapidly and to a higher concentration than trichomes in unstimulated controls. Comparison to responses in leaves of gl1-1 mutants suggested that this acceleration and enhancement of Cd2+ storage requires signaling through trichomes. In wild type A. thaliana, Cd2+ was found exclusively in trichomes, whereas in gl1-1 mutants, Cd2+ was found mainly in the - mesophyll cells. Results suggest a mechanobiological pathway for improving heavy metal detoxification of soils through the action of hyperaccumulator plant leaves containing non-glandular trichomes.

AB  - Force mapping of biological tissues via atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes the mechanical properties of samples within a given topography, revealing the interplay between tissue organization and nanometer-level composition. Despite considerable attention to soft biological samples, constructing elasticity maps on hard tissues is not routine for standard AFM equipment due to the difficulty of interpreting nanoindentation data in light of the available models of surface deformation. To tackle this issue, we proposed a protocol to construct elasticity maps of surfaces up to several GPa in moduli by AFM nanoindentation using standard experimental conditions (air operation, nanometrically sharp spherical tips, and cantilever stiffness below 30 N/m). We showed how to process both elastic and inelastic sample deformations simultaneously and independently and quantify the degree of elasticity of the sample to decide which regime is more suitable for moduli calculation. Afterwards, we used the frequency distributions of Young's moduli to quantitatively assess differences between sample regions different for structure and composition, and to evaluate the presence of mechanical inhomogeneities. We tested our method on histological sections of sheep cortical bone, measuring the mechanical response of different osseous districts, and mapped the surface down to the single collagen fibril level.

AB  - Frequent occurrence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) causes huge economic losses in the pig industry. Accelerated catch-up growth (CUG) in the early stage of life could restore multiple adverse outcomes of IUGR offspring; however, there is little knowledge about this beneficial phenomenon. We previously found that nutrient absorption related to intestinal function was globally promoted in CUG-IUGR piglets before weaning, which might be the dominant reason for CUG, but what this alteration could lead to in subsequent liver metabolism is still unknown. Firstly, a Normal, CUG, and non-catch-up growth (NCUG) piglet model before weaning was established by dividing eighty litters of newborn piglets into normal birth weight (NBW) and IUGR groups according to birth weight, and those piglets with IUGR but above-average weanling body weight were considered CUG, and the piglets with IUGR still below average body weight were considered NCUG at weaning day (d 26). Liver samples were collected and then systematically compared in glycolipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, antioxidant status, and inflammatory status among these three different growth models. Enhanced hepatic uptake of fatty acids, diminished de novo synthesis of fatty acids, and increased oxidation of fatty acids were observed in CUG livers compared to Normal and NCUG. In contrast, the NCUG liver showed enhanced glucose uptake and gluconeogenesis compared to Normal and CUG. We also observed deteriorating hepatic vacuolation in NCUG piglets, while increasing hepatic lipid deposition in CUG piglets. Besides, the expression of genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism and biogenesis was reduced in CUG piglets and the phosphorylation level of AMPK was significantly higher compared to Normal (p < 0.05). Moreover, NCUG liver showed decreased T-AOC (p < 0.01) and GSH-PX (p < 0.05), increased MDA concentrations (p < 0.01), upregulated phosphorylation levels of ERK and NF-kappa B (p < 0.05), and elevated pro-inflammatory factors IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05) compared to Normal. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between glucose metabolism and inflammatory factors, while a negative correlation between mitochondrial function-related genes and fatty acid transport. NGUG piglets showed simultaneous enhancement of glucose uptake and gluconeogenesis, as well as reduced antioxidant capacity and increased inflammatory status, whereas CUG comes at the expense of impaired hepatic mitochondrial function and pathological fat accumulation.

AB  - The MYB4 transcription factor family regulates plant traits. However, their overexpression often results in undesirable side effects like growth reduction. We have reported a green tea (Camellia sinensis) MYB4 transcription factor (CsMYB4) that represses the phenylpropanoid and shikimate pathways and stunts plant growth and development. In the current study, we observed that in CsMYB4a transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants, primary metabolism was altered, including sugar and amino acid metabolism, which demonstrated a pleiotropic regulation by CsMYB4a. The CsMYB4a transgenic tobacco plants had improved drought tolerance, which correlated to alterations in carbohydrate metabolism and an increase in proline content, as revealed by metabolic profiling and transcriptomic analysis. To mitigate the undesirable repressive side effects on plant traits, including dwarfism, shrunken leaves, and shorter roots of CsMYB4a transgenic plants, we deleted the C4 domain of CsMYB4a to obtain a CsMYB4a-DC4 variant and then overexpressed it in transgenic plants (CsMYB4a-DC4). These CsMYB4a-DC4 plants displayed a normal growth and had improved drought tolerance. Metabolite analysis demonstrated that the contents of carbohydrates and proline were increased in these transgenic plants. Our findings suggest that an approriate modification of TFs can generate novel crop traits, thus providing potential agricultural benefits and expanding its application to various crops.

AB  - Candida albicans is an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, and its drug resistance is becoming a serious problem. Camellia sinensis seed saponins showed inhibitory effects on resistant Candida albicans strains, but the active components and mechanisms are unclear. In this study, the effects and mechanisms of two Camellia sinensis seed saponin monomers, theasaponin E1 (TE1) and assamsaponin A (ASA), on a resistant Candida albicans strain (ATCC 10231) were explored. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of TE1 and ASA were equivalent. The time-kill curves showed that the fungicidal efficiency of ASA was higher than that of TE1. TE1 and ASA significantly increased the cell membrane permeability and disrupted the cell membrane integrity of C. albicans cells, probably by interacting with membrane-bound sterols. Moreover, TE1 and ASA induced the accumulation of intracellular ROS and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes were concentrated in the cell wall, plasma membrane, glycolysis, and ergosterol synthesis pathways. In conclusion, the antifungal mechanisms of TE1 and ASA included the interference with the biosynthesis of ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, damage to the mitochondria, and the regulation of energy metabolism and lipid metabolism. Tea seed saponins have the potential to be novel anti-Candida albicans agents.

AB  - Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disease characterized by the typical symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and congestion. Higenamine (HG) is a plant-based alkaloid, possesses a wide range of activities, including vascular and tracheal relaxation, antioxidative, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. So far, the effect and the underlying mechanism of HG on AR have not been studied.
   Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of HG on AR and investigate its underlying mechanism.
   Methods: The effects of HG on AR were evaluated in an ovalbumin-induced AR mouse model. Network pharmacology-based methods such as target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, pathway analysis, and molecular docking were used to identify the likely HG targets. Finally, we validated the mechanism of action of HG through its effects on these targets in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs).
   Results: Oral administration of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg HG significantly alleviated rubbing and sneezing in AR mice and attenuated histopathological changes in the lung and nasal tissues. Additionally, HG reduced the levels of IgE, histamine, and IL-4 in the serum of AR mice, and regulated imbalance in Th1/Th2 cells. Using network pharmacology-based methods, we identified 29 HG targets related to AR. These targets are mainly involved in the PD-L1, relaxin, estrogen, HIF-1, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, T cell receptor, and the Th17 cell differentiation signaling pathways. Molecular docking showed that HG may well be suited to the receptor binding pockets of key target AKT1, EGFR, c-Jun, NOS2, and JAK2. In HNEpCs, HG inhibited the histamine-induced mRNA expression and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, as well as the expression of MUC5AC and the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B. Moreover, HG affected the changes of AKT1, EGFR, c-Jun, iNOS, and JAK2 induced by histamine.
   Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that HG may alleviate AR by activating AKT1 and suppressing the EGFR/JAK2/c-JUN signaling. HG, therefore, has great potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of AR.

AB  - Gene-edited animals are crucial for addressing fundamental questions in biology and medicine and hold promise for practical applications. In light of the rapid advancement of gene editing technologies over the past decade, a dramatically increased number of gene-edited animals have been generated. Genome editing at off-target sites can, however, introduce genomic variations, potentially leading to unintended functional consequences in these animals. So, there is an urgent need to systematically collect and collate these variations in gene-edited animals to aid data mining and integrative in-depth analyses. However, existing databases are currently insufficient to meet this need. Here, we present the Variation Database of Gene-Edited animals (VDGE, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge), the first open-access repository to present genomic variations and annotations in gene-edited animals, with a particular focus on larger animals such as monkeys. At present, VDGE houses 151 on-target mutations from 210 samples, and 115,710 variations identified from 107 gene-edited and wild-type animal trios through unified and standardized analysis and concurrently provides comprehensive annotation details for each variation, thus facilitating the assessment of their functional consequences and promoting mechanistic studies and practical applications for gene-edited animals.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, acts at the ionotropic GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors, and the metabotropic GABA(B) receptor. This chapter summarizes the studies that have investigated the role of the GABA(B) receptor in stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety and mood disorders. Overall, clinical and preclinical evidences strongly suggest that the GABA(B) receptor is a therapeutic candidate for depression and anxiety disorders. However, the clinical development of GABA(B) receptor-based drugs to treat these disorders has been hampered by their potential side-effects, particularly those of agonists. Nevertheless, the discovery of novel GABA(B) receptor allosteric modulators, and increasing understanding of the influence of specific intracellular GABA(B) receptor-associated proteins on GABAB receptor activity, may now pave the way towards GABA(B) receptor therapeutics in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Aim. To analyze the diversity of bat viruses in Russia and neighboring countries. To identify the main vectors of these pathogens and possible ways of introduction into the territory of the Russian Federation. In Russia the RNA sequences of 36 Coronaviridae, 8 Rhabdoviridae and 3 Astroviridae have been obtained from bats. In neighboring countries, RNA/DNA sequences of viruses in bats have been found in Norway (2), Finland 14), Poland 42), Ukraine (8), Georgia (46), Kazakhstan (29), China (5.645) and Japan (109). The dsequences which have been discovered belong to 30 families (Table 1). An increase in the number of sequences obtained over the past year has been observed in Russia and China. The absolute majority of sequences belong to the Coronaviridae family (62.96 %). The available data on bat viruses in Russia indicate the need to develop and implement a state interdisciplinary programme dedicated to this problem. The greatest danger is posed by Rhabdoviridae: mortalities after infection have been recorded in Russia. The data obtained also indicate that the main vectors of viruses are representatives of the genera Eptesicus, Myotis, Nyctalus, Rhinolophus and Vespertilio. The risk of virus exchange and transmission is most likely to be between the western part of Russia and European countries.

AB  - Susumu Ohno proposed that the gene content of the mammalian X Chromosome should remain highly conserved due to dosage compensation. X Chromosome linkage (gene order) conservation is widespread in placental mammals but does not fall within the scope of Ohno's prediction and may be an indirect result of selection on gene content or selection against rearrangements that might disrupt X-Chromosome inactivation (XCI). Previous comparisons between the human and mouse X Chromosome sequences have suggested that although single-copy X Chromosome genes are conserved between species, most ampliconic genes were independently acquired. To better understand the evolutionary and functional constraints on X-linked gene content and linkage conservation in placental mammals, we aligned a new, high-quality, long read X Chromosome reference assembly from the domestic cat (incorporating 19.3 Mb of targeted BAC clone sequence) to the pig, human, and mouse assemblies. A comprehensive analysis of annotated X-linked orthologs in public databases demonstrated that the majority of ampliconic gene families were present on the ancestral placental X Chromosome. We generated a domestic cat Hi-C contact map from an F1 domestic cat/Asian leopard cat hybrid and demonstrated the formation of the bipartite structure found in primate and rodent inactivated X Chromosomes. Conservation of gene order and recombination patterns is attributable to strong selective constraints on three-dimensional genomic architecture necessary for superloop formation. Species with rearranged X Chromosomes retain the ancestral order and relative spacing of loci critical for superloop formation during XCI, with compensatory inversions evolving to maintain these long-range physical interactions.

AB  - Regenerative medicine approaches to restore the mandibular condyle of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may fill an unmet patient need. In this study, a method to implant an acellular regenerative TMJ prosthesis was developed for orthotopic implantation in a pilot goat study. The scaffold incorporated a porous, polycaprolactone-hydroxyapatite (PCL-HAp, 20wt% HAp) 3D printed condyle with a cartilage-matrix-containing hydrogel. A series of material characterizations was used to determine the structure, fluid transport, and mechanical properties of 3D printed PCL-HAp. To promote marrow uptake for cell seeding, a scaffold pore size of 152 & PLUSMN; 68 & mu;m resulted in a whole blood transport initial velocity of 3.7 & PLUSMN; 1.2 mm & BULL;s(-1) transported to the full 1 cm height. The Young's modulus of PCL was increased by 67% with the addition of HAp, resulting in a stiffness of 269 & PLUSMN; 20 MPa for etched PCL-HAp. In addition, the bending modulus increased by 2.06-fold with the addition of HAp to 470 MPa for PCL-HAp. The prosthesis design with an integrated hydrogel was compared with unoperated contralateral control and no-hydrogel group in a goat model for 6 months. A guide was used to make the condylectomy cut, and the TMJ disc was preserved. MicroCT assessment of bone suggested variable tissue responses with some regions of bone growth and loss, although more loss may have been exhibited by the hydrogel group than the no-hydrogel group. A benchtop load transmission test suggested that the prosthesis was not shielding load to the underlying bone. Although variable, signs of neocartilage formation were exhibited by Alcian blue and collagen II staining on the anterior, functional surface of the condyle. Overall, this study demonstrated signs of functional TMJ restoration with an acellular prosthesis. There were apparent limitations to continuous, reproducible bone formation, and stratified zonal cartilage regeneration. Future work may refine the prosthesis design for a regenerative TMJ prosthesis amenable to clinical translation.
   Impact statementThe impact of this study is its translational approach to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) tissue engineering. Specifically, inspiration from the only FDA-approved custom TMJ prosthesis (TMJ Concepts/Stryker) was uniquely infused into an acellular design for a biphasic device to be an "off-the-shelf" approach to regenerate the mandibular condyle. Such a prosthesis would offer an alternative for TMJ patients with condylar fractures or with pediatric reconstruction needs, where current alloplastic devices may be limited. The current study was a pilot study, and helped to identify limitations in the design and to thus inform future work.

AB  - The surface of magnesium alloy was laser-processed, and the laser-etched morphology was determined as grooves by observing the surface morphology of sheep rib bone. The wettability of different morphologies was investigated by contact angle test. Through the cell adhesion test, the effects of different morphologies on cell adhesion, growth and migration were investigated. Results show that the wetting angle of the block-shaped surface is smaller than that of the groove-shaped surface, and block-shaped surface has better hydrophilicity. Compared with the smooth surface, the block-shaped surface has better cell adhesion, and the depressions and bumps are full of cells, suggesting that the micropatterns prepared by the laser processing are conducive to the enhancement of biocompatibility.

AB  - Non-indigenous bryozoans are frequent components of biofouling assemblages in harbour environments worldwide. We performed a survey of artificial hard substrates in six harbours spanning 16 degrees of latitude along the coast of Argentina, from Ingeniero White (38 degrees 47 ' S) to Ushuaia (54 degrees 48 ' S). Microeciella argentina n. sp., distributed in warm-temperate waters of northern Patagonia and Buenos Aires Province, is described. The non-indigenous species (NIS) Callopora dumerilii, Smittoidea spinigera and Stephanollona boreopacifica are recorded here for the first time in the Southwest Atlantic. Their occurrence in fouling assemblages of warm-temperate harbours and their previous absence in these areas suggest that they probably arrived in Argentina by international shipping traffic. Callopora dumerilii is native to Europe and the northeast Atlantic. Smittoidea spinigera and Stephanollona boreopacifica are native to China and Korea, respectively. The morphological differences between S. spinigera and the Californian species S. prolifera, which is invading European harbours in the North Sea, are discussed. Bugula neritina, Bugulina flabellata, Cryptosula pallasiana and Fenestrulina delicia, common in harbours of Buenos Aires Province, are here recorded in Patagonia, highlighting the importance of regional shipping traffic to secondary spread of NIS. Arachnidium fibrosum, Buskia socialis, Anguinella palmata, Aetea cultrata, Bicellariella edentata and Exochella moyanoi, previously known from Brazil, and Hippothoa divaricata, are here recorded in Argentina. This study shows that warm-temperate harbours in Buenos Aires Province and northern Patagonia are particularly prone to the introduction of non-indigenous bryozoans.

AB  - Background: The hemispheric contributions toward interoception, the perception of internal bodily cues, and emotion recognition remains unclear. Semantic dementia cases with either left-dominant (i.e., left-SD) or rightdominant (i.e., right-SD) anterior temporal lobe atrophy experience emotion recognition difficulties, however, little is known about interoception in these syndromes. Here, we hypothesised that right-SD would show worse interoception and emotion recognition due to right-dominant atrophy.Methods: Thirty-five participants (8 left-SD; 6 right-SD; 21 controls) completed a monitoring task. Participants pressed a button when they: (1) felt their heartbeat, without pulse measurement (Interoception); or (2) heard a recorded heartbeat (Exteroception-control). Simultaneous ECG was recorded. Accuracy was calculated by comparing the event frequency (i.e., heartbeat or sound) to response frequency. Emotion recognition was assessed via the Facial Affect Selection Task. Voxel-based morphometry analyses identified neural correlates of interoception and emotion recognition.Results: Right-SD showed worse interoception than controls and left-SD (both p's < 0.001). Both patient groups showed worse emotion recognition than controls (right-SD: p < .001; left-SD: p = .018), and right-SD showed worse emotion recognition than left-SD (p = .003). Regression analyses revealed that worse emotion recognition was predicted by right-SD (p = .002), left-SD (p = .005), and impaired interoception (p = .004). Interoception and emotion were associated with the integrity of right-lateralised structures including the insula, temporal pole, thalamus, superior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus.Conclusion: Our study provides the first evidence for impaired interoception in right-SD, suggesting that impaired emotion recognition in this syndrome is driven by inaccurate internal monitoring. Further we identified a common neurobiological basis for interoception and emotion in the right hemisphere.

AB  - The study is devoted to the effect of lowered resuscitation temperature (26 degrees C) on cryopreserved porcine adrenal glands functional activity in vitro and in vivo under xenotransplantation. The adrenals were collected from newborn pigs, cryopreserved with 5 % DMSO at a rate of 1 degrees C/min, resuscitated at 26 or 37 degrees C for 48 h (5 % CO2, DMEM), embedded into small intestinal submucosa, and transplanted to bilaterally adrenalectomized rats. It has been shown that the glands resuscitated at 26 degrees C have suppressed free-radical processes and can produce cortisol and aldosterone in vitro, and may lead to elevated blood levels of these hormones. Moreover, the adrenal grafts maintain blood glucose levels and promote the formation of glycogen stores. Thus, the resuscitation at 26 degrees C can improve the quality of grafts and favor the introduction and application of the cryopreserved organs and tissues for transplantation in clinical and experimental practice.

AB  - Intestinal development is compromised in low birth weight (LBW) pigs, negatively impacting their growth, health, and resilience. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the altered intestinal maturation observed in neonatal and juvenile LBW female piglets by comparing the changes in intestinal morphology, gene expression, and methylation in LBW versus normal birth weight (NBW) female piglets. A total of 16 LBW/NBW sibling pairs were sacrificed at 0 hours, 8 hours, 10 days, and 8 weeks of age. The gastrointestinal tract was weighed, measured, and the small intestine was sampled for histomorphology, gene expression, and methylation analyses. Impaired intestinal development, with shorter villi and shallower crypts, was observed in LBW female piglets. The expression of intestinal development markers (ALPI and OLFM) rapidly peaked after birth in NBW but not in LBW female piglets. The lower expression of genes involved in nutrient digestion (ANPEP and SI) and barrier function (OCLN and CLDN4) in LBW, together with their delayed development of intestinal villi and crypts could help to explain the compromised health and growth potential of LBW female piglets. The changes in methylation observed in LBW in key regulators of intestinal development (OLFM4 and FZD5) suggest long-term effects of BW on intestinal gene expression, development, and function. Accordingly, experimental demethylation induced in IPEC-J2 cells led to increased expression of intestinal genes (MGA, DPP4, and GLUT2). Overall, we have identified the alterations in transcription or epigenetic marking at a number of genes critical to intestinal development, which may contribute to both the short- and long-term failure of LBW female piglets to thrive.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is an oilseed plant valued for its low water and fertilizer needs, environmental adaptability, and rich fatty acid contents. In this study, genetic diversity among 16 camelina doubled haploid lines and the Soheil and Sepehr varieties was assessed using 15 inter-primer binding site (IPBS) retrotransposon primers to investigate their molecular characteristics. Fresh leaf samples were collected for DNA extraction using Dellaporta's method, followed by quantification and quality assessment using a NanoDrop and agarose gel electrophoresis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with IPBS retrotransposon primers. Amplified DNA fragments were separated via electrophoresis on an agarose gel and visualized under UV light. The study evaluated genetic variation among 18 doubled haploid lines of camelina using 15 IPBS retrotransposon primers, of which 14 produced scorable bands ranging from 200 to 5000 bp. A total of 325 bands were generated, with 83 showing polymorphism, resulting in an average polymorphism percentage of 25.41%. Primers IPBS (2076) and IPBS (2237) were the most effective, each yielding 10 polymorphic bands and high polymorphic information content (PIC) values of 0.30. The Jaccard genetic similarity matrix indicated moderate genetic diversity among the lines, with similarity values ranging from 0.4 to 0.9. Cluster analysis categorized the lines into four distinct groups, while principal coordinates analysis revealed that the first two components explained 78.99% of the total variation, corroborating the clustering results. Overall, the findings highlight the utility of IPBS markers in assessing genetic diversity in camelina lines, demonstrating their potential for future breeding programs. The scatter diagram generated from the principal coordinate analysis depicted the lines grouped into five clusters, showing some consistency with the cluster analysis results. The IPBS marker seems to be a suitable tool for assessing genetic diversity in camelina. The observed genetic diversity provides valuable insights for camelina breeding programs focused on developing cultivars with desirable traits.

AB  - Apolipoprotein E (APOE) has garnered significant attention as one of the most influential genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the pathogenic role of APOE4 in sporadic AD has been extensively studied, research on the protective effects of the APOE2 genotype and its underlying mechanisms remains limited. Additionally, the existence of sex differences in the protective effects of ApoE2 continues to be a topic of debate. In this study, we utilized humanized ApoE2- and ApoE3- target replacement mice to examine the sex-specific effects of ApoE2 on cognition. Compared with female ApoE3 mice, we found significantly lower spatial cognitive ability and impaired hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure in aged female ApoE2 mice, accompanied by reduced insulin signaling of the hippocampus. Further analyses by target metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that female ApoE2 mice exhibit an age-related decline in hippocampal inositol levels, and that alterations in inositol levels lower insulin signaling. Importantly, inositol supplementation was found to alleviate peripheral glucose intolerance, enhance insulin signaling, and ultimately improve cognitive function. Interestingly, these differences were not observed between male ApoE2 and ApoE3 mice. The research findings not only provide new insights into the impact of ApoE2 on cognition but also offer a new strategy for cognitive improvement through inositol supplementation in older women.

AB  - The maximum running speed of legged animals is one evident factor for evolutionary selection-for predators and prey. Therefore, it has been studied across the entire size range of animals, from the smallest mites to the largest elephants, and even beyond to extinct dinosaurs. A recent analysis of the relation between animal mass (size) and maximum running speed showed that there seems to be an optimal range of body masses in which the highest terrestrial running speeds occur. However, the conclusion drawn from that analysis-namely, that maximum speed is limited by the fatigue of white muscle fibres in the acceleration of the body mass to some theoretically possible maximum speed-was based on coarse reasoning on metabolic grounds, which neglected important biomechanical factors and basic muscle-metabolic parameters. Here, we propose a generic biomechanical model to investigate the allometry of the maximum speed of legged running. The model incorporates biomechanically important concepts: the ground reaction force being counteracted by air drag, the leg with its gearing of both a muscle into a leg length change and the muscle into the ground reaction force, as well as the maximum muscle contraction velocity, which includes muscle-tendon dynamics, and the muscle inertia-with all of them scaling with body mass. Put together, these concepts' characteristics and their interactions provide a mechanistic explanation for the allometry of maximum legged running speed. This accompanies the offering of an explanation for the empirically found, overall maximum in speed: In animals bigger than a cheetah or pronghorn, the time that any leg-extending muscle needs to settle, starting from being isometric at about midstance, at the concentric contraction speed required for running at highest speeds becomes too long to be attainable within the time period of a leg moving from midstance to lift-off. Based on our biomechanical model, we, thus, suggest considering the overall speed maximum to indicate muscle inertia being functionally significant in animal locomotion. Furthermore, the model renders possible insights into biological design principles such as differences in the leg concept between cats and spiders, and the relevance of multi-leg (mammals: four, insects: six, spiders: eight) body designs and emerging gaits. Moreover, we expose a completely new consideration regarding the muscles' metabolic energy consumption, both during acceleration to maximum speed and in steady-state locomotion.

AB  - The present study evaluates chemically the soil after an application of treated wastewater originated through anaerobic digestion of dairy cattle wastewater in the cultivar Pennisetum purpureum (BRS Capia & ccedil;u). Developed in an experimental field at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation - Embrapa Gado de Leite located in Coronel Pacheco/MG - from November 2017 to July 2018. The applications were performed by applying different doses of treated wastewater in slides of 0, 24, 48, and 72 mm cycle(-1). For each experimental plot, soil collections were executed in two different layers (0-20 and 40-60 cm) and their characterisations were made before and after the applications. The use of treated wastewater proved to be efficient for fertigation of capia & ccedil;u grass since it provided, in the root zone of the plant, an increase in essential nutrients for its growth. The leaching of the analysed metals was not observed, and the 72 mm cycle(-1) slide was determined as the best disposal dose of the effluent in the soil since it was able to increase the crops height, dry and green mass.

AB  - Background: Lead (Pb) is one of the most hazardous pollutants that induce a wide spectrum of neurological changes such as learning and memory deficits. Sesamin, a phytonutrient of the lignan class, exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective properties. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of sesamin against Pb-induced learning and memory deficits, disruption of hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms, inflammatory response, inhibition of blood 8-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (8-ALA-D) ac-tivity, Pb accumulation, and neuronal loss in rats.Methods: Sesamin treatment (30 mg/kg/day; P.O.) was started simultaneously with Pb acetate exposure (500 ppm in standard drinking water) in rats, and they continued for eight consecutive weeks.Results: The results showed that chronic exposure to Pb disrupted the learning and memory functions in both passive-avoidance and water-maze tests, which was accompanied by increase in spectral theta power and theta/ gamma ratio, and a decrease in spectral gamma power in the hippocampus. Additionally, Pb exposure resulted in an enhanced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) content, decreased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production, inhibited blood 8-ALA-D activity, increased Pb accumulation, and neuronal loss of rats. In contrast, sesamin treatment improved all the above-mentioned Pb-induced pathological changes.Conclusion: This data suggests that sesamin could improve Pb-induced learning and memory deficits, possibly through amelioration of hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms, modulation of inflammatory status, restoration of the blood 8-ALA-D activity, reduction of Pb accumulation in the blood and the brain tissues, and prevention of neuronal loss.

AB  - Inhalation of exogenous Ti-containing nanoparticles (NPs) can have adverse effects on human health. However, few studies have considered industrial emissions, which contribute significantly to atmospheric levels of Ti-containing NPs. In this study, we quantified Ti-containing NP emissions in samples of fine particulate matter (particle sizes: 40-120 nm) collected from 132 full-scale industrial plants. Coal-fired power plants emitted the highest particle number concentrations of Ti-containing NPs (1.7 x 1010 particles per g), followed by solid waste incineration (7.7 x 109 particles per g) and blast furnace pig iron steelmaking (5.5 x 109 particles per g); coking plants and iron-ore sintering were also significant contributors to Ti-containing NPs emissions. Collectively, these five sources accounted for 99.9% of the annual atmospheric emissions of Ti-containing NPs from 13 industrial sectors in China (total approximate to 9.8 x 1022 particles). Moreover, these industrial emissions increased the atmospheric concentration of Ti-containing NPs by 1.7 x 107 particles per m3, therefore leading to the general population's lifetime average daily dose (LADD) of inhaled Ti-containing NPs being 2.4 x 106 particles per day per kg. The findings presented herein highlight the importance of assessing NP emissions and advancing sustainable global industrial development.
   Our study presents an atmospheric inventory of Ti-containing NPs from industrial sources, highlighting environmental risks and informing strategies for pollution control and public health protection.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of gamma,n-irradiation of the mouse head on the brain cells damage, behavior, and cognition and to examine the possibility of using lactoferrin (LF) to alleviate radiation-induced impairments.
   Materials and methods. Mouse heads were irradiated in a beam of neutrons and gamma rays from the IR-8 nuclear reactor. The brain cells of control and irradiated mice were isolated using Percoll. Neurons and resting and activated microglial cells were analyzed using the fluorescently labeled antibodies and flow cytometry. The level of DNA double-strand breaks in neurons was determined by gamma H2AX histone content. Cytokine gene expression in the hippocampus was studied by RT-PCR. Behavior and cognitive functions were studied using the open field, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. LF was isolated from female colostrum by preparative ion-exchange chromatography and purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose.
   Results. gamma,n-Irradiation of the mouse head at a dose of 1.5 Gy led to an increase in the level of DNA double-strand breaks in neurons. Twenty-four hours after irradiation the total number of cells and the number of neurons in the isolated fraction of brain cells decreased, but the number of microglial cells remained unchanged. The number of resting and activated microglia did not change within 3-72 h after gamma,n-irradiation. The expression level of the TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 genes increased 2 months after gamma,n-irradiation of the mouse head at a dose of 1.5 Gy, indicating the development of neuroinflammation. At this time, irradiated mice demonstrated the anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial and episodic memory. A single i.p. administration of human LF to mice immediately after gamma,n-irradiation of the head did not affect the observed radiation-induced disturbances, but decreased the gene expression levels of TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the gene expression level of TGF beta anti-inflammatory cytokine in the hippocampus 2 months after radiation exposure. The obtained results indicate a partial decrease in the level of hippocampal neuroinflammation of irradiated animals treated with LF.
   Conclusions. gamma,n-Irradiation of the mouse head at a dose of 1.5 Gy leads to DNA damage of neurons and the decrease in the number of neurons. Microglia cells are more resistant to such radiation exposure. Late after head-only gamma,n-irradiation, mice develop neuroinflammation, which is detected by an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the hippocampus and also by anxiety-like behavior and impaired cognitive functions. A single LF administration leads to a partial decrease in the neuroinflammation level, but does not affect the other studied parameters. The optimal dosing regimen of LF remains to be determined to preserve cognitive functions after gamma,n-irradiation of the brain.

AB  - Stress is a major factor that threatens the body's homeostasis or well-being. Excessive stress causes psychological anxiety and tension, which disrupts the balance of the autonomic nervous system that maintains the body's balance, resulting in hormonal imbalance and brain changes. In this study, we investigated the effects of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) extract on depression, neurobehavior, and hippocampal changes in model mice exposed to stress. Using an excessive restraint stress-induced depression model, we measured the behavioral changes and the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and antioxidant genes in five groups: control, stress, low-dose W. somniferous extract (20 mg/kg/day), high-dose W. somniferous extract (40 mg/kg/day), and L-theanine (50 mg/kg/day, positive control). Stressed mice showed poorer performance in the open field and elevated plus maze tests compared with the control group. The impaired performance was restored following W. somniferous extract administration. In addition, W. somniferous extract restored the decreased expression of BDNF in the hippocampus caused by restraint stress, improved the balance of stress hormones (i.e., cortisol, dopamine, and norepinephrine), and also regulated BDNF, inflammatory genes, and antioxidant genes in brain tissue. Therefore, W. somniferous extract can induce antidepressant and anti-stress effects by maintaining brain BDNF expression and preventing hippocampal tissue alterations caused by restraint stress.

AB  - Campylobacter spp. resistant to fluoroquinolones and macrolides are serious public health threats. Studies aiming to identify risk factors for drug-resistant Campylobacter have narrowly focused on antimicrobial use at the farm level. Using chain graphs, we quantified risk factors for fluoroquinolones- and macrolide-resistance in Campylobacter coli isolated from two distinctive swine production systems, conventional and antibiotic-free (ABF). The chain graphs were learned using genotypic and antimicrobial susceptibility data from 1082 isolates and host exposures obtained through surveys for 14 cohorts of pigs. The gyrA T86I point mutation alone explained at least 58% of the variance in ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ABF and 79% in conventional farms. For macrolides, genotype and host exposures explained similar variance in azithromycin and erythromycin MIC. Among host exposures, heavy metal exposures were identified as risk factors in both conventional and ABF. Chain graph models can generate insights into the complex epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance by characterizing context-specific risk factors and facilitating causal discovery.

AB  - To assess stress experienced during Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay, we analyzed fingernail Cortisol (CORT) and Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels and ratios in mothers and preterm infants (PI); compared hormones levels/ratio (CORT and DHEA) in kangaroo care (KC) versus standard care (SC) groups and examined relationships between PI hormone levels total days spent in the NICU. Mothers and their infants were recruited in the NICU, included levels I-IV and kangaroo care unit, within one week of infant birth in hospitals in Brazil. At 3 months after birth, mothers provided 3-month growth clippings from all ten digits of their own and their infants' fingernails. CORT and DHEA were measured using enzyme immunoassays (mothers) and high-performance-liquid-chromatography-with-mass-spectrometry (infants). Sample: n = 59 mothers (KC = 30/SC = 29) and 63 infants (KC = 32/SC = 31). Data were analyzed using non-parametric/parametric comparative statistics. NICU stay ranged from 3-103 days. For mothers in Kangaroo and Standard Care the CORT, DHEA levels and DHEA:CORT ratio (DC) ratio did not differ. Infants in KC had higher DHEA (p = 0.003) and a higher DC ratio (p = 0.011) than SC infants. Even though KC infants stayed in the NICU for a greater number of days than infants in SC, they had higher mean level of DHEA, and DC ratio, suggesting that KC played a role in promoting their stress regulatory capacities and may mitigate toxic effects of chronic hypercortisolemia. However, for mothers, KC did not reduce chronic stress compared to that in women in the SC condition. Further research warranted.

AB  - Chemerin participates in the regulation of processes related to physiological and disorder mechanisms in mammals, including metabolism, obesity, inflammation, and reproduction. In this study, we have investigated chemerin influence on alternative mRNA transcription within the porcine luteal cell transcriptome, such as differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (DELs) and their interactions with differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differences in alternative splicing of transcripts (DASs), and allele-specific expression (ASEs) related to the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) frequency. Luteal cells were collected from gilts during the mid-luteal phase of the oestrous cycle. After in vitro culture of cells un-/treated with chemerin, the total RNA was isolated and sequenced using the high-throughput method. The in silico analyses revealed 24 DELs cis interacting with 6 DEGs and trans-correlated with 300 DEGs, 137 DASs events, and 18 ASEs. The results enabled us to analyse metabolic and signalling pathways in detail, providing new insights into the effects of chemerin on the corpus luteum functions related to inflammatory response, leukocyte infiltration, the occurrence of luteotropic and luteolytic signals (leading to apoptosis and/or necroptosis). Validation of the results using qPCR confirmed the predicted expression changes. Chemerin at physiological concentrations significantly modifies the transcription processes in the porcine luteal cells.

AB  - Membrane permeability is an in vitro parameter that represents the apparent permeability (Papp) of a compound, and is a key absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion parameter in drug development. Although the Caco-2 cell lines are the most used cell lines to measure Papp, other cell lines, such as the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), LLC-Pig Kidney 1 (LLC-PK1), and Ralph Russ Canine Kidney (RRCK) cell lines, can also be used to estimate Papp. Therefore, constructing in silico models for Papp estimation using the MDCK, LLC-PK1, and RRCK cell lines requires collecting extensive amounts of in vitro Papp data. An open database offers extensive measurements of various compounds covering a vast chemical space; however, concerns were reported on the use of data published in open databases without the appropriate accuracy and quality checks. Ensuring the quality of datasets for training in silico models is critical because artificial intelligence (AI, including deep learning) was used to develop models to predict various pharmacokinetic properties, and data quality affects the performance of these models. Hence, careful curation of the collected data is imperative. Herein, we developed a new workflow that supports automatic curation of Papp data measured in the MDCK, LLC-PK1, and RRCK cell lines collected from ChEMBL using KNIME. The workflow consisted of four main phases. Data were extracted from ChEMBL and filtered to identify the target protocols. A total of 1661 high-quality entries were retained after checking 436 articles. The workflow is freely available, can be updated, and has high reusability. Our study provides a novel approach for data quality analysis and accelerates the development of helpful in silico models for effective drug discovery. Scientific Contribution: The cost of building highly accurate predictive models can be significantly reduced by automating the collection of reliable measurement data. Our tool reduces the time and effort required for data collection and will enable researchers to focus on constructing high-performance in silico models for other types of analysis. To the best of our knowledge, no such tool is available in the literature.

AB  - Improvement of yield characteristics in animal breeding is important in terms of increasing animal production and sustainability. Fertility is one of the most important yield traits affecting economic gain in sheep breeding. Anti-M & uuml;llerian Hormone (AMH) is widely recognised as a dependable biomarker for assessing ovarian reserves and fertility potential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of AMH during different phases of the sexual cycle in Norduz ewes the non-breeding season. Additionally, the study sought to assess the effects of age and body condition score (BCS) on AMH concentrations during these phases. A total of 32 Norduz ewes with a body condition score (BCS) of 3-4.5 and aged between 2 and 4 years were used as animal material in the study. All experimental procedures were carried out outside the breeding season and when the ewes were lactating. In all ewes in anestrus, intravaginal sponges (Esponjavet, 60 mg MAP, Hipra, Turkey) were kept in the vagina for 7 days for estrus synchronisation. Intramuscular injections of PMSG (Oviser, 500 IU, Hipra, Turkey) and PGF2 alpha analog (Gestavet, 50 mu g, Hipra, Turkey) were administered 48 h prior to sponge removal. Twenty-four hours after sponge removal, ewes were exposed to the ram for estrus detection. Since 5 ewes did not show estrus, blood samples were collected regularly from animals (n = 27) in which estrus was detected at three different stages: one just before the insertion of vaginal sponges (anestrus), another when heat was detected exposing to the ram (estrus), and the final one 10 days after estrus (diestrus). The serum samples were assessed for the levels of AMH and progesterone through the electrochemiluminessence immunoassay technique (ECLIA). The results of the analyses showed that serum AMH concentration did not vary between anestrus, estrus and diestrus phases of the sexual cycle of Norduz ewes outside the breeding season (p > 0.05). Furthermore, age and BCS had no effect on progesterone and AMH levels in different phases of the sexual cycle (p > 0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that serum AMH levels are constant at any stage of the estrus cycle. This suggests that phenotypic evaluation of ewes can be performed with a single measurement and that AMH is a reproducible and dependable biomarker that can be measured at any stage of the estrus cycle at an arbitrary time point.

AB  - In order to improve the phosphate adsorption capacity of Ca-loaded biochar at a wide range of pH values, Ca (oyster shell) was loaded as Ca(OH)(2) on the tobacco stalk biochar (Ca-BC), which was prepared by high-temperature calcination, ultrasonic treatment, and stirring impregnation method. The phosphorus removal performance of Ca-BC adsorption was studied by batch adsorption experiments, and the mechanism of Ca-BC adsorption and phosphorus removal was investigated by SEM-EDS, FTIR, and XRD. The results showed that after high-temperature calcination, oyster shells became CaO, then converted into Ca(OH)(2) in the process of stirring impregnation and had activated the pore expansion effect of biochar. According to the Langmuir model, the adsorption capacity of Ca-BC for phosphate was 88.64 mg P/g, and the adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The Ca(OH)(2) on the surface of biochar under the initial pH acidic condition preferentially neutralizes with H+ acid-base in solution, so that Ca-BC chemically precipitates with phosphate under alkaline conditions, which increases the adsorption capacity by 3-15 times compared with other Ca-loaded biochar. Ca-BC phosphate removal rate of livestock wastewater (pig and cattle farms) is 91 similar to 95%, whereas pond and domestic wastewater can be quantitatively removed. This study provides an experimental basis for efficient phosphorus removal by Ca-modified biochar and suggesting possible applications in real wastewater.

AB  - Perinatal asphyxia is a major cause of severe brain damage and death. For its prenatal identification, Doppler ultrasound has been used as a surrogate marker of fetal hypoxia. However, Doppler evaluation cannot be performed continuously. We have evaluated the performance of a miniaturized multiparametric sensor aiming to evaluate tissular oxygen and pH changes continuously in an umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) sheep model. The electrochemical sensors were inserted in fetal hindlimb skeletal muscle and electrochemical signals were recorded. Fetal hemodynamic changes and metabolic status were also monitored during the experiment. Additionally, histological assessment of the tissue surrounding the sensors was performed. Both electrochemical sensors detected the pO(2) and pH changes induced by the UCO and these changes were correlated with hemodynamic parameters as well as with pH and oxygen content in the blood. Finally, histological assessment revealed no signs of alteration on the same day of insertion. This study provides the first evidence showing the application of miniaturized multiparametric electrochemical sensors detecting changes in oxygen and pH in skeletal muscular tissue in a fetal sheep model.

AB  - Over the past two decades, opioid abuse has risen especially among women. In both sexes hippocampal neural circuits involved in associative memory formation and encoding of motivational incentives are critically important in the transition from initial drug use to drug abuse/dependence. Opioid circuits, particularly the mossy fiber pathway, are crucial for associative memory processes important for addiction. Our anatomical studies, especially those utilizing electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, have provided unique insight into sex differences in the distribution of opioid peptides and receptors in specific hippocampal circuits and how these distributions are altered following stress and oxycodone-associative learning processes. Here we review the hippocampal opioid system in rodents with respect to ovarian hormones effects and baseline sex differences then sex differences following acute and chronic stress. Next, we review sex differences in the hippocampal opioid system in unstressed and chronically stressed rats following oxycodone conditioned place preference. We show that opioid peptides and receptors are distributed within hippocampal circuits in females with elevated estrogen states in a manner that would enhance sensitivity to endogenous and exogenous opioids. Moreover, chronic stress primes the opioid system in females in a manner that would promote opioid-associative learning processes. In contrast, chronic stress has limited effects on the opioid system in males and reduces its capacity to support opioid-mediated learning processes. Interestingly, acute stress appears to prime males for opioid associative learning. On a broader scale the findings highlighted in this review have important implications in understanding sex differences in opioid drug use and abuse.

AB  - Simple Summary Adipose tissue has A vital impact on animal production efficiency. Postnatal development plays a key role in regulating adipose tissue function; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this early-life programming of adipose tissue remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of adipose tissue between newborn and twenty-one days old Laiwu piglets, which is a Chinese indigenous breed characterized with high fat content. Our findings revealed a significant change in metabolic pattern as well as transcriptional and translational control in adipose tissue during this postnatal period, providing a better understanding of the development and function regulation of adipose tissue, improving pig production efficiency.Abstract Adipose tissue plays an important role in pig production efficiency. Studies have shown that postnatal development has a vital impact on adipose tissue; however, the mechanisms behind pig adipose tissue early-life programming remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of 1-day and 21-day old Laiwu piglets. The results showed that the SAT of Laiwu piglets significantly increased from 1-day to 21-day, and transcriptome analysis showed that there were 2352 and 2596 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 1-day and 21-day SAT in male and female piglets, respectively. Expression of genes in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism such as pyruvate kinase M1/2 (PKM), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase 1 (PCK1) and amylo-alpha-1, 6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase (AGL) were significantly different between 1-day and 21-day SAT. Genes in lipid uptake, synthesis and lipolysis such as lipase E (LIPE), acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) were also differentially expressed. Functional analysis showed enrichment of DEGs in transcriptional regulation, protein metabolism and cellular signal transduction. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of these DEGs were analyzed and potential hub genes in these pathways were identified, such as transcriptional factors forkhead box O4 (FOXO4), CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD), signal kinases BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase (BUB1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), and proteostasis-related factors ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 C (UBE2C) and cathepsin D (CTSD). Moreover, we further analyzed the transcriptomes of SAT between genders and the results showed that there were 54 and 72 DEGs in 1-day and 21-day old SAT, respectively. Genes such as KDM5D and KDM6C showed gender-specific expression in 1-day and 21-day SAT. These results showed the significant changes in SAT between 1-day and 21-day in male and female Laiwu pigs, which would provide information to comprehensively understand the programming of adipose tissue early development and to regulate adipose tissue function.

AB  - Senecavirus A (SVA) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA virusThe icosahedral viral particle is composed of four structural proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4, among which VP2 is strongly involved in the antibody immune response. The virus causes vesicles on the snout and feet in pigs, which are clinically indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease. Outbreaks of SVA have been reported worldwide since 2014; however, its prevalence in Brazil remains unknown. In this study, the VP2 structural protein was produced and purified from E. coli, and recombinant VP2 (rVP2), based on the most recent Brazilian strain, was used to develop an indirect ELISA to identify antibodies against SVA in Brazilian swine herds. Sensitivity and specificity values of the rVP2 ELISA were determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis performed on 43 SVA positive and 219 negative serum samples. In addition, serum samples from pigs immunized with eight distinct Brazilian SVA inactivated strains were tested with the rVP2 ELISA. For the specificity of the assay, 17 serum samples from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) from naturally infected pigs were tested. The rVP2 ELISA was found to have 100% specificity and 74.4% sensitivity. The performance of the assay using samples collected during the SVA outbreak, had a sensitivity of 100%, and with those collected nine months after the outbreak it had a sensitivity of 73.4%. The rVP2 ELISA developed here was able to detect specific SVA antibodies in acute disease and recovered pigs, and no cross-reactivity with VSV was observed. This assay has potential as a useful tool for monitoring SVA infection and could help to improve disease diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose
   An Elephant trunk shape (ETS) radiating element is used to achieve the two covering bands of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna. These frequency bands can be controlled by the length of a slot embedded in ETS. The slot length in ETS plays a defining role in controlling the impedance bandwidth (IBW) of the MIMO antenna, and its diligent adjustment of it leads to cover the frequency range of Bluetooth and Wireless Local Area Network systems.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A new MIMO antenna is introduced in this paper in conjunction with an enhanced Wilkinson power divider feeding platform.
   Findings
   These frequency bands can be controlled by the length of a slot embedded in ETS. The slot length in ETS plays a defining role in controlling the IBW of the MIMO antenna, and its diligent adjustment leads to covering the frequency range of Bluetooth and WLAN systems.
   Originality/value
   The proposed MIMO antenna benefits from good isolation between ports for both frequency bands. The proposed MIMO antenna is constructed on FR4 substrate with a volume of 90 x 134 x 1.6 mm3.

AB  - In this paper, we cover 4 years of live fish transports that ranged from 14 to 200 h (8 days), and bioloads from 3.8 to 76.9 kg/m(3). The key ingredients for success in all trips, where virtually no mortality occurred, was atributed to (1) pre-buffering the water with sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate at 50 g/m(3) (each)-and/or ATM Alka-Haul(TM) at 25 g/m(3)-and applying additional (partial or full) doses throughout each transport, whenever the tanks were accessible; (2) pre-quenching ammonia with ATM Triage(TM) at 32 g/m(3), and applying additional (partial or full) doses throughout each transport, whenever the tanks were accessible; (3) keeping the dissolved oxygen saturation rate above 100%, ideally above 150%; (4) Keeping temperature on the lower limit of each species' tolerance range; (5) Using foam fractionators to effectively eliminate organic matter from the water and (6) Using pure sine wave inverters, which allows for a steady supply of electrical current throughout the transport. The use of a 'preventive' versus 'corrective' pH buffering philosophy is also discussed.

AB  - Smell perception plays a role in eating behavior and might be involved in the development of obesity. In fact, olfactory function is impaired in obesity and might depend on metabolic health factors. To date, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate neural processing of food-related odors in normal-weight, overweight and obese individuals. Fifty-three young and healthy participants (28.8 +/- 4.4 years, 27 female; 24 normal-weight, 10 overweight, and 19 obese) were presented with high- (chocolate, potato chips) and low-caloric (orange, cucumber) food odors during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also assessed olfactory identification ability, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, insulin resistance, and leptin levels. In brief, olfactory perception of food odors was linked to brain activity in the entorhinal and piriform cortex, and the insula, hippocampus, and amygdala. Insulin resistance was negatively related to olfactory identification. Additionally, perception of sweet versus savory odors was related to a higher brain activity in the right middle/superior frontal gyms. Finally, we found no effect of obesity status, BMI, metabolic factors, or body fat percentage on neural responses to food odors. Overall, this suggests that food odor processing might depend on factors other than body weight status or associated markers of metabolic health.

Thirty-six Bama mini-sows on day 3 of gestation and their weaned offspring piglets (28 d of age) were randomly allocated to the following treatments: (1) sows and their weaned offspring fed the basal diet (control group, Con group); (2) sows fed the basal diet with 3.50 kg/t betaine, and their weaned offspring fed the basal diet (sows betaine group, SB group); (3) sows fed the basal diet with 3.50 kg/t betaine, and their weaned offspring fed the basal diet with 2.50 kg/t betaine (sow-offspring betaine group, S-OB group). Six offspring piglets from each group were selected to collect plasma and colon samples on d 30, 60, and 90 after weaning. Compared with the Con group, the plasma levels of IgA, IgM, GSH-Px, and SOD during d 30-90 after weaning, IFN-alpha, T-AOC, and GSH on d 30 and 60 after weaning were increased, while MDA during d 30-90 after weaning was decreased in the SB and S-OB groups (p < 0.05). In addition, the plasma levels of IFN-gamma on d 60 and T-AOC on d 30 after weaning were higher in the S-OB group than those in the Con group (p < 0.05). In the colon, betaine supplementation increased plasma T-AOC, GSH, and SOD levels while decreasing MDA concentration (p < 0.05). Betaine supplementation improved the colonic protein abundances of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin in offspring and activated the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway while inhibiting the TLR4-NF-kappa B/MAPK signaling pathway on d 90 after weaning. The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that betaine supplementation altered colonic microbiota composition by increasing the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria in the SB group while decreasing proinflammatory-associated microbiota abundances (Tenericutes, Prevotella, and Parabacteroides) (p < 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that dietary betaine supplementation in sows and/or their offspring could improve offspring piglets' redox status and immune and anti-inflammatory levels and enhance the colonic barrier function by activating Nrf2/Keap1 and inhibiting TLR4-NF-kappa B/MAPK signaling pathways.

AB  - Sialyllactose (SL), one of the most abundant oligosaccharides present in porcine breast milk, has been implicated in many biological functions, including the prebiotic and immune-modulating effects. This study was conducted to investigate the influences of dietary SL supplementation on intestinal barrier functions exposure to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in a porcine model. Thirty-two pigs were assigned to four treatments, fed with basal or SL-containing (5.0 g kg(-1)) diet, and orally infused with ETEC or culture medium. SL supplementation significantly reduced the diarrhea incidence and the abundance of E. coli in feces (P < 0.05). Interestingly, SL attenuated ETEC-induced intestinal epithelium injury as indicated by the decreased serum concentrations of diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactate and reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the jejunal epithelium (P < 0.05). Moreover, SL not only elevated the abundance of the tight-junction protein ZO-1 in the duodenal and ileal epithelium but also elevated the antioxidant capacity and the number of SIgA positive cells in the jejunal epithelium upon the ETEC challenge (P < 0.05). Importantly, SL decreased the expression levels of inflammation-related genes such as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in the duodenum, and ileum upon ETEC challenge (P < 0.05). SL also significantly elevated the expression levels of two critical antioxidant genes such as the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1) in the jejunum (P < 0.05). These results suggested that SL can alleviate ETEC-induced intestinal epithelium injury, which is associated with suppressed inflammation, improved intestinal immunity, antioxidant capacity, and improved intestinal epithelial functions.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) chloride, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, impairs nerve function and is associated with neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of nerve damage caused by Cd exposure in swine. Six-week-old weaned pigs were exposed to CdCl2 (20 mg/kg) for 40 days. Subsequently, real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) were applied to validate the genes. Our results showed that Cd exposure downregulated protein expression of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and mTOR in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, whereas protein expression of AMPK, Beclin-1, LC3-II/LC3-I, ATG5 and ATG7 was upregulated. Moreover, we found that Cd exposure stimulated increased mRNA and protein levels of Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bax and decreased Bcl-2 levels to initiate apoptosis. In addition, our results revealed that Cd exposure destroyed the nerve cell structure in the cerebral cortex and reduced the number of nerve cells in the cerebellum. The severity of cerebellar injuries was higher than that in the cerebral cortex. Overall, we found that Cd led to PI3K/AKT inhibition and AMPK activation to enhance autophagy and induce apoptosis. Our research paves a pathway for mining neurodegeneration in response to Cd exposure.

AB  - Ketamine exhibits rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. As decreased myelination has been linked to depression pathology, changes in myelination may be a pivotal mechanism underlying ketamine's long-lasting antidepressant effects. Although ketamine has a long-lasting facilitating effect on myelination, the precise roles of myelination in ketamine's sustained antidepressant effects remain unknown. In this study, we employed spatial transcriptomics (ST) to examine ketamine's lasting effects in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus of mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress and identified several differentially expressed myelin-related genes. Ketamine's ability to restore impaired myelination in the brain by promoting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes was demonstrated. Moreover, we showed that inhibiting the expression of myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (Mobp) blocked ketamine's long-lasting antidepressant effects. We also illustrated that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) signaling mediated ketamine's facilitation on myelination. In addition, we found that the (R)-stereoisomer of ketamine showed stronger effects on myelination than (S)-ketamine, which may explain its longer-lasting antidepressant effects. These findings reveal novel mechanisms underlying the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine and the differences in antidepressant effects between (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine, providing new insights into the role of myelination in antidepressant mechanisms.

AB  - Depression is one of the disorders involving mental health that most affects the population worldwide. Considering the available pharmacological therapies for the treatment of depression are ineffective in most patients, the search for new alternatives is crucial. In line with this, we investigated the phenolic profile, antidepressant-like, and antioxidant effects triggered by the administration of aqueous extracts from Psidium guajava L. (GUA), Psidium cattleianum Sw. (CAT), and Psidium guineense Sabine (GUI) leaves in mice. Our results show that quercetin is the major compound of GUA and GUI, and o-coumaric acid in CAT extracts. The acute and subchronic administrations of the three plant extracts exerted an antidepressant-like effect in mice exposed to the tail suspension test, without changes on locomotor performance evaluated by the open field test. Furthermore, the GUI and CAT decreased oxidative stress markers, mainly lipid peroxidation and nitrites in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, liver, and plasma. Notably, GUA and CAT increased non-protein thiols in all tissues. Therefore, the Psidium extracts demonstrated an antidepressant-like effect in mice, and the antioxidant capacity of the extracts seems to underlie the behavioral effect.

AB  - The subtype 6 of the serotoninergic receptors (5-HT6Rs) is highly expressed in the hippocampus, and evidence indicates the beneficial effects of 5-HT6Rs blockade on short- and long-term memory in rodents. Nevertheless, the underlying functional mechanisms still need to be established. To this end, we performed electrophysiological extracellular recordings to assess the effects of the 5-HT6Rs antagonist SB-271046 on the synaptic activity and functional plasticity at the CA3/CA1 hippocampal connections of male and female mice slices. We found that basal excitatory synaptic transmission and isolated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) activation were significantly increased by SB-271046. The NMDARs-related improvement was prevented by the GABAAR antagonist bicuculline in male but not in female mice. Regarding synaptic plasticity, neither paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) nor NMDARs-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) (induced either by high-frequency or theta-burst stimulation) was affected by the 5-HT6Rs blockade. Taken together, our results indicate a sex-dependent 5-HT6Rs effect on synaptic activity at the CA3/CA1 hippocampal connections through changes in the excitation/inhibition balance.

AB  - Natural dyes, obtained from plants, insects/animals, and minerals, are renewable and sustainable bioresource products with minimum environmental impact. However, there are still many issues to solve related to natural dyes; consequently, synthetic dyes are still wildly used. Natural dyes have a low affinity towards the substrate cotton, so a solution had to be found: mordants. Mordants can also be harmful to the environment, which is why bio-mordants are used. The mordant used in this paper is chitosan. Cotton is pre-mordanted using the pad dyeing method. By using the exhaustion method, the fabric was coloured with red Camellia sinensis (tea) extracts. The colour, absorption of polyphenols and tannins, and ultraviolet protection (UPF) were tested. A comparison study was carried out between the cotton fabric and the cotton padded with chitosan at two different concentrations. The results are impressive. Cotton pre-mordanted with chitosan can absorb more polyphenols and tannins than cotton itself, and the colour fastness and UPF, once the fabric is laundered, demonstrate there is some kind of bonding between the fibre, quitosan, and active compounds from tea. The UPF was also doubled by using chitosan and the reddish colour obtained by Camellia sinensis extracts were darker on the cotton fabric. The increase in UPF protection on mordanted fabrics is higher than the gap obtained by colour difference, which means there are active compounds that do not confer colour, but enhance UPF protection.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Detarium microcarpum Guill. & Perr. is used traditionally in Far North Cameroun to treat stomach aches, anxiety, epilepsy, and other mental disorders. Aim of the study: Evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of D. microcarpum (DM) in unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model of depression in male rats and its impact on fecal enterobacteria of stressed rats. Materials and methods: Rats were handled daily (control) or subjected to the UCMS procedure for 42 days. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the light and dark box test (LBD) and the open field test (OFT). Depressive-like behaviors were assessed using the forced swimming test (FST), the sucrose preference test (SPT), and the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT). Feces were then collected, followed by blood, brain, and duodenum sections after sacrifice. Monoamine levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress factors, and nitrosative stress were assessed. Feces were introduced into Hectoen enteric agar for the identification of enterobacteria. An in vitro growth test was performed. Results: The DM ethanolic extract has significantly increased the time spent in the light box, in the LBD, and in the center area of the OFT. Moreover, the extract has significantly reduced the preference for sucrose in the SPT, the time of immobility in the FST, and the latency period to consume the pet in the NSFT. DM extract has significantly reduced serum cortisol levels. It also significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and Il1 beta in both brain and duodenum homogenate. DM has increased the brain's serotonin, GABA, and dopamine levels. The DM extract also decreased the MDA and nitrite levels. It also increased the SOD and CAT activities in both brain and duodenal homogenate. Histologically, the DM extract restored the cell's density in hippocampi sections and prevented gut inflammation and peroxidation characterizing leaky gut syndrome. DM extract has no effect on the growth of enterobacteria species isolated in vitro. Conclusion: The ethanolic extract of DM would have anxiolytic and antidepressant effects via the modulation of the HPA axis, brain antioxidant enzyme activities, inflammation, and nitrosative stress. Moreover, it could act by preventing leaky gut syndrome.

AB  - Worldwide, the need for thermal insulation materials used to increase the energy performance of buildings and ensure indoor thermal comfort is constantly growing. There are several traditional, well-known and frequently used thermal insulation materials on the building materials market, but there is a growing trend towards innovative materials based on agro-industrial waste. This paper analyses the performance of 10 such innovative thermal insulation materials obtained by recycling cellulosic and/or animal waste, using standardised testing methods. More precisely, thermal insulation materials based on the following raw materials were analysed: cellulose acetate, cigarette filter manufacturing waste; cellulose acetate, cigarette filter manufacturing waste and cigarette paper waste; cellulose acetate, waste from cigarette filter manufacturing, waste cigarette paper and waste aluminised paper; cellulose from waste paper (two types made by two independent manufacturers); wood fibres; cellulose from cardboard waste; cellulose from waste cardboard, poor processing, inhomogeneous product; rice husk waste and composite based on sheep wool, recycled PET fibres and cellulosic fibres for the textile industry. The analysis followed the performance in terms of thermal insulating quality, evidenced by the thermal conductivity coefficient (used as a measurable indicator) determined for both dry and conditioned material at 50% RH, in several density variants, simulating the subsidence under its own weight or under various possible stresses arising in use. The results showed in most cases that an increase in material density has beneficial effects by reducing the coefficient of thermal conductivity, but exceptions were also reported. In conjunction with this parameter, the analysis of the 10 types of materials also looked at their moisture sorption/desorption capacity (using as a measurable indicator the amount of water stored by the material), concluding that, although they have a capacity to regulate the humidity of the indoor air, under low RH conditions the water loss is not complete, leaving a residual quantity of material that could favour the development of mould. Therefore, the impact on indoor air quality was also analysed by assessing the risk of mould growth (using as a measurable indicator the class and performance category of the material in terms of nutrient content conducive to the growth of microorganisms) under high humidity conditions but also the resistance to the action of two commonly encountered moulds, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum. The results showed a relative resistance to the action of microbiological factors, indicating however the need for intensified biocidal treatment.

AB  - This study analyzed the effects of dietary supplementation with by-pass linseed oil (LO; rich in a-linolenic acid) on maternal antioxidant systems at Days 14 and 16 of pregnancy in Sarda ewes. This trial used sixteen dry ewes. Eight ewes (CT group) were fed with a control diet without LO, and eight ewes (LO group) were fed with a diet supplemented with LO (10.8 g of a-linolenic acid/ewe/day). Both diets had similar crude protein and energy levels. The experiment included 10 days of an adaptation period and 31 days of a supplementation period. This supplementation period was divided into Period -2 (from Day -15 to -8), Period -1 (from Day -7 to -1; before synchronized mating period/Day 0), Period +1 (from Day +1 to + 7 after mating), and Period +2 (from Day +8 to +15 after mating). Estrous synchronization was induced in all the ewes using an intravaginal sponge (45 mg fluorgestone acetate) for 14 days and equine chorionic gonadotropin (350 UI/ewe) at the end of the treatment. On Days 14 (CT, N = 4; LO, N = 4) and 16 (CT, N = 4; LO, N = 4) after mating, the ewes were slaughtered. Samples of plasma, uterine, and luteal tissues were collected. Thiols, total antioxidant activity (TEAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were measured. On Day 16, thiol and TEAC in luteal tissues were higher in the LO group when compared with the control one (p < 0.05). Moreover, TEAC was higher for the LO group in uterine tissues on Days 14 and 16 (p < 0.05). SOD activity was higher in the LO group in luteal and uterine tissues on Day 14 and Day 16, respectively (p < 0.001). On Day 16, uterine MDA content was lower for the LO group (p < 0.001). No differences were found between groups at the plasmatic level. However, the by-pass LO supplementation enhanced the analyzed antioxidant parameters in luteal and uterine tissues. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that by-pass LO supplementation exerted a positive effect on antioxidative defenses on maternal structures during the embryo-maternal recognition period in ewes. Thus, this could contribute to improving the maternal environment during the embryo-maternal recognition period in mammals.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to maternal depression and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressants both affect the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, possibly via the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT). In a community cohort, we investigated the impact of two factors that shape prenatal 5HT signaling (prenatal SRI [pSRI] exposure and child SLC6A4 genotype) on HPA activity at age 6 years. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to study associations between cortisol reactivity, pSRI exposure, and child SLC6A4 genotype, controlling for maternal depression, child age, and sex (48 pSRI exposed, 74 nonexposed). Salivary cortisol levels were obtained at five time points during a laboratory stress challenge: arrival at the laboratory, following two sequential developmental assessments, and then 20 and 40 min following the onset of a stress-inducing cognitive/social task. Cortisol decreased from arrival across both developmental assessments, and then increased across both time points following the stress challenge in both groups. pSRI-exposed children had lower cortisol levels across all time points. In a separate GEE model, we observed a lower cortisol stress response among children with LG/S alleles compared with children with La/La alleles, and this was particularly evident among children of mothers reporting greater third trimester depressed mood. Our findings suggest that pSRI exposure and a genetic factor associated with modulating 5HT signaling shaped HPA reactivity to a laboratory stress challenge at school age.

AB  - Exogenous application of zinc (Zn) and silicon (Si) might serve as potent strategy to boost productivity of oil seed crops including canola in a saline environment. A trial was conducted with an aim to determine the phenotypic divergence among canola cultivars (Sandal and Rachna) under varying doses of Zn and Si (35 ppm and 70 ppm) applied solely and in conjunction with each other under two level of salinity stress (SS). Different morphological and physiological traits of canola cultivars were taken as response variables. The results revealed that SS adversely affected the leaf pigment and shoot length along with their fresh and dry weights, while antioxidant activities were increased especially under exogenous application of Si+Zn=70 ppm. Under salinity stress conditions the root length and their fresh as well as dry weight increase as compared to the controlled plant which are grown under normal conditions without salinity stress. Moreover, canola cv. Sandal outperformed in terms for shoot-root length and their fresh and dry weight as well as the leaf pigments contents. The co-application of Si+Zn=70 ppm exhibited the highest shoot-root length (17.64 cm-16.47 cm) and their fresh (2.60 g-1.89 g) as well as dry weight (0.73 g-0.29 g). The same treatment combination resulted in the maximum leaf pigments such as chlorophyll a (6.63 g/mg FW), chlorophyll b (4.37 g/mg FW) and total carotenoids content (2.38 g/mg FW).

AB  - Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) is widespread, but controversial, in humans and improves pregnancy and live birth rates in cattle. In pigs, it presents a possible solution to improve in vitro embryo production (IVP), however, the incidence and origin of chromosomal errors remains under-explored. To address this, we used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based PGT-A algorithms in 101 in vivo-derived (IVD) and 64 IVP porcine embryos. More errors were observed in IVP vs. IVD blastocysts (79.7% vs. 13.6% p < 0.001). In IVD embryos, fewer errors were found at blastocyst stage compared to cleavage (4-cell) stage (13.6% vs. 40%, p = 0.056). One androgenetic and two parthenogenetic embryos were also identified. Triploidy was the most common error in IVD embryos (15.8%), but only observed at cleavage, not blastocyst stage, followed by whole chromosome aneuploidy (9.9%). In IVP blastocysts, 32.8% were parthenogenetic, 25.0% (hypo-)triploid, 12.5% aneuploid, and 9.4% haploid. Parthenogenetic blastocysts arose from just three out of ten sows, suggesting a possible donor effect. The high incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in general, but in IVP embryos in particular, suggests an explanation for the low success of porcine IVP. The approaches described provide a means of monitoring technical improvements and suggest future application of PGT-A might improve embryo transfer success.

AB  - Background: Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) are widely cultivated cash crops. However, fungal diseases lead to significant reductions in both the yield and quality of tea. Therefore, searching for economical, eco-friendly, and efficient biological control measures is crucial for protecting tea plants from pathogenic fungi. Methods: The confrontation assays were performed to identify the antagonistic bacteria against tea pathogenic fungi and evaluate the antifungal activity of these bacteria. Results: Here, three tea pathogenic fungi were identified: Colletotrichum siamense HT-1, Diaporthe phaseolorum HT-3, and Fusarium fujikuroi HT-4. Notably, D. phaseolorum was the first to be reported in tea plants in China. Some tea pathogenic fungi showed a high relative abundance, suggesting a potential disease risk in tea plantations. Strain GS2Y, isolated from tea rhizosphere soil, exhibited strong antifungal activity against tea pathogenic fungi and represented a novel species within the genus Burkholderia, designated as Burkholderia theae. GS2Y could directly inhibit tea pathogenic fungi by disrupting the cellular structures and protect tea plants from fungal diseases caused by C. siamense HT-1 and D. phaseolorum HT-3. Conclusions: B. theae GS2Y might function as a potentially valuable resource for biocontrol agents, laying the foundation for the development of strategies to manage fungal diseases in tea plants.

AB  - Microplastics pollute the marine environment and pose a greater risk to marine organisms. The microplastics were observed in the guts of the 12 species, which varied from 0.00 to 1.80 +/- 1.19 particles /individual. Most of the microplastics were fibre shaped, 0.5-1 mm sized, blue-coloured, and polyethylene polymers. The abundance of the microplastics was higher for benthic species (0.66 +/- 0.13 particles/ individual) than the pelagic species (0.53 +/- 0.11 particles/individual), with no significant difference (p > 0.05). According to their feeding habits and trophic level, significantly the microplastics were abundant in the herbivores (1.23 +/- 0.61 particles/individual) and quaternary consumers (0.76 +/- 0.16 particles/individual), respectively. The present study suggests that microplastic ingestion in commercially important species was influenced by their feeding habits irrespective of their habitat and length and weight. In addition to this, biomagnification of the microplastics (Trophic Magnification Factor, TMF = 1.02) was also observed in the commercially important species with increasing trophic level. This further indicates that the trophic level can serve as the pathway for the transfer of microplastics from lower trophic level organisms to higher trophic level organisms. The present study concludes that the occurrence of biomagnification of microplastics and the pollutants absorbed by them might harm the commercially important species from the Thoothukudi region.

AB  - Urinary incontinence (UI) is a prevalent condition that adversely affects quality of life, driving the need for innovative technologies for continuous bladder monitoring. In this study, we introduce a wrinkled metal (platinum and gold) strain sensor tailored for real-time bladder volume monitoring. This stretchable sensor is designed to provide robust and reliable performance for 5000 cycles with minimal hysteresis, and its mechanical properties match that of bladder tissue, enabling accurate monitoring during bladder filling and emptying. Our experimental results demonstrate that the sensor offers high sensitivity and stability, with a dynamic range of up to 230% strain, Young's modulus of 11.7-32 kPa, and a gauge factor (GF) of 2.9-4.7. The sensor's efficacy was validated through in vitro bladder phantom studies and ex vivo pig bladder experiments, where it consistently tracked bladder volume changes with a sensitivity of 4.60 mL-1. The results suggest that the strain sensor is a promising candidate for robust, biocompatible bladder volume monitoring in patients with urinary disorders, offering an alternative to traditional methods by being more comfortable and biocompatible.

AB  - Controlling pipeline intelligent plugging robots (PIPRs) to execute rapid and precise deceleration braking within a designated distance is pivotal for enhancing the efficiency of oil-and-gas pipeline maintenance and repair operations. Therefore, for a PIPR that relies on friction braking between the rubber cylinder and pipe wall, a hydraulic control system for deceleration braking is designed to achieve rapid and precise deceleration braking, and an experimental setup is established to verify its feasibility. Concurrently, a joint simulation model of constant deceleration nonlinear dynamics based on the fuzzy Proportion Integration Differentiation (PID) algorithm is proposed to elucidate the effects of key parameters, such as the initial velocity and braking distance, on the stability of the dynamic control of the robot during deceleration braking. The results show that the designed hydraulic control system effectively achieves deceleration braking. The regulation time increases as the initial speed of the robot decreases. The error of the deceleration braking distance ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 m, with reduced positioning and steady-state errors. Under varying deceleration braking distances, the maximum acceleration overshoot is-3.54 m/s2, and increasing the deceleration braking distance effectively reduces the positioning error. This study offers theoretical and empirical support for investigating PIPRs.

AB  - Plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms allow neural networks to maintain proper function while responding to physiological challenges. Despite previous work investigating morphological and synaptic effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most prevalent growth factor in the central nervous system, how exposure to BDNF manifests at the network level remains unknown. Here we report that BDNF treatment affects rodent hippocampal network dynamics during development and recovery from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in culture. Importantly, these effects are not obvious when traditional activity metrics are used, so we delve more deeply into network organization, functional analyses, and in silico simulations. We demonstrate that BDNF partially restores homeostasis by promoting recovery of weak and medium connections after injury. Imaging and computational analyses suggest these effects are caused by changes to inhibitory neurons and connections. From our in silico simulations, we find that BDNF remodels the network by indirectly strengthening weak excitatory synapses after injury. Ultimately, our findings may explain the difficulties encountered in preclinical and clinical trials with BDNF and also offer information for future trials to consider.
   A study uses MEA analysis, computation, and simulations to demonstrate how BDNF treatment after excitotoxic injury remodels hippocampal networks by promoting inhibitory neuron survival while indirectly strengthening weak excitatory synapses.

AB  - The hydrophobic epicuticle wax on fresh leaves of tea tree (Camellia sinensis (L.) 0. Kuntze) leads to the loss of pesticide droplets, reducing efficacy. In this study, four adjuvants were selected to improve the diffusion and adhesion of bifenthrin droplets on the surface of tea leaves at different growth stages. The coupling effect of bifenthrin and adjuvants on the time-dependent and concentration-dependent wettability of droplets was investigated, and the difference in the wettability between bud and leaf was explained by observing the surface morphology. It was found that adjuvants effectively reduced the contact angle of droplets and accelerated the diffusion speed, and the above phenomenon became obvious with the increase in the adjuvant concentration. The wetting promotion of young leaves was more significant due to the reduced epicuticle wax and the greater roughness compared with fresh buds. The surface tension of the pesticide mixture was negatively correlated with the cosine of contact angle after adding the four adjuvants regardless of the growth stage of tea leaves. The contact angle of 0.2% Silwet L-77 decreased to 0 degrees within 10 s, but the extreme wettability led to the decrease in adhesion with the increase in concentration. However, the wettability and adhesion on the surface of tea leaves were simultaneously suitable with more than 0.1% nonionic surfactant. The minimum concentration of the optimal adjuvant proposed in this study can provide an experimental basis and guide more efficient plant protection in tea gardens.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) causes maternal mortality, and has a high disability rate. In recent years, studies have suggested the Sirt1 gene to be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Resveratrol (RSV), an activator of Sirt1, has been investigated in depressive behavior. However, its effect on PPD remains to be thoroughly elucidated.Methods: We employed a mice model with bilateral oophorectomy combined with hormone-simulated pregnancy to assess postpartum depression-like behavior. The behavioral tests were performed 2 days after the withdrawal of estradiol benzoate. RSV was administered subcutaneously to the PPD model mice. Several behavioral tests were executed, including the open field test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test. Western blot ana-lyses and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate protein expression levels of SIRT1, autophagy markers, and the AKT/mTOR. Results: Postpartum depressive-like behavior was triggered following the withdrawal of estradiol benzoate after hormone-stimulated-pregnancy. RSV improved postpartum depressive-like behavior of mice via its upregulation of the SIRT1 and autophagy markers, such as Beclin1, ATG5 and LC3B. Also, the downregulation of the p62 protein expression was observed. More importantly, we also detected the inhibition of phosphorylated AKT and mTOR in the hippocampus of postpartum depressive-like mice.Conclusion: RSV could alleviate postpartum depression-like behavior in mice by stimulating the SIRT1, induce autophagy and inhibit the AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - People report wanting food when they are hungry, and on eating it they typically report liking the experience. After eating, both wanting and liking decline, but wanting declines to a greater extent, which we term the 'affective discrepancy effect'. In this study we examine the predictors - state, sensory and memory-based - of these affective changes. Hungry participants undertook three tasks: (1) written recollections of what certain foods are like to eat; (2) ratings of wanting and expected flavour liking and fillingness when looking at snacks, and ratings of food and flavour liking when eating them; (3) ratings of bodily state. These tasks were then repeated after lunch. State-based changes in food liking were best predicted by changes in flavour liking. For state-based change in wanting, memory-based information about flavour liking and fillingness from tasks (1) and (2) were all significant predictors. For recollections about eating (task 1), mentions of food fillingness significantly increased pre-to post-lunch and this was the best predictor of the affective discrepancy effect. Recollections of food fillingness are state-dependent, and can arise unbidden (i.e., such recollective content was unprompted). This may reflect one way that memory may selectively influence wanting, and hence whether food intake is initiated or not.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of caffeic acid (CA) on behavioral learning and memory tasks in the diabetic state. We also evaluated the effect of this phenolic acid on the enzymatic activities of acetylcholinesterase, ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, ecto-5-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase as well as on the density of M1R, alpha 7nAChR, P2 x7R, A1R, A2AR, and inflammatory parameters in the cortex and hippocampus of diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal dose of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). The animals were divided into six groups: control/vehicle; control/CA 10 and 50 mg/kg; diabetic/vehicle; diabetic/CA 10 and 50 mg/kg, treated by gavage. The results showed that CA improved learning and memory deficits in diabetic rats. Also, CA reversed the increase in acetylcholinesterase and adenosine deaminase activities and reduced ATP and ADP hydrolysis. Moreover, CA increased the density of M1R, alpha 7nAChR, and A1R receptors and reversed the increase in P2 x7R and A2AR density in both evaluated structures. In addition, CA treatment attenuated the increase in NLRP3, caspase 1, and interleukin 1 beta density in the diabetic state; moreover, it increased the density of interleukin-10 in the diabetic/CA 10 mg/kg group. The results indicated that CA treatment positively modified the activities of cholinergic and purinergic enzymes and the density of receptors, and improved the inflammatory parameters of diabetic animals. Thus, the outcomes suggest that this phenolic acid could improve the cognitive deficit linked to cholinergic and purinergic signaling in the diabetic state.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent decades, neurogenesis in the adult brain has been well demonstrated in a number of animal species, including humans. Interestingly, work with rodents has shown that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is vital for some cognitive aspects, as increasing neurogenesis improves memory, while its disruption triggers the opposite effect. Adult neurogenesis declines with age and has been suggested to play a role in impaired progressive learning and memory loss seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, therapeutic strategies designed to boost adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be beneficial for the treatment of AD. The precursor forms of neurotrophins, such as pro-NGF, display remarkable increase during AD in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In contrast to mature NGF, pro-NGF exerts adverse functions in survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Hence, we hypothesized that pro-NGF and its p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) contribute to disrupting adult hippocampal neurogenesis during AD. To test this hypothesis, in this study, we took advantage of the availability of mouse models of AD (APP/PS1), which display memory impairment, and AD human samples to address the role of pro-NGF/p75NTR signaling in different aspects of adult neurogenesis. First, we observed that DG doublecortin (DCX) + progenitors express p75NTR both, in healthy humans and control animals, although the percentage of DCX+ cells are significantly reduced in AD. Interestingly, the expression of p75NTR in these progenitors is significantly decreased in AD conditions compared to controls. In order to assess the contribution of the pro-NGF/p75NTR pathway to the memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice, we injected pro-NGF neutralizing antibodies (anti-proNGF) into the DG of control and APP/PS1 mice and animals are subjected to a Morris water maze test. Intriguingly, we observed that anti-pro-NGF significantly restored memory performance of APP/PS1 animals and significantly increase the percentage of DCX+ progenitors in the DG region of these animals. In summary, our results suggest that pro-NGF is involved in disrupting spatial memory in AD, at least in part by blocking adult neurogenesis. Moreover, we propose that adult neurogenesis alteration should be taken into consideration for better understanding of AD pathology. Additionally, we provide a new molecular entry point (pro-NGF/p75NTR signaling) as a promising therapeutic target in AD.

AB  - Minerals are required for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and regulation of fetal growth in mammals. Lentiviral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) of chorionic somatomammotropin hormone (CSH) results in both an intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and a non-IUGR phenotype in sheep. This study determined the effects of CSH RNAi on the concentration and uptake of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D, and the expression of candidate mRNAs known to mediate mineral signaling in caruncles (maternal component of placentome) and cotyledons (fetal component of placentome) on gestational day 132. CSH RNAi Non-IUGR pregnancies had a lower umbilical vein-umbilical artery calcium gradient (p < 0.05) and less cotyledonary calcium (p < 0.05) and phosphate (p < 0.05) compared to Control RNAi pregnancies. CSH RNAi IUGR pregnancies had less umbilical calcium uptake (p < 0.05), lower uterine arterial and venous concentrations of 25(OH)D (p < 0.05), and trends for lower umbilical 25(OH)D uptake (p = 0.059) compared to Control RNAi pregnancies. Furthermore, CSH RNAi IUGR pregnancies had decreased umbilical uptake of calcium (p < 0.05), less uterine venous 25(OH)D (vitamin D metabolite; p = 0.055), lower caruncular expression of SLC20A2 (sodium-dependent phosphate transporter; p < 0.05) mRNA, and lower cotyledonary expression of KL (klotho; p < 0.01), FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; p < 0.05), FGFR2 (p < 0.05), and TRPV6 (transient receptor potential vanilloid member 6; p < 0.05) mRNAs compared to CSH RNAi Non-IUGR pregnancies. This study has provided novel insights into the regulatory role of CSH for calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D utilization in late gestation.

AB  - Antibiotic resistant Enterococcus faecium isolated from the diarrheic sheep were subjected to antibacterial activity of plant essential oils and their fractions. The fraction with least minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was subjected to cytotoxicity and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. Primarily, biochemically characterized isolates were confirmed by PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene followed by nucleotide sequencing and accession numbers received were MW332526.1, MW332527.1, MW332528.1 and MW332529.1. These isolates were screened for antibiotic resistance to a variety of antibiotic classes and recorded as resistant to all the tested antibiotics. Antibacterial activity of plant essential oils (n=05) was checked against three selected antibiotic resistant E. faecium isolates. Activity of Eucalyptus globulus was highest (13.00 +/- 1.3 mm) and among the fractions of E. globulus, n-hexane plus chloroform depicted a higher mean zone of inhibition (13.45 +/- 1.11mm) with least MIC (25.28 +/- 7.41 mg/mL) which differed significantly (P<0.05) with other fractions tested. Cell survival percentage was 58.60 at 112.10 mg/mL concentration. GCMS analysis revealed that the highest percentage (14.4%) was of Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol,1,7,7-trimethyl. It was concluded that E. globulus fraction n-hexane plus chloroform showed significantly (P<0.05) better results as compared to other (n=08) E. globulus solvent fractions for treatment of antibiotic resistant cases of diarrhea in sheep caused by E. faecium.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly, and is becoming one of the most expensive and deadly diseases. Deficiency of neurotrophic factors signaling is an important cause of this disease. Therefore, we investigated whether neuritin as a neurotrophic factor can have a neuroprotective effect against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD. The animals were bilaterally injected with intra hippocampal-STZ (3 mg/ kg). Different concentrations of neuritin (0.5, 1, 1.5 mu g/rat) were administrated 15 min before STZ injection. After 14 days, the rats were evaluated for cognitive performance using novel object recognition (NOR), open field and Morris water maze (MWM) tests and then sacrificed for biochemical analysis (by real-time PCR and western blot examinations). The results demonstrated that the STZ-induced learning and memory impairments were significantly prevented by 1.5 mu g neuritin. Moreover, the increased levels of inflammatory factors (NF-kappa b, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) and apoptotic parameters (cytochrome c and caspase-3) in STZ-treated rats were also significantly decreased by neuritin. In addition, hippocampal neuritin gene expression was downregulated by STZ injection, which was reversed by intra hippocampal neuritin injection. In conclusion, the present study suggests that neuritin prevents cognitive defects in AD rat model and its expression level is associated with cognitive resilience.

AB  - Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate 'vectorized' forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection, and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.

AB  - Introduction Recent advances in computational neuroscience highlight the significance of prefrontal cortical meta-control mechanisms in facilitating flexible and adaptive human behavior. In addition, hippocampal function, particularly mental simulation capacity, proves essential in this adaptive process. Rooted from these neuroscientific insights, we present Meta-Dyna, a novel neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning architecture that demonstrates rapid adaptation to environmental dynamics whilst managing variable goal states and state-transition uncertainties.Methods This architectural framework implements prefrontal meta-control mechanisms integrated with hippocampal replay function, which in turn optimized task performance with limited experiences. We evaluated this approach through comprehensive experimental simulations across three distinct paradigms: the two-stage Markov decision task, which frequently serves in human learning and decision-making research; stochastic GridWorldLoCA, an established benchmark suite for model-based reinforcement learning; and a stochastic Atari Pong variant incorporating multiple goals under uncertainty.Results Experimental results demonstrate Meta-Dyna's superior performance compared with baseline reinforcement learning algorithms across multiple metrics: average reward, choice optimality, and a number of trials for success.Discussions These findings advance our understanding of computational reinforcement learning whilst contributing to the development of brain-inspired learning agents capable of flexible, goal-directed behavior within dynamic environments.

AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are significant contributors to postweaning diarrhea in piglets. Of the ETEC causing diarrhea, K88 and F18 accounted for 92.7%. Despite the prevalence of ETEC K88 and F18, there is currently no effective vaccine available due to the diversity of these strains. This study presents an innovative approach by isolating chicken-derived single-chain variable fragment antibodies (scFvs) specific to K88 and F18 fimbrial antigens from chickens immunized against these ETEC virulence factors. These scFvs effectively inhibited adhesion of K88 and F18 to porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), with the inhibitory effect demonstrating a dose-dependent increase. Furthermore, a bispecific scFv was designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris. This engineered construct displayed remarkable potency; at a concentration of 25.08 mu g, it significantly reduced the adhesion rate of ETEC strains to IPEC-J2 cells by 72.10% and 69.11% when challenged with either K88 or F18 alone. Even in the presence of both antigens, the adhesion rate was notably decreased by 57.92%. By targeting and impeding the initial adhesion step of ETEC pathogenesis, this antibody-based intervention holds promise as a potential alternative to antibiotics, thereby mitigating the risks associated with antibiotic resistance and residual drug contamination in livestock production. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for the development of innovative treatments against ETEC infections in piglets.

AB  - Ovarian follicular development is a critical determinant of reproductive performance in litter bearing species like pigs, wherein economic gains depend on litter size. The study aimed to gain insight into the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and signalling pathways regulating follicular growth and maturation in Ghoongroo pigs. Transcriptome profiling of porcine small follicles (SF) and large follicles (LF) was conducted using NovaSeq600 sequencing platform and DEGs were identified using DESeq2 with threshold of Padj. < 0.05 and log2 fold change cut off 0.58 (LF vs. SF). Functional annotations and bioinformatics analysis of DEGs were performed to find out biological functions, signalling pathways and hub genes regulating follicular dynamics. Transcriptome analysis revealed 709 and 479 genes unique to SF and LF stages, respectively, and 11,993 co-expressed genes in both the groups. In total, 507 DEGs (284 upregulated and 223 downregulated) were identified, which encoded for diverse proteins including transcription factors (TFs). These DEGs were functionally linked to response to stimulus, lipid metabolic process, developmental process, extracellular matrix organisation along with the immune system process, indicating wide-ranging mechanisms associated with follicular transition. The enriched KEGG pathways in LF stage consisted of ovarian steroidogenesis, cholesterol and retinol metabolism, cell adhesion molecules, cytokine receptor interaction and immune signalling pathways, depicting intra-follicular control of varied ovarian function. The hub gene analysis revealed APOE, SCARB1, MMP9, CYP17A1, TYROBP as key regulators of follicular development. This study identified candidate genes and TFs providing steroidogenic advantage to LFs which makes them fit for selection into the ovulatory pool of follicles.

AB  - The foetal bovine serum (FBS) concentration could influence functional parameters of IPEC-J2 cells. IPEC-J2 is a non-transformed continuous epithelial cell line that represents an established in vitro model to study porcine gut inflammation and alterations of intestinal integrity. This cell line also represents a good translational model thanks to the high similitudes between pig and human gastrointestinal tract. With the aim to assess if the FBS-dependent functional variations are linked to the bioenergetic aspects, the addition of 5% and 10% FBS in the IPEC-J2 culture medium were tested. Doubling time and TEER measurement indicated that cells cultured at higher FBS dose grow faster and as a more compact monolayer. 10% FBS increases ATP production and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and does not affect glycolysis. Both at 5% and 10% FBS ATP production mainly comes from OxPhos and FBS concentration does not affect the cell respiration bioenergetic parameters. Noteworthy, IPEC-J2 treated with 5% and 10% FBS have a metabolic potential since both OxPhos and glycolysis increase by > 100% and < 50%, respectively in comparison with baseline metabolism. Moreover, glucose, fatty acids and glutamine constitute the preferred metabolic fuel for mitochondrial respiration at both FBS conditions tested. Accordingly, the cells flexibility to oxidize these substrates shows that IPEC-J2 mitochondria cannot maintain the basal ATP production without oxidizing all the substrates available irrespective of FBS concentration. To sum up, in IPEC-J2 cells OxPhos increases with the FBS-stimulated functional physiological parameters to fulfil ATP requirements.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is the third largest cause of overdose-related deaths in the United States. Research investigating therapeutic targets for cocaine reward processes is key to combating this issue. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has been shown to reduce cocaine reward processes, though specific mechanisms are not understood. This study examines the effect of intra-dorsal hippocampal (DH) OXT on the expression of cocaine context associations using a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. In this paradigm, one of two visually distinct chambers is paired with a drug. With repeated pairings, control animals display preference for the drugassociated context by spending more time in that context at test. In the present study, four conditioning days took place where male and female rats were injected with either cocaine or saline and placed into the corresponding chamber. On test day, rats received infusions of OXT or saline (VEH) into the DH and were allowed access to both chambers. The results show that while VEH-infused rats displayed cocaine CPP, OXT-infused rats did not prefer the cocaine-paired chamber. These findings implicate the DH as necessary in the mechanism by which OXT acts to block the expression of cocaine-context associations, providing insight into how OXT may exert its therapeutic effect in cocaine reward processes.

AB  - Mental arithmetic involves distributed brain regions spanning parietal and temporal cortices, yet little is known about the neural dynamics of causal functional circuits that link them. Here we use high-temporal resolution (1000 Hz sampling rate) intracranial EEG from 35 participants, 362 electrodes, and 1727 electrode pairs, to investigate dynamic causal circuits linking posterior parietal cortex (PPC) with ventral temporal-occipital cortex and hippocampal regions which constitute the perceptual, visuospatial, and mnemonic building blocks of mental arithmetic. Nonlinear phase transfer entropy measures capable of capturing information flow identified dorsal PPC as a causal inflow hub during mental arithmetic, with strong causal influences from fusiform gyrus in ventral temporal-occipital cortex as well as the hippocampus. Net causal inflow into dorsal PPC was significantly higher during mental arithmetic, compared to both resting-state and verbal memory recall. Our analysis also revealed functional heterogeneity of casual signaling in the PPC, with greater net causal inflow into the dorsal PCC, compared to ventral PPC. Additionally, the strength of causal influences was significantly higher on dorsal, compared to ventral, PPC from the hippocampus, and ventral temporal-occipital cortex during mental arithmetic, when compared to both resting-state and verbal memory recall. Our findings provide novel insights into dynamic neural circuits and hubs underlying numerical problem solving and reveal neurophysiological circuit mechanisms by which both the visual number form processing and declarative memory systems dynamically engage the PPC during mental arithmetic.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases associated with memory disturbances are important health issues occurring due to a prolonged life span. This article presents the results of a study targeting the emergence of a drug candidate with antiamnesic properties. The effect of berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the overground parts of Berberis sibirica Pall., on memory and expression of parvalbumin in the mouse hippocampus proper were determined. High-purity BBR was isolated by centrifugal partition chromatography from a methanolic extract from B. sibirica by using a methyl-tert-butyl ether and water (1:1 v/v) solvent system with 10 mmol/L of triethylamine and hydrochloric acid. In an in vivo study, we assessed the influence of the chronic administration of BBR on different stages of memory-related responses in mice. Our results indicated that the chronic administration of BBR in a higher dose (5 mg/kg) improves long-term memory acquisition in mice, as determined in the passive avoidance test. The hippocampal CA1-CA3 fields showed an increased number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons (PV-IR) and nerve fibers as compared to the control. No significant changes in the dentate gyrus were observed between the groups. The HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis of the biological material revealed the content of BBR as 363.4 +/- 15.0 ng (4.11% of RSD) per brain, 15.06 +/- 0.89 ng (5.91% of RSD) per hippocampus, and 54.45 +/- 1.40 (4.05% of RSD) ng in 100 mu L plasma. The study showed that BBR could be a factor influencing the expression of PV in hippocampal neurons. We speculate that BBR may modulate the level of Ca2+ in neurons and thus potentially act as a neuroprotective factor against neuronal damages.
