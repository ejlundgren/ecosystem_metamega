AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share several common pathophysiological features. Rare variants of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) increase the risk of developing AD, suggesting the involvement of TREM2 and innate immunity in AD development. It is still unknown whether TREM2 is related to cognitive impairment in T2DM. Here, we investigated the effects of the hippocampal overexpression of TREM2 on cognitive in long-term high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were maintained on HFD for 50 weeks. TREM2 was overexpressed in the hippocampus 36 weeks after HFD feeding using adeno-associated virus vector (AAV)-mediated gene delivery. The results showed that the HFD feeding induced rapid and persistent weight gain, glucose intolerance and significant impairments in teaming and memory. Compared with AAV-con, AAV-TREM2 significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment without altering body weight and glucose homeostasis in HFD mice. The overexpression of TREM2 upregulated the synaptic proteins spinophilin, PSD95 and synaptophysin, suggesting the improvement in synaptic transmission. Dendritic complexity and spine density in the CA1 region were rescued after TREM2 overexpression. Furthermore, TREM2 markedly increased the number of iba-1/Arg-1-positive microglia in the hippocampus, suppressed neuroinflammation and microglia) activation. In sum, hippocampal TREM2 plays an important role in improving HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and promoting microglia) polarization towards the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Our study also suggests that TREM2 might be a novel target for the intervention of obesity/diabetes-associated cognitive decline. Copyright (C) 2020, Chongqing Medical University.

AB  - Background: Neonates undergo numerous painful procedures throughout their hospitalization. Repeated procedural pain may cause adverse long-term effects. Glucose as a non-pharmacological analgesia, is used for neonate pain management. In this study, potential mechanism of attenuate pain induced by glucose in neurodevelopment effect of neonate pain stimulus was investigated. Methods: Neonatal rats to perform a repetitive injury model and glucose intervention model in the postnatal day 0-7(P0-7). Pain thresholds were measured by von Frey test weekly. The puberty behavioral outcome, tissue loss and protein expression in hippocampus were analyzed. Results: Oral administration of glucose after repeated pain stimulation can maintain the hippocampal structure in, and reduce the expressions of corticotropin releasing factor (CFR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), therefore, resulted in long-term threshold of pain and cognitive improvement. Conclusion: Exposure to neonatal repeated procedural pain causes persistent mechanical hypersensitivity and the dysfunction of spatial memory retention at puberty. In addition, glucose can relieve these adverse effects, possibly via decreasing CRF/GR levels to change the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

AB  - Concepts of brain function imply congruence and mutual causal influence between molecular events and neuronal activity. Decoding entangled information from concurrent molecular and electrophysiological network events demands innovative methodology bridging scales and modalities. The MEA-seqX platform, integrating high-density microelectrode arrays, spatial transcriptomics, optical imaging, and advanced computational strategies, enables the simultaneous recording and analysis of molecular and electrical network activities at mesoscale spatial resolution. Applied to a mouse hippocampal model of experience-dependent plasticity, MEA-seqX unveils massively enhanced nested dynamics between transcription and function. Graph-theoretic analysis reveals an increase in densely connected bimodal hubs, marking the first observation of coordinated hippocampal circuitry dynamics at molecular and functional levels. This platform also identifies different cell types based on their distinct bimodal profiles. Machine-learning algorithms accurately predict network-wide electrophysiological activity features from spatial gene expression, demonstrating a previously inaccessible convergence across modalities, time, and scales.

AB  - Currently, multifunction has become an essential direction of personal protective equipment (PPE), but achieving the protective effect, flexibility, physiological comfort, and intelligent application of PPE simultaneously is still a challenge. Herein, inspired by the meso-structure of rhinoceros skin, a novel strategy is proposed by compounding an ammonium sulfate ((NH4)(2)SO4) solution soaked gelatin hydrogel with the high weight fraction and vertically interwoven Kevlar fibers to manufacture a flexible and wearable composite with enhanced puncture resistance and strain-sensing properties. After (NH4)(2)SO4 solution immersion, the hydrogel's tensile strength, toughness, and fracture strain were up to 3.77 MPa, 4.26 MJ/m(3), and 305.19%, respectively, indicating superior mechanical properties. The Kevlar/hydrogel composites revealed excellent puncture resistance (quasi-static of 132.06 N and dynamic of 295.05 N), flexibility (138.13 mN/cm), and air and moisture permeability (17.83 mm/s and 2092.73 g m(-2) day(-1)), demonstrating a favorable balance between the protective effect and wearing comfort even after 7 days of environmental exposure. Meanwhile, salt solution immersion endowed the composite with excellent strain-sensing properties at various bending angles (30-90 degrees) and frequencies (0.25-1 Hz) and allowed it to monitor different human motions directly in real-time. The rhinoceros-skin-inspired Kevlar/hydrogel composites provide a simple and economical solution for antipuncture materials that combine high protective effects, a comfortable wearing experience, and good strain-sensing properties, promising multifunctional PPE in the future.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a severe neurological injury during infancy, often resulting in long-term cognitive deficits. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Edaravone (EDA), a free radical scavenger, and elucidate the potential role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mediating these effects in neonatal HIE rats. Using the Rice-Vannucci model, HIE was induced in neonatal rats, followed by immediate administration of EDA after the hypoxic-ischemic insult. To examine the role of BDNF, a separate group of rats received intrahippocampal injections of a lentiviral vector for BDNF knockdown prior to the induction of HIE and subsequent EDA treatment. Neuronal survival and apoptosis in the hippocampal region were assessed by immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining, respectively. BDNF expression levels in the hippocampus were analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y maze tests. Results demonstrated that EDA significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and death, increased neuronal survival, and enhanced BDNF expression compared to the control group. However, the therapeutic effects of EDA were mitigated in the BDNF knockdown group, indicating a crucial role of BDNF in mediating the neuroprotective effects of EDA. Behavioural testing confirmed that EDA treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory abilities in HIE rats, but these improvements were not observed in rats with BDNF knockdown. In conclusion, our study suggests that EDA treatment mitigates hippocampal neuronal death and improves cognitive dysfunction in HIE rats primarily by upregulating BDNF expression. These findings provide experimental support for the potential application of EDA in the treatment of HIE and highlight the essential role of BDNF in neuroprotection and cognitive recovery post-HIE.

AB  - Squalene is a key minor component of virgin olive oil, the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and had shown to improve the liver metabolism in rabbits and mice. The present research was carried out to find out whether this effect was conserved in a porcine model of hepatic steatohepatitis and to search for the lipidomic changes involved. The current study revealed that a 0.5% squalene supplementation to a steatotic diet for a month led to hepatic accumulation of squalene and decreased triglyceride content as well as area of hepatic lipid droplets without influencing cholesterol content or fiber areas. However, ballooning score was increased and associated with the hepatic squalene content. Of forty hepatic transcripts related to lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis, only citrate synthase and a non-coding RNA showed decreased expressions. The hepatic lipidome, assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in a platform able to analyze 467 lipids, revealed that squalene supplementation increased ceramide, Cer(36:2), and phosphatidylcholine (PC[32:01, PC[33:01 and PC[34:01) species and decreased cardiolipin, CL(69:5), and triglyceride (TG[54:21, TG[55:01 and TG[55:21) species. Plasma levels of interleukin 12p40 increased in pigs receiving the squalene diet. The latter also modified plasma lipidome by increasing TG(58:12) and decreasing non-esterified fatty acid (FA 14:0, FA 16:1 and FA 18:0) species without changes in total NEFA levels. Together this shows that squalene-induced changes in hepatic and plasma lipidomic profiles, non-coding RNA and anti-inflammatory interleukin are suggestive of an alleviation of the disease despite the increase in the ballooning score.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis continues throughout life but declines dramatically with age and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In parallel, microglia become activated resulting in chronic inflammation in the aged brain. A unique type of microglia, suggested to support neurogenesis, exists in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but little is known how they are affected by aging. We analyzed the transcriptome of aging microglia and identified a unique neuroprotective activation profile in aged SVZ microglia, which is partly shared with disease-associated microglia (DAM). CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) is characteristically expressed by brain microglia where it directs migration to targets for phagocytosis. We show that Cx3cr1 expression, as in DAM, is downregulated in old SVZ microglia and that heterozygous Cx3cr1 mice have increased proliferation and neuroblast number in the aged SVZ but not in the dentate gyrus, identifying CX3CR1 signaling as a novel age and brain region-specific regulator of neurogenesis.

AB  - Hippocampus is the brain area where aluminum (Al) accumulates in abundance and is widely associated with learning and memory. In the present study, we evaluate behavioral, tissue, and proteomic changes in the hippocampus of Wistar rats caused by exposure to doses that mimic human consumption of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in urban areas. For this, male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: Control (distilled water) and AlCl3 (8.3 mg/kg/day), both groups were exposed orally for 60 days. After the Al exposure protocol, cognitive functions were assessed by the Water maze test, followed by a collection for analysis of the global proteomic profile of the hippocampus by mass spectrometry. Aside from proteomic analysis, we performed a histological analysis of the hippocampus, to the determination of cell body density by cresyl violet staining in Cornu Ammonis fields (CA) 1 and 3, and hilus regions. Our results indicated that exposure to low doses of aluminum chloride triggered a decreased cognitive performance in learning and memory, being associated with the deregulation of proteins expression, mainly those related to the regulation of the cytoskeleton, cellular metabolism, mitochondrial activity, redox regulation, nervous system regulation, and synaptic signaling, reduced cell body density in CA1, CA3, and hilus.

TI  - Adherence to a MIND-Like Dietary Pattern, Long-Term Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter Air Pollution, and MRI-Based Measures of Brain Volume: The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study-MRI
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Previous studies suggest that certain dietary patterns and constituents may be beneficial to brain health. Airborne exposures to fine particulate matter [particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5 )] are neurotoxic, but the combined effects of dietary patterns and PM2.5 have not been investigated.
   Objectives: We examined whether previously reported association between PM2.5 exposure and lower white matter volume (WMV) differed between women whose usual diet during the last 3 months before baseline was more or less consistent with a Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND)-like diet, a dietary pattern that may slow neurodegenerative changes.
   Methods: This study included 1,302 U.S. women who were 65-79 y old and free of dementia in the period 1996-1998 (baseline). In the period 2005-2006, structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed to estimate normal-appearing brain volumes (excluding areas with evidence of small vessel ischemic disease). Baseline MIND diet scores were derived from a food frequency questionnaire. Three-year average PM2.5 exposure prior to MRI was estimated using geocoded participant addresses and a spatiotemporal model.
   Results: Average total and temporal lobe WMVs were 0.74 cm(3) [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.001, 1.48) and 0.19 cm(3) (95% CI: 0.002, 0.37) higher, respectively, with each 0.5-point increase in the MIND score and were 4.16 cm 3 (95% CI: - 6.99 , - 1.33 ) and 1.46 cm(3) (95% CI: - 2.16 , - 0.76 ) lower, respectively, with each interquartile range (IQR) (IQR = 3.22 mu g/m(3) ) increase in PM2.5 . The inverse association between PM2.5 per IQR and WMV was stronger (p-interaction < 0.001 ) among women with MIND scores below the median (for total WMV, - 12.47 cm(3) ; 95% CI: - 17.17 , - 7.78 ), but absent in women with scores above the median (0.16 cm(3) ; 95% CI: - 3.41 , 3.72), with similar patterns for WMV in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. For total cerebral and hippocampus brain volumes or WMV in the corpus callosum, the associations with PM2.5 were not significantly different for women with high MIND scores and women with low MIND scores.
   Discussion: In this cohort of U.S. women, PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower MRI-based WMV, an indication of brain aging, only among women whose usual diet was less consistent with the MIND-like dietary pattern at baseline.

AB  - Microbial infection as a type of environmental risk factors is considered to be associated with long-term increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized by two neuropathologically molecular hallmarks of hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid-beta (A beta), the latter generated by several biochemically reactive enzymes, including gamma-secretase. However, how infectious risk factors contribute to pathological development of the AD core molecules remains to be addressed. In this work, we utilized a modified herpes simplex virus type 1 (mHSV-1) and found that its hippocampal infection locally promotes A beta pathology in 5 x FAD mice, the commonly used amyloid model. Mechanistically, we identified HSV-1 membrane glycoprotein US7 (Envelope gI) that interacts with and modulates gamma-secretase and consequently facilitates A beta production. Furthermore, we presented evidence that adenovirus-associated virus-mediated locally hippocampal overexpression of the US7 aggravates A beta pathology in 5 x FAD mice. Collectively, these findings identify a herpesviral factor regulating gamma-secretase in the development and progression of AD and represent a causal molecular link between infectious pathogens and neurodegeneration.

AB  - Heart disease with attendant cardiac fibrosis kills more patients in developed countries than any other disease, including cancer. We highlight the recent literature on factors that activate and also deactivate cardiac fibroblasts. Activation of cardiac fibroblasts results in myofibroblasts phenotype which incorporates aSMA to stress fibres, express ED-A fibronectin, elevated PDGFR alpha and are hypersecretory ECM components. These cells facilitate both acute wound healing (infarct site) and chronic cardiac fibrosis. Quiescent fibroblasts are associated with normal myocardial tissue and provide relatively slow turnover of the ECM. Deactivation of activated myofibroblasts is a much less studied phenomenon. In this context, SKI is a known negative regulator of TGFb(1)/Smad signalling, and thus may share functional similarity to PPAR gamma activation. The discovery of SKI's potent anti-fibrotic role, and its ability to deactivate and/or myofibroblasts is featured and contrasted with PPAR gamma. While myofibroblasts are typically recruited from pools of potential precursor cells in a variety of organs, the importance of activation of resident cardiac fibroblasts has been recently emphasised. Myofibroblasts deposit ECM components at an elevated rate and contribute to both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with attendant cardiac fibrosis. A major knowledge gap exists as to specific proteins that may signal for fibroblast deactivation. As SKI may be a functionally pluripotent protein, we suggest that it serves as a scaffold to proteins other than R-Smads and associated Smad signal proteins, and thus its anti-fibrotic effects may extend beyond binding R-Smads. While cardiac fibrosis is causal to heart failure, the treatment of cardiac fibrosis is hampered by the lack of availability of effective pharmacological anti-fibrotic agents. The current review will provide an overview of work highlighting novel factors which cause fibroblast activation and deactivation to underscore putative therapeutic avenues for improving disease outcomes in cardiac patients with fibrosed hearts.

AB  - The hypothalamus comprises various nuclei and neuronal subpopulations that control fundamental homeostasis and behaviors. However, spatiotemporal molecular characterization of hypothalamus development in humans is largely unexplored. Here, we revealed spatiotemporal transcriptome profiles and cell-type characteristics of human hypothalamus development and illustrated the molecular diversity of neural progenitors and the cell-fate decision, which is programmed by a combination of transcription factors. Different neuronal and glial fates are sequentially produced and showed spatial developmental asynchrony. Moreover, human hypothalamic gliogenesis occurs at an earlier stage of gestation and displays distinctive transcription profiles compared with those in mouse. Notably, early oligodendrocyte cells in humans exhibit different gene patterns and interact with neuronal cells to regulate neuronal maturation by Wnt, Hippo, and integrin signals. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive molecular landscape of human hypothalamus development at early-and mid-embryonic stages and a foundation for understanding its spatial and functional complexity.

AB  - Background Circular RNA hsa_circ_0008305 (circPTK2), miR-181c-5p and High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) had a targeted regulatory relationship through bioinformatics analysis. This study explained the effects of these genes in microglia and sepsis mice. Methods Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) was used to induce inflammation cell model or sepsis mouse model, as needed. Gene levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot, as required. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay, and RNase R was used to test the stability of circPTK2. Targeting relationships between genes were analyzed using bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase assay. Morris water maze test and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) detection were conducted to analyze the effects of genes on cognitive dysfunction of mice. Results Lipopolysaccharide induction triggered the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the upregulation of HMGB1 and circPTK2, and the downregulation of miR-181c-5p in microglia. Overexpression of HMGB1 enhanced the effect of LPS, while silencing HMGB1 partially counteracted the effect of LPS. Moreover, miR-181c-5p was a target of circPTK2 and bound to HMGB1. MiR-181c-5p mimic partially reversed the functions of LPS and HMGB1 overexpression, reduced the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and HMGB1, and inhibited apoptosis. CircPTK2 knockdown had the same effect as miR-181c-5p up-regulation. In vivo, sicircPTK2 improved cognitive function, restored MMP level, inhibited apoptosis, reduced the levels of inflammatory factors and apoptotic factors, and increased the survival rate of CLP-induced mice. Conclusion Our research reveals that circPTK2 regulates microglia activation and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis induced by sepsis via miR-181c-5p-HMGB1 signaling.

AB  - The clinical presentation of cat and dog allergy vary from discomfort caused by rhinoconjuncitivitis to severe asthma. Exposure to allergens from these animals is ubiquitous and allergic sensitization to cat or dog affect up to 25% of all children and adults, but allergic sensitization does not always cause symptoms. The introduction of molecular-based allergy diagnostics has improved the possibility to characterize the allergic patient in greater detail. However, the full clinical potential of using molecular allergology in the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of patients with allergy to cats and dogs has not yet been established, although significant progress has been made during the last decade, which will be reviewed in detail in this paper.

AB  - Microglia-induced inflammatory signaling and neuronal oxidative stress are mutually reinforcing processes central to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that extracts of dried Pheretima aspergillum (Lumbricus) can inhibit tissue fibrosis, mitochondrial damage, and asthma. However, the effects of Lumbricus extracts on neuroinflammation and neuronal damage have not been previously studied. Therefore, to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Lumbricus extract for neurodegenerative diseases, the current study assessed the extract's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in BV2 microglial cultures stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) along with its neuroprotective efficacy in mouse hippocampal HT22 cell cultures treated with excess glutamate. Lumbricus extract dose-dependently inhibited the LPS-induced production of multiple proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 beta) and reversed the upregulation of proinflammatory enzymes (inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2). Lumbricus also activated the antioxidative nuclear factor erythroid 2-relayed factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway and inhibited LPS-induced activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B/mitogen-activated protein kinases/NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammatory pathway. In addition, Lumbricus extract suppressed the glutamate-induced necrotic and apoptotic death of HT22 cells, effects associated with upregulated expression of antiapoptotic proteins, downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Chromatography revealed that the Lumbricus extract contained uracil, hypoxanthine, uridine, xanthine, adenosine, inosine, and guanosine. Its effects against microglial activation and excitotoxic neuronal death reported herein support the therapeutic potential of Lumbricus for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Taxonomy and systematics are at the base of any biological research, providing the scientific names and evolutionary context to access the biological information needed. The biological control of weeds (BCW), like many other fields, often suffers from the "taxonomic impediment" generated by incomplete taxonomic knowledge or lack of available taxonomic experts on the particular taxa involved (i.e., weed plants and their potential biocontrol agents). Further, most groups with described species require revision by specialists using modern taxonomic methods. Systematists in the different taxonomic groups have the knowledge and experience to perform the accurate identification of the species involved in the study, to recognize if they are non-native species, or if they are new to science. Their expertise is crucial for identifying the organisms involved in BCW, including hybrids or cryptic species. The practice of phylogenetic systematics allows the discovery of evolutionary relationships and natural taxa that are valuable in making host range predictions. This contribution emphasizes the crucial role played by phylogenetic systematics and integrative taxonomy in weed biological control.

AB  - Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane proteins have been directly linked to neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders. We have previously shown that the LRR transmembrane protein, leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (Lrig1), is a physiological regulator of dendrite complexity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and social behavior. In this study, we performed a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate spatial memory and cognitive capabilities in Lrig1 mutant mice. The cognitive assessment demonstrated deficits in recognition and spatial memory, evaluated by novel object recognition and object location tests. Moreover, we found that Lrig1-deficient mice present specific impairments in the processing of similar but not dissimilar locations in a spatial pattern separation task, which was correlated with an enhanced dendritic growth and branching of Doublecortin-positive immature granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Altogether, these findings indicate that Lrig1 plays an essential role in controlling morphological and functional plasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - BACKGROUNDVolatile organic compounds are critical for food flavor and play important roles in plant-plant interactions and plants' communications with the environment. Tobacco is well-studied for secondary metabolism and most of the typical flavor substances in tobacco leaves are generated at the mature stage of leaf development. However, the changes in volatiles during leaf senescence are rarely studied. RESULTSThe volatile composition of tobacco leaves at different stages of senescence was characterized for the first time. Comparative volatile profiling of tobacco leaves at different stages was performed using solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In total, 45 volatile compounds were identified and quantified, including terpenoids, green leaf volatiles (GLVs), phenylpropanoids, Maillard reaction products, esters, and alkanes. Most of the volatile compounds showed differential accumulation during leaf senescence. Some terpenoids, including neophytadiene, beta-springene, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, increased significantly with the progress of leaf senescence. Hexanal and phenylacetaldehyde also showed increased accumulation in leaves during senescence. The results from gene expression profiling indicated that genes involved in metabolism of terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and GLVs were differentially expressed during leaf yellowing. CONCLUSIONDynamic changes in volatile compounds during tobacco leaf senescence are observed and the integration of gene-metabolites datasets offers important readouts for the genetic control of volatile production during the process of leaf senescence.

AB  - RAB35 is a multifunctional small GTPase that regulates endocytic recycling, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cytokinesis. However, its physiological functions in mammalian development remain unclear. Here, we generated Rab35-knockout mice and found that RAB35 is essential for early embryogenesis. Interestingly, brain-specific Rab35-knockout mice displayed severe defects in hippocampal lamination owing to impaired distribution of pyramidal neurons, although defects in cerebral cortex formation were not evident. In addition, Rab35-knockout mice exhibited defects in spatial memory and anxiety-related behaviors. Quantitative proteomics indicated that the loss of RAB35 significantly affected the levels of other RAB proteins associated with endocytic trafficking, as well as some neural cell adhesion molecules, such as contactin-2. Collectively, our findings revealed that RAB35 is required for precise neuronal distribution in the developing hippocampus by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules, thereby influencing spatial memory.
   Mice with a brain-specific knockout of the Rab35 GTPase exhibit defects in spatial memory and hippocampal lamination, outlining a key role for Rab35 in hippocampal development and function.

AB  - Compelling evidence suggests that synaptic structural plasticity, driven by remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, underlies addictive drugs-induced long-lasting behavioral plasticity. However, the signaling mechanisms leading to actin cytoskeleton remodeling remain poorly defined. DNA methylation is a critical mechanism used to control activity-dependent gene expression essential for long-lasting synaptic plasticity. Here, we provide evidence that DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a is degraded by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ube2b-mediated ubiquitination in dorsal hippocampus (DH) of rats that repeatedly self-administrated heroin. DNMT3a degradation leads to demethylation in CaMKK1 gene promotor, thereby facilitating CaMKK1 expression and consequent activation of its downstream target CaMKI alpha, an essential regulator of spinogenesis. CaMKK1/CaMKI alpha signaling regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the DH and behavioral plasticity by activation of Rac1 via acting Rac guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor beta PIX. These data suggest that Ube2b-dependent degradation of DNMT3a relieves a transcriptional brake on CaMKK1 gene and thus activates CaMKK1/CaMKI alpha/beta PIX/Rac1 cascade, leading to drug use-induced actin polymerization and behavior plasticity.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides and dysfunction of mitochondrion, which result in neuronal apoptosis and ultimately cognitive impairment. Inhibiting A beta generation and repairing mitochondrial damage are prominent strategies in AD therapeutic treatment. Luteolin, a flavonoid compound, exhibits anti-inflammatory neuroprotective properties in AD mice. However, it is still unclear whether luteolin has any effect on A beta pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, the beneficial effect and underlying mechanism of luteolin were investigated in triple transgenic AD (3 x Tg-AD) mice and primary neurons. Our study showed that luteolin supplement significantly ameliorated memory and cognitive impairment of AD mice and exerted neuroprotection by inhibiting A beta generation, repairing mitochondrial damage and reducing neuronal apoptosis. Further research revealed that luteolin could directly bind with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gama (PPAR gamma) to promote its expression and function. In the culture of hippocampus-derived primary neurons, addition of PPAR gamma antagonist GW9662 or knockdown of PPAR gamma with its siRNA could eliminate the effect of luteolin on AD pathologies. In summary, this work revealed for the first time that luteolin effectively improved cognitive deficits of 3 x Tg-AD mice and inhibited A beta-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis via PPAR.dependent mechanism. Hence, luteolin has the potential to serve as a therapeutic agent against AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness responsible for cognitive impairment and dementia. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides in neurons and synapses causes cell metabolism to unbalance, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuronal death and cognitive damage. Guanosine is an endogenous nucleoside recognized as a neuroprotective agent since it prevents glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by a mechanism not yet completely elucidated. In this study, we evaluated behavioral and biochemical effects in the hippocampus caused by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of A beta(1-42) peptide (400 pmol/site) in mice, and the neuroprotective effect of guanosine (8 mg/kg, i.p.). An initial evaluation on the eighth day after A beta(1-42) infusion showed no changes in the tail suspension test, although ex vivo analyses in hippocampal slices showed increased ROS production. In the second protocol, on the tenth day following A beta(1-42) infusion, no effect was observed in the sucrose splash test, but a reduction in the recognition index in the object location test showed impaired spatial memory. Analysis of hippocampal slices showed no ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential alteration, but a tendency to increase glutamate release and a significant lactate release, pointing to a metabolic alteration. Those effects were accompanied by decreased cell viability and increased membrane damage. Guanosine treatment prevented behavioral and biochemical alterations evoked by A beta(1-42), suggesting a potential role against behavioral and biochemical damage evoked by A beta in the hippocampus.

AB  - The leaf-beetle Galerucella birmanica is a potential biocontrol herbivore for water chestnut, Trapa natans in North America. During our assessments of effectiveness and safety of G. birmanica in quarantine, we found a narrow fundamental host range with complete development only possible on all T. natans morphospecies present in North America and Brasenia schreberi. Phylogenetic relatedness did not fully explain feeding and oviposition preferences of G. birmanica in no-choice or multiple-choice trials. Instead, feeding and oviposition on non-target plants appears better explained by host-associations of congeneric Galerucella species, underscoring the impor-tance of including additional factors in selecting host-specificity test plant species. To further gauge potential risk to B. schreberi, we used a comparative performance metric proposed by Paynter et al. (2015) and found G. birmanica scored low, further indicating low risk to B. schreberi. Our findings suggest that widespread and safe biocontrol of T. natans in North America appears promising if G. birmanica is granted release approval by reg-ulatory agencies.

AB  - To isolate Letrozole from Glycosmis pentaphylla (Retz.) DC. and to determine its effect on regulating the proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and key mechanisms in human neuroblastoma cell lines. Letrozole was isolated through column chromatographic technique and its effect was checked on human neuroblastoma cell lines, IMR 32. The effects of Letrozole on cell viability were measured by MTT assay, and the cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. The expression changes in mRNA of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL were taken from real-time PCR analysis and the protein levels were detected by Western blotting. The results of the present study showed that Letrozole, isolated from leaves of G. pentaphylla could cause significant inhibitory effect on proliferation of IMR 32 cells in a dose dependent manner. Cell arrest was obtained at S phase with the treatment of Letrozole. Apart from this, the expression of PCNA, cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL were decreased both at mRNA and protein levels for the same treatment. Letrozole can inhibit proliferation, induce cell arrest and cause apoptosis in IMR 32 cell lines. The decreased expression of PCNA, cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL induced by Letrozole contributes to the above effects in vitro. This is the first report on the isolation of Letrozole from G. pentaphylla.

AB  - The current study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism by which the cholecystokinin (CCK)-mediated CCKAR and CCKBR, as well as the molecular mechanisms of CCK-mediated insulin signalling pathway, regulate oestrogen in the granulosa cells. Also, the expression of CCK in ovaries, uterus, hypothalamus and pituitary gland was investigated in Camelus bactrianus. Ovaries, uterus, hypothalamus and pituitary gland were collected from six, three before ovulation (control) and three after ovulation, slaughtered Camelus bactrianus. Ovulation was induced by IM injection of seminal plasma before slaughtering in the ovulated group. The results showed that there were differences in the transcription and protein levels of CCK in various tissues before and after ovulation (p < .05, p < .01). After transfection with p-IRES2-EGFP-CCK, the mRNA and protein levels of CCK, CCKAR, CCKBR and ER in follicular granulosa cells were significantly upregulated (p < .05, p < .01), and the content of E2 was significantly upregulated (p < .01); On the contrary, after transfection with si-CCK, the mRNA and protein levels of CCK, CCKAR, CCKBR and ER in follicular granulosa cells were significantly downregulated (p < .05, p < .01), and the content of E2 was significantly downregulated (p < .01). Regulating CCK can affect the mRNA levels of INS, INSR, IGF and IGF-R. In summary, regulating the expression level of CCK can activate insulin-related signalling pathways by CCKR, thereby regulating the steroidogenic activity of granulosa cells.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis [L.] O. Kussntze) is a global economic crop. Zinc treatment of tea plants can enhance catechin biosynthesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism behind catechin formation through zinc regulation remains unclear. This study identified a zinc-responsive protein, C. sinensis heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein 3 (CsHIPP3), from zinc-treated tea seedlings. CsHIPP3 expression was positively correlated with trihydroxylated catechin (TRIC) content. CsF3 ' 5 ' H1 is a crucial regulator of the TRIC synthesis pathway. The interaction between CsHIPP3 and CsF3 ' 5 ' H1 was assessed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, firefly luciferase complementation imaging, and pulldown experiments. CsHIPP3 knockdown using virus-induced gene silencing technology decreased the content of each component of TRICs. Compared with the control, the relative catechin content was reduced by 40.12-55.39%. Co-overexpression of CsHIPP3 and CsF3 ' 5 ' H1 significantly elevated the TRIC content in tea leaves and calli. Moreover, the TRIC content in transient co-overexpression leaves was 1.44-fold higher than that of the control group, and tea callus was 50.83% higher in transient co-overexpression than in the wild type. Thus, zinc-regulated TRIC synthesis in a zinc-rich environment was mediated by binding CsHIPP3 with CsF3 ' 5 ' H1 to promote TRIC synthesis and accumulation.

AB  - Exposure to excess glucocorticoid (GC) during early development is implicated in adult dysfunctions. Reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a well-known consequence of exposure to early life stress or elevated GC, however the effects on neurogenesis during development and effects on other brain regions are not well understood. Using an optogenetic zebrafish model, here we analyse the effects of GC exposure on neurogenesis during development in the whole brain. We identify that the hypothalamus is a highly GC-sensitive region where elevated GC causes precocious development. This is followed by failed maturation and early decline accompanied by impaired feeding, growth, and survival. In GC-exposed animals, the developmental trajectory of hypothalamic progenitor cells is strikingly altered, potentially mediated by direct regulation of transcription factors such as rx3 by GC. Our data provide cellular and molecular level insight into GC-induced alteration of the hypothalamic developmental trajectory, a process crucial for health across the life-course.
   A study in zebrafish indicates that elevated cortisol levels during early life can alter the developmental trajectory of the hypothalamus, inducing short-term precocious development, but leading to failed maturation in the long-term.

AB  - The development of quantum computers has urged the cryptographic community to prepare cryptographic primitives for the eventual arrival of the post-quantum world. At Asiacrypt 2017, Leander and May combined Grover's and Simon's quantum algorithms to break the FX-based block ciphers. Technically this result is based on the combination of the quantum algorithms of Grover's and Simon's for the first time in the cryptographic setting. In this study, we using Bernstein-Vazirani's and Grover's algorithms to generate a new quantum key-recovery attacks on different rounds of Feistel constructions. An advantage of our attack is the keys can be divided into multiple blocks to enter the S-box and realize the process of recovery; this method greatly reduces the complexity of key recovery. Hence, it has strong practicability for key recovery (e.g., DES, Camellia, etc.). In order to show that, a detailed process has been provided in this paper.

AB  - In the modern swine industry, inflammation and pain in sows after farrowing represent a crucial animal welfare concern. Cannabis sativa, a medicinal plant, has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties and is rich in fibre. The objective of this study is to examine the impacts of supplementing sows with Cannabis sativa byproducts during transition periods (7 days before and after farrowing) on various aspects including postpartum behaviour, feed intake, constipation, farrowing duration, colostrum yield and piglet performance. The experiment involved a total of 100 Landrace x Yorkshire sows. The sows were distributed according to parity numbers into two groups, i.e., control (n = 54) and treatment (n = 46). The control group was provided with a lactation diet at 3.0-3.5 kg per day for a period of 7 days before and after farrowing. The treatment groups received the same quantity of the diet but with an additional supplementation of 150 g/d of Cannabis sativa byproduct. The byproduct was analysed and contained 0.24 % (w/w) cannabidiol (CBD), resulting in a daily intake of 360 mg of CBD per sow. The conventional lactational diet had a dietary fibre content of 4.3 %, whereas the diet supple-mented with Cannabis sativa byproduct had a higher dietary fibre content of 16.9 %. Video cameras were used to observe and document the behaviour of sows within the initial 24 h after farrowing. The duration in which sows engaged in activities such as sleeping, sitting, standing, feeding and nursing their piglets was quantified. Additionally, the rectal temperature of the sows was measured, and a temperature equal to or exceeding 39.5 C-degrees was considered indicative of fever. The faecal score of the sows was assessed, and a faecal score of <= 2 was classified as constipation. On the third day postpartum, the proportion of sows with fever in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group (20.0 % and 38.9 % respectively, P = 0.051). Sows receiving supple-mentation with Cannabis sativa byproducts exhibited increased durations of standing and feeding compared to those in the control group (P < 0.05). Notably, overall, sows without constipation issues spent more time consuming feed than those experiencing constipation (P = 0.006). The prevalence of constipation was signifi-cantly lower in the treatment group compared to the control group (17.4 % and 81.5 %, respectively, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the postpartum sows demonstrated increased feed intake following supplementation with Cannabis sativa byproducts (P < 0.05). Sow colostrum yield, piglet colostrum intake, piglet mortality and other piglet traits did not differ between the control and treatment groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, supplementing Cannabis sativa byproducts during the transition periods in peri-parturient sows under tropical conditions resulted in a reduction in constipation issues and improved sow activities, such as increased time spent standing and consuming feed within the first 24 h postpartum.

AB  - Amyloid fibrils are characteristic of several disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), with no cure or preventive therapy. Diminishing amyloid deposits using aromatic compounds is an interesting approach toward AD treatment. The present study examined the anti-fibrillogenic effects of silibinin and trans-chalcone in vitro, in vivo, and in silico on insulin amyloids. In vitro incubation of insulin at 37 degrees C for 24 h induced amyloid formation. Addition of trans-chalcone and silibinin to insulin led to reduced amounts of fibrils as shown by thioflavin S fluorescence and Congo red absorption spectroscopy, with a better effect observed for silibinin. In vivo bilateral injection of fibrils formed by incubation of insulin in the presence or absence of silibinin and trans-chalcone or insulin fibrils plus the compounds in rats' hippocampus was performed to obtain AD characteristics. Passive avoidance (PA) test showed that treatment with both compounds efficiently increased latency compared with the model group. Histological investigation of the hippocampus in the cornu ammonis (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the rat's brain stained with hematoxylin-eosin and thioflavin S showed an inhibitory effect on amyloid aggregation and markedly reduced amyloid plaques. In silico, a docking experiment on native and fibrillar forms of insulin provided an insight onto the possible binding site of the compounds. In conclusion, these small aromatic compounds are suggested to have a protective effect on AD.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric diseases are related to early life stress (ELS), patients often have abnormal learning, memory and emotion. But the regulatory mechanism is unclear. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity (HSP) changes are important mechanism. RhoA pathway is known to regulate HSP by modulating of dendritic spines (DS), whether it's involved in HSP changes in ELS hasn't been reported. So we investigated whether and how RhoA participates in HSP regulation in ELS. The ELS model was established by separation-rearing in juvenile. Results of IntelliCage detection etc. showed simple learning and memory wasn't affected, but spatial, punitive learning and memories reduced, the desire to explore novel things reduced, the anxiety-like emotion increased. We further found hip-pocampus was activated, the hippocampal neurons dendritic complexities reduced, the proportion of mature DS decreased. The full-length transcriptome sequencing techniques was used to screen for differentially expressed genes involved in regulating HSP changes, we found RhoA gene was up-regulated. We detected RhoA protein, RhoA phosphorylation and downstream molecules expression changes, results shown RhoA and p-RhoA, p-ROCK2 expression increased, p-LIMK, p-cofilin expression and F-actin/G-actin ratio decreased. Our study revealed HSP changes in ELS maybe regulate by activation RhoA through ROCK2/LIMK/cofilin pathway regu-lated F-actin/G-actin balance and DS plasticity, affecting emotion and cognition.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunctions are a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). beta-Lactolin, a whey-derived glycine-threonine-tryptophan-tyrosine tetrapeptide, has been previously reported to prevent AD-like pathologies in an AD mouse model via regulation of microglial functions. However, the direct effect of beta-lactolin on neuronal cells and neuronal mitochondrial functions remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of beta-lactolin on mitochondrial functions in amyloid beta (A beta)-treated mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells and human induced-pluripotent cell (hiPSC)-derived AD model neurons. Adding beta-lactolin to A beta-treated HT22 cells increased both the oxygen consumption rate and cellular ATP concentrations, suggesting that beta-lactolin improves mitochondrial respiration and energy production. Using high content image analysis, we found that beta-lactolin improved mitochondrial fragmentation, membrane potential, and oxidative stress in A beta-treated cells, eventually preventing neuronal cell death. From a mechanistic perspective, we found that beta-lactolin increased gene expression of mitofusin-2, which contributes to mitochondrial fusion events. Finally, we showed that beta-lactolin improves both mitochondrial morphologies and membrane potentials in hiPSC-derived AD model neurons. Taken together, beta-lactolin improved mitochondrial functions AD-related neuronal cell models and prevented neuronal cell death. The dual function of beta-lactolin on both neuron and microglia marks an advantage in maintaining neuronal health.

AB  - NMR offers the unique potential to holistically screen hundreds of metabolites and has already proved to be a powerful technique able to provide a global picture of a wide range of metabolic processes underlying complex and multifactorial diseases, such as neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. The aim of this study was to apply an NMR-based metabolomics approach to explore brain metabolic changes in both male and female rats induced by prenatal exposure to two chemicals associated with autism disorders-the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA)-at different postnatal ages. Depending on the age and on the brain region (hippocampus and cerebellum), several metabolites were shown to be significantly affected by exposure to both compounds. The evaluation of the spectral profiles revealed that the nervous-system-specific metabolite N-acetylaspartate (NAA), amino acid neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate, glutamine, GABA, glycine), pyroglutamic acid, unsaturated fatty acids, and choline-based compounds are discriminant biomarkers. Additionally, metabolic changes varied as a function of age, but importantly not of sex.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pivotal regulators in gene expression and diverse biological processes, such as immune defense and host-pathogen interactions. However, little is known about the roles of lncRNAs in the response of the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) to microsporidian infestation. Based on our previously obtained high-quality transcriptome datasets from the midgut tissues of Apis cerana cerana workers at 7 days post inoculation (dpi) and 10 dpi with Nosema ceranae (AcT7 and AcT10 groups) and the corresponding un-inoculated midgut tissues (AcCK7 and AcCK10 groups), the transcriptome-wide identification and structural characterization of lncRNAs were conducted, and the differential expression pattern of lncRNAs was then analyzed, followed by investigation of the regulatory roles of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) in host response. Here, 2365, 2322, 2487, and 1986 lncRNAs were, respectively, identified in the AcCK7, AcT7, AcCK7, and AcT10 groups. After removing redundant ones, a total of 3496 A. c. cerana lncRNAs were identified, which shared similar structural characteristics with those discovered in other animals and plants, such as shorter exons and introns than mRNAs. Additionally, 79 and 73 DElncRNAs were screened from the workers' midguts at 7 dpi and 10 dpi, respectively, indicating the alteration of the overall expression pattern of lncRNAs in host midguts after N. ceranae infestation. These DElncRNAs could, respectively, regulate 87 and 73 upstream and downstream genes, involving a suite of functional terms and pathways, such as metabolic process and Hippo signaling pathway. Additionally, 235 and 209 genes co-expressed with DElncRNAs were found to enrich in 29 and 27 terms, as well as 112 and 123 pathways, such as ABC transporters and the cAMP signaling pathway. Further, it was detected that 79 (73) DElncRNAs in the host midguts at 7 (10) dpi could target 321 (313) DEmiRNAs and further target 3631 (3130) DEmRNAs. TCONS_00024312 and XR_001765805.1 were potential precursors for ame-miR-315 and ame-miR-927, while TCONS_00006120 was the putative precursor for both ame-miR-87-1 and ame-miR-87-2. These results together suggested that DElncRNAs are likely to play regulatory roles in the host response to N. ceranae infestation through the regulation of neighboring genes via a cis-acting effect, modulation of co-expressed mRNAs via trans-acting effect, and control of downstream target genes' expression via competing endogenous RNA networks. Our findings provide a basis for disclosing the mechanism underlying DElncRNA-mediated host N. ceranae response and a new perspective into the interaction between A. c. cerana and N. ceranae.

TP-315 was administered to mice intraperitoneally for 14 days. At 24 h post the last injection, animals were decapitated, their brains were acquired, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut into 10 mu m slices. The FT-IR chemical imaging technique was used for the investigation of the potential neurotoxic effect in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The effect on the lipidomic and proteomic profile and on oxidative stress was investigated. The results showed no statistically significant changes in the above-mentioned parameters. TP-315 seems to pose no neurotoxic effect on the mouse brain after chronic use, therefore, its use should be safe.

AB  - The suitability of an animal model for use in studying human diseases relies heavily on the similarities between the two species at the genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic levels. However, there is a lack of consistent data from different animal models at each level to evaluate this suitability. With the availability of genome sequences for many mammalian species, it is now possible to compare animal models based on genomic similarities. Herein, we compare the coding sequences (CDSs) of five mammalian models, including rhesus macaque, marmoset, pig, mouse, and rat models, with human coding sequences. We identified 10,316 conserved CDSs across the five organisms and the human genome based on sequence similarity. Mapping the human-disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these conserved CDSs in each species has identified species-specific associations with various human diseases. While associations with a disease such as colon cancer were prevalent in multiple model species, the rhesus macaque showed the most model-specific human disease associations. Based on the percentage of disease-associated SNP-containing genes, marmoset models are well suited to study many human ailments, including behavioral and cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Background Yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1, also known as TAZ) are two key transcription co-activators of the Hippo pathway. Both were originally characterized as organ size and cell proliferation regulators. Later studies demonstrated that the Hippo pathway may play a role in Drosophila and mammal hematopoiesis. However, the role of the Hippo pathway in human erythropoiesis has not yet been fully elucidated. Methods The role of YAP and TAZ was studied in human erythropoiesis and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) lineage determination by using mobilized peripheral blood (PB) and cord blood (CB)-derived HSC as a model. HSCs were isolated and cultured in an erythroid differentiation medium for erythroid differentiation and culture in methylcellulose assay for HSC lineage determination study. Results YAP and TAZ were barely detectable in human HSCs, but became highly expressed in pro-erythroblasts and erythroblasts. Depletion or knockdown of YAP and/or TAZ did not affect the ability of HSC lineage specification to erythroid lineage in either methylcellulose assay or liquid culture. However, depletion of YAP and TAZ did impair erythroblast terminal differentiation to erythrocytes and their enucleation. Moreover, ectopic expression of YAP and TAZ in pro-erythroblasts did not exert an apparent effect on erythroid differentiation, expansion, or morphology. Conclusions This study demonstrated that YAP/TAZ plays important role in erythroid maturation and enucleation but is dispensable for lineage determination of human HSCs.

AB  - The beneficial effects of Korean red ginseng extract (KRGE) on the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported. Among the CNS cells, astrocytes possess robust antioxidative properties and regenerative potential. Under physiological conditions, biliverdin reductase A (BVR-A) converts biliverdin (a heme oxygenase metabolite) into bilirubin, a major natural and potent antioxidant. We found that KRGE enhanced BVR-A in astrocytes in the fimbria region of the adult mouse hippocampus under physiological conditions. KRGE-induced BVR-A expression and subsequent bilirubin production were required for changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial mass, and oxidative phosphorylation through liver kinase B1 (LKB1), estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR alpha), and sirtuin (SIRT1 and SIRT5) in astrocytes. However, BVR-A did not affect the KRGE-induced expression of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK alpha). The KRGE-stimulated BVR-A-LKB1-SIRT1-ERR alpha pathway regulates the levels of mitochondria-localized proteins such as SIRT5, translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (Tom20), Tom22, cytochrome c (Cyt c), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Increased Tom20 expression in astrocytes of the hippocampal fimbria region was observed in KRGE-treated mice. KRGE-induced expression of Cyt c and SOD2 was associated with the Tom20/Tom22 complex. Taken together, KRGE-induced bilirubin production is required for enhanced astrocytic mitochondrial function in an LKB1-dependent and AMPK alpha-independent manner under physiological conditions.

AB  - Oxidative stress is an adverse condition in animals that can cause tissue damage and result in poor health. A number of factors can contribute to this condition, although little has been studied empirically in elephants. This study measured multiple serum oxidative status markers and a stress biomarker (fecal glucocorticoid metabolites) to examine the effects of age, sex, sampling season, and disease factors in captive Asian elephants in Thailand. Age and season influenced several biomarkers and should be considered in data interpretation, while sex did not. The most significant changes in oxidative and antioxidative activity were associated with elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus hemorrhagic disease, a highly fatal disease in calves, suggesting a strong link with oxidative stress responses.Oxidative stress is a pathological condition that can have adverse effects on animal health, although little research has been conducted on wildlife species. In this study, blood was collected from captive Asian elephants for the assessment of five serum oxidative status markers (reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations; malondialdehyde, MDA; albumin; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; and catalase) in healthy (n = 137) and sick (n = 20) animals. Health problems consisted of weakness, puncture wounds, gastrointestinal distress, eye and musculoskeletal problems, and elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus hemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD). Fecal samples were also collected to assess glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) as a measure of stress. All data were analyzed in relation to age, sex, sampling season, and their interactions using generalized linear models, and a correlation matrix was constructed. ROS and serum albumin concentrations exhibited the highest concentrations in aged elephants (>45 years). No sex differences were found for any biomarker. Interactions were observed for age groups and seasons for ROS and catalase, while GPx displayed a significant interaction between sex and season. In pairwise comparisons, significant increases in ROS and catalase were observed in summer, with higher ROS concentrations observed only in the adult female group. Lower catalase activity was exhibited in juvenile males, subadult males, adult females, and aged females compared to subadult and adult elephants (males and females) in winter and the rainy season. There was a positive association between catalase activity and fGCMs (r = 0.23, p < 0.05), and a number of red blood cell parameters were positively associated with several of these biomarkers, suggesting high oxidative and antioxidative activity covary in red cells (p < 0.05). According to health status, elephants with EEHV-HD showed the most significant changes in oxidative stress markers, with MDA, GPx, and catalase being higher and albumin being lower than in healthy elephants. This study provides an analysis of understudied health biomarkers in Asian elephants, which can be used as additional tools for assessing the health condition of this species and suggests age and season may be important factors in data interpretation.

AB  - Specific classes of GABAergic neurons play specific roles in regulating information processing in the brain. In the hippocampus, two major classes, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and somatostatin-expressing (SST+), differentially regulate endogenous firing patterns and target subcellular compartments of principal cells. How these classes regulate the flow of information throughout the hippocampus is poorly understood. We hypothesize that PV+ and SST+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 differentially modulate CA3 patterns of output, thereby altering the influence of CA3 on CA1. We find that while suppressing either interneuron class increases DG and CA3 output, the effects on CA1 were very different. Suppressing PV+ interneurons increases local field potential signatures of coupling from CA3 to CA1 and decreases signatures of coupling from entorhinal cortex to CA1 suppressing SST+ interneurons has the opposite effect. Thus, DG and CA3 PV+ and SST+ interneurons bidirectionally modulate the flow of information through the hippocampal circuit.

AB  - The aging brain is characterized by progressive increases in neuroinflammation and central insulin resistance, which contribute to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. Recently, the Interventions Testing Program demonstrated that the anti-diabetes drug, Canagliflozin (Cana), a sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitor, led to lower fasting glucose and improved glucose tolerance in both sexes, but extended median lifespan by 14% in male mice only. Here, we show that Cana treatment significantly improved central insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus of 30-month-old male mice. Aged males produce more robust neuroimmune responses than aged females. Remarkably, Cana-treated male and female mice showed significant reductions in age-associated hypothalamic gliosis with a decrease in inflammatory cytokine production by microglia. However, in the hippocampus, Cana reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in males, but not in female mice. The decrease in microgliosis was partially correlated with reduced phosphorylation of S6 kinase in microglia of Cana-treated aged male, but not female mice. Thus, Cana treatment improved insulin responsiveness in aged male mice. Furthermore, Cana treatment improved exploratory and locomotor activity of 30-month-old male but not female mice. Taken together, we demonstrate the sex-specific neuroprotective effects of Cana treatment, suggesting its application for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 688,808 individuals with major depression (MD) and 4,364,225 controls from 29 countries across diverse and admixed ancestries, we identify 697 associations at 635 loci, 293 of which are novel. Using fine-mapping and functional tools, we find 308 high-confidence gene associations and enrichment of postsynaptic density and receptor clustering. A neural cell-type enrichment analysis utilizing single-cell data implicates excitatory, inhibitory, and medium spiny neurons and the involvement of amygdala neurons in both mouse and human single-cell analyses. The associations are enriched for antidepressant targets and provide potential repurposing opportunities. Polygenic scores trained using European or multi-ancestry data predicted MD status across all ancestries, explaining up to 5.8% of MD liability variance in Europeans. These findings advance our global understanding of MD and reveal biological targets that may be used to target and develop pharmacotherapies addressing the unmet need for effective treatment.

AB  - In the present study, we compared the antiepileptic effects of alpha-asarone derivatives to explore their structureactivity relationships using the PTZ-induced seizure model. Our research revealed that electron-donating methoxy groups in the 3,4,5-position on phenyl ring increased antiepileptic potency but the placement of other groups at different positions decreased activity. Besides, in allyl moiety, the optimal activity was reached with either an allyl or a 1-butenyl group in conjugation with the benzene ring. The compounds 5 and 19 exerted better neuroprotective effects against epilepsy in vitro (cell) and in vivo (mouse) models. This study provides valuable data for further exploration and application of these compounds as potential anti-seizure medicines.

AB  - Neurons extend axons to form the complex circuitry of the mature brain. This depends on the coordinated response and continuous remodelling of the microtubule and F-actin networks in the axonal growth cone. Growth cone architecture remains poorly understood at nanoscales. We therefore investigated mouse hippocampal neuron growth cones using cryo-electron tomography to directly visualise their three-dimensional subcellular architecture with molecular detail. Our data showed that the hexagonal arrays of actin bundles that form filopodia penetrate and terminate deep within the growth cone interior. We directly observed the modulation of these and other growth cone actin bundles by alteration of individual F-actin helical structures. Microtubules with blunt, slightly flared or gently curved ends predominated in the growth cone, frequently contained lumenal particles and exhibited lattice defects. Investigation of the effect of absence of doublecortin, a neurodevelopmental cytoskeleton regulator, on growth cone cytoskeleton showed no major anomalies in overall growth cone organisation or in F-actin subpopulations. However, our data suggested that microtubules sustained more structural defects, highlighting the importance of microtubule integrity during growth cone migration.

AB  - Simple Summary Fear behavior is associated with negative emotional responses, which can adversely affect animal welfare. A comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying fearfulness is essential for developing effective strategies to improve welfare. In this study, laying hens were classified into high- and low-fear groups based on tonic immobility tests, and hippocampal histological and transcriptomic characteristics were compared to explore the biological basis of individual differences in fear responses. The results revealed that hens with high-fear levels exhibited a significant reduction in Nissl bodies in hippocampal neurons, increased doublecortin (DCX) expression, and decreased c-Fos (Fos proto-oncogene) expression. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in several pathways related to neural function and immune regulation. This suggests that individuals with high fear may experience impaired neural plasticity and dysregulated stress responses. These findings provide molecular-level insights into the mechanisms underlying fearfulness differences and offer a theoretical foundation for future interventions aimed at experiencing less fear and enhancing welfare in laying hens. Fear is a critical welfare concern in laying hens. Fearful behaviors in domestic chickens are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, contributing to individual differences in stress responses. Tonic immobility (TI) duration is widely recognized as a reliable indicator of fear levels. The hippocampus, a critical brain region for emotional states, plays a pivotal role in associating fearful experiences with specific stimuli, enabling adaptive behavioral responses. This study investigated hippocampal histological characteristics and transcriptomic profiles in laying hens with different fear responses categorized based on TI duration. A total of 80 native Lindian hens (75 weeks old) were individually housed in modified conventional cages. At 76 weeks of age, hens exhibiting the longest and shortest TI durations were classified into the high-fear (TH) and low-fear (TL) groups, respectively. Whole hemibrains were collected for histological and immunohistochemical analyses, while hippocampal tissues underwent transcriptome sequencing. The results showed a significant reduction in Nissl body counts in hippocampal neurons of high-fear hens (p < 0.05), suggesting potential neuronal damage or functional impairment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 365 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups, with 277 upregulated and 88 downregulated genes in TH chickens. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified seven significantly associated pathways (p < 0.01), including retinol metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, all of which are crucial for neuronal function and immune regulation. In addition, a significant increase in DCX protein expression (p < 0.05) and a decrease in c-Fos protein expression (p < 0.05) was noted in in high-fear hens, whereas PCNA levels remained unchanged (p > 0.05) under immunohistochemical validation. The neuronal alterations observed in high fear individuals suggest neural damage, while transcriptomic variations point to potential disruptions in neurogenesis, synaptic signaling, and stress-related pathways. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the neurobiological basis of fear regulation in laying hens and may have implications for poultry welfare and management strategies.

AB  - Selective antagonists of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; pGlu-His-Pro-NH2), in order to enable a better understanding of this peptide's central functions, have not been identified. Using pGlu-Glu-Pro-NH2 ([Glu(2)]TRH) as a lead peptide and with modification at its central residue, our studies focused on some of its analogues synthesized as potential functional antagonists of TRH in the rodent brain. Among the peptides studied, the novel isomeric analogue [beta-Glu(2)]TRH was found to suppress the analeptic and antidepressant-like pharmacological activities of TRH without eliciting intrinsic effects in these paradigms. [beta-Glu(2)]TRH also completely reversed TRH's stimulation of acetylcholine turnover in the rat hippocampus without a cholinergic activity of its own, which was demonstrated through in vivo microdialysis experiments. Altogether, [beta-Glu(2)]TRH emerged as the first selective functional antagonist of TRH's prominent cholinergic actions, by which this endogenous peptide elicits a vast array of central effects.

AB  - Homeostatic synaptic depression (HSD) in excitatory neurons is a cell-autonomous mechanism which protects excitatory neurons from over-excitation as a consequence of chronic increases in network activity. In this process, excitatory synapses are weakened and eventually eliminated, as evidenced by a reduction in synaptic AMPA receptor expression and dendritic spine loss. Originally considered a global, cell-wide mechanism, local forms of regulation, such as the local control of mRNA translation in dendrites, are being increasingly recognized in HSD. Yet, identification of excitatory proteins whose local regulation is required for HSD is still limited. Here, we show that proline-rich protein 7/ transmembrane adapter protein 3 (Prr7) down-regulation in dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons is necessary for HSD induced by chronic increase in network activity resulting from a blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission by picrotoxin (PTX). We further identify two activity-regulated miRNAs, miR-329-3p and miR-495-3p, which inhibit Prr7 mRNA translation and are required for HSD. Moreover, we found that Prr7 knockdown reduces expression of the synaptic scaffolding protein SPAR, which is rescued by pharmacological inhibition of CDK5, indicating a role of Prr7 protein in the maintenance of excitatory synapses via protection of SPAR from degradation. Together, our findings highlight a novel HSD mechanism in which chronic activity leads to miR-329- and miR-495-mediated Prr7 reduction upstream of the CDK5-SPAR pathway.

AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), the most common sarcoma, is mainly caused by an oncogenic mutation in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase. Targeting KIT using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib, provides substantial benefit; however, in most patients, the disease will eventually progress due to KIT secondary mutations leading to treatment failure. Understanding how GIST cells initially adapt to KIT inhibition should guide the selection of appropriate therapies to overcome the emergence of resistance. Several mechanisms have been broadly implicated in the resistance to imatinib anti-tumoral effects, including the reactivation of MAPK signaling upon KIT/PDGFRA targeted inhibition. This study provides evidence that LImb eXpression 1 (LIX1), a protein we identified as a regulator of the Hippo transducers YAP1 and TAZ, is upregulated upon imatinib or sunitinib treatment. LIX1 silencing in GIST-T1 cells impaired imatinib-induced MAPK signaling reactivation and enhanced imatinib anti-tumor effect. Our findings identified LIX1 as a key regulator of the early adaptative response of GIST cells to targeted therapies.

AB  - (1) Background: Genistein is a naturally occurring flavonoid with a rich spectrum of biological activities, including plant-herbivore interactions. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of exogenous application of genistein on aphid behavior during probing in plant tissues. (2) Methods: Vicia faba, Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis, and Avena sativa were treated transepidermally with a 0.1% ethanolic solution of genistein, and the probing behavior of generalist aphid species Aphis fabae, Myzus persicae, and Rhopalosiphum padi was monitored on their respective treated and untreated host plants using electropenetrography (=electrical penetration graph technique, EPG); (3) Results: Genistein did not deter aphid probing activities in non-phloem tissues. In A. fabae and R. padi, a trend towards reduction and in M. persicae a trend towards increase in phloem sap ingestion occurred on genistein-treated plants, but these trends were not statistically significant. (4) Conclusions: Genistein is not a deterrent chemical against generalist aphid species studied; therefore, it is not recommended for practical application.

AB  - Psoroptes ovis, a common surface-living mite of domestic and wild animals worldwide, results in huge economic losses and serious welfare issues in the animal industry. P. ovis infestation rapidly causes massive eosinophil infiltration in skin lesions, and increasing research revealed that eosinophils might play an important role in the pathogenesis of P. ovis infestation. Intradermal injection of P. ovis antigen invoked massive eosinophil infiltration, suggesting that this mite should contain some relative molecules involved in eosinophil accumulation in the skin. However, these active molecules have not yet been identified. Herein, we identified macrophage migration inhibitor factor (MIF) in P. ovis (PsoMIF) using bioinformatics and molecular biology methods. Sequence analyses revealed that PsoMIF appeared with high similarity to the topology of monomer and trimer formation with host MIF (RMSD = 0.28 angstroms and 2.826 angstroms, respectively) but with differences in tautomerase and thiol-protein oxidoreductase active sites. Reverse transcription PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) results showed that PsoMIF was expressed throughout all the developmental stages of P. ovis, particularly with the highest expression in female mites. Immunolocalization revealed that MIF protein located in the ovary and oviduct of female mites and also localized throughout the stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and even basal layers of the epidermis in skin lesions caused by P. ovis. rPsoMIF significantly upregulated eosinophil-related gene expression both in vitro (PBMC: CCL5, CCL11; HaCaT: IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, CCL5, CCL11) and in vivo (rabbit: IL-5, CCL5, CCL11, P-selectin, ICAM-1). Moreover, rPsoMIF could induce cutaneous eosinophil accumulation in a rabbit model and increased the vascular permeability in a mouse model. Our findings indicated that PsoMIF served as one of the key molecules contributing to skin eosinophil accumulation in P. ovis infection of rabbits.

AB  - The risk of exposure to toxic metals is a known concern to human populations. The overexposure to Mn can lead to a pathological condition, with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. Although toxicity of Mn has been reported, studies in neonates are scarce but necessary, as Mn can cross biological barriers. The present study evaluated if chronic perinatal exposure to Mn at low doses lead to neurotoxic effects in mice, after direct and indirect exposure. Couples of mice were exposed to Mn (0.013, 0.13, and 1.3 mg kg(-1).day(-1)) for 60 days prior to mating, as well as during gestation and lactation. The offspring was distributed into two groups: animals that were not exposed after weaning - parental exposure only (PE); and animals subject to additional 60-day exposure through gavages after weaning - parental and direct exposure (PDE). Neurological effects were evaluated by Mn quantification, behavior tests and biochemical markers in the brain. PDE animals had alterations in short/long-term memory and increased anxiety-like behavior. Exposure to Mn triggered a decrease of glutathione-s-transferase and increase of cholinesterase activity in different regions of the brain. These findings highlight the risk of exposure to low doses of Mn over a generation and at early stages of development.

AB  - The perturbation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors is thought to underlie many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. We previously identified that the tumor suppressor gene, MEN1, regulates both the expression and synaptic targeting of alpha 7 nAChRs in the mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro. Here we sought to determine whether the alpha 7 nAChRs gene expression reciprocally regulates the expression of menin, the protein encoded by the MEN1 gene, and if this interplay impacts learning and memory. We demonstrate here that alpha 7 nAChRs knockdown (KD) both in in vitro and in vivo, initially upregulated and then subsequently downregulated menin expression. Exogenous expression of menin using an AAV transduction approach rescued alpha 7 nAChRs KD mediated functional and behavioral deficits specifically in hippocampal (CA1) neurons. These effects involved the modulation of the alpha 7 nAChR subunit expression and functional clustering at the synaptic sites. Our data thus demonstrates a novel and important interplay between the MEN1 gene and the alpha 7 nAChRs in regulating hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.

Groups I and II were left untreated, while groups III and IV were injected with LiCl (127 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by pilocarpine HCl (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 18-24 h later, repeatedly, till induction of SE. 72 h post-SE, KD effectively ameliorated the balance between excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters and the oxidative stress indices, increased adenine nucleotides and decreased immunoreactivity of iNOS, TNF alpha, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and synaptophysin. Thiswas in association with improvement in inflammatory response and neuronal tissue characteristics in hippocampus of SE rats. Histological changes showed preservation of neuronal integrity. These findings highlight the protective effects of KD in the acute phase post-SE via ameliorating biochemical and histological changes involved. Practical applications Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder that requires lifelong treatment. It stigmatizes patients and their families. The use of the ketogenic diet (KD) as a therapy for epilepsy developed from observations that fasting could reduce seizures. From 1920s, the KD was a common epilepsy treatment until it was gradually superseded by anticonvulsant drugs so that by the 1980s it was rarely used. However, there has been a resurgence of interest and usage of the KD for epilepsy since the turn of the century. Despite its long history, the mechanisms by which KD exhibits its anti-seizure action are not fully understood. Our study aims to identify the mechanism of KD which may help further studies to achieve the same benefits with a drug or supplement to overcome its unpalatability and gastrointestinal side effects.

AB  - The nasal septal island (NSI) is a sensory patch of neuroepithelium located within the soft tissue of the nasal septum in dromedaries. The island has unique anatomical features, including the specialized subepithelial glands. The aim of the present study was to describe the microscopic features and ultrastructure of these subepithelial glands and to speculate the possible functions. A total of 10 camel heads were used for the study. Unlike the serous and mucous airway glands, the NSI glands' ultrastructural features were typical for cells of the (Amine Precursor Uptake and Decarboxylation, APUD) system. These features were included, membrane bound secretory vesicles of varying electron density, smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the form of vesicles; electron dense mitochondria, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes. Alcian-PAS identifiable mucus granules were not observed, except for few clusters of cells, located at the luminal surface. The probable functions were discussed on basis of cellular morphology and context. In a conclusion, the NSI subepithelial glands in dromedaries had unique anatomical structures, and as many other APUD cells, they had the machinery required for synthesis of a variable number of biologically active peptides, amines and chemical mediators.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative proteinopathy in which A beta and tau misfold and aggregate into entities that structurally unsettle native proteins, mimicking a prion-like or "seeding" process. These A beta and tau "seeds" can arrange in different conformations or strains that might display distinct pathogenic properties. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that microglia play a key role in the amyloidogenic event and can modulate the propagation and aggregation processes. Here, we employed histological and molecular approaches to determine whether seeds from human AD brains compared to those from transgenic mice (3xTg-AD) are more prone to induce A beta and tau aggregates in vivo, as well as potential differences in the microglial response to the plaque pathology. Brain homogenates were injected into the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice and hA beta-KI mice and examined at 18-20 months of age. The seeds from the human AD brain induced more aggressive amyloid pathology compared to seeds from aged 3xTg-AD mice. However, the AD seeds from aged transgenic mice triggered more tau pathology. Interestingly, such mice seeds impaired microglial clustering around plaques, leading to more severe neuritic pathology. Furthermore, the human AD seeds injected into the hippocampus of hA beta-KI mice were not able to induce plaque formation. These results suggest that multiple variables such as the AD seed, recipient model, and time are critical factors that can modulate the amyloid pathology onset and progression. Thus, more profound understanding of these factors will provide key insight into how amyloid and tau pathology progresses in AD.

AB  - Numerous illnesses, including neurological and mental disorders, have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Disruptions in mitochondrial respiration and energy production have been linked to dysmetabolism of the tryptophan (Trp)-kynurenine (KYN) pathway, which produces a diverse array of bioactive metabolites. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a putative neuroprotectant. The exact mechanisms through which Trp-KYN metabolic dysregulation affects mitochondrial function remain largely unclear. This study investigates the impact of the genetic deletion of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) enzymes, which are responsible for KYNA synthesis, on mitochondrial function, specifically mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, and its potential role in neuropsychiatric pathology. CRISPR/Cas9-induced knockout mouse strains kat1-/-, kat2-/-, and kat3-/- were generated. Eight-to-ten-week-old male mice were used, and cerebral and hepatic respiration, complex I- and II-linked oxidative phosphorylation (CI and CII OXPHOS), and complex IV (CIV) activity were measured using high-resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential changes were measured with Fluorescence-Sensor Blue and safranin dye. KAT knockout mice exhibited significantly lower cerebellar respiration (CI OXPHOS, CII OXPHOS, and CIV activity) compared to wild-type mice. Lower baseline respiration and attenuated OXPHOS activities were observed in the hippocampus and striatum, particularly in kat2-/- and kat3-/- mice. Non-neuronal tissues showed reduced CIV activity, while ADP-stimulated CI and CII OXPHOS remained unchanged. The deletion of the KAT genes significantly impairs mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, potentially contributing to pathogenesis. This study highlights the importance of KYNA in mitochondrial function, offering new insights into potential therapeutic targets for various disorders. Targeting the KYN pathway could mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction in a variety of diseased conditions.image

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with neural oxidative stress and inflammation, and it is assumed to affect more women than men with unknown mechanisms. Kaempferol (KMP) as a potent natural antioxidant has been known to exhibit various biological and pharmacological functions, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. We aimed here to evaluate the role of gender difference in response to KMP on the rat model of sporadic AD. Forty-six female and male Wistar rats were divided into six groups of sham, streptozotocin (STZ) + saline (SAL), STZ + KMP. Female rats were ovariectomized, and then all animals received an intracerebroventricular bilateral injection of STZ (3 mg/kg) to induce the AD model. KMP (10 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered for 21 consecutive days. Afterward, spatial learning and memory were assessed via the Morris water maze task (MWM). Finally, the hippocampus level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione, and malondialdehyde were measured using calorimetric kits. Data showed a significant cognition deficit in STZ + SAL compared with the sham. To sum up, we reported that chronic KMP treatment increase significantly improved acquisition and retrieval of spatial memory as evident by longer TTS (total time spent) and short-latency to the platform in MWM. In addition, KMP increased the levels of SOD and glutathione in the hippocampus of rats. Also, KMP decreased hippocampal levels of malondialdehyde in both genders. In conclusion, KMP successfully restores spatial memory impairment independent of gender difference. This memory restoration may at least in part be mediated through boosting the hippocampal level of SOD and glutathione.

AB  - Background: 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD), a ginsenoside metabolite, has prominent benefits for the central nervous system, especially in improving learning and memory. However, its transcriptional targets in brain tissue remain unknown. Methods: In this study, we first used mass spectrometry-based drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) to identify the potential proteins of ginsenosides and intersected them with the transcription factor library. Second, the transcription factor PURA was confirmed as a target of PPD by biolayer interferometry (BLI) and molecular docking. Next, the effect of PPD on the transcriptional levels of target genes of PURA in brain tissues was determined by qRT-PCR. Finally, bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze the potential biological features of these target proteins. Results: The results showed three overlapping transcription factors between the proteomics of DARTS and transcription factor library. BLI analysis further showed that PPD had a higher direct interaction with PURA than parent ginsenosides. Subsequently, BLI kinetic analysis, molecular docking, and mutations in key amino acids of PURA indicated that PPD specifically bound to PURA. The results of qRT-PCR showed that PPD could increase the transcription levels of PURA target genes in brain. Finally, bioinformatics analysis showed that these target proteins were involved in learning and memory function. Conclusion: The above-mentioned findings indicate that PURA is a transcription target of PPD in brain, and PPD upregulate the transcription levels of target genes related to cognitive dysfunction by binding PURA, which could provide a chemical and biological basis for the study of treating cognitive impairment by targeting PURA.

AB  - Tea is one of the world's major non-alcoholic beverages, popular for its health benefits and flavor. Purple-bud tea is particularly rich in anthocyanins, the concentration of which varies depending on the tea cultivar and cultivation conditions. While the genetic regulation of anthocyanin accumulation is well understood, the impact of environmental factors, such as light, on anthocyanin synthesis is less documented. In this study, we analyzed the anthocyanin content and the expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes (ABGs), CsAN1, and CsHY5, under different light intensities and durations. The expression of both CsAN1 and ABGs was significantly induced by light, with an intensity of 8000 lx particularly effective in promoting anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, we explored the effect of shading on anthocyanin content, finding that fifty percent shading reduced anthocyanin content by nearly half. Finally, dual-luciferase reporter assays and yeast one-hybrid assays confirmed the direct regulation of CsHY5 on CsAN1. These findings offer insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in tea plants and suggest a potential method for controlling anthocyanin accumulation in tea production.

AB  - Recent studies have indicated that dysfunction of gut microbiota, living microorganisms of the digestive tract, plays a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, indicating the valuable impact of probiotics as a potential preventive or therapeutic strategy. Saccharomyces boulardii is a yeast probiotic with beneficial effects on various disorders, ranging from inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases to brain and behavioral disorders. Herein, we examined the effect of S. boulardii on memory impairment induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Wistar rats. Four groups of rats were used in this study (N = 10): (1) control [Cnt], (2) LPS, (3) LPS + S. boulardii [LPS + S], and (4) S. boulardii [S]. Animals were orally administered S. boulardii (250 mg/ rat) or saline by gavage for 4 weeks. From the 14th day of the study, animals were administered intraperitoneal LPS (0.25 mg/kg/ day) or saline for 9 days. We assessed memory impairment, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-fi deposition. S. boulardii ameliorated LPS-induced memory dysfunction. We observed that S. boulardii significantly reduced the elevated levels of serum interleukin (IL)-1fi, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a, as well as hippocampal levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in the LPS model. Moreover, S. boulardii alleviated amyloid-fi deposition in the rat hippocampus. Collectively, our findings indicated that S. boulardii could inhibit memory impairment, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-fi accumulation induced by LPS, possibly by modifying the gut microbiota.

AB  - Appropriate myelin structures are crucial for efficient nerve impulse conduction; however, the precise mechanisms sustaining myelin integrity throughout life remain unclear. KLK6 and KLK8 (Klk8 in mice), serine proteases of the tissue kallikrein family, are upregulated in oligodendrocytes in response to central nervous system injuries and are associated with myelin degradation. However, the physiological roles of these proteases have not yet been fully clarified. Here, we examined whether Klk8 and Klk6 are expressed in glial cells other than oligodendrocytes and whether Klk8 affects myelin structure under physiological conditions. Microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes were isolated from the brains and spinal cords of wild-type and Klk8 knockout mice, and we examined the expression levels of Klk8, Klk6, and myelin-related genes. We found that both Klk6 and Klk8 expression levels in oligodendrocytes were correlated with myelin-related gene expression levels. The myelin-related gene expression levels in oligodendrocytes were significantly higher in Klk8 knockout mice than in wild-type mice. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy revealed that, compared with that in wild-type mice, the myelin volume and thickness were greater in Klk8 knockout mice. Oligodendrocyte-expressed Klk8 may play a role in modulating myelin structure under physiological conditions. Klk8 expression was higher in microglia than in oligodendrocytes, and Klk6 expression was higher in astrocytes than in oligodendrocytes. The expression levels of Klk6 and Klk8 in microglia and astrocytes were uncorrelated with the expression of myelin-related genes in oligodendrocytes, suggesting that these genes in microglia and astrocytes may have functional roles other than myelination.image

AB  - The common occurrence of cognitive decline is one of the most significant manifestations of aging in the brain, with the hippocampus - critical for learning and memory - being one of the first regions to exhibit functional deterioration. BGLAP/OCN/osteocalcin (bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein), a pro-youth systemic factor produced by the bone, improves age-related cognitive decline by boosting hippocampal neuronal autophagy. However, the mechanism by which hippocampal neurons detect BGLAP/OCN in the systemic milieu and adapt their downstream response was previously unknown. We determined that BGLAP/OCN modulates core primary cilia (PC) proteins, suggesting that this "extracellular antenna" may play a role in mediating BGLAP/OCN's anti-aging effects. Furthermore, selective downregulation of core PC proteins in the hippocampus impairs learning and memory by reducing neuronal macroautophagy/autophagy. In contrast, restoring core PC protein levels in the hippocampus of aged mice improved this phenotype and was necessary for the induction of autophagy machinery by BGLAP/OCN. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism through which pro-youth systemic factors, like BGLAP/OCN, can regulate neuronal autophagy and foster cognitive resilience during aging.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Lactate, classically considered a metabolic byproduct of anaerobic glycolysis, is implicated in ischemic acidosis and neuronal injury. The recent evidence highlights its potential role in sustaining metabolic networks and neuroprotection. This study investigates lactate's compensatory mechanisms in ischemic brain injury by analyzing post-ischemic metabolic enrichments and inter-regional metabolite correlations. Methods: Dynamic metabolic profiling was conducted using C-13-labeled glucose combined with H-1-C-13 NMR spectroscopy to quantify the metabolite enrichment changes in a murine cerebral ischemia model (n = 8). In vivo validation included intracerebroventricular pH-neutral lactate infusion in ischemic mice to assess the behavioral, electrophysiological, and mitochondrial outcomes. In vitro, HT22 hippocampal neurons underwent oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) with pH-controlled lactate supplementation (1 mM), followed by the evaluation of neuronal survival, mitochondrial membrane potential, and glycolytic enzyme expression. Results: NMR spectroscopy revealed a 30-50% reduction in most cerebral metabolites post-ischemia (p < 0.05), while the quantities of lactate and the related three-carbon intermediates remained stable or increased. Correlation analyses demonstrated significantly diminished inter-metabolite coordination post-ischemia, yet lactate and glutamate maintained high metabolic activity levels (r > 0.80, p < 0.01). Lactate exhibited superior cross-regional metabolic mobility compared to those of the other three-carbon intermediates. In vivo, lactate infusion improved the behavioral/electrophysiological outcomes and reduced mitochondrial damage. In the OGD-treated neurons, pH-neutral lactate (7.4) reduced mortality (p < 0.05), preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential (p < 0.05), and downregulated the glycolytic enzymes (HK, PFK, and PKM; p < 0.01), thereby attenuating H+ production. Conclusions: Under ischemic metabolic crisis, lactate and the three-carbon intermediates stabilize as critical substrates, compensating for global metabolite depletion. pH-neutral lactate restores energy flux, modulates the glycolytic pathways, and provides neuroprotection by mitigating acidotoxicity.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is a significant complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with T2DM remain elusive. Herein, we discussed the role of Bmal1, a core circadian rhythm-regulating gene, in the process of T2DM-associated cognitive dysfunction. We identified a marked decrease in BMAL1 levels in the hippocampus of db/db mice, followed by gain- and loss-of-function studies to explore the impact of BMAL1 on cognitive function. Our findings indicated that BMAL1 downregulation led to cognitive deficits, characterized by tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulated amyloid plaque. Conversely, BMAL1 overexpression mitigated these Alzheimer-like pathologies. Further investigation revealed that BMAL1 directly activated the transcription of Areg, thereby activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway and ameliorating cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, these effects of BMAL1 were attenuated by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Collectively, these results underscore the significant role of BMAL1 in T2DM-associated cognitive impairment, proposing a novel intervention strategy for individuals exposed to risk factors of T2DM.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Brain aging can promote neuronal damage, contributing to aging-related diseases like memory dysfunction. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula known for tonifying qi and activating blood circulation, shows neuroprotective properties. Despite this, the specific mechanism by which BYHWD improves age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) has not been explored in existing literature. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of BYHWD in the improvement of AAMI based on the "co-occurrence network regulation of intestinal microecology-host metabolism-immune function". Materials and methods: Firstly, D-galactose was performed to induce a rat model of AAMI. Learning and memory deficits was assessed by the Morris water maze test. H&E &E and Nissl staining were used to observe the pathological changes in neurons in the hippocampus of rats. Meanwhile, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of antioxidant enzymes in rat serum were measured using ELISA. Finally, an integrated pharmacological approach was applied to explore the potential mechanism of BYHWD in improving AAMI. Results: Our results indicated that BYHWD significantly mitigated the pathological structure of the hippocampus, reversed the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, GSH, and CAT in the serum, and improved learning and memory in aging rats. Transcriptomics combined with network pharmacology showed that energy metabolism and the inflammatory response were the key biological pathways for BYHWD to ameliorate AAMI. Integrative analysis of the micro- biome and metabolomics revealed that BYHWD has the potential to restore the balance of abundance between probiotics and harmful bacteria, and ameliorate the reprogramming of energy metabolism caused by aging in the brain. The co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated that a strong correlation between the treatment of AAMI and the stability of intestinal microecology, host metabolism, and immune network. Conclusion: The findings of this study collectively support the notion that BYHWD has a superior therapeutic effect in an AAMI rat model. The mechanism involves regulating the "intestinal microecology-metabolismimmune function co-occurrence network" system to restore the composition of gut microbiota and metabolites. This further improves the metabolic phenotype of brain tissue and maintains the homeostasis of central nervous system's immunity, leading to an improvement in AAMI. Consequently, this study offers a unique perspective on the prevention and treatment of AAMI. And, BYHWD is also considered to be a promising pre- clinical treatment for improving AAMI.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION Does a chemically defined maturation medium supplemented with FGF2, LIF, and IGF1 (FLI) improve in vitro maturation (IVM) of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) obtained from children, adolescents, and young adults undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC)? SUMMARY ANSWER Although FLI supplementation did not increase the incidence of oocyte meiotic maturation during human IVM, it significantly improved quality outcomes, including increased cumulus cell expansion and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression as well as enhanced transzonal projection retraction. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY During OTC, COCs, and denuded oocytes from small antral follicles are released into the processing media. Recovery and IVM of these COCs is emerging as a complementary technique to maximize the fertility preservation potential of the tissue. However, the success of IVM is low, especially in the pediatric population. Supplementation of IVM medium with FLI quadruples the efficiency of pig production through improved oocyte maturation, but whether a similar benefit occurs in humans has not been investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This study enrolled 75 participants between January 2018 and December 2021 undergoing clinical fertility preservation through the Fertility & Hormone Preservation & Restoration Program at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Participants donated OTC media, accumulated during tissue processing, for research. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Participants who underwent OTC and include a pediatric population that encompassed children, adolescents, and young adults & LE;22 years old. All participant COCs and denuded oocytes were recovered from media following ovarian tissue processing. IVM was then performed in either a standard medium (oocyte maturation medium) or one supplemented with FLI (FGF2; 40 ng/ml, LIF; 20 ng/ml, and IGF1; 20 ng/ml). IVM outcomes included meiotic progression, cumulus cell expansion, transzonal projection retraction, and detection of MAPK protein expression. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The median age of participants was 6.3 years, with 65% of them classified as prepubertal by Tanner staging. Approximately 60% of participants had been exposed to chemotherapy and/or radiation prior to OTC. On average 4.7 & PLUSMN; 1 COCs and/or denuded oocytes per participant were recovered from the OTC media. COCs (N = 41) and denuded oocytes (N = 29) were used for IVM (42 h) in a standard or FLI-supplemented maturation medium. The incidence of meiotic maturation was similar between cohorts (COCs: 25.0% vs 28.6% metaphase II arrested eggs in Control vs FLI; denuded oocytes: 0% vs 5.3% in Control vs FLI). However, cumulus cell expansion was 1.9-fold greater in COCs matured in FLI-containing medium relative to Controls and transzonal projection retraction was more pronounced (2.45 & PLUSMN; 0.50 vs 1.16 & PLUSMN; 0.78 projections in Control vs FLIat 16 h). Additionally, MAPK expression was significantly higher in cumulus cells obtained from COCs matured in FLI medium for 16-18 h (chemiluminescence corrected area 621,678 vs 2,019,575 a.u., P = 0.03). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Our samples are from human participants who exhibited heterogeneity with respect to age, diagnosis, and previous treatment history. Future studies with larger sample sizes, including adult participants, are warranted to determine the mechanism by which FLI induces MAPK expression and activation.
   Moreover, studies that evaluate the developmental competence of eggs derived from FLI treatment, including assessment of embryos as outcome measures, will be required prior to clinical translation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS FLI supplementation may have a conserved beneficial effect on IVM for children, adolescents, and young adults spanning the agricultural setting to clinical fertility preservation.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are considered to be signaling molecules in higher plants involved in the regulation of growth and development processes. However, the molecular mechanisms of their formation, removal, and participation in plant responses to adverse environmental stimuli remain largely unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of selected single stresses and combined stresses (i.e., Rhopalosiphum padi L. aphid infestation, drought, aphid infestation, and drought) and post-stress recovery on the contents of NO and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-), as well as the levels of mRNA and protein nitration (i.e., the 8-nitroguanine and protein 3-nitrotyrosine amounts, respectively), in maize seedlings (Zea mays L.). Moreover, the expression patterns of the two tested genes (nos-ip, encoding nitric oxide synthase-interacting protein, and nr1, encoding nitrate reductase 1) involved in NO metabolism in maize plants were quantified. We identified significant intervarietal, time-course, and stress-dependent differences in the levels of the quantified parameters. Under the investigated stress conditions, the aphid-resistant Waza cv. seedlings were characterized by a higher and earlier NO accumulation and mRNA nitration level and an increased expression of the two target genes (nos-ip and nr1), compared to the aphid-susceptible Z & lstrok;ota Kar & lstrok;owa cv. seedlings. Conversely, the Z & lstrok;ota Kar & lstrok;owa plants responded with a greater elevation in the content of ONOO- and protein 3-nitrotyrosine than the Waza cv. plants The multifaceted role of NO and its derivatives in maize plants challenged by single and combined stresses, as well as during post-stress recovery, is discussed.

AB  - A striking property of the auditory system is its capacity for the stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), which is the reduction of neural response to repeated stimuli but a recuperative response to novel stimuli. SSA is found in both the medial geniculate body (MGB) and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). However, it remains unknown whether the SSA of MGB neurons is modulated by inhibitory inputs from the TRN, as it is difficult to investigate using the extracellular recording method. In the present study, we performed intracellular recordings in the MGB of anesthetized guinea pigs and examined whether and how the TRN modulates the SSA of MGB neurons with inhibitory inputs. This was accomplished by using microinjection of lidocaine to inactivate the neural activity of the TRN. We found that (1) MGB neurons with hyperpolarized membrane potentials exhibited SSA at both the spiking and subthreshold levels; (2) SSA of MGB neurons depends on the interstimulus interval (ISI), where a shorter ISI results in stronger SSA; and (3) the long-lasting hyperpolarization of MGB neurons decreased after the burst firing of the TRN was inactivated. As a result, SSA of these MGB neurons was diminished after inactivation of the TRN. Taken together, our results revealed that the SSA of the MGB is strongly modulated by the neural activity of the TRN, which suggests an alternative circuit mechanism underlying the SSA of the auditory thalamus.

AB  - Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common respiratory inflammatory disease characterized by Th2 inflammatory response from exposure to allergens. The current study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of miR-155 in AR. Nasal mucosa tissue samples and nasal lavage fluid samples were obtained from patients diagnosed with AR and healthy subjects who served as the control. We found that the miR-155 expression was downregulated in AR patients while the expression of BACH1 was upregulated. miR-155 overexpression reduced apoptosis, the levels of IL-4 and IL-12 in AR nasal epithelial cells (NECs). CD4+T cells were treated with supernatant of NECs following miR-155 overexpression. miR-155 up-regulation elevated the ratio of Th1/Th2, reduced the levels of IL-4 and IL-5, elevated the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in CD4+T cells. Down-regulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3, upregulation of SOCS4, SOCS5 and SOCS6 were observed in CD4+T cells following treatment of NECs with miR-155 overexpression. Mechanically speaking, miR-155 activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by interacting with BACH1. miR-155 elevated Th1/Th2 proportion in CD4+T cells by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Moreover, an AR mouse model was also constructed, the frequency of sneezing, nose rubbing, and rhinorrhea were elevated. After treatment with miR-155 agomir, these symptoms were significantly alleviated. In conclusion, this work showed that miR-155 activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by targeting BACH1, thereby affecting Th1/Th2 balance in AR. Our findings suggest that miR-155 could hold promise as a novel AR therapy.

AB  - The stacking of impermissible materials in the disposal of dry fly ash is unprecedented in the last 40 years of power plant management in China, and their effect on the stability of the whole facility is uncertain. Due to the lack of relevant treatment experience, a more comprehensive method such as numerical modeling must be adopted for the final design. This paper set up a borehole database from geological logging data to obtain the distribution of the coal gangue solid waste. Then, it established an accurate three-dimensional mesh model through Rhino. Based on elastic-plastic mechanics, the finite difference code Flac3D 6.0 was employed to study the risk of the coal gangue as a dam foundation. A comparative analysis of the influence of the displacement method and the composite foundation method on subdam deformation and differential subsidence was conducted. The simulation revealed that the composite foundation method showed the best reductions: 70.57% in shear failure, 97.83% in tension failure, and 22.63% in maximum subsidence. Ultimately, the optimum stone column diameter of 0.5 m and the spacing of 6 m were proposed due to the standard deviation.

AB  - Coordination of synapses onto electrodes with high specificity and maintaining a stable and long-lasting interface have importance in the field of neural interfaces. One potential approach is to present ligands on the surface of electrodes that would be bound through a protein-protein interaction to specific areas of neuronal cells. Here, we functionalize electrode surfaces with genetically engineered neuroligin-1 protein and demonstrate the formation of a nascent presynaptic bouton upon binding to neurexin-1 beta on the presynaptic membrane of neurons. The resulting synaptically connected electrode shows an assembly of presynaptic proteins and comparable exocytosis kinetics to that of native synapses. Importantly, a neuroligin-1-induced synapse-electrode interface exhibits type specificity and structural robustness. We envision that the use of synaptic adhesion proteins in modified neural electrodes may lead to new approaches in the interfacing of neural circuity and electronics.

AB  - Since 2011, PRV has resurged in China and is characterized by a mutated strain with significant alterations in antigenicity and virulence. Therefore, we hypothesized that antibody detection kits based on classic PRV strains may have limitations in detecting PRV variants. For more sensitive antibody detection of PRV variants, two MABs targeting the gB and gE proteins were developed. IFA revealed that these MABs exhibited strong reactivity toward both classic and variant PRV strains. MAB-gE recognizes a novel conserved linear B -cell epitope (41PSAEVWD47), while MAB-gB recognizes a conformational B -cell epitope. The binding of both MABs was effectively inhibited in the PRV-positive pig blood samples. Accordingly, we established blocking-ELISAs to detect anti-PRV gB and gE antibodies, which achieved higher sensitivity than commercial kits. Moreover, the clinical serum samples results of our method and that of IFA were in high agreement, and our test results had a higher coincidence rate than that of a commercial kit. Assessing antibody levels by our methods at various times following immunization and challenge accurately reflected the trend of antibody -level changes and revealed the conversion to positive antibody status before the commercial kit. Our method is crucial for monitoring PRV infections, assessing immune responses, and controlling disease.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Diabetes is a systemic disease, which can cause synaptic defects in the hippocampus. Hippocampus plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Melissa officinalis L. has been used as for memory enhancement in Persian Medicine.
   Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the hydroalcoholic extract of Melissa officinalis L. on learning and memory, considering its impact on nitric oxide synthase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the hippocampus of diabetic rats.
   Materials and methods: Melissa officinalis L. extract was obtained by maceration method. To evaluate phenolic and flavonoid compounds of the extract, the samples were analyzed by HPLC. The animals were randomly divided into 6 groups: vehicle-treated control, Melissa officinalis-treated control (50 mg/kg), vehicle-treated diabetic, and M. officinalis-treated diabetic (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg). Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin And Melissa officinalis L. was administered for 2 weeks once diabetes was induced. Passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks were performed for learning and memory assessment. At the end of learning and memory tasks, rats were sacrificed and their hippocampus removed, lysed, and homogenized. The RNA contents were purified and then used as the template for cDNA synthesis. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate nitric oxide synthase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor genes expression.
   Results: Rutin was main flavonoid compound and rosmarinic acid was the main phenolic compound of the Melissa officinalis extract. Streptozotocin induced diabetes and impaired learning and memory in diabetic rats. Melissa officinalis treated-control group showed a higher alternation score in the Y-maze task and step-through latency in the passive avoidance task compared to the vehicle treated diabetic group. Melissa officinalis-treated rats showed a higher alternation score in the Y-maze task in all doses compared to the vehicle treated diabetic group (P < 0.05). In addition, in the passive avoidance task Melissa officinalis increased step-through latency (P < 0.05) but not initial latency, in all doses. Furthermore, in diabetic rats, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide synthase genes decreased. However, hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide synthase gene expression was increased in Melissa officinalis-treated rats compared to diabetic rats (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Melissa officinalis improved learning and memory in diabetic rats, which may have occurred by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide synthase gene expression.

AB  - In utero exposure to ionizing radiation can lead to cerebral alterations during adulthood. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is possible to assess radiation-induced structural brain damage noninvasively. However, little is currently known about microstructure alterations in brain tissue. Therefore, the goal of this study was to establish, based on an original and robust pipeline of MRI image analysis, whether the long-term effects of in utero radiation exposure on brain tissue microstructure could be detected noninvasively. Pregnant C57BL/6N mice received a single dose of 1 Gy on gestation day 14.5, which led to behavioral impairments in adults. At 3 months old, in vivo MRI data were acquired from in utero irradiated and nonirradiated male mice. An MRI protocol was designed to assess the effects of radiation on the parameters of brain volume, non-Gaussian diffusion (ADC(0), kurtosis and signature index) and anisotropic diffusion (fractional anisotropy and mean, axial, radial diffusivities and anisotropic signature index) in 10 key cerebral structures defined using an in-house atlas of the mouse brain. Based on the relative amplitude of these anatomical and microstructural changes, maps of the radiosensitivity of the brain to in utero irradiation were created. We observed microcephaly in irradiated mice with noticeably larger volume changes in the cortex and the corpus callosum. We also observed significantly lower ADC(0), anisotropy fraction (sFA), radial diffusivity (sRD), as well as signature index (S-index and SI3) values, which are original markers sensitive to tissue microstructure alterations. All these changes together are in favor of a decreased cellular "imprint'' and in some regions a reduced density in myelinated axons. A reduction in the number and complexity of myelinated axons was further revealed by myelin basic protein immunostaining.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS) generating neuropathic pain and anxiety. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is the most disabling clinical form, and the patients present an intense neurodegenerative process. In this context, the advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) are oxidized compounds and their accumulation in plasma has been related to clinical disability in MS patients. However, the involvement of AOPPs in neuropathic pain- and anxiety-like symptoms was not previously evaluated. To assess this, female mice C57BL/6J were used to induce progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (PMS-EAE). Clinical score, weight, strength of plantar pressure, rotarod test, mechanical allodynia, and cold hypersensitivity were evaluated before induction (baseline) and on days 7(th), 10(th), and 14(th) post-immunization. We assessed nest building, open field, and elevated plus-maze tests 13 days post-immunization. Animals were killed at 14 days post-immunization; then, AOPPs levels, NADPH oxidase, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord samples. The clinical score increased 14(th) post-immunization without changes in weight and mobility. Reduced paw strength, mechanical allodynia, and cold allodynia increased in the PMS-EAE animals. PMS-EAE mice showed spontaneous nociception and anxiety-like behavior. AOPPs concentration, NADPH oxidase, and MPO activity increase in CNS structures. Multivariate analyses indicated that the rise of AOPPs levels, NADPH oxidase, and MPO activity influenced the clinical score and cold allodynia. Thus, we indicated the association between non-stimuli painful perception, anxiety-like, and CNS oxidative damage in the PMS-EAE model.

AB  - Corticosteroids are stress-related hormones that maintain homeostasis. The most effective corticosteroids are corticosterone (CORT) in rodents and cortisol in primates. 11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1; EC 1.1.1.146), encoded by Hsd11b1, is a key regulator of the local concentration of CORT/cortisol. Hsd11b1 expression in layer 5 of the primary somatosensory cortex has been shown in adult mice. However, its localization in the entire neocortex, especially during development, has not been fully addressed. Here, we established robust and dynamic expression profiles of Hsd11b1 in the developing mouse neocortex. Hsd11b1 was found mostly in pyramidal neurons. By retrograde tracing, we observed that some Hsd11b1-positive cells were projection neurons, indicating that at least some were excitatory. At postnatal day 0 (P0), Hsd11b1 was expressed in the deep layer of the somatosensory cortex. Then, from P3 to P8, the expression area expanded broadly; it was observed in layers 4 and 5, spanning the whole neocortex, including the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary visual cortex (V1). The positive region gradually narrowed from P14 onwards and was ultimately limited to layer 5 of the somatosensory cortex at P26 and later. Furthermore, we administered CORT to nursing dams to increase the systemic CORT level of their pups. Here, we observed a reduced number of Hsd11b1-positive cells in the neocortex of these pups. Our observation suggests that Hsd11b1 expression in the developing neocortex is affected by systemic CORT levels. It is possible that stress on mothers influences the neocortical development of their children.

AB  - Xanthan gum (XG) and locust bean gum (LBG) are nontoxic polysaccharides that produce culture substrates. The present study examined the effect of XG-LBG gel on in vitro bovine oocyte growth and gene expression in granulosa cells. Oocytes and granulosa cell complexes (OGCs) were cultured in vitro on plastic culture plate (Plate) or XG-LBG gel for 16 days. OGCs formed a dome-like cavity surrounding the oocytes on plate but formed a spherical follicle structure on XG-LBG gel. The total granulosa cell numbers of the OGCs and their survival rate was greater for OGCs cultured on XG-LBG gel than for those cultured on plate. Oocytes grown on XG-LBG gels had higher lipid and mitochondrial content, as well as a larger diameter, than their plate counterparts. When oocytes grown in vitro were subjected to in vitro maturation and fertilization, the normal fertilization rate was significantly higher for oocytes developed on XG-LBG gel than that of oocytes cultured on the plate counterpart. RNAseq of the granulosa cells revealed that genes associated with focal adhesion, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-Akt and Hippo signaling, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton were upregulated in granulosa cells of OGCs cultured on XG-LBG gel compared with those cultured on plate.

AB  - DNA damage is a central contributor to the aging process. In the brain, a major threat to the DNA is the considerable amount of reactive oxygen species produced, which can inflict oxidative DNA damage. This type of damage is removed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway, an essential DNA repair mechanism, which contributes to genome stability in the brain. Despite the crucial role of the BER pathway, insights into how this pathway is affected by aging in the human brain and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are very limited. By microarray analysis of four cortical brain regions from humans aged 20-99 years (n = 57), we show that the expression of core BER genes is largely downregulated during aging across brain regions. Moreover, we find that expression of many BER genes correlates positively with the expression of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the human brain. In line with this, we identify binding sites for the BDNF-activated transcription factor, cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), in the promoter of most BER genes and confirm the ability of BDNF to regulate several BER genes by BDNF treatment of mouse primary hippocampal neurons. Together, these findings uncover the transcriptional landscape of BER genes during aging of the brain and suggest BDNF as an important regulator of BER in the human brain.

AB  - Persistent cognitive and mood dysfunction is the primary CNS symptom in veterans afflicted with Gulf War Illness (GWI). This study investigated the efficacy of melatonin (MEL) for improving cognitive and mood function with antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and pro-cognitive effects in a rat model of chronic GWI. Six months after exposure to GWI-related chemicals and stress, rats were treated with vehicle or MEL (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/ kg) for eight weeks. Behavioral tests revealed cognitive and mood dysfunction in GWI rats receiving vehicle, which were associated with elevated oxidative stress, reduced NRF2, catalase and mitochondrial complex proteins, astrocyte hypertrophy, activated microglia with NLRP3 inflammasomes, elevated proinflammatory cytokines, waned neurogenesis, and synapse loss in the hippocampus. MEL at 10 mg/kg alleviated simple and associative recognition memory dysfunction and anhedonia, along with reduced oxidative stress, enhanced glutathione and complex III, and reduced NLRP3 inflammasomes, IL-18, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. MEL at 20 mg/kg also normalized NRF2 and catalase and increased microglial ramification. MEL at 40 mg/kg, in addition, reduced astrocyte hypertrophy, activated microglia, NF-kB-NLRP3-caspase-1 signaling, IL-1 beta, MCP-1, and MIP-1 alpha. Moreover, MEL at 80 mg/kg activated the BDNF-ERK-CREB signaling pathway, enhanced neurogenesis and diminished synapse loss in the hippocampus, and improved a more complex hippocampus-dependent cognitive function. Thus, MEL therapy is efficacious for improving cognitive and mood function in a rat model of chronic GWI, and MEL's effect was dose-dependent. The study provides the first evidence of MEL's promise for alleviating neuroinflammation and cognitive and mood impairments in veterans with chronic GWI.

AB  - In wounded Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, four 13S-lipoxygenases (AtLOX2, AtLOX3, AtLOX4, AtLOX6) act in a hierarchical manner to contribute to the jasmonate burst. This leads to defense responses with LOX2 playing an important role in plant resistance against caterpillar herb-ivory. In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of AtLOX2 on wound-induced phytohormonal and transcriptional responses to foliar mechanical damage using wildtype (WT) and lox2 mutant plants. Compared with WT, the lox2 mutant had higher constitutive levels of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) and enhanced expression of SA-responsive genes. This suggests that AtLOX2 may be involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonates that are involved in the antagonism of SA biosynthesis. As expected, the jasmonate burst in response to wounding was dampened in lox2 plants. Generally, 1 h after wounding, genes linked to jasmonate biosynthesis, jasmonate signaling attenuation and abscisic acid-responsive genes, which are primarily involved in wound sealing and healing, were differentially regulated between WT and lox2 mutants. Twelve h after wounding, WT plants showed stronger expression of genes associated with plant protection against insect herbivory. This study highlights the dynamic nature of jasmonate-responsive gene expression and the contribution of AtLOX2 to this pathway and plant resistance against insects.

AB  - The otolith organs located in the inner ear of the fish are responsible for vital activities such as balance and hearing. Abnormalities in these organs can adversely affect the vital activities of the fish species. The main purpose of the study is to analyze the abnormalities in the otoliths of Sarpa salpa, known as the hallucinogenic fish. For that, 372 individuals of S. salpa are collected from the North Aegean Sea. As a result of the abnormality analyses in S. salpa otoliths, anomalies were detected such as various prominence structures on the surface of the otolith caused by accumulation and a more transparent appearance due to the different crystal structures in some parts of the otolith. These abnormalities were found in the left and/or right otoliths of male and female individuals in different total lengths. The percentage of individuals with abnormal otoliths of S. salpa is calculated as 52.42%. It was determined that there are statistical differences between the left and right otolith measurements of male and female individuals with abnormal and normal otoliths(p < 0.05). There is no relationship between the percentage of individuals showing abnormality and total length and sex. The current study presents for the first time abnormal otolith information on left and right otoliths in male and female S. salpa. It is thought that abnormalities in hallucinogenic fish otoliths could be related to genetic predisposition as well as stress due to nutritional preference, pollutants, and environmental factors.

AB  - The brown planthopper (BPH) impacts both rice yield and quality. The exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) has been previously shown to induce rice resistance to BPH; however, the regulation of rice-mediated defense by these plant growth regulators is unclear. We applied exogenous JA and ABA to rice and analyzed molecular responses to BPH infestation. Nine RNA libraries were sequenced, and 6218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were generated and annotated. After ABA + BPH and JA + BPH treatments, 3491 and 2727 DEGs, respectively, were identified when compared with the control (BPH alone). GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the expression of several JA pathway genes (OsAOS2, encoding allene oxide synthase; OsOPR, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase; and OsACOX, acy1-CoA oxidase) were significantly up-regulated after ABA + BPH treatment. Furthermore, exogenous JA increased the expression of genes involved in ABA synthesis. Meanwhile, the expression levels of genes encoding WRKY transcription factors, myelocytomatosis protein 2 (MYC2) and basic leucine zippers (bZIPs) were up-regulated significantly, indicating that ABA and JA might function together to increase the expression of transcription factors during the rice defense response. The DEGs identified in this study provide vital insights into the synergism between ABA and JA and further contribute to the mechanistic basis of rice resistance to BPH.

AB  - BackgroundProstate cancer (PCa) is a common malignant tumor of the genitourinary system. Clinical intervention in advanced PCa remains challenging. Tropomyosins 2 (TPM2) are actin-binding proteins and have been found as a biomarker candidate for certain cancers. However, no studies have explored the role of TPM2 in PCa and its regulatory mechanism.MethodsTPM2 expression was assessed in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PCa patient dataset. The effect of TPM2 on PCa progression was assessed in vitro and in vivo by quantifying proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth assays, and the mechanism of TPM2 in PCa progression was gradually revealed by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence staining arrays.ResultsTPM2 was found to be severely downregulated in tumor tissues of PCa patients compared with tumor-adjacent normal tissues. In vitro experiments revealed that TPM2 overexpression inhibited PCa cell proliferation, invasion and androgen-independent proliferation. Moreover, TPM2 overexpression inhibited the growth of subcutaneous xenograft tumors in vivo. Mechanistically, this effect was noted to be dependent on PDZ-binding motif of TPM2. TPM2 competed with YAP1 for binding to PDLIM7 through the PDZ-binding motif. The binding of TPM2 to PDLIM7 subsequently inhibited the nuclear transport function of PDLIM7 for YAP1. YAP1 sequestered in the cytoplasm phosphorylated at S127, resulting in its inactivation or degradation which in turn inhibited the expression of YAP1 downstream target genes.ConclusionsThis study investigated the role of TPM2, PDLIM7, and YAP1 in PCa progression and castration resistance. TPM2 attenuates progression of PCa by blocking PDLIM7-mediated nuclear translocation of YAP1. Accordingly, targeting the expression or functional modulation of TPM2, PDLIM7, or YAP1 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic approach to reduce PCa proliferation and prevent the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

AB  - The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande, is an invasive pest that damages agricultural and horticultural crops. The induction of plant defenses and RNA interference (RNAi) technology are potent pest control strategies. This study investigated whether the anti-adaptive ability of F. occidentalis to jasmonic acid (JA)- and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced defenses in kidney bean plants was attenuated after glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene knockdown. The expression of four GSTs in thrips fed JA- and MeJA-induced leaves was analyzed, and FoGSTd1 and FoGSTs1 were upregulated. Exogenous JA- and MeJA-induced defenses led to increases in defensive secondary metabolites (tannins, alkaloids, total phenols, flavonoids, and lignin) in leaves. Metabolome analysis indicated that the JA-induced treatment of leaves led to significant upregulation of defensive metabolites. The activity of GSTs increased in second-instar thrips larvae fed JA- and MeJA-induced leaves. Co-silencing with RNAi simultaneously knocked down FoGSTd1 and FoGSTs1 transcripts and GST activity, and the area damaged by second-instar larvae feeding on JA- and MeJA-induced leaves decreased by 62.22% and 55.24%, respectively. The pupation rate of second-instar larvae also decreased by 39.68% and 39.89%, respectively. Thus, RNAi downregulation of FoGSTd1 and FoGSTs1 reduced the anti-adaptive ability of F. occidentalis to JA- or MeJA-induced defenses in kidney bean plants.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the histone deacetylase (HDAC) activator ITSA-1 can ameliorate systemic inflammation after cardiac arrest (CA), thereby enhancing cardiac function and neurological outcomes in rats. Materials and Methods: Sixty-nine healthy adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 12 min of CA induced by Vecuronium bromide. The rats were randomly assigned to five groups: normal control, sham operation, control, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and ITSA-1. The study evaluated the effects of ITSA-1 on cardiac function, survival, and neurological functions, including the neurological deficit score (NDS) at 24-, 48-, and 72-h post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and Morris water maze performance at 72 h. Additionally, levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100 beta in plasma, and TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta in the hippocampus were measured 4 h post-ROSC. Western blot analysis was used to assess HDACs, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), p-NF-kappa B, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax protein expressions. Results: ITSA-1 reduced basic life support (BLS) duration and adrenaline dosage during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and improved cardiac and neural functions, enhancing survival compared to the control and SAHA groups. ITSA-1 decreased serum levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, GFAP, S100 beta, and hippocampal TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, promoting neuronal survival in the CA1 region. It also inhibited glial cell activation and reduced histone acetylation, blocking the NF-kappa B pathway and neuronal apoptosis. Conclusion: ITSA-1 enhances the recovery and survival of post-ROSC rats by diminishing histone acetylation and mitigating systemic inflammation. This effect is possibly due to the inhibition of glial cell activation, increased neuronal survival in the brain, and improved cardiac output (CO) and ejection fraction (EF).

AB  - Diabetes, mobile phone use, and obesity have increased simultaneously in recent years. The radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitted from mobile phones is largely absorbed in the heads of users. With 5 G, which has started to be used in some countries without the necessary precautions being taken, the amount of RFR to which living things are exposed will increase. In this study, the changes in energy homeostasis and redox balance caused by 5 G (3.5 GHz, GSM-modulated) were explored. The effects of RFR on the brains of diabetic and healthy rats were investigated and histopathological analysis was performed. Twenty-eight Wistar albino rats weighing 200-250 g were divided into 4 groups as sham, RFR, diabetes, and RFR+diabetes groups (n = 7). The rats in each group were kept in a plexiglass carousel for 2 h a day for 30 days. While the rats in the experimental groups were exposed to RFR for 2 h a day, the rats in the sham group were kept under the same experimental conditions but with the radiofrequency generator turned off. At the end of the experiment, brain tissues were collected from euthanized rats. Total antioxidant (TAS), total oxidant (TOS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ghrelin, nesfatin-1, and irisin levels were determined. In addition, histopathological analyses of the brain tissues were performed. The specific absorption rate in the gray matter of the brain was calculated as 323 mW/kg and 195 mW/kg for 1 g and 10 g averaging, respectively. After RFR exposure among diabetic and healthy rats, decreased TAS levels and increased TOS and H2O2 levels were observed in brain tissues. RFR caused increases in ghrelin and irisin and a decrease in nesfatin-1 in the brain. It was also observed that RFR increased the number of degenerated neurons in the hippocampus. Our results indicate that 3.5 GHz RFR causes changes in the energy metabolism and appetite of both healthy and diabetic rats. Thus, 5 G may not be innocent in terms of its biological effects, especially in the presence of diabetes.

AB  - Plants are known to increase the emission of volatile organic compounds upon the damage of phytophagous insects. However, very little is known about the composition and temporal dynamics of volatiles released by wild plants of the genus Crotalaria (Fabaceae) attacked with the specialist lepidopteran caterpillar Utetheisa ornatrix (Linnaeus) (Erebidae). In this work, the herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV) emitted by Crotalaria nitens Kunth plants were isolated with solid phase micro-extraction and the conventional purge and trap technique, and their identification was carried out by GC/MS. The poly-dimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber showed higher affinity for the extraction of apolar compounds (e.g., trans-beta-caryophyllene) compared to the Porapak (TM)-Q adsorbent from the purge & trap method that extracted more polar compounds (e.g., trans-nerolidol and indole). The compounds emitted by C. nitens were mainly green leaf volatile substances, terpenoids, aromatics, and aldoximes (isobutyraldoxime and 2-methylbutyraldoxime), whose maximum emission was six hours after the attack. The attack by caterpillars significantly increased the volatile compounds emission in the C. nitens leaves compared to those subjected to mechanical damage. This result indicated that the U. ornatrix caterpillar is responsible for generating a specific response in C. nitens plants. It was demonstrated that HIPVs repelled conspecific moths from attacked plants and favored oviposition in those without damage. The results showed the importance of volatiles in plant-insect interactions, as well as the choice of appropriate extraction and analytical methods for their study.

AB  - Learning never stops. As we navigate life, we continuously acquire and update knowledge to optimize memory-guided action, with a gradual shift from the former to the latter as we master our environment. How are these learning dynamics expressed in the brain and in behavioral patterns? Here, we devised a spatiotemporal image learning task ("Memory Arena") in which participants learn a set of 50 items to criterion across repeated exposure blocks. Critically, brief task-free periods between successive image presentations allowed us to assess multivariate electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns representing the previous and/or upcoming image identity, as well as anticipatory eye movements toward the upcoming image location. As expected, participants eventually met the performance criterion, albeit with different learning rates. During task-free periods, we were able to readily decode representations of both previous and upcoming image identities. Importantly though, decoding strength followed opposing slopes for previous vs. upcoming images across time, with a gradual decline of evidence for the previous image and a gradual increase of evidence for the upcoming image. Moreover, the ratio of upcoming vs. previous image evidence directly followed behavioral learning rates. Finally, eye movement data revealed that participants increasingly used the task-free period to anticipate upcoming image locations, with target-precision slopes paralleling both behavioral performance measures as well as EEG decodability of the upcoming image across time. Together, these results unveil the neural and behavioral dynamics underlying the gradual transition from learning to memory-guided action.

AB  - The development of animal models to study cell death in the brain is a delicate task. One of the models, that was discovered in the late eighties, is the induction of neurodegeneration through glucocorticoid withdrawal by adrenalectomy in albino rats. Such a model is one of the few noninvasive models for studying neurodegeneration. In the present study, using stereological technique and ultrastructural examination, we aimed to investigate the impact of short-term adrenalectomy (2 weeks) on different hippocampal neuronal populations in Wistar rats. In addition, the underlying mechanism(s) of degeneration in these neurons were investigated by measuring the levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and beta-nerve growth factor (beta-NGF). Moreover, we examined whether the biochemical and histological changes in the hippocampus, after short-term adrenalectomy, have an impact on the cognitive behavior of Wistar rats. Stereological counting in the hippocampus revealed significant neuronal deaths in the dentate gyrus and CA4/CA3, but not in the CA2 and CA1 areas, 7 and 14 days post adrenalectomy. The ultrastructural examinations revealed degenerated and degenerating neurons in the dentate, as well as CA4, and CA3 areas, over the course of 3, 7 and 14 days. The levels of IGF-1 were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of ADX rats 24 h post adrenalectomy, and lasted over the course of two weeks. However, beta-NGF was not affected in rats. Using a passive avoidance task, we found a cognitive deficit in the ADX compared to the SHAM operated rats over time (3, 7, and 14 days). In conclusion, both granule and pyramidal cells were degenerated in the hippocampus following short-term adrenalectomy. The early depletion of IGF-1 might play a role in hippocampal neuronal degeneration. Consequently, the loss of the hippocampal neurons after adrenalectomy leads to cognitive deficits.

AB  - MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has been reported to exert a neu-roprotective effect. However, the specific role and mech-anism of miR-22 in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury are still not known well. In this study, we evaluated whether miR-22 participates in I/R-induced neuronal injury and the potential mechanism by us-ing an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in vitro. Our results showed that miR-22 was sig-nificantly down-regulated in SH-SY5Y cells suffering from OGD/R. Up-regulation of miR-22 by its specific mimic could protect SH-SY5Y cells against OGD/R-induced in-jury. The luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) was a direct target of miR-22. MiR-22 mimic obviously inhib-ited Tiam1 expression in OGD/R-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Tiam1 siRNA could attenuate OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury. In addition, Tiam1 siRNA reduced the activa-tion of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) in OGD/R-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, and up-regulation of Rac1 activity could attenuate the neuroprotective effect of miR-22 up-regulation. Furthermore, OGD/R exposure led to increased methylation of miR-22, and the demeth-ylating agent 5-Aza-dC significantly up-regulated miR-22 expression and inhibited Tiam1 expression and Rac1 ac-tivation. Taken together, our results demonstrated that DNA methylation-mediated miR-22 down-regulation ag-gravated I/R-induced neuron injury by promoting the activation of Tiam1/Rac1 signals. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of I/R-induced brain injury and suggest that miR-22 may be a promising therapeutic tar-get for this disease.

AB  - The anterolateral motor cortex of rodents is an important motor auxiliary area, and its function is similar to that of the premotor area in humans. Activation and inhibition of the contralesional anterolateral motor cortex (cALM) have been shown to have direct effects on motor behavior. However, the significance of cALM activation and inhibition in the treatment of stroke remains unclear. This study investigated the role of optogenetic cALM stimulation in a mouse model of cerebral stroke. The results showed that 21-day optogenetic cALM inhibition, but not activation, improved neurological function. In addition, optogenetic cALM stimulation substantially altered dendritic structural reorganization and dendritic spine plasticity, as optogenetic cALM inhibition resulted in increased dendritic length, number of dendritic spines, and number of perforated synapses, whereas optogenetic activation led to an increase in the number of multiple synapse boutons and the number of dendritic intersections. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that multiple biological processes regulated by the cALM were upregulated immediately after optogenetic cALM inhibition, and that several immediate-early genes (including cFOS, Erg1, and Sema3f) were expressed at higher levels after optogenetic inhibition than after optogenetic activation. These results were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Finally, immunofluorescence analysis showed that the c-FOS signal in layer V of the primary motor cortex in the ischemic hemisphere was higher after optogenetic cALM activation than it was after optogenetic cALM inhibition. Taken together, these findings suggest that optogenetic cALM stimulation promotes neural reorganization in the primary motor cortex of the ischemic hemisphere, and that optogenetic cALM inhibition and activation have different effects on neural plasticity. The study was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Fudan University (approval No. 201802173S) on March 3, 2018.

AB  - Food packaging has to preserve food products, not only providing protection against mechanical factors, but also providing antioxidant and antimicrobial protection. This article describes the effects of PBS film modification with two sea buckthorn extracts (chloroform extract and supercritical CO2 extract) at two different concentrations (1 or 5 g per 100 g of polymer). The films were tested to determine the effect of the active additive on optical properties, mechanical properties, moisture sorption, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties (against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans). The extracts improved free radical scavenging significantly (up to 41.13 +/- 1.31% for PBS-CO2 0.05) and reduced the number of microorganisms studied (more than a 6000-fold reduction for E. coli, a 1400-fold reduction in S. aureus and a 1200-fold reduction in C. albicans). The ability to block UV radiation was dependent on the concentration of extracts in the polymer matrix. No significant changes were noticed for mechanical properties or FTIR spectra. The films obtained appear to be potential packaging materials for food products with special protective properties.

AB  - The hippocampus is essential for human memory.(1) The protracted maturation of memory capacities from infancy through early childhood(2-4) is thus often attributed to hippocampal immaturity.(5-7) The hippocampus of human infants has been characterized in terms of anatomy,(8,9) but its function has never been tested directly because of technical challenges.(10,11) Here, we use recently developed methods for task-based fMRI in awake human infants(12) to test the hypothesis that the infant hippocampus supports statistical learning.(13-15) Hippocampal activity increased with exposure to visual sequences of objects when the temporal order contained regularities to be learned, compared to when the order was random. Despite the hippocampus doubling in anatomical volume across infancy, learning-related functional activity bore no relationship to age. This suggests that the hippocampus is recruited for statistical learning at the youngest ages in our sample, around 3 months. Within the hippocampus, statistical learning was clearer in anterior than posterior divisions. This is consistent with the theory that statistical learning occurs in the monosynaptic pathway,(16) which is more strongly represented in the anterior hippocampus.(17,18) The monosynaptic pathway develops earlier than the trisynaptic pathway, which is linked to episodic memory,(19,20) raising the possibility that the infant hippocampus participates in statistical learning before it forms durable memories. Beyond the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex showed statistical learning, consistent with its role in adult memory integration(21) and generalization.(22) These results suggest that the hippocampus supports the vital ability of infants to extract the structure of their environment through experience.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world, which seriously affects AD patients' life quality. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play a key role in AD pathogenesis, however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA NKILA in AD. The learning and memory performance of rats from streptozotocin (STZ)-treated or other treated groups were tested by Morris water maze test. Relative levels of genes and proteins were measured using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Mitochondrial membrane potential was tested by JC-1 staining. Levels of ROS, SOD, MDA, GSH-Px, and LDH were measured using corresponding commercial kits. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining or Flow cytometry assay. RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pulldown, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and dual-luciferase reporter assays were utilized to test the interaction between indicated molecules. STZ treatment caused learning and memory impairment in rats and oxidative stress damage in SH-SY5Y cells. LncRNA NKILA was found to be elevated in the hippocampal tissues of rats and SH-SY5Y cells after STZ exposure. Knockdown of lncRNA NKILA alleviated STZ-induced neuronal damage. Furthermore, lncRNA NKILA could bind to ELAVL1, which regulate the stability of FOXA1 mRNA. Moreover, TNFAIP1 transcription process was controlled by FOXA1, which targeted the promoter of TNFAIP1. In vivo results demonstrated that lncRNA NKILA accelerated STZ-induced neuronal damage and oxidative stress by FOXA1/TNFAIP1 axis. Our findings indicated that knockdown of lncRNA NKILA inhibited the neuronal damage and oxidative stress induced by STZ through the FOXA1/TNFAIP1 axis, thereby alleviating the development of AD, revealing a promising therapeutic axis for AD treatment.

AB  - Few studies describe the sequence of morphological events that characterize spermiogenesis in birds. In this paper, the clearly observable steps of spermiogenesis are described and illustrated for the first time in a commercially important ratite, the ostrich, based on light microscopy of toluidine blue-stained plastic sections. Findings were supplemented and supported by ultrastructural observations, PNA labeling of acrosome development, and immunocytochemical labeling of isolated spermatogenic cells. Spermiogenesis in the ostrich followed the general pattern described in non-passerine birds. Eight steps were identified based on changes in nuclear shape and contents, positioning of the centriolar complex, and acrosome development. Only two steps could be recognized with certainty during development of the round spermatid which contributed to the fewer steps recorded for the ostrich compared to that described in some other bird species. The only lectin that displayed acrosome reactivity was PNA and only for the first three steps of spermiogenesis. This suggests that organizational and/or compositional changes may occur in the acrosome during development and merits further investigation. Immunological labeling provided additional evidence to support the finding of previous studies that the tip of the nucleus in the ostrich is shaped by the forming acrosome and not by the microtubular manchette. To our knowledge, this is the first complete description of spermiogenesis in ostrich and one of few in any avian species. In addition to comparative reproduction and animal science, this work has implications for evolutionary biology as the reported germ cell features provide a bridge between reptile and ratite-avian spermatogenesis.

AB  - Background Aging and neurodegenerative diseases are typical metabolic-related processes. As a metabolism-related long non-coding RNA, EPB41L4A-AS has been reported to be potentially involved in the development of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we sought to reveal the mechanisms of EPB41L4A-AS in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Methods Human hippocampal gene expression profiles downloaded from the Genotype-Tissue Expression database were analyzed to obtain age-stratified differentially expressed genes; a weighted correlation network analysis algorithm was then used to construct a gene co-expression network of these differentially expressed genes to obtain gene clustering modules. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, protein-protein interaction network, and correlation analysis were used to reveal the role of EPB41L4A-AS1. The mechanism was verified using Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE5281 and biological experiments (construction of cell lines, Real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot, measurement of ATP and NAD(+) levels, nicotinamide riboside treatment, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) in neurons and glial-derived cells. Results EPB41L4A-AS1 was downregulated in aging and Alzheimer's disease. EPB41L4A-AS1 related genes were found to be enriched in the electron transport chain and NAD(+) synthesis pathway. Furthermore, these genes were highly associated with neurodegenerative diseases and positively correlated with EPB41L4A-AS1. In addition, biological experiments proved that the downregulation of EPB41L4A-AS1 could reduce the expression of these genes via histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation, resulting in decreased NAD(+) and ATP levels, while EPB41L4A-AS1 overexpression and nicotinamide riboside treatment could restore the NAD(+) and ATP levels. Conclusions Downregulation of EPB41L4A-AS1 not only disturbs NAD(+) biosynthesis but also affects ATP synthesis. As a result, the high demand for NAD(+) and ATP in the brain cannot be met, promoting the development of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, overexpression of EPB41L4A-AS1 and nicotinamide riboside, a substrate of NAD(+) synthesis, can reduce EPB41L4A-AS1 downregulation-mediated decrease of NAD(+) and ATP synthesis. Our results provide new perspectives on the mechanisms underlying brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene is crucial in developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNA generated through back-splicing, resulting in a covalently closed circular molecule. This study aimed to investigate PSEN1-gene-derived circular RNAs (circPSEN1s) and their potential functions in AD. Our in silico analysis indicated that circPSEN1s (hsa_circ_0008521 and chr14:73614502-73614802) act as sponge molecules for eight specific microRNAs. Surprisingly, two of these miRNAs (has-mir-4668-5p and has-mir-5584-5p) exclusively interact with circPSEN1s rather than mRNA-PSEN1. Furthermore, the analysis of pathways revealed that these two miRNAs predominantly target mRNAs associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. With sponging these microRNAs, circPSEN1s were found to protect mRNAs commonly targeted by these miRNAs, including QSER1, BACE2, RNF157, PTMA, and GJD3. Furthermore, the miRNAs sequestered by circPSEN1s have a notable preference for targeting the TGF-beta and Hippo signaling pathways. We also demonstrated that circPSEN1s potentially interact with FOXA1, ESR1, HNF1B, BRD4, GATA4, EP300, CBX3, PRDM9, and PPARG proteins. These proteins have a prominent preference for targeting the TGF-beta and Notch signaling pathways, where EP300 and FOXA1 have the highest number of protein interactions. Molecular docking analysis also confirms the interaction of these hub proteins and A beta 42 with circPSEN1s. Interestingly, circPSEN1s-targeted molecules (miRNAs and proteins) impacted TGF-beta, which served as a shared signaling pathway. Finally, the analysis of microarray data unveiled distinct expression patterns of genes influenced by circPSEN1s (WTIP, TGIF, SMAD4, PPP1CB, and BMPR1A) in the brains of AD patients. In summary, our findings suggested that the interaction of circPSEN1s with microRNAs and proteins could affect the fate of specific mRNAs, interrupt the function of unique proteins, and influence cell signaling pathways, generally TGF-beta. Further research is necessary to validate these findings and gain a deeper understanding of the precise mechanisms and significance of circPSEN1s in the context of AD.

AB  - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder. A variety of molecular and cellular abnormalities leads to behavioral deficits in autism. Nevertheless, its etiology and treatment strategy are not completely understood. Oxytocin has recently shown improvements in social functioning. This study aimed to evaluate the necroptosis pathway for the neuroprotective effects of oxytocin in the valproic acid-induced autism spectrum disorder model. The autism spectrum disorder was induced by valproic acid on gestational day 12.5 (600 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Offspring received intranasal oxytocin (1 & mu;g/& mu;L) on the 21st and 40th days after birth. The offspring behaviors were scrutinized by self-grooming, marble-burying, three-chamber, and Morris water maze tests. Western blot was performed on the hippocampus and amygdala tissues to investigate the expression of RIP3 and MLKL markers. The valproic acid group demonstrated more anxiety, repetitive behaviors, and expression of RIP3 and MLKL markers, and less social interaction and spatial memory compared with the control group. Oxytocin considerably improved social interactions, preference for social novelty, and memory. The elevated expression of RIP3 and MLKL markers in valproic acid-induced autistic rats were alleviated after treatment with oxytocin. We also highlighted the importance of age and gender in autism spectrum disorder interventions. Our findings suggested that oxytocin administration was as an effective treatment in two areas of repetitive/stereotyped behaviors, social interactions/cognitive function. Notably, early administration of oxytocin resulted in better therapeutic responses in autism-like behaviors. The molecular tests introduce oxytocin as a potential candidate for reducing the expression of necroptosis mediators in the brain. This reinforced our hypothesis that the necroptosis pathway takes part in autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - We describe the antioxidant capability of scavenging the superoxide radical of several tea and yerba mate samples using rotating ring-disk electrochemistry (RRDE). We directly measured superoxide concentrations and detected their decrease upon the addition of an antioxidant to the electrochemical cell. We studied two varieties of yerba mate, two varieties of black tea from Bangladesh, a sample of Pu-erh tea from China, and two components, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid. All of these plant infusions and components showed strong antioxidant activities, virtually annihilating the available superoxide concentration. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we describe a mechanism of superoxide scavenging via caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Superoxide can initially interact at two sites in these acids: the H4 catechol hydrogen (a) or the acidic proton of the acid (b). For (a), caffeic acid needs an additional pi-pi superoxide radical, which transfers electron density to the ring and forms a HO2- anion. A second caffeic acid proton and HO2- anion forms H2O2. Chlorogenic acid acts differently, as the initial approach of superoxide to the catechol moiety (a) is enough to form the HO2- anion. After an additional acidic proton of chlorogenic acid is given to HO2-, three well-separated compounds arise: (1) a carboxylate moiety, (2) H2O2, and a (3) chlorogenic acid semiquinone. The latter can capture a second superoxide in a pi-pi manner, which remains trapped due to the aromatic ring, as for caffeic acid. With enough of both acids and superoxide radicals, the final products are equivalent: H2O2 plus a complex of the type [X-acid-eta-O-2], X = caffeic, chlorogenic. Chlorogenic acid (b) is described by the following reaction: 2 O-2(center dot-) + 2 chlorogenic acid -> 2 chlorogenic carboxylate + O-2 + H2O2, and so, it acts as a non-enzymatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, as shown via the product formation of O-2 plus H2O2, which is limited due to chlorogenic acid consumption. Caffeic acid (b) differs from chlorogenic acid, as there is no acidic proton capture via superoxide. In this case, approaching a second superoxide to the H4 polyphenol moiety forms a HO2- anion and, later, an H2O2 molecule upon the transfer of a second caffeic acid proton.

AB  - Depression is a common disease that affects 3.8% of the global population. Despite various antidepressant treatments, one-third of patients do not respond to antidepressants, therefore augmentation with mood stabilizers such as lithium may be required in this group. One of the suggested pathomechanisms of depression is the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and recent reports showed that microRNAs (miRNA) can impact its activity by epigenetic regulation. We aimed to explore the miRNA expression profile in the depression model and its changes upon short-term and chronic lithium treatment in the rat brain (pituitary, hypothalamus, and hippocampus). We used a chronic mild stress rat model of depression and short- and long-term lithium treatment. The behavior was assessed by an open-field test. The miRNA expression profile in the pituitary was estimated by sequencing and validated in the hypothalamus and hippocampus with qPCR. We found several miRNAs in the pituitary that were significantly altered between CMS-exposed and control rats as well as after short- and long-term lithium treatment. MicroRNAs chosen for validation in the hypothalamus and hippocampus (rno-miR-146a-5p, rno-miR-127-3p) showed no significant changes in expression. We performed in silico analysis and estimated potential pathways involved in lithium action for miRNAs differentially expressed in the pituitary at different time points. Specific microRNA subsets showed altered expression in the pituitary in depression model upon short- and long-term lithium treatment. We identified that biological pathways of target genes for these altered miRNAs differ, with the Foxo pathway potentially involved in disease development.

AB  - Estrogens have been demonstrated to inhibit age-related cognitive decline via binding to estrogen receptors (ERs). As a natural flavonoid component of Cuscuta Chinensis Lam., Kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (K-3-G) not only possesses anti-neuroinflammatory potential but also functions as an agonist for ER alpha and ER beta. This study aimed to determine whether K-3-G improved cognition during the aging process, with an emphasis on its effect on microglial inflammation. In vivo, K-3-G (5 or 10 mg/kg/day) was orally given to the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice from six to eight-month old. In addition to mitigating the memory and learning deficits of SAMP8 mice, K-3-G upregulated the expression of ER alpha and ER beta in their hippocampal CA1 region, with the higher dose being more effective. Less Iba-1+ microglial cells presented in SAMP8 mice treated with K-3-G. The formation of NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) complex, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress-related markers, as well as expression of pro-apoptotic proteins were reduced by K-3-G. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells exposed to oligomeric amyloid beta (A beta)1-42 were treated with 100 mu M K3-G. K-3-G showed similar anti-inflammatory effects on BV2 cells as in vivo. K-3-G-induced alterations were partly diminished by fulvestrant, an ER antagonist. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter system demonstrated that K-3-G induced ER expression by activating the transcription of estrogen-response elements (EREs). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that K-3-G may be a novel therapeutic agent for senescence-related cognitive impairment by inhibiting microglial inflammation through its action on ERs.

AB  - The targeted removal of A beta 33-42 accumulation in vivo emerges as a promising strategy for Alzheimer 's disease (AD) treatment, offering potential avenues for the development of innovative anti -AD therapeutics. In this study, the effect of curcumin (Cur) with AD therapeutic potential on the cellular mechanical properties of A beta 33-42 fibrilinduced neurons injury in the hippocampus of mice has been explored. The results showed that Cur had no obvious toxicity and side effects on neuronal cells and could significantly inhibit A beta 33-42 -induced cell damage and improve cell survival. The measurements of cell mechanical properties revealed that Cur could restore the mechanical properties of damaged cells to a large extent. In addition, the inhibition mechanism of Cur on A beta 33-42 - induced damage cell model was explained, which provides clues for the development of new drugs for the AD treatment.

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore the effects of degradable biomaterial self-polypeptide nanofiber scaffolds plus bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the behavior and neurological function of rats with focal ischemic cerebral infarction (ICI). BMSCs were isolated and cultured. The self-assembling peptides and BMSCs were mixed to prepare self-assembling peptides/BMSCs (SAP/BMSCs) material. BMSCs and SAP/BMSCs were injected into the carotid artery of rats in Model group. The rats without ligation were used as Sham group. Longa 5 and modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) of each group were evaluated. The adhesive removal test and forelimb asymmetry test were used to examine the behavior of the rats. The brain tissues were collected, and the infarct size, neuronal apoptosis, and the protein expression of Nogo-A and lipoprotein a (LPA) in the hippocampus were detected by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot. The results indicated that the fiber diameter of the self-polymerizing peptide material was about 12 nm, and the length was about 100-250 nm. The cells grew well after composite BMSCs. Compared with Sham group, Longa 5, mNSS score, adhesive removal time, forelimb asymmetry test score, cerebral infarction volume, and neuronal apoptosis rate were increased, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were raised, IL-10 was decreased, and Nogo-A and LPA protein was increased in Model group (P < 0.05). As against Model group, Longa 5, mNSS score, adhesive removal time, forelimb asymmetry test score, cerebral infarction volume, neuronal apoptosis rate, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were clearly decreased, and IL-10 was raised, and Nogo-A and LPA protein was clearly decreased in BMSCs and SAP/BMSCs groups (P < 0.05). As against BMSCs group, Longa 5, mNSS score, adhesive removal time, forelimb asymmetry test score, cerebral infarction volume, and neuronal apoptosis rate were clearly decreased, and IL-6 and TNF-alpha were decreased, and IL-10 was raised, and Nogo- A and LPA protein was decreased in SAP/BMSCs group (P < 0.05). Early transplantation of BMSCs can improve the neurobehavioral symptoms of ICI rats and inhibit neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory response. The effect of self-polymerizing peptide nanofiber scaffold plus BMSCs transplantation in ICI is superior to the transplantation of BMSCs alone.

AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that mainly threatens newborn piglets and poses a potential broad cross-species transmission risk. The antigenic epitopes of PDCoV are currently unidentified, and no information about T cell epitopes is available. Here, T-cell epitopes of PDCoV structural proteins were predicted using computational methods. 17 epitope peptides were synthesized and then screened using ELIspot, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and RT-qPCR detection of IFN-& gamma; mRNA to evaluate their ability to elicit interferon-gamma (IFN-& gamma;) responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PDCoV-challenged pigs. Five peptides (M1, M2, M3, N6, and S4) elicited high levels of IFN-& gamma; and were investigated further as potential T-cell epitope candidates. All five peptides were cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, and two peptides (M3, N6) were recognized simultaneously by CD8 + and CD4 + T cells. A multi-epitope peptide combining the five epitopes (designated "5T") was synthesized and its immune response and protection efficacy was evaluated in a piglet model. ELISpot assay results indicated that 5T induces robust epitope-specific cellular immune responses. Four epitopes (M1, M2, N6, S4) elicited IFN-& gamma; responses in 5T-vaccinated piglets. No obvious protection efficacy was detected in piglets vaccinated with 5T alone. Our results provide valuable information concerning PDCoV-related antigenic epitopes and will be useful in the design of epitope-based vaccines.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of cognitive decline. The alarming epidemiological features of Alzheimer's disease, combined with the high failure rate of candidate drugs tested in the preclinical phase, impose more intense investigations for new curative treatments. NRF2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2) plays a critical role in the inflammatory response and in the cellular redox homeostasis and provides cytoprotection in several diseases including those in the neurodegeneration spectrum. These roles suggest that NRF2 and its directly associated proteins may be novel attractive therapeutic targets in the fight against AD. In this study, through a systemics perspective, we propose an in silico drug repurposing approach for AD, based on the NRF2 interactome and regulome, with the aim of highlighting possible repurposed drugs for AD. Using publicly available information based on differential ex-pressions of the NRF2-neighborhood in AD and through a computational drug repurposing pipeline, we derived to a short list of candidate repurposed drugs and small molecules that affect the expression levels of the majority of NRF2-partners. The relevance of these findings was assessed in a four-step computational meta-analysis including i) structural similarity comparisons with currently ongoing NRF2-related drugs in clinical trials ii) evaluation based on the NRF2-diseasome iii) comparison of relevance between targeted pathways of shortlisted drugs and NRF2-related drugs in clinical trials and iv) further comparison with existing knowledge on AD and NRF2-related drugs in clinical trials based on their known modes of action. Overall, our analysis yielded in 5 candidate repurposed drugs for AD. In cell culture, these 5 candidates activated a luciferase reporter for NRF2 activity and in hippocampus derived TH22 cells they increased NRF2 protein levels and the NRF2 transcriptional signatures as determined by increased expression of its downstream target heme oxygenase 1. We expect that our proposed candidate repurposed drugs will be useful for further research and clinical translation for AD.

AB  - Preeclampsia is an obstetric disorder and remains the leading contributor to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. This study was designed to explore the role of hsa_circ_0001740 in preeclampsia as well as its underlying mechanism. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine hsa_circ_0001740 and miR-188-3p levels in trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo. The proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of HTR-8/SVneo cells were detected using cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, transwell, and terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling assays, respectively. The expression of apoptosis- and Hippo signaling-related proteins were assessed by western blot. Moreover, the binding relationship between hsa_circ_0001740 and miR-188-3p, miR-188-3p and ARRDC3 were verified by luciferase report assay. The results showed that hsa_circ_001740 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Hsa_circ_0001740 was verified to bind to miR-188-3p, and ARRDC3 was demonstrated to be a target of miR-188-3p. miR-188-3p overexpression partially counteracted the suppressive effects of hsa_circ_001740 overexpression on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. What's more, ARRDC3 expression was upregulated by hsa_circ_001740-overexpression but was downregulated by miR-188-3p overexpression. Hsa_circ_001740/miR-188-3p also mediated Hippo signaling. To summarize, hsa_circ_0001740 could maintain trophoblast cell function via downregulating miR-188-3p, providing a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of preeclampsia.

AB  - As one genotype of porcine circovirus (PCV) identified in 2016, PCV3 has brought huge hidden dangers to the global swine industry together with PCV2. Virus-like particles (VLPs) of capsid protein (Cap) of PCV2 serve as an alternative nano-antigen delivery strategy to efficiently induce antiviral immune response against PCV2 and/or other covalently displayed swine pathogens. However, the current understanding is limited on the capability of PCV3 as a nano-vaccine vehicle. Here we systematically compared the characteristics and the immunogenic efficacy of PCV3 Cap (Cap3) and PCV2 Cap (Cap2) in a VLP form. Cap3 VLPs presented higher internalization efficiency into cells and cytokines production compared to those of Cap2. Meanwhile, cross-reactive immunity between Cap3 VLPs and Cap2 VLPs was detected. Furthermore, to evaluate the function of Cap3 VLPs and Cap2 VLPs as vaccine vehicles carrying foreign proteins, the non-structural protein 6 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was fused to C-terminus of Cap. Cap3-based chimeric particles induced a higher level of nsp6-specific immune response and PRRSV inhibition. Collectively, these self-assembling, Capbased VLPs offer a compelling platform for enhancing the effectiveness of subunit vaccinations against newly emerging diseases and hold great promise for the development of Cap3-based chimeric subunit vaccines.

AB  - Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after surgery due to the usage of anesthetics, such as Sevoflurane, which severely impacts the life quality of patients. Currently, the pathogenesis of Sevoflurane-induced POCD has not been fully elucidated but is reportedly involved with oxidative stress (OS) injury and aggravated inflammation. Phoenixin-20 (PNX-20) is a PNX peptide consisting of 20 amino acids with promising inhibitory effects on OS and inflammation. Herein, we proposed to explore the potential protective function of PNX-20 on Sevoflurane inhalation-induced POCD in rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with 100 ng/g PNX-20 for 7 days with or without pre-inhalation with 2.2% Sevoflurane. Markedly increased escape latency and decreased time in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and aggravated pathological changes and apoptosis in the hippocampus tissue were observed in Sevoflurane-treated rats, which were markedly attenuated by PNX-20. Furthermore, the aggravated inflammation and OS in the hippocampus observed in Sevoflurane-treated rats were notably abolished by PNX20. Moreover, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein kinase A (PKA), and phospho-cAMP response element binding protein/cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB/CREB) levels were markedly decreased in Sevoflurane-treated rats, which were memorably increased by PNX-20. Our results indicated that PNX-20 ameliorated Sevoflurane inhalation-induced POCD in rats via the activation of PKA/CREB signaling, which might supply a new treatment approach for POCD.

AB  - Although sleep, physical activity and sedentary behavior have been found to be associated with dementia risk, findings are inconsistent and their joint relationship remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate independent and joint associations of these three modifiable behaviors with dementia risks. A total of 431,924 participants (median follow-up 9.0 years) without dementia from UK Biobank were included. Multiple Cox regressions were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Models fitted with restricted cubic spline were conducted to test for linear and nonlinear shapes of each association. Sleep duration, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), and screen-based sedentary behavior individually associated with dementia risks in different non-linear patterns. Sleep duration associated with dementia in a U-shape with a nadir at 7 h/day. LTPA revealed a curvilinear relationship with dementia in diminishing tendency, while sedentary behavior revealed a J-shaped relationship. The dementia risk was 17% lower in the high LTPA group (HR[95%CI]: 0.83[0.76-0.91]) and 22% higher in the high sedentary behavior group (1.22[1.10-1.35]) compared to the corresponding low-level group, respectively. A combination of seven-hour/day sleep, moderate-to-high LTPA, and low-to-moderate sedentary behavior showed the lowest dementia risk (0.59[0.50-0.69]) compared to the referent group (longer or shorter sleep/low LTPA/high sedentary behavior). Notably, each behavior was non-linearly associated with brain structures in a pattern similar to its association with dementia, suggesting they may affect dementia risk by affecting brain structures. Our findings highlight the potential to change these three daily behaviors individually and simultaneously to reduce the risk of dementia.

AB  - Alternate-day fasting (ADF) has been reported to reduce body weight, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress damage. However, it is not known whether ADF affects obesity-induced anxiety-like behavior. Here, male C57BL/6 mice were given an alternate fasting and high-fat diet (HFD) or standard chow diet (SD) every other day for 16 or 5 weeks. After the intervention, the degree of anxiety of the mice was evaluated by the open field test (OFT) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Pathological changes in the hippocampus, the expression of Sirt1 and its downstream protein monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in the hippocampus, and the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were detected. Compared with HFD-fed mice, HFD-fed mice subjected to ADF for 16 weeks had a lower body weight but more brown adipose tissue (BAT), less anxiety behavior, and less pathological damage in the hippocampus, and lower expression of Sirt1 and MAO-A protein and higher 5-HT levels in the hippocampus could be observed. In addition, we noted that long-term ADF intervention could cause anxiety-like behavior in SD mice. Next, we changed the intervention time to 5 weeks. The results showed that short-term ADF intervention could reduce the body weight and increase the BAT mass of SD mice, but it did not affect anxiety. These results indicated that long-term ADF ameliorated obesity-induced anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal damage, but caused anxiety in normal-weight mice. Short-term ADF did not produce adverse emotional reactions in normal-weight mice. Here, we might provide new ideas for the treatment of obesity-induced anxiety. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale spiking and field potentials of the rodent hippocampus encode spatial representations during maze runs, immobility, and sleep. Here, we show that multisite hippocampal field potential amplitude at ultra-high-frequency band (FPA(uhf)), a generalized form of multiunit activity, provides not only a fast and reliable reconstruction of the rodent's position when awake, but also a readout of replay content during sharp-wave ripples. This FPA(uhf) feature may serve as a robust real-time decoding strategy from large-scale recordings in closed-loop experiments. Furthermore, we develop unsupervised learning approaches to extract low-dimensional spatiotemporal FPA(uhf) features during run and ripple periods and to infer latent dynamical structures from lower-rank FPA(uhf) features. We also develop an optical flow-based method to identify propagating spatiotemporal LFP patterns from multisite array recordings, which can be used as a decoding application. Finally, we develop a prospective decoding strategy to predict an animal's future decision in goal-directed navigation.

AB  - Electromyography (EMG) has been commonly used for the precise identification of animal behavior. However, it is often not recorded together within vivo electrophysiology due to the need for additional surgeries and setups and the high risk of mechanical wire disconnection. While independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to reduce noise from field potential data, there has been no attempt to proactively use the removed "noise,"of which EMG signals are thought to be one of the major sources. Here, we demonstrate that EMG signals can be reconstructed without direct EMG recording using the "noise"ICA component from local field potentials. The extracted component is highly correlated with directly measured EMG, termed IC-EMG. ICEMG is useful for measuring an animal's sleep/wake, freezing response, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM)/REM sleep states consistently with actual EMG. Our method has advantages in precise and long-term behavioral measurement in wide-ranging in vivo electrophysiology experiments.

AB  - Impaired synaptic neurotransmission may underly circuit alterations contributing to behavioral autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotypes. A critical component of impairments reported in somatosensory and prefrontal cortex of ASD mouse models are parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. However, it remains unknown whether PV interneurons mediating hippocampal networks crucial to navigation and memory processing are similarly impaired. Using PV-labeled transgenic mice, a battery of behavioral assays, in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology, and in vivo 32-channel silicon probe local field potential recordings, we address this question in a Cntnap2-null mutant mouse model representing a human ASD risk factor gene. Cntnap2(-/-) mice show a reduction in hippocampal PV interneuron density, reduced inhibitory input to CA1 pyramidal cells, deficits in spatial discrimination ability, and frequency-dependent circuit changes within the hippocampus, including alterations in gamma oscillations, sharp-wave ripples, and theta-gamma modulation. Our findings highlight hippocampal involvement in ASD and implicate interneurons as a potential therapeutical target.

AB  - Intellectual disability and autistic features are associated with chromosome region 2q23.q23.2 duplication carrying LYPD6 and LYPD6B genes. Here, we analyzed LYPD6 and LYPD6B expression in patients with different neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased LYPD6 and LYPD6B expression was revealed in autism and other disorders. To study possible consequences of Lypd6 and Lypd6b overexpression in the brain, we used a mouse model with intracerebroventricular delivery of recombinant analogs of these proteins. A two-week infusion evoked significant memory impairment and acute stress. Both modulators downregulated hippocampal and amygdala dendritic spine density. No changes in synaptic plasticity were observed. Intracerebroventricular administration by both proteins downregulated hippocampal expression of Lypd6, Lypd6b, and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Similar to Lypd6, Lypd6b targeted different nAChR subtypes in the brain with preferential inhibition of alpha 7- and alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs. Thus, increased Lypd6 and Lypd6b level in the brain are linked to cholinergic system depression, neuronal atrophy, memory decline, and anxiety.

AB  - Despite an accumulating number of studies, treatments for depression are currently insufficient. Therefore, the search for new substances with antidepressant potential is very important. In this study, we hypothesized that treatment with a newly synthesized pyridoindole derivative compound SMe1EC2M3 would result in protective and antidepressant-like effects on behavioral outcomes and reverse the impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis caused by chronic mild stress (CMS). We found that chronic administration of 5 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg SMe1EC2M3 to adult Sprague Dawley rats ameliorated the consequences of CMS on immobility and swimming time in a forced swim test. A slight sedative effect of the highest dose of SMe1EC2M3 in the nonstress group was observed in the open field. SMe1EC2M3 in the highest dose ameliorated CMS-induced decreases in the sucrose preference test. Administration of SMe1EC2M3 significantly increased SOX2-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in CMS compared to control animals. A significant reduction in glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-positive cells in the DG of CMS compared to control animals was observed. Administration of both 5 and 25 mg/kg SMe1EC2M3 significantly increased signal of GFAP-positive cells in the DG of CMS animals. No such effects of SMe1EC2M3 were observed in the cornu ammonis hippocampal area. Additionally, we found that incubation of primary hippocampal neurons in the presence of 1.50 mu M SMe1EC2M3 significantly stimulated the length of neurites. Overall, we found that the negative effects of CMS on depression-like behavior are partially reduced by the administration of SMe1EC2M3 and are associated with changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. SMe1EC2M3 represents a potential drug candidate with positive neuroplastic effects and neurogenesis-associated effects in therapeutic approaches to depression.

AB  - Background: Huangjingui (Camellia sinensis), a kind of oolong tea, is native to Anxi County, Fujian Province, China, and is a national tea tree species. Tea processing is the key link in the formation of its aroma characteristics, and it is important to analyze the influence of each processing process on the aroma intensity and odor characteristics of tea, in order to optimize the tea processing process and improve the quality of tea. Results: The processing process favored the accumulation of volatile compounds in oolong tea, as evidenced by the increase in their content from 9.793 to 123.052 mu g/kg, of which the highest content was mainly in terpenoids, alcohols and esters substances. The aroma formation of oolong tea was mainly composed of 14 key compounds, among which the most critical compounds were four substances such as geraniol, alpha-pinene, methyl salicylate and trans-beta-ionone. The typical odor characteristics of oolong tea were floral and wood, among which the formation of floral odor mainly came from geraniol and methyl salicylate, and the formation of wood odor characteristics mainly came from alpha-pinene and trans-beta-ionone. Further analysis showed that the aroma quality of oolong tea could be improved by focusing on key processes such as fermentation and kneading during the processing of oolong tea. Conclusion: The processing was conducive to the accumulation of aroma compounds of oolong tea, improving the aroma intensity of tea leaves and forming the unique floral and wood odor characteristics of oolong tea.

AB  - In this research, the involvement of CB1 and TRPV1 receptors in the possible protective effects of anandamide were investigated in the kindling model of epilepsy. The basolateral amygdala of the rat brain was chosen to put stimulating electrodes. Semi-rapid kindling was induced by a repetitive sub-threshold stimulation for 5-9 consecutive days. There were seven groups, six of which were kindled and used for drug testing by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) microinjection. (i) Sham, (ii) control group received vehicles, (iii) anandamide (AEA; 100 ng/rat), (iv) capsazepine (TRPV1 antagonist; 100 ng/rat), (v) AM251 (CB1 antagonist; 100 ng/rat), (vi) AM251 + anandamide, and (vii) capsazepine + anandamide. The after-discharge duration, seizure duration, and stage five duration were measured in rats. Moreover, the expressions of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) proteins in the hippocampus were also studied. The anandamide-treated group showed a significant decrease in seizure scores, while no change was shown in seizure scores in the capsazepine- and AM251-treated groups compared with the control group. Co-administrations of either capsazepine + AEA or AM251 + AEA attenuated the protective effect of AEA against seizure. Furthermore, the group received AEA showed a decrease in the expressions of CREB and p-CREB possibly through the activation of the CB1 and TRPV1 receptors. Activation of CB1 and TRPV1 receptors might be involved in AEA anticonvulsant effect in kindling model of epilepsy. This effect could be due to suppression of CREB phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Background/aim: In an aging model established using male Wistar albino rats via the administration of D-galactose (D-gal), the aim of this study was to examine the effects of chelidonic acid (CA) on cognitive function and the levels of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Materials and methods: Thirty-two, three-month-old Wistar albino male rats (n = 8) were divided into four groups, as the control (C) group, CA group (2 mg/kg of CA via oral gavage), D-gal group (150 mg/kg of D-gal, subcutaneously), and D-gal + CA group (150 mg/kg of D-gal and 2 mg/kg of CA). Following overnight fasting, the 10-week trial was concluded with intramuscular injections of anesthetic drugs xylazine (8-10 mg/kg) and ketamine (80-100 mg/kg), and subsequently, the collection of cardiac blood. The brain tissues of the rats were removed. The GSH, MDA, TAS, and BDNF levels were determined in the collected serum samples and prepared tissue homogenates. Novel object recognition and Morris water maze (MWM) experiments were also used to evaluate cognitive function. Results: The D-gal group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the discrimination index for memory in both the short and long term compared to the D-gal + CA group. Further analysis of the MWM data for these two groups indicated a notable decrease in the amount of time required for finding the platform. In comparison with the D-gal group, the MDA levels decreased in the CA and D-gal + CA groups, whereas the GSH, TAS, and BDNF levels increased in both the serum and hippocampus samples. Conclusion: CA showed positive effects on age-related neurodegenerative disorders and memory-related processes, especially by increasing TAS and BDNF levels.

AB  - Ambiguity is often recognized as an intrinsic aspect of addressing complex sustainability challenges. Nevertheless, in the practice of transdisciplinary sustainability research, ambiguity is often an 'elephant in the room' to be either side-stepped or reduced rather than explicitly mobilized in pursuit of solutions. These responses threaten the salience and legitimacy of sustainability science by masking the pluralism of real-world sustainability challenges and how research renders certain frames visible and invisible. Critical systems thinking (CST) emerged from the efforts of operational researchers to address theoretical and practical aspects of ambiguity. By adapting key concepts, frameworks, and lessons from CST literature and case studies, this paper aims to establish (1) an expansive conceptualization of ambiguity and (2) recommendations for operationalizing ambiguity as a valuable means of addressing sustainability challenges. We conceptualize ambiguity as an emergent feature of the simultaneous and interacting boundary processes associated with being, knowing, and intervening in complex systems, and propose Reflexive Boundary Critique (RBC) as a novel framework to help navigate these boundary processes. Our characterization of ambiguity acknowledges the boundary of a researcher's subjective orientation and its influence on how ambiguity is exposed and mediated in research (being), characterizes knowledge as produced through the process of making boundary judgments, generating a partial, contextual, and provisional frame (knowing), and situates a researcher as part of the complexity they seek to understand, rendering any boundary process as a form of intervention that reinforces or marginalizes certain frames and, in turn, influences action (intervening). Our recommendations for sustainability scientists to operationalize ambiguity include (1) nurturing the reflexive capacities of transdisciplinary researchers to navigate persistent ambiguity (e.g., using our proposed framework of RBC), and (2) grappling with the potential for and consequences of theoretical incommensurability and discordant pluralism. Our findings can help sustainability scientists give shape to and embrace ambiguity as a fundamental part of rigorous sustainability science.

AB  - Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside that has a protective effect against neuroinflammation at low doses through Na+/K+-ATPase signaling and that can activate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the brain. TNF plays an essential role in neuroinflammation and regulates glutamate receptors by acting on two different receptors (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNFR1] and TNFR2) that have distinct functions and expression. The activation of constitutively and ubiquitously expressed TNFR1 leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the effects of ouabain in a TNFR1 knockout (KO) mouse model. Interestingly, the hippocampus of TNFR1 KO mice showed a basal increase in both TNFR2 membrane expression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Moreover, ouabain activated TNF-alpha-converting enzyme/a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (TACE/ADAM17), decreased N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) expression, and induced anxiety-like behavior in both genotype animals, independent of the presence of TNFR1. However, ouabain induced an increase in interleukin (IL)-1 beta in the hippocampus, a decrease in IL-6 in serum, and an increase in NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) only in wild-type (WT) mice, indicating that TNFR1 or TNFR2 expression may be important for some effects of ouabain. Collectively, our results indicate a connection between ouabain signaling and TNFR1, with the effect of ouabain partially dependent on TNFR1.

AB  - The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has garnered significant attention as a potential target for rapid-onset antidepressantlike effects, particularly owing to its ability to swiftly stimulate serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). However, the precise mechanisms underlying its regulatory effects remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to examine the interaction between SA-4503 (a selective S1R agonist) and 8-OH-DPAT (a serotonin1A (5HT1A) receptor agonist) in mice with depressive-like behavior induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). Preliminary studies were conducted to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the accelerated antidepressantlike effects resulting from the combined activation of S1R and 5-HT1A receptors. The results showed that the coadministration of SA4503 (1.0 mg/kg, orally) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg, i. g.) produced antidepressant-like effects. However, the doses of 8-OH-DPAT used in this study did not exhibit intrinsic antidepressant-like activity in this model. Moreover, using an in-situ proximity ligation assay provided the first evidence of S1R-5-HT1A heteroreceptor complexes in the midbrain DRN and dentate gyrus (DG) of the forebrain in mice. The formation of these heterocomplexes was influenced by pharmacological agents and was closely associated with depressive-like behavior development in mice. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the combined activation of S1R and 5-HT1A receptors synergistically enhanced neurogenesis and plasticity in the dorsal DG region of the hippocampus in mice subjected to CRS. These findings significantly advance our understanding of S1R-mediated neuroplasticity, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for developing rapid-acting antidepressants.

AB  - The present study was designed to focus on the potential effects of the electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by mobile phones on hippocampal pyramidal neurons and to investigate the role of curcumin (Cur), Garcinia kola (GK) and Gum Arabic (GA) in reducing these adverse effects. Fifty-four 12-week-old male Wistar albino rats were used. These were randomly divided into nine groups of six rats each. The control, Cur, GK and GA groups were not exposed to EMF, while the sham group was kept in the EMF exposure system without being exposed to EMF. The EMF+Cur, EMF+GK, EMF+GA and EMF groups were exposed to 900 MHz EMF for one hour a day for 28 days. The number of the pyramidal neurons in the cornu ammonis (CA) of the hippocampus was estimated using the optical fractionator technique. Histopathological changes were evaluated under light and electron microscopes. The activities of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes were also evaluated from serum samples. Significant levels of CAT and SOD activities were observed in the EMF group compared to the control group (p = 0.000; p = 0.001) respectively. Microscopic observations showed that dark-coloured nuclei with unclear neuron boundaries were frequently observed in the EMF group. Stereological data analysis revealed a significant decrease in the CA's total number of pyramidal neurons in the EMF group compared to the control and sham groups (p = 0.000; p = 0.000) respectively. Cur and GK were observed to provide significant protection in the EMF+Cur and EMF+GK groups compared to the EMF group (p = 0.000; p = 0.000) respectively. No significant difference was observed between the EMF+GA group and EMF group (p = 0.989). Exposure to 900 MHz EMF causes severe alterations in the number and structure of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Cur and GK exhibit a protective effect against these deleterious effects, but GA showed no protective effect.

AB  - The most well-known type of focal epilepsy that is resistant to existing treatments is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), with seizure foci in various structures including temporal lobe, hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and subcortex. The most significant processes involved in the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are oxidative stress, inflammation, and pyroptosis. There are evidences indicating that acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyroptotic effects. In the present study, rat model of TLE was induced by intrahippocampal kainate and animals received ALC (100 mg/kg, p.o.). ALC properly attenuated intensity of seizures and also incidence of kainate-induced status epilepticus (SE). As well, obtained findings showed that ALC can partially reverse hippocampal levels of MDA, ROS, SOD, TNFa, NF-kB, TLR4, GFAP, and caspase 1. Besides, treatment of kainate group with ALC exerted a protective effect against CA(1) neuronal loss and abnormal mossy fiber sprouting (MFS). Conclusively, these results suggest that ALC is capable to attenuate kainate-induced SE which is somewhat mediated through its lowering of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and pyroptosis that are related to its neuroprotective effect.

AB  - Nanoparticles have emerged as potential transporters of drugs targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their design should consider the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and neuroinflammation of the AD brain. This study presents that aging is a significant factor for the brain localization and retention of nanoparticles, which we engineered to bind with reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. We assembled 200 nm-diameter particles using a block copolymer of poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and CD44-binding hyaluronic acid (HA). The resulting PLGA-b-HA nanoparticles displayed increased binding to CD44-expressing reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. Upon intravascular injection, nanoparticles were localized to the hippocampi of both APP/PS1 AD model mice and their control littermates at 13-16 months of age due to enhanced transvascular transport through the leaky BBB. No particles were found in the hippocampi of young adult mice. These findings demonstrate the brain localization of nanoparticles due to aging-induced BBB breakdown regardless of AD pathology.

AB  - Inadequate levels of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids have been reported as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Avocado oil (Persea americana Mill., Laucaceae) represents a source of bioactive compounds with a relative abundance of omega-3, omega-6 polyunsaturated, and omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids. The present study investigated the effects of extra-virgin avocado oil on the D-galactose-induced Alzheimer's disease model in ovariectomized Wistar rats. The cognitive dysfunctions were induced by D-galactose administration (150 mg.kg(-1) i.p) and/or ovariectomy in 54 female rats for 70 days. The rats were concomitantly treated with extra-virgin avocado oil (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mL.kg(-1), p.o), donepezil (1 mg.kg(-1), p.o), and estradiol valerate (1 mg.kg(-1), p.o). Memory disorders were evaluated using the Object Recognition, Y-Maze, and Morris water maze tests. Some biochemical and histological parameters regarding memory function were evaluated on hippocampus homogenate and tissue. D-galactose administration and ovariectomy significantly induced learning and memory impairments, decreased relative hippocampal weight (p < 0.001), the levels of acetylcholine (p < 0.001), glutamate (p < 0.001), reduced glutathione (p < 0.001), catalase (p < 0.05), and superoxide dismutase (p < 0.001) activities, and an increase (p < 0.001) in the levels of methylglyoxal, malondialdehyde, and nitrites. The treatment with extra-virgin avocado oil at all tested doses reversed or prevented the negative effects induced by ovariectomy and/or by D-galactose. Taken together, these results suggest that avocado oil possesses neuroprotective properties and can be consumed or supplemented to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The main feature of insomnia is difficulty in starting or maintaining sleep. 5-HT1A receptor and 5-HT2A receptor are two subtypes of the classic central 5-HT neurotransmitter closely related to sleep and wakefulness. To observe the effects of Evodia rutaecarpa acupoint sticking therapy on the mRNA expressions of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and hippocampus of insomnia rats induced by para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). Ten rats were randomly selected as the normal group, and 80 PCPA insomnia model rats were randomly divided into eight groups, including a model group, a positive control group (diazepam group), a low-dose E. rutaecarpa acupoint sticking therapy group (Yongquan acupoint group and Shenque acupoint group; the same applied below), a middle-dose E. rutaecarpa acupoint sticking therapy group, and a high-dose E. rutaecarpa acupoint sticking therapy group. The normal group and the model group did not receive treatment. The positive control group was given diazepam through intragastric administration, and the three-dose E. rutaecarpa acupoint sticking therapy groups were divided into the Yongquan acupoint group and the Shenque acupoint group. After seven days of administration, the rat hypothalamus, brainstem, and hippocampus tissues were taken, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect the mRNA expressions of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A. E. rutaecarpa acupoint sticking therapy significantly upregulated 5-HT(1A )mRNA expression and downregulated 5-HT(2A )mRNA expression in rats with insomnia caused by PCPA. No significant differences were found in the expression between the two acupoints and the expression among the three brain tissues. E. rutaecarpa acupoint sticking therapy can improve insomnia. The mechanism may be related to the upregulation of 5-HT1A mRNA expression and the downregulation of 5-HT(2A )mRNA expression in brain tissue.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to highlight the possible effects on the hippocampus of the electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by mobile phones, and to investigate whether these potential effects can be reduced using various antioxidant substances. Twenty-seven female Wistar albino rats were divided into nine equal groups, each containing three pregnant rats aged 8-10 weeks and weighing 200-250 gr. The EMF groups were exposed to 900 Megahertz (MHz) EMF for 1 h (hr) a day for 21 days. No EMF exposure was applied to the Cont and also the groups given only Garcinia kola (GK), Momordica charantia (MC), and thymoquinone (TQ). The Sham group was kept in the polycarbonate EMF exposure system, but was not exposed to EMF. Four weeks after birth, rat pups were subjected to behavioural tests. Brain tissue samples were evaluated using histological, stereological, functional, and immunohistochemical methods. The numbers of pyramidal neurons in the rat cornu ammonis (CA) were determined using the optical fractionator method. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities in the blood samples were also evaluated. The analysis data indicated that total pyramidal neuron numbers were decreased significantly in the CA of the EMF (1 hr) group (p < 0.01). Our results also showed that the protective effect of MC was more potent than that of the other antioxidant substances (p < 0.01). A 900 MHz EMF can cause deleterious changes in the brain. It can also be suggested that GK, MC and TQ are capable of reducing these adverse effects.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the effect of GF powder on the growth performance, diarrhea rate, antioxidant and immune capacity, and intestinal health of weaned piglets. A total of 144 weaned piglets (8.29 +/- 0.11 kg) at 21 d old were randomly assigned to four groups, with each treatment consisting of six replicate pens, with six piglets per pen, and each pen containing three barrows and three gilts. The piglets were fed a basal diet supplement with 0%, 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% GF powder (n = 36). Our results indicated that compared with the basal diet, the F/G and diarrhea rate were remarkably decreased in the 0.8% GF group (p < 0.05). Serum biochemical parameters showed that supplementation with GF significantly increased the content of HDL-C (0.6 and 0.8% levels), IL-6 (0.8% level), IL-10 (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8% levels), Ig G (0.4% level), and Ig A (0.8% level) compared with the basal diet (p < 0.05). The index of antioxidant capacity showed that compared with a basal diet, supplementation with GF significantly decreased serum MDA content (0.4% and 0.8% levels) and jejunal and ileal MDA content (0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% levels) (p < 0.05). Additionally, compared with the basal diet, supplementation with GF significantly increased serum and ileal T-AOC content (0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% levels), serum T-SOD content (0.4% and 0.8% levels), ileal T-SOD content (0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% levels), CAT content (0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% levels), and jejunal GSH-Px content (0.8% level) (p < 0.05). The results of gene expression indicate that compared with the basal diet, supplementation with GF significantly increased Nrf 2 (0.4% level), NQO (0.4% level), SOD 1 (0.4% and 0.8% levels), and GCLC (0.4% level) and GCLM (0.8% level) abundance in jejunal mucosa; supplementation with GF significantly increased Nrf 2 (0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% levels), HO-1 (0.4% level), NQO (0.8% level), SOD 1 (0.4% and 0.8% levels), and GCLC (0.4% level) and GCLM (0.8% level) abundance in ileal mucosa (p < 0.05). Ulteriorly, the present results indicate that supplementation with GF at the 0.8% level significantly increased the villus height in the jejunum and ileum as well as the villus/crypt ratio in the ileum compared with the basal diet (p < 0.05). Compared with the basal diet, 0.4% GF significantly increased Occludin gene expression in ileal mucosa (p < 0.05), 0.6% GF significantly increased ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin gene expression in jejunal mucosa (p < 0.05), and 0.8% GF significantly increased ZO-1 and Occludin gene expression in jejunal mucosa along with Occludin expression in ileal mucosa (p < 0.05). Furthermore, colonic microbiota composition showed that Shannon, observed species, and Chao 1 indices were significantly increased in the 0.8% GF group compared with the basal diet (p < 0.05). At the phylum level, in comparison with the basal diet, the relative abundance of Firmicutes significantly decreased in the 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% GF groups, and Bacteroidetes increased in the 0.8% GF group (p < 0.05). At the genus level, compared with the basal diet, 0.6% and 0.8% GF significantly increased Prevotella abundance, and 0.6% GF significantly decreased Coprococcus abundance (p < 0.05). At the species level, compared with the basal diet, 0.8% GF significantly increased Prevotella copri abundance, and 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% GF significantly decreased Blautia obeum abundance (p < 0.05). In summary, a dietary supplement with 0.
   8% Gardeniae Fructus powder significantly decreased the F/G and diarrhea rate and improved antioxidant capacity and intestinal barrier function, which may be associated with the improvement of the relative abundance of Prevotella copri. These findings indicate that Gardeniae Fructus powder may be used as a feed additive in swine weaning.

AB  - Nanotechnology employing nanostructured materials is becoming a promising and green tool for crop protection against abiotic and biotic stresses. As eco-friendly biostimulants, chitosan (CS) and salicylic acid (SA) could induce plant resistance to insect herbivores. However, to date, the control efficiency of the SA-CS nanocomposites (SCNs) on insect herbivores and their underlying mechanism of activating plant defense against herbivores are still unclear. Herein, 17.2 nm of SCNs with excellent stability were prepared to control fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) on maize plants. We found that foliar application of SCNs (100-1000 mg L-1) exhibited higher control efficiency for S. frugiperda than SA and CS treatment alone, and 100 mg L-1 SCNs significantly decreased the growth of S. frugiperda by 54.7% as compared to the control. Mechanistically, SCNs enhanced maize plant resistance to S. frugiperda via increasing the leaf defense compound benzoxazinoid (e.g., DIMBOA-Glc, DIBOA-Glc, DIBOA, DIMBOA, DIM(2)BOA-Glc, HDM(2)BOA-Glc and MBOA) contents by 36.7-179.8%, and the expression of anti-insect genes (e.g., JAC1, Pep1, JAR1a, RIP2, MPI) by 2-19 fold. Additionally, SCNs increased activities of leaf antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT) compared to CS and SA treatments, thus decreasing leaf oxidative stress caused by S. frugiperda attack. Altogether, SCNs could act as an eco-friendly nano-biostimulant for green pest control in agroecosystems.

AB  - Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most frequent complications of diabetes with significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes can trigger neutrophils to undergo histone citrullination by protein arginine deiminase 4 (encoded by Padi4 in mice) and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The specific mechanism of NETs-mediated wound healing impairment in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we show neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis in diabetic wound environments. Via in vitro experiments and in vivo models of wound healing using wide-type and Padi4(-/-) mice, we demonstrate NETs can induce the activation of PAK2 via the membrane receptor TLR-9. Then PAK2 phosphorylates the intracellular protein Merlin/NF2 to inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway. YAP binds to transcription factor SMAD2 and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which ultimately impedes angiogenesis and delays wound healing. Suppression of the Merlin/YAP/SMAD2 pathway can attenuate NET-induced EndMT. Inhibition of NETosis accelerates wound healing by reducing EndMT and promoting angiogenesis. Cumulatively, these data suggest NETosis delays diabetic wound healing by inducing EndMT via the Hippo-YAP pathway. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanism that regulates NETosis and EndMT will be of considerable value for providing cellular targets amenable to therapeutic intervention for DFUs.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the heavy metals of Cd, Mn, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cr in two naturally grown plants (Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Pyrus elaeagnifolia Pall.) and on the roadside soil. The samples in this study were collected from the European route e80 highway in Turkiye. Average concentrations of metals in surface soil samples were: Cd, 0.47; Mn, 656.18; Ni, 96.68; Zn, 171.90; Pb, 33.42; Cu, 45.82; and Cr, 95.60 ppm. Pollution levels were estimated based on soil pollution index (PI) and geoaccumulation index (I-geo). The general trends of soil pollution index (PI) and geoaccumulation index (I-geo) were Cu > Pb > Cd > Cr > Ni > Mn > Zn. Additionally, transfer factors (TF) were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of plant species for phytoremediation purposes. The leaf part of H. rhamnoides (Seabuckthorn) has the highest TF for Cu among plant parts. Finally, in this study, the highest transfer factors were determined as Cu and Zn in Seabuckthorn; P. elaeagnifolia (Wild Pear) these are heavy metals Cu and Cd. In particular, it is thought that employing plant leaves as a monitoring technique may be helpful in keeping track of changes in Cu, Cd, and Zn concentrations in situations along highways. In particular, it is thought that employing plant leaves as a monitoring technique may be helpful in keeping track of changes in Cu, Cd, and Zn concentrations in situations along highways. The findings of this study can be further interpreted to assess the risks that may arise from exposure to heavy metals at the edge of highways.

AB  - Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder associated with brain and immune system abnormalities. In recent years, xanthohumol (Xn) a bioactive prenylated flavonoid has received ample attention for its polypharmacological effects, therefore, here we aimed to explore the protective effects of Xn against the LPS-induced depressive-like symptoms mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. We tested the effect of Xn against LPS-induced behavioural changes in mice by means of forced swimming test (FST), tail suspention test (TST), sucrose preference test (SPT) and open field test (OPT). Examined the neuroinflammation and oxido-nitrosative stress (O&NS) markers and analyze Nrf2 and NF-kappa B signalling pathways in the hippocampus. Our results indicated that peripheral repeated administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (1 mg/kg, intra peritoneally) induced depressive-like behavior, neuroinflammation and O&NS in mice. Pretreatment with Xn (10 and 20 mg/kg, intra gastrically) reverse the behavioural impairments prophylactically as obvious in the FST and TST without effecting locomotion, however only 20 mg dose improve anhedonic behavior as observed in SPT. Similarly, Xn pretreatment in dose-dependent manner prevented the LPS induced neuro-inflammation and O&NS. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Xn reduced activated gliosis via attenuation of Iba-1 and GFAP in hippocampus. In addition, Xn considerably reduced the expression of phospho-NF-kappa B and cleaved caspase-3 while enhanced Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in the hippocampus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the underlying beneficial prophylactic effects of the Xn in neuroinflammation and O&NS mediating depressive-like behaviors.

AB  - Sepsis-induced neuroinflammation is significantly associated with sepsis-related brain dysfunction. Remimazolam is a novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine anesthetic with multiple organ protective effects. However, it is unknown whether remimazolam can ameliorate LPS-induced brain impairment. In this study, Lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg, LPS) severely impaired Sprague-Dawley rats spatial learning ability, memory, and cognitive function. However, remimazolam treatment showed a protective effect on LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction. Remimazolam partly reversed LPS-induced splenomegaly, decreased serum cytokine expression, suppressed hippocampal M1 microglial activation, and mitigated oxidative stress injury and neuroinflammation. Electroacupuncture (EA) or PNU282987 treatment improved LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction and also significantly inhibited neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation. However, MLA, ML385, or subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve (SDV) treatment abolished the protective effects of remimazolam. Further mechanistic studies showed that remimazolam induces protective effects by activating subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve target alpha 7nAChR-mediated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that remimazolam can up-regulate alpha 7nAChR, Cyto-Nrf2, HO-1, and cognitive-related (CREB, BDNF, PSD95) protein expressions, suppress M1 microglia, ameliorate neuroinflammation or systemic inflammation, and reverse cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, this study provides insight into a new therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis-induced cerebral dysfunction.

AB  - Studies have demonstrated that LIN28 is expressed in the CNS and may exert protective effects on neurons. However, it remains unknown whether LIN28 regulates ferroptosis in the context of epilepsy. In this study, we established an epilepsy model by culturing hippocampal neurons from rats in a magnesium-free (Mg2+-free) medium. In Mg2+-depleted conditions, hippocampal neurons exhibited reduced LIN28 expression, heightened miR-142-5p expression, decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity and expression, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), resulting in a significant decline in cell viability and an increase in ferroptosis. Conversely, overexpression of LIN28 reversed these trends in the mentioned indices. Altogether, this study reveals that LIN28 may exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the miR-142-5p expression and suppressing ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons induced by Mg2+-free via increasing GPX4 expression.

AB  - XOS production from lignocellulose using organic carboxylic acids and alkyd acids has been widely reported. However, it still faces harsh challenges such as high energy consumption, high cost, and low purity. Pyruvic acid (PYA), a carbonyl acid with carbonyl and carboxyl groups, was used to produce XOS due to its stronger catalytic activity. In this work, XOS was efficiently prepared from COS in an autoclave under the condition of 0.21 M PYA121 C-35 min. The total yield of XOS reached 68.72 % without producing any toxic by-products, including furfural (FF) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). The yield of xylobiose (X-2), xylotriose (X-3), xylotetraose (X-4), and xylopentaose (X-5) were 20.58 %, 12.47 %, 15.74 %, and 10.05 %, respectively. Meanwhile, 89.05 % of lignin was retained in the solid residue, which provides a crucial functional group for synthesizing layered carbon materials (SRG-a). It achieves excellent electromagnetic shielding (EMS) performance through graphitization, reaching -30 dB at a thickness of 2.0 mm. The use of a PYA catalyst in the production of XOS has proven to be an efficient method due to lower temperature, lower acid consumption, and straightforward operation.

AB  - c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are a family of proteinkinasesactivated by a myriad of stimuli consequently modulating a vast rangeof biological processes. In human postmortem brain samples affectedwith Alzheimer ' s disease (AD), JNK overactivation has beendescribed; however, its role in AD onset and progression is stillunder debate. One of the earliest affected areas in the pathologyis the entorhinal cortex (EC). Noteworthy, the deterioration of theprojection from EC to hippocampus (Hp) point toward the idea thatthe connection between EC and Hp is lost in AD. Thus, the main objectiveof the present work is to address if JNK3 overexpression in the ECcould impact on the hippocampus, inducing cognitive deficits. Dataobtained in the present work suggest that JNK3 overexpression in theEC influences the Hp leading to cognitive impairment. Moreover, proinflammatorycytokine expression and Tau immunoreactivity were increased both inthe EC and in the Hp. Therefore, activation of inflammatory signalingand induction of Tau aberrant misfolding caused by JNK3 could be responsiblefor the observed cognitive impairment. Altogether, JNK3 overexpressionin the EC may impact on the Hp inducing cognitive dysfunction andunderlie the alterations observed in AD.

AB  - Oxidative stress leads to protein degeneration or mitochondrial dysfunction, causing neuronal cell death. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that nerve cells use to send signals. However, the excess accumulation of glutamate can cause excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. In this study, we deciphered the molecular mechanism of catechin-mediated neuroprotective effect on glutamate-induced oxidative stress in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. Cellular antioxidant activity was determined using the 1,1-diphenyl-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) assay and 2 ',7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) staining. Furthermore, the levels of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) as well as nuclear condensation and protein expression related to neuronal damage were assessed. All five catechins (epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate (GCG), gallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epicatechin) showed strong antioxidant effects. Among them, GCG exhibited the highest neuroprotective effect against glutamate excitotoxicity and was used for further mechanistic studies. The glutamate-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ was reduced after GCG treatment. Moreover, GCG reduced nuclear condensation and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) involved in cell death. The neuroprotective effect of GCG against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells was attributed to the reduction in intracellular free radicals and Ca2+ influx and also the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of GCG was found to be likely due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK that led to the effective suppression of neurocytotoxicity caused by glutamate in HT22 cells.

AB  - The comparison between adding egg yolks (EY) of chicken, duck, goose, pigeon, Japanese quail or turkey to the Tris glycerol extender on the quality of ram semen before freezing and post-thawing was evaluated. The correlation between fatty acids levels in egg yolks of different avian species and the post-thawed quality of ram semen was studied. The pooled ejaculates collected from five rams were extended with Tris EY glycerol extenders containing the EY of chicken, duck, goose, pigeon, quail or turkey and cryopreserved at -196 degrees C. The straws were evaluated before freezing and post-thawing for sperm motility using a sperm cell analyser, vitality using a FluoVit kit and abnormality using a SpermBlue stain besides plasma-membrane and DNA integrities using a hypo-osmotic swelling test and a Halomax kit, respectively. The moisture, ash, protein and fatty acid (FA) contents of EY of chicken, duck, goose, pigeon, quail and turkey were analysed using a gas chromatograph. The chicken and quail EY extenders significantly improved the total progressive motility (32.05 +/- 1.41 and 31.68 +/- 1.43, respectively), vitality, plasma membrane and DNA integrities and abnormalities of post-thawing ram semen in comparison with other EY extenders. Pigeon EY had the lowest saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in comparison with the other types of EYs. The chicken and turkey EYs had the lowest percentage of (monoun- saturated fatty acids) MUFAs in comparison with the other types of EYs. The highest percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was observed in the turkey, pigeon and chicken EYs which were considered double or triple their percentage in duck and goose EYs, respectively. Significant positive correlations existed between SFAs levels and total motility, vitality, plasma membrane functionality and DNA integrity (0.77, 0.80, 0.67, 0.52, respectively). Significant negative correlations existed between gon- doic EY levels and total motility, vitality, plasma membrane functionality and DNA integrity. In conclusion, the EYs of duck, goose, pigeon or turkey cannot substitute the chicken EY in ram semen extenders as they gave lower post-thawing quality. The quail EY can be used as a good replacer for chicken EY in the extender used for cryopreser- vation of ram semen. The EY composition of FAs can significantly affect the quality of ram semen post-thawing.

AB  - Tangeretin (TAN) exhibits many bioactivities, including neuroprotective effects. However, the efficacy of TAN in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been sufficiently investigated. In the present study, we integrated behavioral tests, pathology assessment, and biochemical analyses to elucidate the antidementia activity of TAN in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic (Tg) mice. At supplementation levels of 100 mg/kg body weight per day, TAN significantly attenuated the cognitive impairment of Tg mice in behavioral tests. These effects were associated with less synaptic impairments and fewer beta-amyloid accumulations after TAN administration. Furthermore, our study revealed that TAN possessed powerful inhibitory activity against beta-secretase both in vitro and in vivo, which played a crucial role in the process of A beta generation. These findings indicate that TAN is a potential drug for preventing AD pathology. The key mechanism underlying the antidementia effect of TAN may include its inhibitory activity against beta-secretase.

AB  - The number of children born after assisted reproductive technology (ART) is accumulating rapidly, and the health problems of the children are extensively concerned. This study aims to evaluate whether ART procedures alter behaviours in male offspring. Mouse models were utilized to establish three groups of offspring conceived by natural conception (NC), in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), and frozen-thawed embryo transfer (IVF-FET), respectively. A battery of behaviour experiments for evaluating anxiety and depression levels, including the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM) test, light/dark transition test (L/DTT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT) was carried out. Aged (18 months old), but not young (3 months old), male offspring in the IVF-ET and IVF-FET groups, compared with those in the NC group, exhibited increased anxiety and depression-like behaviours. The protein expression levels of three neurotrophins in PFC or hippocampus in aged male offspring from the IVF-ET and IVF-FET groups reduced at different extent, in comparison to NC group. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed in the hippocampus of 18 months old offspring to further explore the gene expression profile changes in the three groups. KEGG analyses revealed the coexisted pathways, such as PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, which potentially reflected the similarity and divergence in anxiety and depression between the offspring conceived by IVF-ET and IVF-FET. Our research suggested the adverse effects of advanced age on the psychological health of children born after ART should be highlighted in the future.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Alzheimer's disease (AD) is identified as "forgetfulness" or "dementia", and it can be caused by spleen deficiency. Longan Aril (the aril of Dimocarpus longan Lour., LA) is a kind of Chinese medicine, and it can improve intelligence attributed to entering the spleen-meridian. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of LA on AD mice with spleen deficiency, and to understand anti-AD mechanism of LA.
   Material and methods: A mouse model of AD with spleen deficiency was established by D-gal (140 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and AlCl3 (20 mg/kg, intragastrical administration) in combination with an irregular diet for 60 days, in which mice in LA group were daily given LA (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg). The anti-AD effects of LA were evaluated by the Morris water maze, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Nissl, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The anti-AD mechanism of LA was studied by using metabolomics, and the expressions of RAS/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by Western blotting.
   Results: LA improved learning and memory abilities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, and form and number of Nissl bodies, while reduced the levels of A beta(42), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), histological injury, and apoptosis rate in AD group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). The anti-AD mechanism of LA may be related to RAS/MEK/ERK and other signaling pathways, in which the expressions of RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway-related proteins significantly reduced (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: LA could improve the cognitive ability and reduce the pathologic impairment in AD mice, which might be partly mediated via inhibition of RAS/MEK/ERK singling pathway.

AB  - Noise is a kind of sound that causes agitation and harms human health. Studies have shown that noise can lead to neuroinflammation, damage to synaptic plasticity and altered levels of neurotransmitters that may result in depression. The present study demonstrated that luteolin exerted antidepressant-like effects by improving neuroinflammation in a mouse model of noise-induced depression. Luteolin significantly alleviated noise-induced depression-like behavior. Notably, luteolin treatment not only remarkably ameliorated noise-induced inflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, but also increased synapsin. Furthermore, luteolin treatment significantly increased the contents of serum 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine in noise-induced mice. In sum, luteolin exerts antidepressant effects indepression-like mice caused by noise, which can serve as a potential agent for the treatment of chronic noise-induced depression.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Feronia elephantum corr. (synonym: Feronia limonia, Murraya odorata, Schinus Limonia, or Limonia acidissima; common names: Bela, Kath, Billin, and Kavitha), belonging to the family Rutaceae has been known for clinical conditions such as pruritus, diarrhea, impotence, dysentery, heart diseases, and is also used as a liver tonic. However, the effect of the fruit pulp of F. elephantum on insulin resistance has yet not been reported.Aim of the study: The present study aimed to assess the effect of hydroalcoholic extract/fraction of F. elephantum fruit pulp on fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, and glucose uptake in fructose-induced insulinresistant rats and predict the gene-set enrichment of lead hits of F. elephantum with targets related to insulin resistance.Material and methods: System biology tools were used to predict the best category of fraction and propose a possible mechanism. Docking was carried out with adiponectin and its receptor (hub genes). Further, fructose supplementation was used for the induction of insulin resistance. Later, three doses of extract (400, 200, and 100 mg/kg) and a flavonoid-rich fraction (63 mg/kg) were used for treatment along with metformin as standard. The physical parameters like body weight, food intake, and water intake were measured along with oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, glycogen content in skeletal muscles and liver, glucose uptake by rat hemidiaphragm, lipid profiles, anti-oxidant biomarkers, and histology of the liver and adipose tissue.Results: Network pharmacology reflected the potency of F. elephantum to regulate adiponectin which may promote the reversal of insulin resistance and inhibit a-amylase and a-glucosidase. Vitexin was predicted to modulate the most genes associated with diabetes mellitus. Further, F. elephantum ameliorated the exogenous glucose clearance, promoted insulin sensitivity, reduced oxidative stress, and improved glucose and lipid metabolism. HPLC profiling revealed the presence of apigenin and quercetin in the extract for the first time.Conclusion: The fruit pulp of F. elephantum reverses insulin resistance by an increase in glucose uptake and a decrease in gluconeogenesis which may be due to the regulation of multiple proteins via multiple bio-actives.

AB  - We present a computationally efficient approach to perform systematically convergent real-space all-electron Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations for solids using an enriched finite element (FE) basis. The enriched FE basis is constructed by augmenting the classical FE basis with atom-centered numerical basis functions, comprising of atomic solutions to the Kohn-Sham problem. Notably, to improve the conditioning, we orthogonalize the enrichment functions with respect to the classical FE basis, without sacrificing the locality of the resultant basis. In addition to improved conditioning, this orthogonalization procedure also renders the overlap matrix block diagonal, greatly simplifying its inversion. Subsequently, we use a Chebyshev polynomial based filtering technique to efficiently compute the occupied eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach on periodic unit cells and supercells. The benchmark studies show a staggering 130x speedup of the orthogonalized enriched FE basis over the classical FE basis. We also present a comparison of the orthogonalized enriched FE basis with the linearized augmented plane-wave + local orbitals basis, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate that the orthogonalized enriched FE basis can handle large system sizes of similar to 10 000 electrons. Finally, we observe good parallel scalability of our implementation with 92% efficiency at 22x speedup for a system with 620 electrons.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Jian-Yan-Ling (JYL) capsule is a famous anti-aging Chinese patent medicine. It is applied mainly to delay senescence to improve cognition in aging individuals. However, the action mechanisms of JYL for improving cognition have not been determined. Aim of the study: We will evaluate the effect of the JYL capsule at improving the cognition of aging mice by improving oxidative stress in the hippocampus and exploring its action mechanism. Materials and methods: A senescence mouse model was developed via intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose. The effect of the JYL capsule at improving the learning and memory abilities of mice was evaluated using the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. The apotosis of model mice hippocampus' were determined by TUNEL analysis. The antioxidant capacity of the JYL capsule was evaluated by determining the activities of antioxidant enzymes and expressions of oxidative products. The regulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway of the JYL capsule was evaluated by determining the expressions of related proteins via western blotting analysis. In vitro, H2O2-treated mouse hippocampal HT22 cells were used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of JYLcontaining rat serum by determining the cell viability, apoptotic level and expressions of related proteins. Results: JYL capsules enhanced the learning and memory abilities of model mice according to behavioral tests. The results of TUNEL analysis showed that the JYL capsule ameliorated hippocampal apoptosis in model mice. JYL capsules also exerted significant antioxidant capacity by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes while decreasing the levels of oxidative products both in the hippocampus and serum. The regulation of Nrf2/ HO-1 pathway might contribute to the antioxidant function. In vitro, JYL-containing rat serum protected HT22 cells from H2O2 induced oxidative stress. The apoptosis of HT22 cells was also attenuated by regulating the caspase and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. Conclusions: The amelioration of neuronal oxidative stress of hippocampus might contribute to the D-galactose induced cognition impairment of senescence mice. These findings provide evidence for the application of JYL capsules to enhance cognition in aging individuals.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dingxian Pill (DXP), a famous traditional Chinese medicine prescription, and has been widely proven to have positive therapeutic effects on "Xianzheng" (the name of epilepsy in ancient China). However, the anti-epileptic molecular mechanisms of DXP are not yet fully understood and remain to be further investigated. Aim of the study: To elucidate the molecular mechanism of DXP's improvement in epileptic neuronal loss, damage and apoptosis by regulating TNF-alpha/TNFR1 signaling pathway. Materials and methods: Sixty Kunming mice were randomly divided in 6 groups: control group (equal volume of normal saline), model group (180 mg kg-1 pilocarpine hydrochloride - used to establish the epilepsy animal model), carbamazepine group (30 mg kg- 1), and low, medium, and high-dose Dingxian Pill groups (4.08, 8.16, and 16.32 g kg-1, respectively - oral administration once daily for 2 weeks). Successful establishment of the epileptic mouse model was monitored with electroencephalography. Pathological changes in hippocampal tissue were analyzed with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was analyzed with TUNEL staining. TNF-alpha, TNFR1, TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 mRNA and protein expression levels in hippocampal tissue were analyzed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot, respectively. Cleaved caspase-8 protein levels in hippocampal tissue were measured with immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Results: Compared to control, the model group showed an increase in continuous epileptic discharge waves on EEG, a damaged hippocampal neuron morphological structure, increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and significantly increased TNF-alpha, TNFR1, TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 mRNA and protein levels, and increased caspase-8 cleavage (P < 0.05). Compared to the model group, the carbamazepine group as well as the low-, medium-, and high-dose Dingxian Pill groups showed decreased epileptic discharges on EEG, an obvious hippocampal neuron morphological structure restoration, varying degrees of attenuated hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and significantly decreased TNF-alpha, TNFR1, TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 mRNA and protein levels as well as decreased caspase-8 cleavage (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Dingxian Pill exerts an anti-epileptic effect through inhibition of TNF-alpha/TNFR1 signaling pathwaymediated apoptosis in hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, is a medicinal herb with rich history of traditional use in Indian subcontinent. This herb has been valued for its diverse range of medicinal properties including memory booster, and also as a folk treatment for skin diseases, wound healing and mild diuretic. Aim of study: Aging is a gradual and continuous process of natural decay in the biological systems, including the brain. This work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica (CAE) on ageassociated cognitive impairments in rats, as well as the underlying mechanism. Material and methods: Rats were allocated into five distinct groups of 5 animals each: Young rats (3 months old rats), middle-aged (m-aged) rats (13-14 months old), and the remaining three groups were comprised of m-aged rats treated with different concentrations of CAE, viz., 150, 300, and 450 mg/kg b. w., orally for 42 days. Y-maze, open field, novel object recognition, and elevated plus maze tests were used to assess animal behavior. The malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assays; and H&E staining were done in the rat brain to assess the biochemical and structural changes. CAE was also subjected to HPLC analysis, in vitro antioxidant and anti-cholinergic activity. The active compounds of CAE were docked with AChE and BuChE in molecular docking study. Results: The results showed that CAE treatment improves behavioral performance; attenuates the age-associated increase in MDA content, SOD, and AChE activity; and reduces neuronal loss. In vitro study showed that CAE has concentration-dependent antioxidant and anti-AChE activity. Furthermore, the presence of Asiatic acid and Madecassic acid in CAE and their good binding with cholinergic enzymes (in silico) also suggest the anticholinergic effect of CAE. Conclusion: The findings of the current study show that the anticholinergic and antioxidant effects of CAE are attributable to the presence of Asiatic acid and Madecassic acid, which not only provide neuroprotection against age-associated cognitive decline but also reverse it.

AB  - (1) Sesame oil aroma has stress-relieving properties, but there is little information on its effective use and active ingredients. (2) Methods: ICR male mice were housed under water-immersion stress for 24 h. Then, the scent of sesame oil or a typical ingredient was inhaled to the stress groups for 30, 60, or 90 min. We investigated the effects of sesame oil aroma on mice behavior and the expression of the dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) gene, a candidate stress marker gene in the brain. (3) Results: In an elevated plus-maze test, the rate of entering into the open arm of a maze and the staying time were increased to a maximum after 60 min of inhalation, but these effects decreased 90 min after inhalation. As for the single component, anxiolytic effects were observed in the 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methoxy phenol group, but the effect was weakened in the furfuryl mercaptan group. The expression levels of DUSP1 in the hippocampus and striatum were significantly decreased in 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methoxy phenol groups. (4) Conclusions: We clarified the active ingredients and optimal concentrations of sesame oil for its sedative effect. In particular, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methoxy phenol significantly suppressed the stress-induced changes in the expression of DUSP1, which are strong anti-stress agents. Our results suggest that these molecules may be powerful anti-stress agents.

AB  - 3 '-Sialyllactose (3 '-SL), a major acidic oligosaccharide found in human milk, has been investigated to improve cognitive-enhancing effects with 3 weeks old C57BL/6 mice by administering 3 '-SL orally at a dose of 350 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks. Behavioral tests indicated that supplementation with 3 '-SL promoted cognitive and memory development in young mice. Through interaction network and coenrichment analysis, nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to memory and cognition were identified and localized in the hippocampal tissue of mice. The intervention of 3 '-SL significantly increased the metabolism of sialic acid in mouse hippocampal tissue and promoted the expression of learning-related genes (p < 0.05). Notably, it increased the expression of genes associated with neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM, p < 0.05), glutamate receptors, and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR, p < 0.05). This suggests that 3 '-SL may elevate polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) levels, which could subsequently interact with FGFR and glutamate receptors, thereby enhancing synaptic growth and plasticity. Additionally, 3 '-SL altered the composition of the mouse intestinal microbiota. The synergistic action of gut microbiota and intestinal sialidase promoted the production of free sialic acid, providing essential nutritional elements for the development of the brain's nervous system. In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the promoting effect of 3 '-SL on cognitive development in growing mice and elucidate its molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Preterm birth is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. The preterm heart before terminal differentiation is in a phase that is crucial for the number and structure of cardiomyocytes in further development, with adverse effects of hypoxic and hyperoxic events. Pharmacological intervention could attenuate the negative effects of oxygen. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist and has been mentioned in connection with cardio-protective benefits. In this study, H9c2 myocytes and primary fetal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) were cultured for 24 h under hypoxic condition (5% O-2), corresponding to fetal physioxia (pO(2) 32-45 mmHg), ambient oxygen (21% O-2, pO(2) similar to 150 mmHg), or hyperoxic conditions (80% O-2, pO(2) similar to 300 mmHg). Subsequently, the effects of DEX preconditioning (0.1 & mu;M, 1 mu M, 10 mu M) were analyzed. Modulated oxygen tension reduced both proliferating cardiomyocytes and transcripts (CycD2). High-oxygen tension induced hypertrophy in H9c2 cells. Cell-death-associated transcripts for caspase-dependent apoptosis (Casp3/8) increased, whereas caspase-independent transcripts (AIF) increased in H9c2 cells and decreased in NRCMs. Autophagy-related mediators (Atg5/12) were induced in H9c2 under both oxygen conditions, whereas they were downregulated in NRCMs. DEX preconditioning protected H9c2 and NRCMs from oxidative stress through inhibition of transcription of the oxidative stress marker GCLC, and inhibited the transcription of both the redox-sensitive transcription factors Nrf2 under hyperoxia and Hif1 & alpha; under hypoxia. In addition, DEX normalized the gene expression of Hippo-pathway mediators (YAP1, Tead1, Lats2, Cul7) that exhibited abnormalities due to differential oxygen tensions compared with normoxia, suggesting that DEX modulates the activation of the Hippo pathway. This, in the context of the protective impact of redox-sensitive factors, may provide a possible rationale for the cardio-protective effects of DEX in oxygen-modulated requirements on survival-promoting transcripts of immortalized and fetal cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: Ganoderma leucocontextum T.H. Li, W. Q. Deng M. Wang & H.P.Hu. is a highland herbal medicine that has been shown to nourish the nervesand prolong life. Nevertheless, there is no evidence to indicate that Ganoderma leucocontextum triterpenoids (GLTs) reduce the damage triggered by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aim of the study: The aim of this investigation was to ascertain the protective effects of GLTs on AD mice models and cells, as well as to look into potential pathways. Materials and methods: In this study, the phytochemical characterization of GLTs was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The AD mouse model was induced by injecting intraperitoneally with D-galactose (120 mg/kg) and administering orally with aluminum chloride (20 mg/kg) daily for 28 days. After that, donepezil (5 mg/kg) and GLTs (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 g/kg) were administered orally for 35 days. During the treatment period, aluminum chloride (20 mg/kg) and D-galactose (120 mg/kg) were continuously administered. And the behavior of the animals and the molecular changes of the hippocampus were determined after the whole experimental procedure. Furthermore, BV-2 cells were employed to validate GLTs' anti-neuroinflammatory properties. Results: The total triterpenoids content was 443.12 +/- 0.21 g/kg and was inferred to contain 19 classes of substances such as organic acids, amino acids, vitamins, flavonoids, and other chemicals in GLTs. Treatment of Dgalactose/aluminum chloride-induced mouse with GLTs can ameliorate AD symptoms, counteract cognitive decline, improve A beta 1-42 deposition, reduce the expression level of pro-apoptotic proteins, and attenuate the activation of hippocampal microglia and astrocytes. GLTs significantly increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes and significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory factors. GLTs inhibits nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) nuclear translocation and preserves myd88/traf6-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, GLTs (2 and 5 mg/mL) inhibited the generation of nitric oxide and protected lipopolysaccharide (1 mg/L)-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 cells. Conclusions: Taken together, Ganoderma leucocontextum triterpenoids can improve cognitive functions, including learning and memory, by reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, preventing apoptosis, and controlling amyloid genesis.

AB  - Objective: In Parkinson's disease (PD), mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress cause an increase in free radicals and the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. By preventing lipid peroxidation and protecting against peroxide radicals, vitamin E is the most important antioxidant of biological membranes that can neutralize free radicals. Also, the improvement of the functional status of mitochondria can be influenced by exercise, which can be partially the result of changes in the mitochondrial mitophagy and dynamics system. This study aimed to investigate the interactive effects of six weeks of vitamin E (VE) VE ) consumption and training on the mitochondrial function [Cytochrome C ( Cyt-C ), Adenosine triphosphate (Atp) Atp ) synthase, optical atrophy1 mitochondrial dynamics like guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ), 8-Oxodequanosin and Pten induced kinase 1 ( Pink1 ) is a protein coding gene] in the hippocampus tissue of PD rats. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 4-6-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (mean weight 250 +/- 30 g) were given parkinsonism with reserpine (2 mg/kg) and were categorized into different groups, including healthy (H), PD, VE solvent+PD (Sham), aerobic exercise+PD (AE+PD), VE+PD, AE+VE+PD. The aerobic training program was carried out for six weeks and 5 sessions per week and each session lasted 15-22 minutes. VE was also taken orally at 30 mg/kg daily. Results: A six-week regimen of VE supplement along with the AE significantly reduced the Cyt-C gene expression level, also we observed a significant increase in gene expression level of the Pink1, Atp synthase and Opa1 (P<0.05). There is no significant difference was found in the level of 8-Oxog detected in hippocampal tissue samples (P>0.05). Conclusion: The consumption of VE along with AE may provide therapeutic effects on mitochondrial damage in PD rats.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of dietary hempseed or camelina cakes on the fatty acid profiles of intramuscular fat in quail. A total of 189 one-day-old quail were allocated to three dietary treatment groups. The diet of the control (C) group was supplemented with 10% rapeseed cake, whereas the rapeseed in experimental 1 (HE) and experimental 2 (CA) groups was replaced by, respectively, hempseed cake and camelina cake in the same proportions. The length of the study was 42 days. Dietary enrichment with camelina cake increased the alpha-linolenic fatty acid (ALA) content in the meat of CA group 2.5 times (p < 0.01). The muscle tissues of CA contained 3.4-3 times more eicosapentaenoic acid (p < 0.01), 1.2 times more docosapentaenoic acid (p < 0.05-p < 0.01) and 1.3 times more docosahexaenoic acid (p < 0.01) and, thus, demonstrated the increase in total long chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (p < 0.01) and total n-3 PUFA (p < 0.01) compared with the C group. The ALA and total n-3 PUFA content in the breast and leg meat of HE-treated quail were, respectively, 1.3 and 1.1 times higher (p < 0.01) than in the C group but the accumulation was lower compared to the CA group. The content of gamma-linolenic acid was found to be 1.21-1.31 times higher in HE quail meat (p < 0.01). However, hempseed cake supplementation had a negative effect on growth performance. The supplementation of quail feed with camelina or hempseed cakes resulted in the production of healthy meat with an increased n-3 PUFA content.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is popularly used as a herbal medicine and food additive in the world. Total flavonoids of Hippophae rhamnoides (TFH) are reported to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities.
   Aim: The effects of TFH on atopic dermatitis (AD)-like lesions induced by MC903 in mice was elucidated in the study.Methods: To induce AD-like lesions, MC903 was adopted to apply repeatedly on the left ear in C57BL/6 mice. After induction of AD-like lesions, 0.5% and 1% TFH cream was applied topically on ears of mice once a day for 8 days. The degree of skin lesions was evaluated by macroscopical and histological methods. Expressions of filaggrin (FLG) was evaluated by Western blotting. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was adopted to detect the mRNA expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL-4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in skin lesions. In vitro, Cytokine Antibody Arrays were performed to measure production of cytokines in IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha-treated HaCaT cells, Western blotting was employed to detect the ex-pressions of p-NF-kappa B, p-ERK and p-P38.
   Results: Topical application of TFH significantly improved the severity of dermatitis by inhibiting the infiltration of mast cell, increasing expression of FLG, decreasing the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-4, IFN-gamma and TSLP in skin lesions. TFH decreased the levels of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, MCP-3, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) in the supernatants of the HaCaT cells treated by IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha. Furthermore, ex-pressions of p-NF-kappa B, p-ERK and p-P38 were also decreased by TFH administration with dose dependent manner in HaCaT cells treated by IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha.
   Conclusions: Topical application of TFH improved AD-like lesions in mice induced by MC903. Which exerted the effects of anti-inflammation and repairing skin barrier by regulating Th1/Th2 balance. This finding indicates that TFH is a novel potential agent for the external treatment of AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neuro-degenerative disease characterized by dementia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diseases, including AD. MiR-132-3p has been identified to be downregulated in AD. In this study, we explored the effects of miR-132-3p on neuron apoptosis and impairments of learning and memory abilities. A beta 1-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells were used as in vitro models of AD. An AD-like homocysteine (Hcy) rat model was established to evaluate the effects of miR-132-3p on AD pathogenesis in vivo. RIP, RNA pull down and luciferase reporter assays were conducted to investigate the relationship between miR-132-3p and its downstream target genes. The viability and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells were measured by CCK-8 and TUNEL assays. The rat spatial learning and memory abilities were accessed using Morris water maze test. Results indicated that miR-132-3p was downregulated in SH-SY5Y cells after A beta 1-42 treatment and promoted cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-132-3p targeted heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU). HNRNPU acted as an RNA binding protein (RBP) to regulate the mRNA stability of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Overexpression of HNRNPU or BACE1 reversed the effects of miR-132-3p overexpression on the viability and apoptosis of A beta 1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells. In vivo experiments revealed the downregulation of miR-132-3p in the hippocampus of Hcy-treated rats. MiR-132-3p suppressed levels of apoptotic genes in hippocampus and reduced impairments of learning and memory abilities in Hcy-treated rats. In conclusion, miR-132-3p reduces apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells and alleviates impairments of learning and memory abilities in AD rats by modulating the HNRNPU/BACE1 axis.

AB  - Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protein which is closely related to neurodegenerative disorders. The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is well expressed in microglia cells involving inflammatory disorders of the brain. However, it remains unclear as to how modulation of AhR expression by thrombin is related to the development of neurodegeneration disorders. In this study, we investigated the role of AhR in the development of thrombin-induced neurodegenerative processes, especially those concerning microglia. The primary culture of either wild type or AhR deleted microglia, as well as BV-2 cell lines, was used for an in vitro study. Hippocampal slice culture and animals with either wild type or with AhR deleted were used for the ex vivo and in vivo studies. Simulations of ligand protein docking showed a strong integration between the thrombin and AhR. In thrombin-triggered microglia cells, deleting AhR escalated both the NO release and iNOS expression. Such effects were abolished by the administration of the AhR agonist. In thrombin-activated microglia cells, downregulating AhR increased the following: vascular permeability, pro-inflammatory genetic expression, MMP-9 activity, and the ratio of M1/M2 phenotype. In the in vivo study, thrombin induced the activation of microglia and their volume, thereby contributing to the deterioration of neurobehavior. Deleting AhR furthermore aggravated the response in terms of impaired neurobehavior, increasing brain edema, aggregating microglia, and increasing neuronal death. In conclusion, thrombin caused the activation of microglia through increased vessel permeability, expression of inflammatory response, and phenotype of M1 microglia, as well the MMP activity. Deleting AhR augmented the above detrimental effects. These findings indicate that the modulation of AhR is essential for the regulation of thrombin-induced brain damages and that the AhR agonist may harbor the potentially therapeutic effect in thrombin-induced neurodegenerative disorder.

AB  - N-acetyl-L-cysteine-modified CdTe QDs (Cadmium Telluride Quantum Dots) were obtained by hydrothermal method, and DA (amino deoxyglucose), PEG (polyethylene glycol), and 9-p-D (9 polyamine acid) were obtained by ligand substitution, which were used for remodifying CdTe QDs. Successively, a novel CdTe QDs nanomaterial, CdTe-NALC, was obtained. This composite nanometer material was characterized by ultraviolet, fluorescence spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen-spectrum, and other methods to study further its biocompatibility and toxic effect on the primary cultured mouse hippocampus neurons. PC12 cells were vitro-cultured and dissolved in the CdTe-NALC solution with different concentrations. After 24 h, the expression levels of proteins related to the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate)-CREB (cAMP response element-binding proteins)-BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) signaling pathway in the cells were detected by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kit. In the experiment, the DA/9-p-D/PEG-modified CdTe QDs composite nanometer material was successfully manufactured by ligand replacement. The nanoparticles had good dispersibility with an average particle size of about 9.2 nm. DA/9-p-D/PEG modification improved the biocompatibility of the QDs. CdTe composite nanomaterials could significantly reduce the cell activity of mouse hippocampal neurons and promote their apoptosis, with an evident dose-apoptosis relationship. With the increase of CDTE-NALC solution concentration, cAMP, pCREB (phosphorylated CREB), and BDNF protein content decreased (P < 0.05).

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate the possible neuroprotective impact of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and an alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) mixture against brain damage in irradiated rats. AuNPs were synthesized and characterized using different techniques. Then, a preliminary investigation was carried out to determine the neuroprotective dose of AuNPs, where three single doses (500, 1000, and 1500 mu g/kg) were orally administrated to male Wistar rats, one hour before being exposed to a single dose of 7Gy gamma radiation. One day following irradiation, the estimation of oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde, MDA; glutathione peroxidase, GPX), DNA fragmentation, and histopathological alterations were performed in brain cortical and hippocampal tissues in both normal and irradiated rats. The chosen neuroprotective dose of AuNPs (1000 mu g/kg) was processed with ALA (100 mg/kg) to prepare the AuNPs-ALA mixture. The acute neuroprotective effect of AuNPs-ALA in irradiated rats was determined against valproic acid as a neuroprotective centrally acting reference drug. All drugs were orally administered one hour before the 7Gy-gamma irradiation. One day following irradiation, animals were sacrificed and exposed to examinations such as those of the preliminary experiment. Administration of AuNPs, ALA, and AuNPs-ALA mixture before irradiation significantly attenuated the radiation-induced oxidative stress through amelioration of MDA content and GPX activity along with alleviating DNA fragmentation and histopathological changes in both cortical and hippocampal tissues. Notably, the AuNPs-ALA mixture showed superior effect compared to that of AuNPs or ALA alone, as it mitigated oxidative stress, DNA damage, and histopathological injury collectively. Administration of AuNPs-ALA resulted in normalized MDA content, increased GPX activity, restored DNA content in the cortex and hippocampus besides only mild histopathological changes. The present data suggest that the AuNPs-ALA mixture may be considered a potential candidate for alleviating radiation-associated brain toxicity.

AB  - BackgroundChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is likely to relapse due to aberrant eosinophil infiltration. The deficiency of Vitamin D (VD) is associated with increased eosinophil infiltration in eosinophilic oesophagitis. However, the role of VD in eosinophilic CRSwNP (ECRSwNP) remains unclear. This study aims to explore the effects of VD on eosinophil chemotaxis in ECRSwNP and the underlying mechanisms.MethodsHuman nasal mucosal tissues were collected from the control group, patients with non-ECRSwNP and those with ECRSwNP. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the expression of VD and CCL26 in the nasal mucosa, plasma, or human primary nasal epithelial cells (hNECs). hNECs and eosinophils from patients were cultured to investigate the effect of VD on eosinophil chemotaxis and CCL26 expression via eosinophil migration assay, Western blot, and ELISA. Transcriptome sequencing, pathway enrichment analysis, Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to determine the key signaling pathway involved in eosinophil chemotaxis.ResultsA significant decrease in VD levels was observed in the nasal mucosa of patients with ECRSwNP, which correlated with increased local eosinophil infiltration. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis suggested that glycolysis signaling was promoted in the ECRSwNP group, verified by enhanced expression of glycolytic key enzymes that were positively correlated with eosinophil infiltration in nasal mucosa from patients with ECRSwNP. VD suppressed eosinophil chemotaxis in vitro by inhibiting CCL26 expression. Glycolysis regulated CCL26 expression via the ERK pathway and lactate, which promoted the expression and stability of CCL26 protein. VD attenuated glycolysis, leading to decreased production of lactate and inactivation of the ERK pathway. The decrease in lactate production suppressed eosinophil chemotaxis. Moreover, the ERK pathway activator reversed the inhibitory effect of VD on eosinophil chemotaxis.ConclusionsVD impedes eosinophil chemotaxis by inhibiting glycolysis - induced CCL26 expression via attenuating the activation of the ERK pathway and reducing lactate production. VD supplementation may be a novel strategy to treat ECRSwNP.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hippocampus trimaculatus is an important traditional Chinese medicine, which has been used to warm and tonify kidney yang in the clinic for a long time. Modern studies have also shown that it can also display various pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammation and antitumor due to the abundant ingredients. However, its therapeutic effect and mechanism against tumors like leukemia, which emerge as a prevalent type of hematological tumor disease, requires further research. Aim of the study: The current study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of sphingoid bases extracted from Hippocampus trimaculatus Leach against human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells through mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Materials and methods: The sphingoid bases extracted from Hippocampus trimaculatus Leach (SBHTL) was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells was treated with different concentrations of SBHTL. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, Annexin V assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by fluorescence intensity with probe Rhodamine 123. Cell cycle was analyzed by the MuseTM Cell Cycle Kit. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), caspase-3, caspase-9 expressions. Results: The SBHTL species mainly consist of d16:0, d18:2 and d20:2 based on the determination by GC-MS and FTIR, which barely exist in mammals. SBHTL significantly induced apoptosis of human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the SBHTL could cause mitochondrial membrane potential loss of K562 cells and down-regulate the Bcl-2, up-regulate the Bax as well as subsequently active the expression of caspase-3, 8, and 9.

AB  - Resveratrol, a plant-derived polyphenol, exhibits significant antidepressant effects and notably enhances neuroplasticity in neurological diseases. However, whether the antidepressant function of resveratrol is related to neuroplasticity remains uncertain, and the underlying mechanisms is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of resveratrol in neuroplasticity in depression. Here, we adopted the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model and resveratrol intervention by oral gavage. Thereafter, behavioral tests confirmed resveratrol's antidepressant effect, and Nissl staining, Golgi staining, and Western blotting (WB) were employed to assess the neuronal plasticity. Moreover, proteomic analysis and WB were used to screen and identify the key proteins. To investigate the downstream target of ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 4 (ELAVL4) (one of candidate genes), the RNA Interactome Database and the National Center for Biotechnology Information databases were utilized to predict the targets of ELAVL4. Finally, Quantitative PCR, WB, and Immunofluorescence were used to verify the prediction. Our results indicate that resveratrol alleviates CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors accompanied by the restoration of impaired hippocampal neuroplasticity. Then, proteomic analysis shows that 351 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) decrease after CUMS, while 24 DEPs increase remarkably with the resveratrol treatment. Among which, ELAVL4 is downregulated by CUMS, simultaneously increasing after resveratrol intervention, which acts as a protective protein in this process. Finally, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA is predicted to be the potential target of ELAVL4 and validated by molecular technologies. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that resveratrol's antidepressant efficacy is closely associated with ELAVL4, an RNA-binding protein, a mediated neuroplasticity pathway, potentially intersecting with the Bdnf mRNA. Overall, this research sheds light on the role of the ELAVL4-Bdnf mRNA pathway through neuroplasticity in resveratrol's antidepressant action, which provides an mRNA regulation perspective for the development of novel antidepressants and understanding depression pathology.

AB  - Polygalae radix (PR) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that is used to treat depression, and polygalae radix oligosaccharide esters (PROEs) are the main active ingredient. Although gut microbiota are now believed to play key role in depression, the effects of PROEs on depression via modulation of gut microbiota remain unknown. In this article, we investigate the effect of PROEs on the gut microbiota of a depression rat and the possible mechanism responsible. The depression rat model was induced by solitary rearing combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The depression-like behavior, the influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the contents of monoamine neurotransmitter in the hippocampus, and the quantity of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the feces were each assessed, and the serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured by ELISA. Additionally, ultrastructural changes of the duodenal and colonic epithelium were observed under transmission electron microscope, and the gut microbiota were profiled by using 16S rRNA sequencing. The results show that PROEs alleviated the depression-like behavior of the depression model rats, increased the level of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain, and reduced the hyperfunction of the HPA axis. Furthermore, PROEs regulated the imbalance of the gut microbiota in the rats, relieving intestinal mucosal damage by increasing the relative abundance of gut microbiota with intestinal barrier protective functions, and adjusting the level of SCFAs in the feces, as well as the serum levels of LPS and IL-6. Thus, we find that PROEs had an antidepressant effect through the restructuring of gut microbiota that restored the function of the intestinal barrier, reduced the release of intestinal endotoxin, and constrained the inflammatory response.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xihuang Pill (XHP) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula that was originally used to treat malignant ulcers. Recent studies revealed its therapeutic effects on various malignant tumors. However, its potential efficacy and mechanisms in primary liver cancer (PLC) were not thoroughly investigated. Aim of the study: This study aimed to elucidate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of XHP in the treatment of PLC. Methods: An orthotopic PLC mice model was established adopting hydrodynamic tail vein injection method. Human liver cancer cell lines and organoids were utilized to assess the effect of XHP in vitro. The expressions of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Yes-associated protein (YAP) were evaluated with western blotting. The mRNA expressions of YAP downstream targets were detected with qRT-PCR. Data from Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma Collection of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-LIHC) were extracted to identify the potential targets of HCC. The major active components of XHP methanol extract and XHP medicated serum were detected by UHPLC-MS/MS. Human liver cancer cell lines were used to assess the efficacy and potential mechanisms of these active components in XHP in vitro. Finally, molecular docking was conducted to predict the binding affinities of XHP's active components with AFP and YAP. Results: XHP inhibited PLC tumor growth in the mice model with decreased AFP and Ki-67 index. In vitro, XHP suppressed the proliferation and migration of liver cancer cell lines in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, even with a low concentration (5 mg/mL), XHP paralyzed the growth of PLC organoids derived from patients. Mechanistically, XHP downregulated the expression of AFP and YAP signaling in vitro and in vivo. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis identified 25 active components in XHP medicated serum. Among them, certain active compounds suppressed PLC cell proliferation and downregulated AFP and YAP signaling, suggesting their therapeutic potentials in PLC. Molecular docking indicated that several components in XHP exhibited strong binding affinities with both AFP and YAP. Conclusion: XHP inhibited PLC growth by suppressing AFP and YAP signaling. This study provides an experimental basis for XHP application in PLC treatment.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizure attacks. Numerous studies have suggested a strong correlation between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in several neurodegenerative disorders including epilepsy. This study is aimed at investigating the neuroprotective effects of the natural compound carveol against pentylenetetrazole- (PTZ-) induced kindling and seizure model. Two different doses of carveol (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) were administered to male rats to determine the effects and the effective dose of carveol and to further demonstrate the mechanism of action of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) in PTZ-induced kindling model. Our results demonstrated reduced levels of innate antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glutathione (GSH), associated with elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) and inflammatory cytokines level such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and mediators like cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B). These detrimental effects exacerbated oxidative stress and provoked a marked neuronal alteration in the cortex and hippocampus of PTZ-intoxicated animals that were associated with upregulated Nrf2 gene expression. Furthermore, carveol treatment positively modulated the antioxidant gene Nrf2 and its downstream target HO-1. To further investigate the role of Nrf2, an inhibitor of Nrf2 called all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was used, which further exacerbated PTZ toxicity. Moreover, carveol treatment induced cholinergic system activation by mitigating acetylcholinesterase level which is further linked to attenuated neuroinflammatory cascade. The extent of blood-brain barrier disruption was evaluated based on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that carveol acts as an Nrf2 activator and therefore induces downstream antioxidants and mitigates inflammatory insults through multiple pathways. This eventually alleviates PTZ-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

AB  - The seed oil of Carapa guianensis Aublet (Andiroba) has been used in folk medicine for its insect-repelling, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malarial activities. This study aimed to examine the triglyceride (TG) reducing effects of C. guianensis-derived limonoids or other commercially available limonoids in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells and evaluate the expression of lipid metabolism or autophagy-related proteins by treatment with 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (DAOG; 1), a principal limonoid of C. guianensis. The gedunin-type limonoids, such as DAOG (% of control at 20 mu M: 70.9 +/- 0.9%), gedunin (2, 74.0 +/- 1.1%), epoxyazadiradione (4, 73.4 +/- 2.0%), 17 beta-hydroxyazadiradione (5, 79.9 +/- 0.6%), 7-deacetoxy-7 alpha-hydroxygedunin (6, 61.0 +/- 1.2%), andirolide H (7, 87.4 +/- 2.2%), and 6 alpha-hydroxygedunin (8, 84.5 +/- 1.1%), were observed to reduce the TG content at lower concentrations than berberine chloride (BBR, a positive control, 84.1 +/- 0.3% at 30 mu M) in HepG2 cells pretreated with high glucose and oleic acid. Andirobin-, obacunol-, nimbin-, and salannin-type limonoids showed no effect on the intracellular TG content in HepG2 cells. The TG-reducing effect of DAOG was attenuated by the concomitant use of compound C (dorsomorphin), an AMPK inhibitor. Further investigation on the detailed mechanism of action of DAOG at non-cytotoxic concentrations revealed that the expressions of autophagy-related proteins, LC3 and p62, were upregulated by treatment with DAOG. These findings suggested that gedunin-type limonoids from Andiroba could ameliorate fatty liver, and that the action of DAOG in particular is mediated by autophagy.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Vascular dementia (VaD) represents a frequently seen cognitive dysfunction syndrome and has ranks second among dementia subtypes following Alzheimer's disease. At present, Ditan Decoction (DTD), the traditional Chinese herbal prescription, is clinically applied in treating VaD. However, the material basis of its efficacy and therapeutic mechanism still remain unknown. Aim of the study: This experiment investigated the protection induced by DTD against VaD and the associated mechanism through network pharmacology, mass spectrometry analysis, and in vivo validation. Materials and methods: We induced VaD in a rat model using bilateral common carotid artery ligation method (2VO) and administered DTD at doses of 2.14, 4.28 and 8.55 g/kg, with Memantine (0.9 mg/kg) being the positive control. Following oral administration with DTD or Memantine for 4 weeks, behavioral tests were used for assessing cognitive function. H&E and Nissl staining was used for evaluating hippocampal pathology. TEM was used to visualize the ultrastructure of the hippocampal tissue. ELISA was carried out for measuring inflammatory factor levels in rat serum, and biochemical assays were employed to assess oxidative stress levels. Ferroptosis in the hippocampus was examined through analyzing corresponding biomarkers and protein expression. Additionally, HPLC-Q-Exactive-MS technology was employed for identifying DTD components, whereas network pharmacology was conducted for predicting DTD's targets for treating VaD. HIF1 alpha expression levels were assessed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. We also further validated whether the protective effects of DTD on VaD were mediated through the HIF1 alpha-regulated ferroptosis signaling pathway by using an HIF1 alpha inhibitor in rats. Results: DTD demonstrated protective effects against 2VO-induced hippocampal injury through alleviating oxidative stress, lowering systemic inflammation, while preventing ferroptosis of hippocampal tissue. As revealed by network pharmacology, DTD probably executes its function in VaD by activating HIF1 alpha pathway. According to immunofluorescence and Western blotting, DTD activated HIF1 alpha within hippocampal tissue. Furthermore, DTD's protection against VaD and ferroptosis was reversed when an HIF1 alpha inhibitor was applied. Conclusion: These findings suggested that DTD rescued cognitive dysfunction in VaD by inhibiting ferroptosis via activating HIF1 alpha pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lignosus rhinocerotis (Cooke) Ryvarden cultivar TM02, also known as tiger's milk mushroom, is regarded as important folk medicine in Malaysia, while is used for the treatment of liver cancer, chronic hepatitis, gastric ulcer in traditional Chinese medicine. However, there is no compilation of scientific evidence that its protection for gastric, and no attempts have been made to understand how polysaccharides in Lignosus rhinocerotis might promote intestinal mucosal wound healing.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of 8-glucan prepared from L. rhinocerotis using an enzymatic method on epithelial restitution during intestinal mucosal damage.
   Materials and methods: Based on FT-IR, MALDI-TOF-MS, HPSEC-MALLS-RID, and AFM, the structure of polysaccharides from L. rhinocerotis was analysed. In addition, polysaccharides were used to test for wound healing activity in IEC-6 cells by measuring cell migration, proliferation, and expression of cell division control protein 42, Rac-1, RhoA, and Par-3.
   Results: 8-glucan was extracted using enzyme-assisted extraction, and a yield of approximately 8.5 +/- 0.8% was obtained from the dried biomass. The 8-glucan extracted by enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE) of polysaccharides was composed entirely of D-glucose with a total carbohydrate content of 95.5 +/- 3.2%. The results of HPLC, FTIR, and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses revealed EAEP to be confirmed as 8-glucan. The molecular weight of prepared 8-glucan was found to be 5.315 X 10(4) g/mol by HPSEC-MALLS-RID. Furthermore, mucosal wound healing studies showed that the treatment of IEC-6 with a beta-glucan concentration of 200 mu g/mL promoted cell migration and proliferation, and it enhanced the protein expression of cell division control protein 42, Rac-1, RhoA, and Par-3.
   Conclusions: The present study reveals that the prepared 8-glucan accelerates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and migration via activation of Rho-dependent pathway. Hence, 8-glucan can be employed as a prospective therapeutic agent for the treatment of diseases associated with gastrointestinal mucosal damage, such as peptic ulcers and inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Experimental studies have shown the action of green tea in modulating cardiac remodeling. However, the effects of green tea on the cardiac remodeling process induced by doxorubicin (DOX) are not known. Therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating whether green tea extract could attenuate DOX-induced cardiac remodeling, assessed by cardiac morphological and functional changes and associated with the evaluation of different modulators of cardiac remodeling. The animals were divided into four groups: the control group (C), the green tea group (GT), the DOX group (D), and the DOX and green tea group (DGT). Groups C and GT received intraperitoneal sterile saline injections, D and DGT received intraperitoneal injections of DOX, and GT and DGT were fed chow supplemented with green tea extract for 35 days prior to DOX injection. After forty-eight hours, we performed an echocardiogram and euthanasia and collected the materials for analysis. Green tea attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by increasing cardiac function and decreasing the concentric remodeling. Treatment with DOX increased oxidative stress in the heart, marked by a higher level of lipid hydroperoxide (LH) and lower levels of antioxidant enzymes. Treatment with green tea increased the antioxidant enzymes' activity and decreased the production of LH. Green tea extract increased the expression of Top2-beta independent of DOX treatment. The activity of ATP synthase, citrate synthase, and complexes I and II decreased with DOX, without the effects of green tea. Both groups that received DOX presented with a lower ratio of P-akt/T-akt and a higher expression of CD45, TNF alpha, and intermediate MMP-2, without the effects of green tea. In conclusion, green tea attenuated cardiac remodeling induced by DOX and was associated with increasing the expression of Top2-beta and lowering oxidative stress. However, energy metabolism and inflammation probably do not receive the benefits induced by green tea in this model.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Chai Shao Jie Yu Granules (CSJY) is a renowned and time-honored formula employed in clinical practice for the management of various conditions, notably depression. Depression, a prevalent psychiatric disorder, poses challenges with limited effective treatment options. Traditional herbal medicines have garnered increasing attention in the realm of combating depression, being perceived as safer alternatives to pharmacotherapy. Aim of the study: To explore the effects and mechanisms of CSJY in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)induced depression. Materials and methods: Rat models of CUMS-induced depression were established, and the rats were randomly allocated into six groups: Control, CUMS, CUMS + Paroxetine (PX), CUMS + CSJY-L, CUMS + CSJY-M, and CUMS + CSJY-H. Throughout the study, the rats' body weight was monitored. Depression-related behaviors were assessed using the sucrose preference test (SPT) and open field test (OFT). High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) measured monoamine neurotransmitters in the rat cortex and hippocampus. We measured adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), and corticotropinrelease hormone (CRH) levels in rat serum. Additionally, network pharmacology was employed to predict relevant molecular targets and potential mechanisms, followed by in vivo validation. Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate the protein levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine/serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1A) and Glutamate (Glu)-related proteins, such as p-GluA1, GluA1, p-GluN1, GluN1, p-GluN2A and GluN2A in the hippocampus. Results: In behavioral assessments, CUMS rats exhibited depressive behaviors, which were ameliorated by CSJY or PX treatment. Moreover, CSJY or PX treatment increased serotonin (5-HT) levels. It reduced the kynurenine/ tryptophan (KYN/TRP) and gamma-aminobutyric acid/glutamate (GABA/Glu) in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as reduced serum levels of ACTH, CORT and CRH. Furthermore, CSJY or PX administration enhanced the decreased expression of p-GluN1/GluN1 while upregulating 5-HT1A and p-GluA1/GluA1 levels in the CUMS group. Conclusion: CSJY demonstrated the ability to alleviate depressive behaviors in CUMS-induced depression rats, potentially through the inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, modulation of monoamine neurotransmitters, and glutamatergic neurons. These findings suggest that CSJY could serve as a promising treatment option for depression.

AB  - Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is diagnosed when good-quality embryos repeatedly fail to implant after transfer in several in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment cycles. Different expression profiles in maternal mRNAs could be referring to many diseases including RIF. This study aimed to reveal significantly dysregulated selected genes expression between healthy fertile women and RIF patients in the implantation window days of the natural menstrual cycle. MME, WWC1, TNC, and FOXP3 genes were chosen as target genes regarding their possible relations with the implantation process. Pathways with these genes were identified and the relationship between these pathways and RIF was investigated. In this study, the endometrial biopsy samples were collected in the secretory phase (cycle day 20-24) of the menstrual cycle from RIF patients (n = 34) and healthy fertile controls (n = 34). After "Pathway and network-oriented GWAS analysis" (PANOGA) and "Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes" (KEGG) pathway analysis; "Membrane Metalloendopeptidase" (MME), "WW and C2 Domain Containing 1" (WWC1), "Tenascin C" (TNC) and "Forkhead Box P3" (FOXP3) genes were chosen as target genes by regarding their possible relation with implantation process. Detection of differences in mRNA expressions between the control group and RIF patients has been performed with the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method. Results of the study showed that MME and WWC1 genes expression levels are significantly (p < 0,05) up-regulated 4.9 and 5.2 times respectively and TNC gene expression level is significantly (p < 0,05) down-regulated 9 times in the RIF samples compared to the control group. However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the patient group and the control group in the expression of the FOXP3 gene (p < 0.05). Changes are observed in the expression of the renin-angiotensin system pathway in which the MME gene is involved in the implantation process. The increase in MME gene expression can be speculated to cause implantation failure by restricting the invasion of trophoblast cells. Increasing WWC1 gene expression in the Hippo signaling pathway inhibits "Yes-associated protein 1" (YAP) expression, which is a transcriptional cofactor. Inhibition of YAP protein expression may impair the implantation process by causing the failure of endometrial decidualization. The TNC gene is located in the focal adhesion pathway and this pathway reduces cell adhesion on the endometrial surface to facilitate the attachment of the embryo to the endometrium. The reason for implantation failure might be that the intercellular connections are not suitable for implantation as a result of decreased expression of the focal adhesion pathway in which the TNC gene is effective. Considering the relations between the pathways of the target genes and the implantation process, changes in the expression of target genes might be a cause of RIF.

AB  - Genes mutated in monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders are broadly expressed. This observation supports the concept that monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders are systemic diseases that profoundly impact neurodevelopment. We tested the systemic disease model focusing on Rett syndrome, which is caused by mutations in MECP2. Transcriptomes and proteomes of organs and brain regions from Mecp2-null mice as well as diverse MECP2-null male and female human cells were assessed. Widespread changes in the steady-state transcriptome and proteome were identified in brain regions and organs of presymptomatic Mecp2-null male mice as well as mutant human cell lines. The extent of these transcriptome and proteome modifications was similar in cortex, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle and more pronounced than in the hippocampus and striatum. In particular, Mecp2- and MECP2-sensitive proteomes were enriched in synaptic and metabolic annotated gene products, the latter encompassing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways. MECP2 mutations altered pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration while maintaining the capacity to use glutamine as a mitochondrial carbon source. We conclude that mutations in Mecp2/MECP2 perturb lipid and mitochondrial metabolism systemically limiting cellular flexibility to utilize mitochondrial fuels.

AB  - The acute inflammation process is explained by numerous hypotheses, including oxidative stress, enzyme stimulation, and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The anti-inflammatory activity of Yucca gigantea methanol extract (YGME) against carrageenan-induced acute inflammation and possible underlying mechanisms was investigated. The phytochemical profile, cytotoxic, and antimicrobial activities were also explored. LC-MS/MS was utilized to investigate the chemical composition of YGME, and 29 compounds were tentatively identified. In addition, the isolation of luteolin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside, and kaempferol-3-O-alpha-l-rhamnoside was performed for the first time from the studied plant. Inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of 100 mu L of 1% carrageenan sodium. Rats were treated orally with YGME 100, 200 mg/kg, celecoxib (50 mg/kg), and saline, respectively, one hour before carrageenan injection. The average volume of paws edema and weight were measured at several time intervals. Levels of NO, GSH, TNF-alpha, PGE-2, serum IL-1 beta, IL-6 were measured. In additionally, COX-2 immunostaining and histopathological examination of paw tissue were performed. YGME displayed a potent anti-inflammatory influence by reducing paws edema, PGE-2, TNF-alpha, NO production, serum IL-6, IL-1 beta, and COX-2 immunostaining. Furthermore, it replenished the diminished paw GSH contents and improved the histopathological findings. The best cytotoxic effect of YGME was against human melanoma cell line (A365) and osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63). Moreover, the antimicrobial potential of the extract was evaluated against bacterial and fungal isolates. It showed potent activity against Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and fungal Candida albicans isolates. The promoting multiple effects of YGME could be beneficial in the treatment of different ailments based on its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic effects.

AB  - The serotonin 5-HT1A receptor is one of the most abundant and widely distributed brain serotonin (5-HT) receptors that play a major role in the modulation of emotions and behavior. The 5-HT1A receptor gene (Htr1a) is under the control of transcription factor Freud-1 (also known as Cc2d1a/Freud-1). Here, using adeno-associated virus (AAV) constructs in vivo, we investigated effects of a Cc2d1a/Freud-1 knockdown in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice on behavior, the brain 5-HT system, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). AAV particles carrying the pAAV_H1-2_shRNA-Freud-1_Syn_EGFP plasmid encoding a short-hairpin RNA targeting mouse Cc2d1a/Freud-1 mRNA had an antidepressant effect in the forced swim test 5 weeks after virus injection. The knockdown impaired spatiotemporal memory as assessed in the Morris water maze. pAAV_H1-2_shRNA-Freud-1_Syn_EGFP decreased Cc2d1a/Freud-1 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the Cc2d1a/Freud-1 knockdown upregulated 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid but not their ratio. The Cc2d1a/Freud-1 knockdown failed to increase mRNA and protein levels of Htr1a but diminished a 5-HT1A receptor functional response. Meanwhile, the Cc2d1a/Freud-1 knockdown reduced Creb mRNA expression and CREB phosphorylation and upregulated cFos mRNA. The knockdown enhanced the expression of a BDNF precursor (proBDNF protein), which is known to play a crucial part in neuroplasticity. Our data indicate that transcription factor Cc2d1a/Freud-1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders not only via the 5-HT1A receptor and transcription factor CREB but also through an influence on BDNF.

AB  - During injuries in the central nervous system, intrinsic protective processes become activated. However, cellular reactions, especially those of glia cells, are frequently unsatisfactory, and further exogenous protective mechanisms are necessary. Nimodipine, a lipophilic L-type calcium channel blocking agent is clinically used in the treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with neuroprotective effects in different models. Direct effects of nimodipine on neurons amongst others were observed in the hippocampus as well as its influence on both microglia and astrocytes. Earlier studies proposed that nimodipine protective actions occur not only via calcium channel-mediated vasodilatation but also via further time-dependent mechanisms. In this study, the effect of nimodipine application was investigated in different time frames on neuronal damage in excitotoxically lesioned organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Nimodipine, but not nifedipine if pre-incubated for 4 h or co-applied with NMDA, was protective, indicating time dependency. Since blood vessels play no significant role in our model, intrinsic brain cell-dependent mechanisms seems to strongly be involved. We also examined the effect of nimodipine and nifedipine on microglia survival. Nimodipine seem to be a promising agent to reduce secondary damage and reduce excitotoxic damage.

AB  - Depression is a widespread disease, with high mortality and recurrence rates. Recent studies have shown that elevated cytokine levels are implicated in the molecular mechanisms of depression. Oxidative stress contributes to the stimulation of cytokine production. Growing evidence suggests that ginsenoside Re (Gs-Re) exerts a neuroprotective effect on the hippocampus by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the effect and mechanism of Gs-Re in the treatment of depression remain understudied. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective and antidepressant-like effects of Gs-Re and the possible underlying mechanisms. In this article, the antidepressant-like effect of the Gs-Re was studied both in vitro (H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HT-22 cells) and in vivo (reserpine-induced depressive model mice). Our results indicated that, at the cellular level, Gs-Re effectively enhanced cell survival following H2O2 stimulation, inhibited the mass production of oxidative stress markers (MDA and ROS), and prevented the occurrence of apoptosis. Moreover, Gs-Re significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha and restored the abnormal mitochondrial membrane potential. Subsequently, Gs-Re treatment reversed reserpine-induced neuroinflammation and depressive-like behaviors in vivo and inhibited microglia overactivation. Furthermore, the alterations in the BDNF/TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway induced by H2O2 or reserpine in HT-22 cells or in the mouse hippocampus were significantly reversed by Gs-Re. K252a blocked the improvement of Gs-Re on depression-like behavior and eliminated the inhibition of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in vivo. This study suggested that Gs-Re produces neuroprotective and depressive effects by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation and activating the BDNF/TrkB/ERK/CREB pathway.

AB  - Bambuterol is a long-acting anti-asthmatic prodrug which releases terbutaline. Terbutaline is an agonist of the beta 2-adrenergic receptors which is formed by decarbamoylation of bambuterol by butyrylcholinesterase. Inhibition of the latter, as well as activation of beta 2-AR, are of interest for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Combining these two activities, bambuterol could express a good clinical efficacy against AD. The present work firstly confirmed the capacity of bambuterol to display in cellulo neuroprotective activities, reduction of Tau hyperphosphorylation and preservation of synapses in rat hippocampal neuronal cultures intoxicated with A beta peptides. Further, bambuterol, in the form of a liposomal gel, showed a good bioavailability in CNS after intranasal administration, which should reduce any side effects linked to peripheral terbutaline release. Indeed, even if the latter is more selective than other beta 2-mimetics towards bronchial beta 2-AR, cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, arrhythmias & mldr;) could occur upon cardiac beta 1-AR activation. Finally, intranasal administration of low doses of bambuterol gel in mice intoxicated with A beta peptides, prevented long-term spatial memory impairment and showed beneficial effects on the survival of neurons and on synapse preservation.

AB  - Exposure to high acute doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can induce cutaneous radiation syndrome. Weeks after such radiation insults, keratinocyte nuclei of the epidermis exhibit persisting genomic lesions that present as focal accumulations of DNA double-strand break (DSB) damage marker proteins. Knowledge about the nanostructure of these genomic lesions is scarce. Here, we compared the chromatin nano-architecture with respect to DNA damage response (DDR) factors in persistent genomic DNA damage regions and healthy chromatin in epidermis sections of two minipigs 28 days after lumbar irradiation with similar to 50 Gy gamma-rays, using single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) combined with geometric and topological mathematical analyses. SMLM analysis of fluorochrome-stained paraffin sections revealed, within keratinocyte nuclei with perisitent DNA damage, the nano-arrangements of pATM, 53BP1 and Mre11 DDR proteins in gamma-H2AX-positive focal chromatin areas (termed macro-foci). It was found that persistent macro-foci contained on average similar to 70% of 53BP1, similar to 23% of MRE11 and similar to 25% of pATM single molecule signals of a nucleus. MRE11 and pATM fluorescent tags were organized in focal nanoclusters peaking at about 40 nm diameter, while 53BP1 tags formed nanoclusters that made up super-foci of about 300 nm in size. Relative to undamaged nuclear chromatin, the enrichment of DDR protein signal tags in gamma-H2AX macro-foci was on average 8.7-fold (+/- 3) for 53BP1, 3.4-fold (+/- 1.3) for MRE11 and 3.6-fold (+/- 1.8) for pATM. The persistent macro-foci of minipig epidermis displayed a similar to 2-fold enrichment of DDR proteins, relative to DSB foci of lymphoblastoid control cells 30 min after 0.5 Gy X-ray exposure. A lasting accumulation of damage signaling and sensing molecules such as pATM and 53BP1, as well as the DSB end-processing protein MRE11 in the persistent macro-foci suggests the presence of diverse DNA damages which pose an insurmountable problem for DSB repair.

AB  - In the adult mammalian brain, neurons are produced from neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in two niches-the subventricular zone (SVZ), which forms the lining of the lateral ventricles, and the subgranular zone in the hippocampus. Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to maintaining distinct cell fates by suppressing gene expression that is required for deciding alternate cell fates. Several histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can affect adult neurogenesis in vivo. However, data regarding the role of specific HDACs in cell fate decisions remain limited. Herein, we demonstrate that HDAC8 participates in the regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs/neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the adult mouse SVZ. Specific knockout of Hdac8 in NSCs/NPCs inhibited proliferation and neural differentiation. Treatment with the selective HDAC8 inhibitor PCI-34051 reduced the neurosphere size in cultures from the SVZ of adult mice. Further transcriptional datasets revealed that HDAC8 inhibition in adult SVZ cells disturbs biological processes, transcription factor networks, and key regulatory pathways. HDAC8 inhibition in adult SVZ neurospheres upregulated the cytokine-mediated signaling and downregulated the cell cycle pathway. In conclusion, HDAC8 participates in the regulation of in vivo proliferation and differentiation of NSCs/NPCs in the adult SVZ, which provides insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease with unknown pathogenesis. Identifying possible diagnostic markers of AD is essential to elucidate its mechanisms and facilitate diagnosis. Methods: A total of 295 samples (153 AD and 142 normal) were analyzed from two datasets (GSE122063 and GSE132903) in the Gene Express Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups were identified and dimensionality reduction was applied to identify feature genes (key genes) using three algorithms of machine learning including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and Random forest (RF). In addition, we obtained sample data from single-cell RNA datasets GSE157827, GSE167490, and GSE174367 to classify cells into different types and examined changes in gene expression and their correlation with AD progression. Immunofluorescence assay was used to verify the expression of key genes in animal experiments. Results: To identify diagnostic genes associated with AD, we analyzed two datasets and identified 379 DEGs which might be related to the onset of AD, and 115 of them were up-regulated and 264 down-regulated. Three algorithms of machine learning were adopted to reduce the dimensions of these DEGs and finally six core DEGs CD86, SCG3, VGF, PRKCG, SPP1, and TPI1 of AD were identified. Diagnostic analyses showed that SCG3 was substantially down-regulated in the AD group, and its AUC was higher in both the training and validation sets (0.845, 0.927, and 0.917, respectively). Transcriptome sequencing results further revealed that SCG3 expression was down-regulated in multiple cell types in the AD group and SCG3 expression in the hippocampus was found significantly reduced in the AD group. Conclusions: This study systematically identified and validated the potential of SCG3 as an early diagnostic biomarker for AD through several technical strategies. The findings provided new biomarkers for early detection of AD and laid a foundation for future clinical applications.

AB  - Background Thyroid hormones play a vital function in the maturation in the course of mind development. Regarding the well-known effects of choline on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the study examined the effects of choline on hippocampal BDNF gene expression in maternal hypothyroidism rats. Methods and results To induce the hypothyroidism, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil was introduced to the ingesting water from the sixth day of gestation to twenty-first postnatal day (PND). Choline-treatment started twice a day on the first day of gestation until PND 21. On PND28, pups were sacrificed. The expression of BDNF gene was evaluated after the hippocampus was harvested. Our results demonstrated that both male and female pre-pubertal offspring rats' BDNF gene expression was decreased by developmental hypothyroidism. Choline increases the ratio of relative gene expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of males and females in the control/hypothyroidism group, especially in males. Conclusions It can be concluded that maternal choline supplementation on the first day of gestation until PND 21 improves brain development and cognitive function in pre-pubertal offspring rats regarding control/hypothyroidism groups.

AB  - The currently used anti-cytokine therapeutic antibodies cannot selectively neutralize pathogenic cytokine signalling that cause collateral damage to protective signalling cascades. The single domain chain firstly discovered in Camelidae displays fully functional ability in antigen-binding against variable targets, which has been seemed as attractive candidates for the next-generation biologic drug study. In this study, we established a simple prokaryotic expression system for a dual target-directed single domain-based fusion protein against the interleukin-6 receptor and human serum, albumin, the recombinant anti-IL-6R fusion protein (VHH-0031). VHH-0031 exhibited potent anti-inflammatory effects produced by LPS on cell RAW264.7, where the major cytokines and NO production were downregulated after 24 h incubation with VHH-0031 in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, VHH-0031 presented significant effects on the degree reduction of joint swelling in the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat, having a healthier appearance compared with the dexamethasone. The expression level of JNK protein in the VHH-0031 group was significantly decreased, demonstrating that VHH-0031 provides a low-cost and desirable effect in the treatment of more widely patients.

AB  - Tea plants are a perennial crop with significant economic value. Chlorophyll, a key factor in tea leaf color and photosynthetic efficiency, is affected by the photoperiod and usually exhibits diurnal and seasonal variations. In this study, high-throughput transcriptomic analysis was used to study the chlorophyll metabolism, under different photoperiods, of tea plants. We conducted a time-series sampling under a skeleton photoperiod (6L6D) and continuous light conditions (24 L), measuring the chlorophyll and carotenoid content at a photoperiod interval of 3 h (24 h). Transcriptome sequencing was performed at six time points across two light cycles, followed by bioinformatics analysis to identify and annotate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in chlorophyll metabolism. The results revealed distinct expression patterns of key genes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. The expression levels of CHLE (magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase gene), CHLP (geranylgeranyl reductase gene), CLH (chlorophyllase gene), and POR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase gene), encoding enzymes in chlorophyll synthesis, were increased under continuous light conditions (24 L). At 6L6D, the expression levels of CHLP1.1, POR1.1, and POR1.2 showed an oscillating trend. The expression levels of CHLP1.2 and CLH1.1 showed the same trend, they both decreased under light treatment and increased under dark treatment. Our findings provide potential insights into the molecular basis of how photoperiods regulate chlorophyll metabolism in tea plants.

AB  - The presynaptic protein Mover/TPRGL/SVAP30 is absent in Drosophila and C. elegans and differentially expressed in synapses in the rodent brain, suggesting that it confers specific functions to subtypes of presynaptic terminals. In order to investigate how the absence of this protein affects behavior and learning, Mover knockout mice (KO) were subjected to a series of established learning tests. To determine possible behavioral and cognitive alterations, male and female 8-week-old KO and C57Bl/6J wildtype (WT) control mice were tested in a battery of memory and anxiety tests. Testing included the cross maze, novel object recognition test (NOR), the Morris water maze (MWM), the elevated plus maze (EPM), and the open field test (OF). Mover KO mice showed impaired recognition memory in the NOR test, and decreased anxiety behavior in the OF and the EPM. Mover KO did not lead to changes in working memory in the cross maze or spatial reference memory in the MWM. However, a detailed analysis of the swimming strategies demonstrated allocentric-specific memory deficits in male KO mice. Our data indicate that Mover appears to control synaptic properties associated with specific forms of memory formation and behavior, suggesting that it has a modulatory role in synaptic transmission.

AB  - BackgroundNeuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is genetically linked to CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene, with nascent polyglycine-containing protein (uN2CpolyG) identified as a primary pathogenic factor. Emerging clinical evidence suggests that inflammation contributes to NIID pathogenesis, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular interaction between uN2CpolyG and the NF-kappa B-NLRP3 pathway.MethodsSingle-cell RNA sequencing was conducted on the skin tissues of NIID patients to assess changes in the expression of genes involved in inflammatory pathways. Cell models (HEK-293T and U87-MG) transfected with CGG9/69/100 expansion vectors were used to investigate alterations in the NF-kappa B-NLRP3-autophagy pathway. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of NF-kappa B activators was evaluated in a Drosophila model with a CGG expansion knock-in.ResultsSingle-cell sequencing revealed a significant reduction in the expression of NFKBIA, encoding NF-kappa B inhibitor alpha (IkBa), which facilitates the nuclear translocation of p65, a key NF-kappa B component. uN2CpolyG directly interacted with and sequestered p65 in nuclear inclusions, leading to reduced phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) levels. This sequestration significantly downregulated the NF-kappa B-NLRP3 pathway, impairing autophagy, as indicated by decreased LC3II/LC3I ratios. Treatment of CGG100 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased p-p65, NLRP3, and LC3II/LC3I levels while reducing insoluble uN2CpolyG levels and intranuclear inclusions. In the Drosophila knock-in model, LPS significantly reduced the number of intranuclear inclusions and improved phenotypic manifestations.ConclusionsThis study revealed that uN2CpolyG directly interacts with and sequesters p65, thereby inhibiting the NF-kappa B-NLRP3 pathway and impairing autophagy. This mechanism highlights a novel therapeutic target for NIID and provides potentially broader insights into similar mechanisms in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by misfolded protein aggregates.

AB  - This study evaluated the productivity and economic indicators of Santa In & ecirc;s and Dorper x Santa In & ecirc;s crossbred lambs finished in confinement on a forage cactus-based diet. Sixteen uncastrated lambs were used: eight purebred Santa In & ecirc;s and eight Dorper x Santa In & ecirc;s crossbreds (87.5% Dorper + 12.5% Santa In & ecirc;s). At the onset of the experiment, lambs averaged 150 +/- 7.28 days old and weighed 24.28 +/- 3.45 kg. A single ration was formulated for an expected average weight gain of 200 g/day. The forage cactus used was Mexican Elephant Ear (Opuntia stricta HAW), and the hay was buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris). The experimental period lasted 58 days, following a 9-day adaptation period, totaling 67 days. Data were subjected to analysis of variance in a completely randomized design with eight replicates per treatment, using the F-test to compare mean squares. Lambs consumed similar amounts of fresh and dry matter, but Dorper crossbred lambs had higher water consumption, total weight gain, and average daily weight gain. The genetic group had no effect on feed conversion and body condition score. The gross profit was 59.65% higher for the crossbred lambs compared to the Santa In & ecirc;s breed. Crossbred lambs showed higher productivity and better economic results. Forage cactus can be included in high proportions in diets for lambs.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is common and affected by several factors, such as age, weight, sex, and genetics. The pathogenesis of OA remains unclear. Therefore, using a rat model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA, we examined genomic-wide DNA methylation using methyl-seq and characterized the transcriptome using RNA-seq in the articular cartilage tissue from a negative control (NC) and MIA-induced rats. We identified 170 genes (100 hypomethylated and upregulated genes and 70 hypermethylated and downregulated genes) regulated by DNA methylation in OA. DNA methylation-regulated genes were enriched in functions related to focal adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and the PI3K-Akt and Hippo signaling pathways. Functions related to extracellular matrix organization, extracellular matrix proteoglycans, and collagen formation were involved in OA. A molecular and protein-protein network was constructed using methylated expression-correlated genes. Erk1/2 was a downstream target of OA-induced changes in DNA methylation and RNA expression. We found that the integrin subunit alpha 2 (ITGA2) gene is important in focal adhesion, alpha6-beta4 integrin signaling, and the inflammatory response pathway in OA. Overall, gene expression changes because DNA methylation influences OA pathogenesis. ITGA2, whose gene expression changes are regulated by DNA methylation during OA onset, is a candidate gene. Our findings provide insights into the epigenetic targets of OA processes in rats.

AB  - Glutamate and glycine are important neurotransmitters in the brain. An action potential propagating in the terminal of a presynaptic neuron causes the release of glutamate and glycine in the synapse by vesicles fusing with the cell membrane, which then activate various receptors on the cell membrane of the post-synaptic neuron. Entry of Ca2+ through the activated NMDA receptors leads to a host of cellular processes of which long-term potentiation is of crucial importance because it is widely considered to be one of the major mechanisms behind learning and memory. By analysing the readout of glutamate concentration by the post-synaptic neurons during Ca2+ signaling, we find that the average receptor density in hippocampal neurons has evolved to allow for accurate measurement of the glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft.

AB  - DNA methylation, which is modulated by both genetic factors and environmental exposures, may offer a unique opportunity to discover novel biomarkers of disease-related brain phenotypes, even when measured in other tissues than brain, such as blood. A few studies of small sample sizes have revealed associations between blood DNA methylation and neuropsychopathology, however, large-scale epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are needed to investigate the utility of DNA methylation profiling as a peripheral marker for the brain. Here, in an analysis of eleven international cohorts, totalling 3337 individuals, we report epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation with volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-three subcortical regions selected for their associations with disease and heritability and volumetric variability. Analyses of individual CpGs revealed genome-wide significant associations with hippocampal volume at two loci. No significant associations were found for analyses of thalamus and nucleus accumbens volumes. Cluster-based analyses revealed additional differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with hippocampal volume. DNA methylation at these loci affected expression of proximal genes involved in learning and memory, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fatty acid metabolism and type-2 diabetes. These DNA methylation marks, their interaction with genetic variants and their impact on gene expression offer new insights into the relationship between epigenetic variation and brain structure and may provide the basis for biomarker discovery in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric conditions.

AB  - Depression, a mood disorder, affects one in fifteen adults, has multiple risk factors and is associated with complicated underlying pathological mechanisms. P-coumaric acid (p-CA), a phenolic acid, is widely distributed in vegetables, fruits and mushrooms. P-CA has demonstrated a protective role against oxidative stress and inflammation in various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. In the current study, we investigated the protection of p-CA against depression and memory impairment in a corticosterone (CORT)-induced chronic depressive mouse model. CORT administration resulted in depression-like behaviors and memory impairment. P-CA treatment alleviated CORT-induced depression-related behaviors and memory impairment. Network pharmacology predicted that p-CA had multiple targets and mediated various signaling pathways, of which inflammation-associated targets and signaling pathways are predominant. Western blotting showed CORT-induced activation of the advanced glycation end product (AGE)-receptor of AGE (RAGE) (AGE-RAGE) signaling and increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in the hippocampus, while p-CA treatment inactivated AGE-RAGE signaling and decreased the levels of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha, suggesting that protection against depression and memory impairment by p-CA is mediated by the inhibition of inflammation, mainly via the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. Our data suggest that p-CA treatment will benefit patients with depression.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a severe neuromuscular disease mediated by a toxic gain of function of mutant RNAs. The neuropsychological manifestations affect multiple domains of cognition and behavior, but their etiology remains elusive. Transgenic DMSXL mice carry the DM1 mutation, show behavioral abnormalities, and express low levels of GLT1, a critical regulator of glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft. However, the impact of glutamate homeostasis on neurotransmission in DM1 remains unknown. We confirmed reduced glutamate uptake in the DMSXL hippocampus. Patch clamp recordings in hippocampal slices revealed increased amplitude of tonic glutamate currents in DMSXL CA1 pyramidal neurons and DG granule cells, likely mediated by higher levels of ambient glutamate. Unexpectedly, extracellular GABA levels and tonic current were also elevated in DMSXL mice. Finally, we found evidence of synaptic dysfunction in DMSXL mice, suggestive of abnormal short-term plasticity, illustrated by an altered LTP time course in DG and in CA1. Synaptic dysfunction was accompanied by RNA foci accumulation in localized areas of the hippocampus and by the mis-splicing of candidate genes with relevant functions in neurotransmission. Molecular and functional changes triggered by toxic RNA may induce synaptic abnormalities in restricted brain areas that favor neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective effects of cardamonin in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We treated six-month-old female 5XFAD mice with cardamonin at 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Novel Object Recognition (NOR) tests. ELISA, western blot, and PCR analyses evaluated amyloid-beta (A beta) levels, neuroinflammation markers, and apoptosis-related factor expression. All animals survived without toxicity. Cardamonin treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory retention in MWM and NOR tests, with the 20 mg/kg dose showing the most pronounced effects. Additionally, cardamonin reduced soluble and insoluble A beta levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The treatment also significantly decreased neuroinflammatory markers, with IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels dropping substantially at higher doses. Cardamom treatment also normalizes cleaved caspase 3, GFAP, Iba-1, PSD-95, and synaptophysin, which aids in restoring synaptic integrity. Furthermore, cardamonin led to a marked reduction in apoptosis-related gene expression, indicating its potential to mitigate neurodegeneration. Cardamonin demonstrates significant cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective properties in the 5XFAD mouse model, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD. These findings support further investigation into cardamonin's mechanisms and applicability in treating neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Growth hormone is a multifunctional molecule with broad cellular targets. This pituitary hormone is currently used as a therapeutic agent against several brain injuries due to its neurotrophic activity. The hippocampus is one of the brain regions where the growth hormone plays a role in normal and pathologic conditions. This brain structure is associated with several cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and mood, which are frequently affected by brain traumatism. The present chapter describes the experimental and clinical evidence that supports a central role of growth hormone in the hippocampus functionality.

AB  - The use of natural surfactants including plant extracts, plant hydrocolloids and proteins in nanoemulsion systems has received commercial interest due to demonstrated safety of use and potential health benefits of plant products. In this study, a whey protein isolate (WPI) from a byproduct of cheese production was used to stabilize a nanoemulsion formulation that contained hempseed oil and the Aesculus hippocastanum L. extract (AHE). A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to set the formulation criteria and the optimal nanoemulsion conditions, used subsequently in follow-up experiments that measured specifically emulsion droplet size distribution, stability tests and visual quality. Regression analysis showed that the concentration of HSO and the interaction between HSO and the WPI were the most significant factors affecting the emulsion polydispersity index and droplet size (nm) (p < 0.05). Rheological tests, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and L*a*b* color parameters were also taken to characterize the physicochemical properties of the emulsions. Emulsion systems with a higher concentration of the AHE had a potential metabolic activity up to 84% in a microbiological assay. It can be concluded from our results that the nanoemulsion system described herein is a safe and stable formulation with potential biological activity and health benefits that complement its use in the food industry.

AB  - Pollen micromorphological traits with taxonomic implications are first reported from the study area for 50 Asteraceous taxa belonging to nine tribes. Cichorieae (21 taxa), Cardueae (11 taxa), Inuleae (six taxa), and Anthemideae (four taxa) are the leading tribes. The research included Cousinia haeckeliae, Himalaiella afghana, Pterachaenia stewartii (endemic to Afghanistan and Pakistan), and Xylanthemum macropodum (endemic to Baluchistan). Light and scanning electron microscopy were employed for the visualization of pollen photomicrographs. The data was analyzed statistically via SPSS, PAST, and Origin. Significant diagnostic qualitative and quantitative palynological traits were explored for discrimination down to the species level within the tribes. All the investigated taxa possessed radial symmetry, isopolarity, and monad form (characters for distinction at the subdivision level). The aperture types were trizonocolporate, tetrazonocolporate, and tricolporate with number position and character (NPC) formulas N3P4C5, N4P4C5, and N3P4C3. Goniotreme, peritreme, and ptychotreme types of amb were recognized. Echinate, echinate lophate, scabrate, and gemmate sculpturing were present with and without perforated surface patterns. Variations in the shapes in polar and equatorial views and lacuna shapes further assisted the separation of taxa. The observed shape classes were perprolate, prolate spheroidal, prolate, subprolate, oblate spheroidal, suboblate, and oblate. Principal component analysis, correlation, standard probability plots, and ridge line paired features plot for quantitative variables determined the positive correlation between the length and width of colpi in equatorial and polar view with polar axis and equatorial diameter and number of spines between colpi with the number of spines per pollen. The number of spines per pollen was negatively correlated with the width and length of colpi in the polar view. Multiple sample analysis of variance (ANOVA) concluded that a high statistically significant difference exists among the means of analyzed traits. The examined qualitative and quantitative palynological traits revealed noticeable variations, thus providing the source for species discrimination in Asteraceous tribes.

AB  - Utilising segmental data of MHIN-UNSL-GEO-V 465, we extend and re-evaluate previous observations on the morphology of the macraucheniid Oxyodontherium zeballosi comparing with additional micro and medical CT evidence from published data on Litopterna and other South American Native Ungulates (SANU). This new anatomical information includes qualitative and quantitative data on cranial pneumatization, nasal and encephalic cavities, and body mass estimates. The calculated Encephalization Quotients for MHIN-UNSL-GEO-V 465 range between 0.32 and 0.43, which are relatively low compared to other macraucheniids. The neopallial height ratio indicates a less expanded neopallial surface than in Huayqueriana and other Miocene SANU, and a higher ratio than several early ungulates. Our data reveal that O. zeballosi shares characteristics with the protolipternid cf. Miguelsoria parayirunhor, such as a shallow rostral tympanic process and a bulkier pars canalicularis of the inner ear. Although O. zeballosi shows less pneumatic spaces than other macraucheniids, it does show an important degree of pneumatization in the anterior portion of the caudal cranium, especially affecting frontals, parietals, and the alisphenoid. Finally, the estimated body mass of O. zeballosi is around 122-180 kg. This study increases the knowledge of the internal cranial anatomy of litopterns providing potentially valuable characters for future phylogenetic analyses.

AB  - Presynaptic Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) is a key signal for synaptic vesicle release. Synaptic neurexins can partially determine the strength of transmission by regulating VGCCs. However, it is unknown whether neurexins modulate Ca2+ influx via all VGCC subtypes similarly. Here, we performed live cell imaging of synaptic boutons from primary hippocampal neurons with a Ca2+ indicator. We used the expression of inactive and active Cre recombinase to compare control to conditional knockout neurons lacking either all or selected neurexin variants. We found that reduced total presynaptic Ca2+ transients caused by the deletion of all neurexins were primarily due to the reduced contribution of P/Q-type VGCCs. The deletion of neurexin1 alpha alone also reduced the total presynaptic Ca2+ influx but increased Ca2+ influx via N-type VGCCs. Moreover, we tested whether the decrease in Ca2+ influx induced by activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1-receptor) is modulated by neurexins. Unlike earlier observations emphasizing a role for beta-neurexins, we found that the decrease in presynaptic Ca2+ transients induced by CB1-receptor activation depended more strongly on the presence of alpha-neurexins in hippocampal neurons. Together, our results suggest that neurexins have unique roles in the modulation of presynaptic Ca2+ influx through VGCC subtypes and that different neurexin variants may affect specific VGCCs.

AB  - The common pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been supported by biochemical, genetic and molecular evidence. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to be the common pathology in early AD and PD. The physiological regulation of APP and alpha-synuclein on mitochondria remains unclear, let alone whether they share common regulatory mechanisms affecting the development of neurodegenerative diseases. By studying gene knockout rats, the commonality of physiological APP and alpha-synuclein in maintaining mitochondrial function through calcium homeostasis regulation was revealed, which was critical in inhibiting hippocampal degeneration in young rats. APP and alpha-synuclein both control hippocampal mitochondrial calcium intake and outflow. In the mitochondrial calcium influx regulation, APP and alpha-synuclein are located on the mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) and converge to regulate the IP(3)R1-Grp75-VDAC2 axis. Mitochondrial calcium outflow is redundantly promoted by both alpha-synuclein and APP. Loss of APP or SNCA leads to mitochondrial calcium overload, thus enhancing aerobic respiration and ER stress, and ultimately causing excessive apoptosis in the hippocampus and spatial memory impairment in young rats. Based on this study, we believe that the physiological function impairment of APP and SNCA is the early core pathology to induce mitochondrial dysfunction at the early stage of AD and PD, while the IP(3)R1-Grp75-VDAC2 axis might be the common drug target of these two diseases.

AB  - Pathological alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin several years prior to symptom onset. Cortical mean diffusivity (cMD) may be used as a measure of early grey matter damage in AD as it reflects the breakdown of microstructural barriers preceding volumetric changes and affecting cognitive function. We investigated cMD changes early in the disease trajectory and evaluated the influence of amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau deposition. In this cross-sectional study, we analysed multimodal PET, DTI, and MRI data of 87 participants, and stratified them into A beta-negative and -positive, cognitively normal, mildly cognitively impaired, and AD patients. cMD was significantly increased in A beta-positive MCI and AD compared with CN in the frontal, parietal, temporal cortex, hippocampus, and medial temporal lobe. cMD was significantly correlated with cortical thickness only in patients without A beta deposition but not in A beta-positive patients. Our results suggest that cMD is an early marker of neuronal damage since it is observed simultaneously with A beta deposition and is correlated with cortical thickness only in subjects without A beta deposition. cMD changes may be driven by A beta but not tau, suggesting that direct A beta toxicity or associated inflammation causes damage to neurons. cMD may provide information about early microstructural changes before macrostructural changes.

AB  - High malignancy and mortality in colon cancer require clarifying the underlying mechanisms of colon cancer carcinogenesis and exploring new targets or drugs for the clinical treatment of colon cancer. Resveratrol (Res), a natural compound, shows cytotoxicity against various tumors. However, the specific anti-cancer mechanism of Res remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the anti-cancer activity of Res against colon cancer cells and the possible mechanism. The results showed that Res could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Western blotting and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that Res increased the phosphorylated YAP (pYAP) levels and decreased YAP total protein level and decreased the mRNA expression of the YAP signaling downstream genes CTGF and CYR61. The effects of Res on pYAP were enhanced by YAP inhibitor verteporfin (VP). VP also enhanced the effects of Res on decreasing viability and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the molecular docking analysis indicated Res could bind with YAP-TEAD through van der Waals, pi-alkyl, and pipi stacked interactions. Our findings suggested that the anti-cancer activity of Res may be mediated via activating Hippo/YAP signaling and partially disturbing the interaction between YAP and TEAD. All this evidence supports that Res may be an efficacious drug for colon cancer treatment. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Poststroke depression (PSD) is an important consequence after stroke, with a negative impact on stroke outcome. Recent evidence points to a modulatory role of Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 45 beta (Gadd45b) in depression. Herein, we evaluated the antidepressant efficacy and mechanism underlying the potent therapeutic effects of Gadd45b after cerebral ischemia.
   Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to cerebral ischemia by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swim test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST) were performed after completing MCAO to study the antidepressant-like effects. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuroinflammation were determined in the hippocampus.
   Results: We showed that Gadd45b knockdown induced depression-like behaviors after cerebral ischemia, including increased immobility time in the FST and TST and reduced sucrose preference. Gadd45b knockdown enhanced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a, accompanying with decreased protein levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Moreover, the levels of phosphorylated ERK and CREB, which have been implicated in events downstream of BDNF signaling, were also decreased after cerebral ischemia.
   Conclusion: Hence, the results showed that Gadd45b is a promising drug candidate for treating PSD and possibly other nervous system diseases associated with neuroinflammation. Gadd45b may have therapeutic potential for PSD through BDNF-ERK-CREB pathway and neuroinflammation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the early nineteenth century, the pre-eminence of lecturers at the University of Edinburgh medical school faced challenge from successful extra-mural teachers, like the anatomist John Barclay (1758-1826). Wishing to maintain the University's reputation, in 1816 Edinburgh Town Council proposed the institution of a new chair in Comparative Anatomy and Veterinary Surgery: a proposal which the University chose to reject. These events provided the subject to John Kay's (1742-1826) satirical print The craft in danger (1817), which accused Alexander Monro tertius (1773-1859), Thomas Charles Hope (1766-1844) and Robert Jameson (1774-1854) of attempting to hold back the progress of knowledge in the interest of personal profit. Kay staged a mock battle in which Barclay charges the entrance of the University mounted upon an elephant skeleton; Hope attempts to topple him using an insecurely anchored rope; Monro tries to fend him off with a bone, while Jameson, seated astride a walrus, brandishes a narwhal tusk. The animal specimens pictured represent identifiable objects, then in the museum collections of Barclay and Jameson - the depiction of which reflects the colonial networks of natural history collecting that brought them to Edinburgh. Kay's satirical print thus maintains a valuable record of the culture of natural history in the city, being facilitated to do so by periodicals like The Scots Magazine, and Edinburgh Literary Miscellany through which new knowledge was actively transmitted.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a serious neurodegenerative disease, is pathologically characterized by synaptic loss and dysfunction. Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is an indispensable vesicular protein specifically expressed in synapses and can be used as a biomarker for synaptic density. We found that the expression of SV2A was down-regulated in the hippocampus of AD patients, yet the relation of SV2A to other hallmarks of AD pathology such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-amyloid (A beta), and Tau protein is not thoroughly clear. In addition, SV2A colocalized with APP and was down-regulated at A beta deposition. Moreover, we found that SV2A deficiency leads to a simultaneous increase in A beta and Tau hyperphosphorylation, while SV2A overexpression was associated with downregulation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 and apolipoprotein E genes. In addition, evidence gained in the study points to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway as a possible mediator in SV2A regulation influencing the incidence and development of AD. With limited effective diagnostic methods for AD, a close interplay between SV2A and AD-related proteins demonstrated in our study may provide novel and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.

AB  - Cannabis is now one of the most commonly used illicit substances among pregnant women. This is particularly concerning since developmental exposure to cannabinoids can elicit enduring neurofunctional and cognitive alterations. This study investigates the mechanisms of learning and memory deficits resulting from prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE) in adolescent offspring. The synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 was administered to pregnant rats, and a series of behavioral, electrophysiological, and immunochemical studies were performed to identify potential mechanisms of memory deficits in the adolescent offspring. Hippocampal-dependent memory deficits in adolescent PCE animals were associated with decreased long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhanced long-term depression (LTD) at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, as well as an imbalance between GluN2A- and GluN2B-mediated signaling. Moreover, PCE reduced gene and protein expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and polysialylated-NCAM (PSA-NCAM), which are critical for GluN2A and GluN2B signaling balance. Administration of exogenous PSA abrogated the LTP deficits observed in PCE animals, suggesting PSA mediated alterations in GluN2A- and GluN2B- signaling pathways may be responsible for the impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity resulting from PCE. These findings enhance our current understanding of how PCE affects memory and how this process can be manipulated for future therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Serotonin regulates multiple physiological and pathological processes in the brain, including mood and cognition. The serotonin receptors 5-HT1AR (also known as HTR1A) and 5-HT7R (also known as HTR7) have emerged as key players in stress-related disorders, particularly depression. These receptors can form heterodimers, which influence their functions. Here, we explored the developmental dynamics of 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R expression and validated heterodimerization levels in the brain of control and stressed mice. In control animals, we found that there was an increase in 5-HT1AR expression over 5-HT7R in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus during development. Using a chronic unpredictable stress as a depression model, we found an increase in 5-HT7R expression exclusively in the PFC of resilient animals, whereas no changes in 5-HT1AR expression between control and anhedonic mice were obtained. Quantitative in situ analysis of heterodimerization revealed the PFC as the region exhibiting the highest abundance of 5-HT1AR-5-HT7R heterodimers. More importantly, upon chronic stress, the amount of heterodimers was significantly reduced only in PFC of anhedonic mice, whereas it was not affected in resilient animals. These results suggest an important role of brain-region-specific 5-HT1AR-5-HT7R heterodimerization for establishing depressive-like behaviour and for development of resiliency.

AB  - Congenital heart disease is one of the leading causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality, thus highlighting the importance of deciphering the molecular mechanisms that control heart development. As the terminal transcriptional effectors of the Hippo-YAP pathway, YAP and TEAD1 form a transcriptional complex that regulates the target gene expression and depletes either of these two genes in cardiomyocytes, thus resulting in cardiac hypoplasia. Vestigial-like 4 (VGLL4) is a transcriptional co-factor that interacts with TEAD and suppresses the YAP/TEAD complex by competing against YAP for TEAD binding. To understand the VGLL4 function in the heart, we generated two VGLL4 loss-of-function mouse lines: a germline Vgll4 depletion allele and a cardiomyocyte-specific Vgll4 depletion allele. The whole-body deletion of Vgll4 caused defective embryo development and perinatal lethality. The analysis of the embryos at day 16.5 revealed that Vgll4 knockout embryos had reduced body size, malformed tricuspid valves, and normal myocardium. Few whole-body Vgll4 knockout pups could survive up to 10 days, and none of them showed body weight gain. In contrast to the whole-body Vgll4 knockout mutants, cardiomyocyte-specific Vgll4 knockout mice had no noticeable heart growth defects and had normal heart function. In summary, our data suggest that VGLL4 is required for embryo development but dispensable for myocardial growth.

AB  - Quick responses to fast changes in the environment are crucial in animal behaviour and survival, for example to seize prey, escape predators, or negotiate obstacles. Here, we study the 'simple response time' that is the time elapsed between receptor stimulation and motor activation as typically shown in escape responses, for mobile organisms of various taxa ranging from bacteria to large vertebrates. We show that 95% of these simple response times lie within one order of magnitude of the overall geometric mean of about 25 ms, which is similar to that of a well-studied sensory time scale, the inverse of the critical flicker fusion frequency in vision, also lying within close bounds for all the organisms studied. We find that this time scale is a few times smaller than the minimum time to move by one body length, which is known to lie also within a relatively narrow range for all moving organisms. The remarkably small 10(2)-fold range of the simple response time among so disparate life forms varying over 10(20)-fold in body mass suggests that it is determined by basic physicochemical constraints, independently on the structure and scale of the organism. We thus propose first-principle estimates of the simple response and sensory time scales in terms of physical constants and a few basic biological properties common to mobile organisms and constraining their responses.

AB  - Epithelial ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies and poses a considerable threat to women's health. Although the progression-free survival of patients has been prolonged with the application of anti-angiogenesis drugs and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors, overall survival has not substantially improved. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are essential for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug, has garnered attention for its potential anti-cancer activity. However, the anti-tumor effects and possible underlying mechanisms of NTZ on ovarian cancer remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects and the mechanism of NTZ on ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. We found that NTZ inhibited the proliferation of A2780 and SKOV3 epithelial ovarian cancer cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner; Furthermore, NTZ suppressed the metastasis and invasion of A2780 and SKOV3 cells in vitro, correlating with the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Additionally, NTZ suppressed the Hippo/YAP/TAZ signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated a good binding activity with core genes of Hippo pathway, including Hippo, YAP, TAZ, LATS1, and LATS2. Oral administration of NTZ inhibited tumor growth in xenograft ovarian cancer mice models without causing considerable damage to major organs.

AB  - The disruption of endosomal actin architecture negatively affects endocytic recycling. However, the underlying homeostatic mechanisms that regulate actin organization during recycling remain unclear. In this study, we identified a synergistic endosomal actin assembly restricting mechanism in C. elegans involving WTS-1, the homolog of LATS kinases, which is a core component of the Hippo pathway. WTS-1 resides on the sorting endosomes and colocalizes with the actin polymerization regulator PTRN-1 [the homolog of the calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated proteins (CAMSAPs)]. We observed an increase in PTRN-1-labeled structures in WTS-1-deficient cells, indicating that WTS-1 can limit the endosomal localization of PTRN-1. Accordingly, the actin overaccumulation phenotype in WTS-1-depleted cells was mitigated by the associated PTRN-1 loss. We further demonstrated that recycling defects and actin overaccumulation in WTS-1-deficient cells were reduced by the overexpression of constitutively active UNC-60A(S3A) (a cofilin protein homolog), which aligns with the role of LATS as a positive regulator of cofilin activity. Altogether, our data confirmed previous findings, and we propose an additional model, that WTS-1 acts alongside the UNC-60A-mediated actin disassembly to restrict the assembly of endosomal F-actin by curbing PTRN-1 dwelling on endosomes, preserving recycling transport.

AB  - We demonstrate that the rate of extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation (P-ERK1,2/Total-ERK1,2) in the amygdala is negatively and independently associated with anxiety symptoms in 23 consecutive patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy that was surgically treated. In naive Wistar rats, the P-ERK1,2/Total-ERK1,2 ratio in the amygdala correlates negatively with innate anxiety-related behavior on the elevated plus maze (n = 20) but positively with expression of defensive-learned behavior (i.e., freezing) on Pavlovian aversive (fear) conditioning (n = 29). The microinfusion of ERK1/2 inhibitor (FR180204, n = 8-13/group) or MEK inhibitor (U0126, n = 8-9/group) into the basolateral amygdala did not affect anxiety-related behavior but impaired the evocation (anticipation) of conditioned-defensive behavior (n = 9-11/group). In conclusion, the P-ERK1,2/Total-ERK1,2 ratio in the amygdala predicts anxiety in humans and the innate anxiety- and conditioned freezing behaviors in rats. However, the ERK1/2 in the basolateral AMY is only required for the expression of defensive-learned behavior. These results support a dissociate ERK-dependent mechanism in the amygdala between innate anxiety-like responses and the anticipation of learned-defensive behavior. These findings have implications for understanding highly prevalent psychiatric disorders related to the defensive circuit manifested by anxiety and fear.

AB  - RNA editing is an epitranscriptomic modification, leading to targeted changes in RNA transcripts. It is mediated by the action of ADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on double-stranded (ds) RNA and APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like) deaminases and appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Here, we assessed its role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used non-clinical model of autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), which resembles many aspects of human multiple sclerosis (MS). We have analyzed in silico data from microglia isolated at different timepoints through disease progression to identify the global editing events and validated the selected targets in murine tissue samples. To further evaluate the functional role of RNA editing, we induced EAE in transgenic animals lacking expression of APOBEC-1. We found that RNA-editing events, mediated by the APOBEC and ADAR deaminases, are significantly reduced throughout the course of disease, possibly affecting the protein expression necessary for normal neurological function. Moreover, the severity of the EAE model was significantly higher in APOBEC-1 knock-out mice, compared to wild-type controls. Our results implicate regulatory epitranscriptomic mechanisms in EAE pathogenesis that could be extrapolated to MS and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) with common clinical and molecular features.

AB  - Regional rainfall-runoff modeling is a classic and significant research topic in hydrological sciences. Currently, the predominant modeling approach is developing data-driven models. This study proposes a rainfall-runoff model named ED-TimesNet (Encoder-Decoder-based TimesNet), which consists of convolutional neural networks. It transforms a one-dimensional time series into a two-dimensional matrix based on frequency-domain partitioning rules and subsequently employs a two-dimensional visual backbone to learn both local and global features of the hydrological time series. Compared to LSTM-based models and Transformer models, this model learns both intra-period and inter-period variations in hydrological series, simultaneously focusing on the relationships between adjacent and non-adjacent time points. It alleviates the temporal ambiguity problem inherent in attention mechanisms. This research validates the performance of the ED-TimesNet model in regional rainfall-runoff modeling tasks using the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset. The model achieves a median and mean NSE of 0.8049 and 0.7808, respectively, across 448 basins, outperforming the benchmark LSTM, VIC, and mHM models, and achieving comparable performance to the Transformer model. This paper does not address the model's performance on ungauged basins. The method of predicting runoff based on the periodic features of hydrological data provides a novel perspective for hydrological sciences.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, a substantial global health challenge affecting millions, underscore the pressing need for novel and effective pharmacotherapeutic drugs to address these disorders. In this concern, a library of novel trifluoromethylated arylidene-hydrazinyl-thiazoles has been synthesized and assessed for their antineurodegenerative potential. Multicomponent regioselective chemical transformation has been carried out utilizing thiosemicarbazide, trifluoromethylated 1,3-diketones and heteroaryl aldehydes in the presence of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in refluxing ethanol. The regioisomeric structure of the synthesized products was unambiguously characterized by employing heteronuclear 2D NMR spectroscopic studies. All the synthesized derivatives were evaluated for their anti-neurodegenerative properties on rat brain hippocampus-derived Neural Stem Cells (NSCs), examining their impact on survival, proliferation and neuronal differentiation in vitro. Among the tested thiazole derivatives, compounds 4a, 4b, 4c, 4f, 4 g, 4b' and 4i' demonstrated a remarkable increase in the number of neuronal cells as compared to the control group within the NSC culture and also exhibited the ability to promote NSC differentiation towards the neuronal lineage. Additionally, the selected compounds showed protection against amyloid beta (A beta)-induced neurotoxicity in NSCs culture. Incorporating the trifluoromethyl group into the thiazole scaffold is a pivotal factor in augmenting biopotency, resulting in a marked increase in the count of neuronal cells compared to their non-fluorinated thiazole counterparts.

AB  - Despite recent improvements, second-generation (2G) biorefineries still have challenges to overcome, especially regarding cellulose and xylan hydrolysis and xylose fermentation. Hydrolases account for a high percentage of the process' total cost, and industrial yeasts may not assimilate xylose properly. In this sense, prospecting microorganisms that can both metabolize this sugar and hydrolyze cellulose and xylan may lead to significant advances in 2G processes. Since the gut microbiota of herbivorous insects has proven to be the major player in their lignocellulose digestion, yeasts were isolated from the gut of Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, and their cellulolytic, xylanolytic, and xylose-assimilating capacity were analyzed. From a hundred larvae guts, forty-six yeasts were selected for their growth capacity in xylose-containing media. Fourteen strains were able to hydrolyze cellulose, and three showed xylanolytic activity. Two strains, taxonomically identified as Papiliotrema laurentii and Meyerozyma caribbica, stood out with the highest cellular biomass yield and productivity when submitted to a high-throughput microscale growth analysis under different culture conditions (varying pH and sugar concentration). While the P. laurentii strain displayed the highest xylanolytic activity (205.48 U/mL) and an intermediate cellulolytic capacity (31.25 U/mL), the M. caribbica strain showed, besides cellulase activity (37.46 U/mL), high ethanol and xylitol yields (0.36 g(ethanol)/g(glucose) and 0.35 g(xylitol)/g(xylose), respectively) in media with the most common fermentation inhibitors in 2G bioprocesses. Through a Central Composite Rotatable Design, the optimized condition for the simultaneous production of ethanol and xylitol was found to be in a 55-85 g/L range of sugar concentration and between pH values of 6.0 to 8.5. Also, this experimental design analysis allowed the validation of empiric-coded models. These results indicate the high biotechnological potential of prospecting yeasts in S. frugiperda guts.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins and receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), proposing IGF-1-induced neurotrophic actions in normal growth, development, and maintenance. However, while there is convincing evidence that the IGF-1 system has specific endocrine roles in the CNS, the concept is emerging that IGF-I might be also important in disorders such as ischemic stroke, brain trauma, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc., by inducing neuroprotective effects towards glutamate-mediated excitotoxic signaling pathways. Research in rodent models has demonstrated rescue of pathophysiological and behavioral abnormalities when IGF-1 was administered by different routes, and several clinical studies have shown safety and promise of efficacy in neurological disorders of the CNS. Focusing on the relationship between IGF-1-induced neuroprotection and glutamate-induced excitatory neurotoxicity, this review addresses the research progress in the field, intending to provide a rationale for using IGF-I clinically to confer neuroprotective therapy towards neurological diseases with glutamate excitotoxicity as a common pathological pathway.

AB  - The solid and growing demand for fuels evidences the necessity of diversifying the countries' energy matrices. The present work proposed to carry out pretreatment tests, enzymatic hydrolysis, and batch fermentation of elephant grass biomass - a competitive lignocellulosic culture for obtaining ethanol due to low production costs and high levels of agricultural productivity. As a process and product economy strategy, the production of xylitol integrated with ethanol production was carried out. Therefore, two alkaline pretreatment methodologies were followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain fermentable sugars. The pretreatments proved efficient in making cellulose available and removing the lignin content. The hydrolysates obtained showed 19.9 and 25.6 g/L of total sugars. Then, three fermentation conditions were carried out in each hydrolysate: (i) by the wild yeast strain Meyerozyma caribbica CHAP-096, (ii) by the industrial strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae PE-02, and (iii) by a combination of both yeasts in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. A high ethanol yield of 0.42 g(ethanol)/g(glucose) was reached through the combination of S. cerevisiae and M. caribbica strains, representing 83% of the maximum theoretical yield (0.511 g(ethanol)/g(glucose)). The industrial strain S. cerevisiae PE-2 was also able to reduce xylose into another important component in biorefinery, xylitol, with a yield of up to 0.61 g(xylitol)/g(xylose).

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway regulates tissue growth and cell fate, and its dysregulation can induce tumorigenesis. When Hippo is activated by cell-cell contact, extracellular signals, or cell polarity among others, the large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) kinase catalyzes inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) to maintain YAP in the cytoplasm or promote its degradation. Separately, calmodulin is a Ca2+-dependent protein that modulates the activity of target proteins and regulates several signaling cascades; however, its potential role in the Hippo pathway has not been identified. Here, using diverse experimental approaches, including in vitro binding analyses, kinase assays, RT-PCR, and confocal microscopy, we reveal that calmodulin promotes Hippo signaling. We show that purified YAP and LATS1 bind directly to calmodulin and form a Ca2+-dependent ternary complex in vitro. Importantly, Ca2+/calmodulin directly stimulated the activity of LATS1 kinase. In cultured mammalian cells, we demonstrated that endogenous YAP and LATS1 coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous calmodulin. In cells with activated Hippo signaling, we show that calmodulin antagonism significantly (i) decreases YAP phosphorylation, (ii) increases expression of two Hippo target genes (connective tissue growth factor [CTGF] and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 [CYR61]) that regulate cell proliferation and tumor progression, and (iii) enhances the interaction of YAP with its major transcription factor, thereby facilitating transcription of target genes. Collectively, our data demonstrate that calmodulin activates the Hippo kinase cascade and inhibits YAP activity via a direct interaction with LATS1 and YAP, thereby uncovering previously unidentified crosstalk between the Ca2+/calmodulin and Hippo signaling pathways.

AB  - Linderone is a major compound in Lindera erythrocarpa and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in BV2 cells. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of linderone action in BV2 and HT22 cells. Linderone suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and prostaglandin E-2) in BV2 cells. Linderone treatment also inhibited the LPS-induced activation of p65 nuclear factor-kappa B, protecting against oxidative stress in glutamate-stimulated HT22 cells. Furthermore, linderone activated the translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1. These findings provided a mechanistic explanation of the antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory effects of linderone. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of linderone in neuronal diseases.

AB  - The red blood cells (RBCs) of vertebrates have evolved into two basic shapes, with nucleated nonmammalian RBCs having a biconvex ellipsoidal shape and anuclear mammalian RBCs having a biconcave disk shape. In contrast, camelid RBCs are flat ellipsoids with reduced membrane deformability, suggest-ing altered membrane skeletal organization. However, the mechanisms responsible for their elliptocytic shape and reduced deformability have not been determined. We here showed that in alpaca RBCs, protein 4.1R, a major component of the membrane skeleton, contains an alternatively spliced exon 14-derived cassette (e14) not observed in the highly conserved 80 kDa 4.1R of other highly deformable biconcave mammalian RBCs. The inclusion of this exon, along with the preceding unordered proline-and glutamic acid-rich peptide (PE), results in a larger and unique 90 kDa camelid 4.1R. Hu-man 4.1R containing e14 and PE, but not PE alone, showed markedly increased ability to form a spectrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex in viscosity assays. A similar facilitated ternary complex was formed by human 4.1R possessing a duplication of the spectrin-actin-binding domain, one of the mutations known to cause human hereditary elliptocytosis. The e14-and PE-containing mutant also exhibited an increased binding af-finity to beta-spectrin compared with WT 4.1R. Taken together, these findings indicate that 4.1R protein with the e14 cassette results in the formation and maintenance of a hyperstable membrane skeleton, resulting in rigid red ellipsoidal cells in camelid species, and suggest that membrane structure is evolutionarily regulated by alternative splicing of exons in the 4.1R gene.

AB  - Fish consumption is an indicator of human exposure to personal care products (PCP) such as tonalide (AHTN) and benzophenone 3 (BP3). Although most fish consumed is cooked, the impact of cooking procedures on PCP levels is difficult to evaluate. Hence, the aim of this work was to provide thorough information on the stability and bioaccessibility of AHTN and BP3 upon cooking and in vitro digestion. A green tea (Camellia sinensis) marinade, rich in polyphenol, was used as mitigating strategy to reduce these contaminants. Roasting and frying reduced AHTN and BP3 levels in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) spiked samples. Additionally, the green tea marinade promoted a reduction of up to 47% AHTN and 35% BP3. Bioaccessibility of AHTN was higher (up to 45%), and increased with the use of green tea marinades. BP3 showed a bioaccessibility below 19% in all cooked samples. Overall, a decrease in PCP levels was observed after cooking; this decrease was even more pronounced when marination was previously used. However, this decrease is cancelled out by the fact that the bioaccessible fraction of the contaminants increases in an inverse way; therefore, none of these processes can be considered a mitigating alternative.

AB  - An upregulation of the Na+-K+-2Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC1, the main chloride importer in mature neurons, can lead to depolarizing/excitatory responses mediated by GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) and, thus, to hyperactivity. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of NKCC1 would help prevent intra-neuronal chloride accumulation that occurs in pathologies with defective inhibition. The cell mechanisms regulating NKCC1 are poorly understood. Here, we report in mature hippocampal neurons that GABAergic activity controls the membrane diffusion and clustering of NKCC1 via the chloride-sensitive WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1) and the downstream Ste20 Pro-line Asparagine Rich Kinase (SPAK) kinase that directly phosphorylates NKCC1 on key threonine residues. At rest, this signaling pathway has little effect on intracellular Cl- concentration, but it participates in the elevation of intraneuronal Cl- concentration in hyperactivity conditions associated with an up-regulation of NKCC1. The fact that the main chloride exporter, the K+-Cl- cotransporter KCC2, is also regulated in mature neurons by the WNK1 pathway indicates that this pathway will be a target of choice in the pathology.

AB  - Acrylamide (AA) is a widespread environmental and dietary-derived neurotoxin, which can induce oxidative stress and associated inflammation in the brain. Anthocyanins widely occur as natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals. Herein, the protective effects of blueberry anthocyanins extract (BAE) against AA-induced neurotoxicity were investigated in rats. The rats were pretreated with BAE (175 mg/kg body weight/day) by oral gavage for the first 7 days, followed by the co-administration of BAE and AA (35 mg/kg body weight/day) by oral gavage for the next 12 days. Results showed that BAE significantly decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and increased glutathione (GSH) and antioxidant enzyme levels; and it also suppressed microglial activation, astrocytic reaction, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions. Furthermore, BAE elevated the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/cAMP response elements binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway, and relieved the accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) 1-42 and 1-40 after AA exposure. Consequently, AA-induced neuronal necrosis and downregulation of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) were attenuated by BAE in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In conclusion, BAE can exert a protective function on neurons and synapses against AA-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Age-related microglial activation is associated with cognitive impairment. Tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP) is a critical mediator of microglial activation in response to neuroinflammation. However, the precise role of TonEBP in the middle-aged brain is not yet known. We used TonEBP haploinsufficient mice to investigate the role of TonEBP in middle-aged or amyloid beta oligomer (A beta O)-injected brains and examined the effect of TonEBP knockdown on A beta O-treated BV2 microglial cells. Consistent with an increase in microglial activation with aging, hippocampal TonEBP expression levels were increased in middle-aged (12-month-old) and old (24-month-old) mice compared with young (6-month-old) mice. Middle-aged TonEBP haploinsufficient mice showed reduced microglial activation and fewer memory deficits than wild-type mice. Electron microscopy revealed that synaptic pruning by microglial processes was reduced by TonEBP haploinsufficiency. TonEBP haploinsufficiency also reduced dendritic spine loss and improved memory deficits in A beta O-treated mice. Furthermore, TonEBP knockdown attenuated migration and phagocytosis in A beta O-treated BV2 cells. These findings suggest that TonEBP plays important roles in age-related microglial activation and memory deficits.

AB  - In the field of nanoscience and nanobiotechnology, the use of plant extracts in synthesising metal sulphide nanoparticles has lately come to light as an intriguing issue with several benefits over traditional physicochemical methods. Herein, bio-mediated novel beta-In2S3 quantum dots were fabricated using Camellia sinensis var. assamica (tea) leaf extract as a stabilising and capping agent through a facile solvothermal technique to evaluate the photocatalytic and antioxidant characteristics. The prepared green beta-In2S3 quantum dots (g-beta-In2S3), having a bandgap of 2.0 eV, were employed for the degradation of three major categories of dyes Xanthane (Rhodamine B), Triphenylmethane (Malachite Green), and Azo (Biebrich Scarlet). It also showed excellent antioxidant properties compared to standard ascorbic acid and pure chemically synthesised beta-In2S3. The g-beta-In2S3 quantum dots were characterised for their crystal structure, morphology, surface functional groups, charge recombination delay, and chemical composition using XRD, PL, FTIR, UV-DRS, SEM, TEM, and XPS analyses. The fabricated material showed high crystallinity of 77.17%, a particle size of 6.97 nm, and spherical morphology. The greenly synthesised beta-In2S3 displayed enhanced photocatalytic performance, indicating that bio-synthesis can be a superb method to create flexible and environmentally friendly goods. About 75.28 +/- 1.69%, 72.31 +/- 1.43%, and 62.21 +/- 1.14% for Rhodamine B, Malachite Green, and Biebrich Scarlet could be degraded within 60 min of visible light irradiation via beta-In2S3/H2O2 system. The kinetics and the mechanism of the degradation of dyes by g-beta-In2S3 are also discussed. This work highlighted the potential of g-beta-In2S3 quantum dots for enhanced visible light, advanced oxidation process-assisted degradation of dyes, and outstanding antioxidant properties.

AB  - The number of people diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MetS) has increased dramatically to reach alarming proportions worldwide. The origin of MetS derives from bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle. Most people consume foods high in carbohydrates and saturated fat. In recent years, it has been reported that alterations in insulin at the brain level could have an impact on the appearance of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alz-heimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, depression, and other types of disorders that compromise brain function. These alterations have been associated with damage to the structure and function of neurons located in the reptilian and limbic systems, a decrease in dendritic arborization and an exacerbated inflammatory state that impaired learning and memory and increased in the state of stress and anxiety. Although the molecular mech-anisms induced by MetS to cause neurodegeneration are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to know the effect of the intake of hypercaloric diets on the structure and function of neurons located in the frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus and its impact on behavior in rats with metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, the present study illustrated that chronic exposure to hypercaloric diets, with a high content of sugars and saturated fatty acids, induces a proinflammatory state and exacerbates oxidative stress in brain regions such as the hy-pothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, leading to dysfunction. metabolism, neuronal damage, and recognition memory loss.

AB  - Plant-based fermented beverages are growing in popularity due to the rise in vegetarianism, health trends and ethical concerns. In this study, camelina (Camelina sativa L.) seed press cake (CPC, 15% and 20% w/w) was fermented using yogurt starter culture. The physicochemical properties of the samples, including pH, total acidity, color, viscosity, texture and rheological properties were investigated. Moreover, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) viability, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity were determined. During fermentation and 28-day refrigerated storage, the samples achieved a mean viable bacterial count of at least 10(10) CFU/g, which is higher than the recommended bacteria level for traditional dairy yogurt (10(6) CFU/g). A significant acidification, consumption of reducing sugars, increase in free amino acids and polyphenolics was observed. In addition, CPC-based fermented samples showed good antioxidant potential. Textural and rheological characteristics were similar to dairy yogurt. Moreover, fermentation improved the sensory attributes of CPC, meeting consumers' acceptance criteria. Thus, the study indicated that fermentation had a marked effect on the physicochemical, microbiological and functional properties of CPC. Therefore, the fermented CPC-based beverage has the potential to be a valid, value-added and novel alternative to dairy-based yogurt.

AB  - Purpose Although YAP1 and TAZ are believed to be equivalent downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, differential expression of YAP1 or TAZ suggests distinct functions during cancer progression. The exact role of YAP1 and TAZ in esophageal cancer, the 6th leading cancer-related mortality in the world, remains elusive. Methods Following single or double manipulation of YAP1 or TAZ expression, we subjected these manipulated cells to proliferation, migration, invasion, and xenograft tumorigenesis assays. We used RT-qPCR and Western blotting to examine their expression in the manipulated cells with or without inhibition of transcription or translation. We also examined the impact of YAP1 or TAZ deregulation on clinical outcome of esophageal cancer patients from the TCGA database. Results We found that YAP1 functions as a tumor suppressor whereas TAZ exerts pro-tumor functions in esophageal cancer cells. We also found a significant increase in TAZ mRNA expression upon YAP1 depletion, but not vice versa, despite the downregulation of CTGF and CYR61, shared targets of YAP1 and TAZ, in xenografted tissue cells. In addition to transcriptional regulation, YAP1-mediated TAZ expression was found to occur via protein synthesis. Restored TAZ expression mitigated YAP1-mediated suppression of cellular behavior. By contrast, TAZ silencing reduced the promoting effect exerted by YAP1 depletion on cellular behaviors. The observed anti-tumor function of YAP1 was further supported by a better overall survival among esophageal cancer patients with a high YAP1 expression. Conclusion From our data we conclude that YAP1 functions as a suppressor and negatively regulates pro-tumor TAZ expression via transcriptional and translational control in esophageal cancer.

AB  - As it is closely associated with tumor proliferation, metastasis, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment, the dysfunc-tional Hippo pathway has become an extremely attractive target for treating multiple cancers. However, to date, the corresponding chemo-therapeutic nanomedicines have not been developed. Herein, a supra -molecular self-delivery nanomedicine with in situ transforming capacity was tailor-constructed for Hippo-pathway restoration, and its inhibitory effect against tumor growth and metastasis was investigated in a highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model. Stimulated by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and esterase in cancer cells, the self -assembled nanomedicine transformed from inactive nanospheres to active nanofibers conjugating tyrosvaline and spatiotemporally synchro-nously released the covalently linked flufenamic acid in situ, together activating the maladjusted Hippo pathway by simultaneously acting on different targets upstream and downstream. The transcriptional expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and related growth-promoted genes were significantly reduced, finally significantly repressing the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. Additionally, the Hippo-pathway restoration showed an excellent radiosensitization effect, making the targeted therapy combined with radiotherapy display a prominent synergistic in vivo anticancer effect against TNBC. This work reports a specifically designed smart nanomedicine to restore the function of the Hippo pathway and sensitize radiotherapy, providing an attractive paradigm for targeted drug delivery and cancer combination therapy.

AB  - Gastric cancer's (GC) bad prognosis is usually associated with metastatic spread. Invasive cancer stem cells (CSC) are considered to be the seed of GC metastasis and not all CSCs are able to initiate metastasis. Targeting these aggressive metastasis-initiating CSC (MIC) is thus vital. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is hereby used to target Hippo pathway oncogenic members, found to be induced in GC and associated with CSC features. LIF-treated GC cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells and/or CSC tumourspheres underwent transcriptomics, laser microdissection-associated proteomics, 2D and 3D invasion assays and in vivo xenograft in mice blood circulation. LIFR expression was analysed on tissue microarrays from GC patients and in silico from public databases. LIF-treated cells, especially CSC, presented decreased epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and invasion capacity in vitro, and lower metastasis initiation ability in vivo. These effects involved both the Hippo and Jak/Stat pathways. Finally, GC's high LIFR expression was associated with better clinical outcomes in patients. LIF treatment could thus represent a targeted anti-CSC strategy to fight against metastatic GC, and LIFR detection in primary tumours could constitute a potential new prognosis marker in this disease.

AB  - The hippocampus is an archicortical structure that is highly sensitive to experience and is made up of individual subfields. These subfields, crucial for learning and memory, rapidly develop and are vulnerable to early stress, yet the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we analyse data from 520 neonates born between 23 and 42 weeks' gestation to assess how early extrauterine exposure-related stress influences subfield maturation. Subfields are segmented automatically by training a U-net model on infant data using HippUnfold, a novel tool for subfield segmentation. Results indicate that subfield volumes are resilient to early stress, while myelination shows greater vulnerability and variation, which may contribute to long-term outcomes. Notably, subfields are not uniformly impacted by stress, with CA1 and CA2 showing the largest effects. Developmental context, including time spent in and ex utero, primarily influences hippocampal subfield myelination.

AB  - Background: Dandouchi polypeptide (DDCP) is derived from Semen Sojae Praeparatum (Dandouchi in Chinese), a fermented product of Glycine max (L.) Merr. Semen Sojae Praeparatum is widely used in the food industry for its unique flavor and nutritional value, and DDCP, as its derivative, also shows potential health benefits in food applications. However, the specific active substances responsible for Semen Sojae Praeparatum and the underlying mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated. Methods: DDCP was extracted from Semen Sojae Praeparatum using enzymes, and its antidepressant effects were tested in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were used to analyze neurogenesis and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway. Moreover, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) shRNA was used to induce tripartite motif-containing 67 (TRIM67) deficiency to examine the function of TRIM67 in the neuroprotective effects of DDCP in depressive disorders. Results: DDCP reduced depressive behaviors in CUMS mice and the expression of proinflammatory markers in the hippocampus. DDCP promoted neurogenesis and modulated the TRIM67/NF-kappa B pathway, with TRIM67 deficiency impairing its antidepressant effect. Conclusions: This research revealed that DDCP has a protective effect on countering depression triggered by CUMS. Notably, TRIM67 plays a crucial role in mitigating depression through DDCP, positioning DDCP as a potential therapeutic option for treating depressive disorders.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD), characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral disorders, has seen a rapid increase in prevalence in recent years. However, effective treatments for VD remain unavailable. Due to its regenerative potential, stem cell therapy has garnered attention as a promising approach for VD treatment, yet it has shown limited effects on cognitive and behavioral impairments caused by the disease. To address this limitation, this study aimed to develop a novel treatment using human embryonic stem cell-derived multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MMSCs). The therapeutic efficacy of MMSCs was evaluated using a vascular dementia mouse model induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). The effects of MMSCs were assessed through behavioral tests and postmortem brain tissue analysis, including mRNA expression analysis and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. MMSCs treatment significantly improved both working memory and long-term memory. Histological analysis revealed enhanced angiogenesis, preservation of blood-brain barrier integrity, and improved hippocampal organization. Furthermore, MMSCs treatment reduced the expression of Rock1/2, indicating suppression of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic pathways. These findings suggest that MMSCs offer a sustainable and effective therapeutic approach for vascular dementia.

AB  - The first lineage differentiation in mammals gives rise to the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm (TE). In mice, TEAD4 is a master regulator of TE commitment, as it regulates the expression of other TE-specific genes and its ablation prevents blastocyst formation, but its role in other mammals remains unclear. Herein, we have observed that TEAD4 ablation in two phylogenetically distant species (bovine and rabbit) does not impede TE differentiation, blastocyst formation and the expression of TE markers, such as GATA3 and CDX2, although a reduced number of cells in the inner cell mass was observed in bovine TEAD4 knockout (KO) blastocysts. Transcriptional analysis in bovine blastocysts revealed no major transcriptional effect of the ablation, although the expression of hypoblast and Hippo signalling-related genes tended to be decreased in KO embryos. Experiments were conducted in the bovine model to determine whether TEAD4 was required for post-hatching development. TEAD4 KO spherical conceptuses showed normal development of the embryonic disc and TE, but hypoblast migration rate was reduced. At later stages of development (tubular conceptuses), no differences were observed between KO and wild-type conceptuses.

AB  - The unique zigzag-patterned tea plant is a rare germplasm resource. However, the molecular mechanism behind the formation of zigzag stems remains unclear. To address this, a BC1 genetic population of tea plants with zigzag stems was studied using histological observation and bulked segregant RNA-seq. The analysis revealed 1494 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the upright and zigzag stem groups. These DEGs may regulate the transduction and biosynthesis of plant hormones, and the effects on the phenylpropane biosynthesis pathways may cause the accumulation of lignin. Tissue sections further supported this finding, showing differences in cell wall thickness between upright and curved stems, potentially due to lignin accumulation. Additionally, 262 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 38 genes were identified as key SNPs, and 5 genes related to zigzag stems were identified through homologous gene function annotation. Mutations in these genes may impact auxin distribution and content, resulting in the asymmetric development of vascular bundles in curved stems. In summary, we identified the key genes associated with the tortuous phenotype by using BSR-seq on a BC1 population to minimize genetic background noise.

AB  - Simple Summary Chlamydia abortus causes intracellular persistent infections in sheep, requiring a strong immune response for resolution. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a dual role by modulating the inflammatory immune response during infection and preventing damage during pregnancy. This study used transgenic mice overexpressing IL-10 to model chronic C. abortus infections. The goal was to test the effectiveness of an experimental vaccine and understand the immune mechanisms involved when high levels of IL-10 are present. Both transgenic and control mice were vaccinated and exposed to the bacteria. Results showed that vaccinated control mice cleared the infection by day 9, while transgenic mice still had bacteria at day 28. Vaccination increased a key immune response, with IFN-gamma and iNOS production, but did not change IL-10 levels in transgenic mice. Additionally, fewer immune cells were recruited in vaccinated transgenic mice. The study concludes that vaccine effectiveness is reduced in presence of high IL-10 levels. This model could be used for the development of better vaccines against C. abortus, and could help to test vaccines requiring strong cellular immune responses, thereby benefiting animal health. In ovine populations, the enzootic nature of Chlamydia abortus (C. abortus) is attributed to its capacity to establish persistent intracellular infections, which necessitate a cellular immune response mediated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) for effective resolution. In both natural hosts and murine models, interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been demonstrated to modulate the cellular immune response crucial for the eradication of C. abortus. During gestation, it has also been shown to play a role in preventing inflammatory damage to gestational tissues and foetal loss through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This paradigm can be key for events leading to a protective response towards an infectious abortion. Previous research successfully established a mouse model of chronic C. abortus infection using transgenic mice overexpressing IL-10 (IL-10tg), simulating the dynamics of chronic infection observed in non-pregnant natural host. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an experimental inactivated vaccine against C. abortus and to elucidate the immune mechanisms involved in protection during chronic infection using this model. Transgenic and wild-type (WT) control mice were immunized and subsequently challenged with C. abortus. Vaccine effectiveness and immune response were assessed via immunohistochemistry and cytokine serum levels over a 28-day period. Morbidity, measured by daily weight loss, was more pronounced in non-vaccinated transgenic IL-10 mice, though no mortality was observed in any group. Vaccinated control mice eliminated the bacterial infection by day 9 post-infection (p.i.), whereas presence of bacteria was noted in vaccinated transgenic IL-10 mice until day 28 p.i. Vaccination induced an early post-infection increase in IFN-gamma production, but did not alter IL-10 production in transgenic mice. Histological analysis indicated suboptimal recruitment of inflammatory cells in vaccinated transgenic IL-10 mice compared to WT controls. In summary, the findings suggest that IL-10 overexpression in transgenic mice diminishes the protective efficacy of vaccination, confirming that this model can be useful for validating the efficacy of vaccines against intracellular pathogens such as C. abortus that require robust cell-mediated immunity.

AB  - Cucumber plants can be infested with many insect pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and thrips, especially in greenhouses, resulting in significant damage to the crops. This study investigated the efficacy of three species of coccinellids (Coccinella undecimpunctata, Coccinella septempunctata, and Hippodamia variegata), indigenous to the Taif region of Saudi Arabia, to control Bemisia tabaci whiteflies and Aphis gossypii aphids on cucumbers in greenhouses. The study was conducted with a release rate of five second-instar larvae of each coccinellid species per plant. One week after the first release of coccinellids, there were no significant differences among the treatment groups in terms of infestation rate, but all three groups differed significantly from the control group. After the first week, the B. tabaci and A. gossypii infestation rates decreased significantly in the H. variegata group compared with the other two coccinellid species, a trend that continued until the end of the experiment. These results suggested that H. variegata was the most effective of the three species at decreasing the B. tabaci population. After the second release of each coccinellid species, the reduction rates were >90% in all three groups, being significantly higher in the H. variegata group. Thus, these results suggest that second-instar larvae of all three coccinellid species would be effective predators of B. tabaci and A. gossypii on cucumbers in greenhouses, with those of H. variegata showing the greatest efficacy. Future research should focus on the effects of these predators on outdoor cucumber fields and on other crops grown in the Taif region.

AB  - The present study describes investigation of the effects of the bark resin extract of Garcinia nigrolineata (Clusiaceae) on the cognitive function and the induction of oxidative stress in both frontal cortex and hippocampus by unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). By using behavioral mouse models, i.e., the Y-maze test, the Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT), and the Morris Water Maze Test (MWMT), it was found that the negative impact of repeated mild stress-induced learning and memory deficit through brain oxidative stress in the UCMS mice was reversed by treatment with the bark resin extract G. nigrolineata. Moreover, the prenylated xanthones viz. cowagarcinone C, cowaxanthone, alpha-mangostin, cowaxanthone B, cowanin, fuscaxanthone A, fuscaxanthone B, xanthochymusxanthones A, 7-O-methylgarcinone E, and cowagarcinone A, isolated from the bark resin of G. nigrolineata, were assayed for their inhibitory activities against beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregation and monoamine oxidase enzymes (MAOs).

AB  - Antioxidative, nutritional, and immune-boosting characteristics of turmeric-camel milk (TCM) and fermented turmeric-camel milk (FTCM) were investigated. A cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression rat model consisting of six experimental groups was carried out to study the effects of TCM and FTCM on weight gain, antioxidant status, immunoglobulin (Igs), pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress biomarkers. TCM or FTCM were orally administrated at 10 or 20 mL Kg(-1) rat weight to CYP-immunosuppressed rats for 2 weeks in the presence of negative (NR) and positive (CYP) control groups. The phytochemical analysis and antioxidant capacity results indicated that TCM and FTCM contained considerable phenolic content with super antioxidant activities. CYP injection affected the rats' weight directly during the first week and then, a low weight gain percentage was recorded in treated groups at the end of the experiment. The most efficient treatment for recovering rats' weight was administering TCM and FTCM at 20 mL kg(-1). Feed efficiency significantly increased with feeding TCM and FTCM in a dose-dependent manner. A significant improvement was found in WBCs, lymphocytes, and neutrophils count, suggesting that both TCM and FTCM alleviated the CYP-induced immunity suppression in a dose-dependent manner. IgG, IgA, and IgM concentrations in the CYP + TCM at 10 or 20 mL kg(-1) and CYP + FTCM at 10 or 20 mL kg(-1) groups were increased significantly. Concentrations of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-TNF-alpha in the CYP group were significantly lower than in the NR group. Interestingly, both TCM and FTCM, especially with high doses, significantly enhanced cytokines production. Administrating FTCM was more potent than TCM, indicating that TCM with probiotics fermentation potentiated the immunological activity in immunosuppressed rats. Treated rats with TCM and FTCM can reverse CYP inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities, significantly increase GSH, CAT, and SOD, and decrease MDA levels in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these observations indicated that FTCM exhibits better improvements in weight gain, increased immune biomarkers in terms of WBCs, enhanced pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation responses, and accelerated antioxidant activity in immunosuppressed rats compared with TCM. It could be beneficial and profitable for boosting immunity and protecting against oxidative stress.

AB  - Various impacts of exercise on brain performance following the induction of morphine dependence have been documented; however, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are still unclear. The present research was done to investigate the impact of different exercise training modes on apoptosis, neuronal maturation, and synaptic plasticity in the perforant pathway (PP)-dentate gyrus (DG) synapses in the morphine-dependent rats. Five groups, including a control group (Con, ten healthy rats) and forty morphine-dependent rats were considered as follows (n = 10/group): 1) sedentary-dependent (Sed-D); 2) endurance exercise-dependent (En-D); 3) strength exercise-dependent (St-D); and 4) concurrent exercise-dependent (Co-D). The exercise training groups were subjected to endurance, strength, and concurrent training five days a week for ten weeks. After training sessions, the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude in the DG were determined in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the PP. For assessing neurogenesis and apoptosis, NeuroD and Caspase-3 expression levels were evaluated after all experiments. Concurrent training increased PS amplitude and EPSP compared to the control group. NeuroD in the morphine-dependent rats significantly decreased, but concurrent training returned the NeuroD to its levels in healthy rats. Furthermore, Caspase-3 expression levels in morphine-dependent rats remarkably increased and concurrent training significantly reduced Caspase-3 expression levels compared to the Sed-D group. Concurrent training can ameliorate synaptic plasticity impairment in morphine-dependent rats through neurogenesis promotion and apoptosis reduction. According to the results, concurrent training can be an appropriate novel candidate for treating opioid addiction.

AB  - Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional regulator, is the predominant factor in modulating oxidative stress and other cellular signaling responses. Studies from our lab and others highlighted that activation of the Nrf2 pathway by small molecules improves endothelial function by suppressing oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, the exact mechanisms by which Nrf2 elicits these effects are unknown. In the present study, we developed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Nrf2 knocked-out human endothelial cells, and proteomic signature was studied using LC-MS/MS. We identified 723 unique proteins, of which 361 proteins were found to be differentially regulated and further screened in the Nrf2ome online database, where we identified a highly interconnected signaling network in which 70 proteins directly interact with Nrf2. These proteins were found to regulate some key cellular and metabolic processes in the regulation actin cytoskeleton, ER stress, angiogenesis, inflammation, Hippo signaling pathway, and epidermal growth factor/fibroblast growth factor (EGF/FGF) signaling pathway. Our findings suggest the role of Nrf2 in maintaining endothelium integrity and its relationship with the crucial cellular processes which help develop novel therapeutics against endothelial dysfunction and its associated complications.

AB  - The objective of this study was to construct lactoferrin (LFA-LFC) chimeric peptide gelatin drug-loaded fiber film by tissue engineering strategy, and study its bacteriostatic effect on oral pathogens (especially Candida albicans) and its effect on biofilm. First of all, LFA-LFC chitosan nanoparticles were prepared firstly, and then fluconazole gelatin (LF/GH/F) film loaded with LFA-LFC was prepared by electrospinning. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), mechanical strength, drug release, cytotoxicity, and real-time PCR were used to test the properties of the synthesized materials. SEM showed that there was the reticular structure for fiber film before and after cross-linking. LF/GH/F film had no obvious cytotoxicity, with good biocompatibility and drug release; real-time PCR and antibacterial test showed that the LF/GH/F film had good antibacterial activity. LF/GH/F film has a good inhibitory effect on oral pathogens, and its mechanism is related to biofilm. The antibacterial experiments of nanofiber membrane in vitro and the effect of bacterial biofilm were carried out. The effect of LF/GH/F on oral microbial flora structure was studied by fluorescence quantitative pest techniques.

AB  - Sex differences in the neurobiology of responses to chronic stress have been widely discussed but remain poorly understood. We found that chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) experienced during adolescence induced different behavioral patterns in adult males and females. Immunohistochemical analysis of the CA1 field of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus revealed no quantitative or morphological changes in astrocytes in the long term after CUMS. Real-time PCR analysis showed no increase in the expression level of SigmaR1 after CUMS relative to individual housekeeping genes. Analysis of mouse cerebral cortex homogenates showed that IL-1 beta levels only decreased after CUMS in males. However, the SigmaR1 levels were significantly higher in the CUMS groups than in the control groups in both sexes. It can be concluded that biological sex and age influence the response to CUMS, although not in all cases. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of chronic stress on males and females. This is important because men and women have different risks for stress and mental disorders.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is caused by human chromosome 21 (HSA21) trisomy. It is characterized by a poorly understood intellectual disability (ID). We studied two mouse models of DS, one with an extra copy of the Dyrk1A gene (189N3) and the other with an extra copy of the mouse Chr16 syntenic region (Dp(16)1Yey). RNA-seq analysis of the transcripts deregulated in the embryonic hippocampus revealed an enrichment in genes associated with chromatin for the 189N3 model, and synapses for the Dp(16)1Yey model. A large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen (82 different screens, including 72 HSA21 baits and 10 rebounds) of a human brain library containing at least 107 independent fragments identified 1,949 novel protein-protein interactions. The direct interactors of HSA21 baits and rebounds were significantly enriched in ID-related genes (P-value < 2.29 x 10(-8)). Proximity ligation assays showed that some of the proteins encoded by HSA21 were located at the dendritic spine postsynaptic density, in a protein network at the dendritic spine postsynapse. We located HSA21 DYRK1A and DSCAM, mutations of which increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 20-fold, in this postsynaptic network. We found that an intracellular domain of DSCAM bound either DLGs, which are multimeric scaffolds comprising receptors, ion channels and associated signaling proteins, or DYRK1A. The DYRK1A-DSCAM interaction domain is conserved in Drosophila and humans. The postsynaptic network was found to be enriched in proteins associated with ARC-related synaptic plasticity, ASD, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These results highlight links between DS and brain diseases with a complex genetic basis.

AB  - The viability, productivity and survival of higher plants under the adverse factors influence are largely determined by the functional activity of the antioxidant system. The aim of our work was to investigate changes in formation of high-molecular (superoxide dismutase and peroxidase) and low-molecular (phenolics, including flavanols and proanthocyanidins) antioxidants in callus culture of Camellia sinensis under influence of phenolic precursors (L-phenylalanine-3 mM, trans-cinnamic acid-1 mM, naringenin-0.5 mM). According to the data obtained, the effect of precursors on tea callus cultures did not lead to significant increasing of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity in most cases. However, it led to the increased accumulation of the total phenolics content, as well as flavanols and proanthocyanidins contents. For C. sinensis callus cultures, the most promising regulator of phenolic compounds was L-phenylalanine, in the presence of which its content increased almost twice. Thus, the exogenous effect of various precursors is possible to use for the targeted regulation of certain phenolics classes accumulation in plant cells.

AB  - Branches are critical for neuron function, generating the morphological complexity required for functional networks. They emerge from different, well-described, cytoskeletal precursor structures that elongate to branches. While branches are thought to be maintained by shared cytoskeletal regulators, our data from mouse hippocampal neurons indicate that the precursor structures trigger alternative branch maintenance mechanisms with differing stabilities. Whereas branches originating from lamellipodia or growth cone splitting events collapse soon after formation, branches emerging from filopodia persist. Furthermore, compared to other developing neurites, axons stabilise all branches and preferentially initiate branches from filopodia. These differences explain the altered stability of branches we observe in neurons lacking the plasma membrane protein phospholipid phosphatase-related protein 3 (PLPPR3, also known as PRG2) and in neurons treated with netrin-1. Rather than altering branch stability directly, PLPPR3 and netrin-1 boost a 'filopodia branch programme' on axons, thereby indirectly initiating more long-lived branches. In summary, we propose that studies on branching should distinguish overall stabilising effects from effects on precursor types, ideally using multifactorial statistical models, as exemplified in this study.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHAD) is a neurobehavioral disorder that affects children and adolescents with a high prevalence. Despite its prevalence and an unclear etiology, previous reports suggest that it is closely related to homocysteine metabolism. Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered with homocysteine from postnatal day (PD) 2 to PD 16. Locomotor activity was evaluated at 35 PD (prepuberal age) and 60 PD (adult age) before and after amphetamine administration. In rats evaluated at both ages, homocysteine induced hyperactivity, and the amphetamine administration reduced hyperactivity significantly at 35 PD, but not at 60 PD. In the social interaction test, homocysteine reduced the number of contacts and increased the latency to the first contact only in rats at 35 PD. Homocysteine also had an effect on short term memory at 35D and 60 PD and long-term memory at 60 PD. Morphological changes were found mainly in the shape of dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex (PFC-3), dorsal hippocampus (CA1), dentate gyrus (DG) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), in rats administered neonatally with homocysteine at both ages studied. In prepuberal and adult rats, there was an increase in dendritic length in DG and NAcc, respectively. The dendritic spine morphology also was altered at both ages, mainly decreasing the number of mushroom spines in NAcc and CA1 at 30 PD and in all the areas studied at 60 PD rats. Those areas are associated with the processes of attention, learning and memory that were studied, and those alterations are possibly related to changes observed in the behavioral tests. These behavioral and morphological changes in rats at 35 PD administered with homocysteine could be similar to changes found in children diagnosed with ADHD. Moreover, half to two thirds of children diagnosed with ADHD reach adulthood with this disorder. In this study we found similarities with ADHD, finding alterations in both rats at 35 PD and 60 PD. So, this may be proposed as an animal model to study this disorder present in children, adolescents and adults.

AB  - Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) removes most glutamate in the synaptic cleft. Sulbactam confers neuronal protection against ischemic insults in the hippocampal CA1 region accompanied by the upregulation of GLT-1 expression in rats. The present study further investigates the effect of sulbactam on the binding property and uptake capacity of GLT-1 for glutamate, and the change in extracellular glutamate concentration in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats with global brain ischemia. The binding property and uptake capacity of GLT-1 were measured using a radioligand binding and uptake assay, respectively, with L-H-3-glutamate. The extracellular glutamate concentration was detected using microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Neuropathological evaluation was performed based on thionin staining. It was shown that sulbactam pre-treatment changed GLT-1 binding property, including increased B-max and decreased K-d values, increased GLT-1 uptake capacity for glutamate, and inhibited the elevation of extracellular glutamate concentration in rats with global cerebral ischemia. These effects of sulbactam were accompanied by its neuronal protection on the hippocampal CA1 neurons against delayed neuronal death resulted from ischemic insult. Furthermore, administration of GLT-1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, which inhibited the expression of GLT-1, blocked the aforementioned sulbactam-related effects, which suggested that GLT-1 upregulation mediated the above effect although other mechanisms independent of the upregulation of GLT-1 expression could not be excluded. It could be concluded that sulbactam improves the binding property and uptake capacity of GLT-1 for glutamate and then reduces the glutamate concentration and excitotoxicity during global cerebral ischemia, which contributes to the neuroprotection of sulbactam against brain ischemia.

AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/ threonine kinase, is implicated in synaptic plasticity by controlling protein synthesis. Research suggests that ethanol exposure during pregnancy alters the mTOR signaling pathway in the fetal hippocampus. Thus, we investigated the influence of pre-treatment with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, on the development of recognition memory deficits in adult rats that were neonatally exposed to ethanol. In the study, male and female rat pups received ethanol (5 g/kg/day) by intragastric intubation at postanatal day (PND 4-9), an equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Rapamycin (3 and 10 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally before every ethanol administration. Short- and long-term recognition memory was assessed in the novel object recognition (NOR) task in adult (PND 59/60) rats. Locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior were also evaluated to exclude the influence of such behavior on the outcome of the memory task. Moreover, the effects of rapamycin pre-treatment during neonatal ethanol exposure on the content of amino-acids and amines essential for the proper development of cognitive function in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus was evaluated using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in male adult (PND 60) rats. Our results show the deleterious effect of ethanol given to neonatal rats on long-term recognition memory in adults. The effect was more pronounced in male rather than female rats. Rapamycin reversed this ethanol-induced memory impairment and normalized the levels of amino acids and amines in the DG. This suggests the involvement of mTORC1 in the deleterious effect of ethanol on the developing brain.

AB  - Lanthanides are a group of 15 elements (8 heavy and 7 light) grouped for their proximity in the chemical and physical properties. Recently, this group of elements has received great attention because of their importance, and their entrance into many industrial technologies making the probability of the living organisms' exposure to it increase. The present study aims to study ability of cerium nanoparticles (CeNPs) or lanthanum (LaCl3) to cross the blood brain barrier also, investigate their neuro effect separately or together on some parameters in six brain areas (cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, and hypothalamus) of the adult male albino rats. The results showed the ability of both elements to distribute and accumulate in the different brain areas. Also, the results of CeNPs or LaCl3 treatment were in the same line where each element caused a significant decrease in norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and GABA accompanied with a significant increase in 5-hydroxyl indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) glucose level. On the other hand, GSH and MDA showed a significant decrease after CeNPs treatment while, with LaCl3 treatment, MDA showed a significant increase in the different brain areas after 3 weeks of treatment. The coadministration of CeNPs and La Cl3 caused an ameliorating effect in all the tested parameters. In conclusion, from the previous studies the effects of lanthanides in the present study may be in part due to its effect on the release or turnover of neurotransmitters and insulin secretion. Finally, the ameliorative effect of CeNPs may be regarded as its high activity to scavenge the free radicals.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is progressive neurodegeneration known as the most common cause of dementia, and it the sixth leading cause of death in older people. Given the promising data on the additive effect of combination therapy with donepezil (Aricept), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), and regarding the similar neuronal mechanisms through which donepezil (DON) and environmental enrichment (EE) exert their enhancing effects cognition; we asked whether simultaneous treatment with two paradigms in amyloid-beta-induced AD rats may lead to greater protection against the cognitive impairments than either treatment individually. The experimental groups consisted of Alz, sham-operated, Alz + DON, Alz + EE, and Alz + DON + EE. AD was induced by intrahippocampal injection of amyloid-beta (1-42, 6 mu g), and DON was orally administrated (4 mg/ kg) for 21 days. Environmental enrichment consisted of housing animals in large cages (50 x 50 x 50 cm) containing a running wheel and differently shaped objects for 21 days. Spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Real-time PCR was performed to assess the expression of brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (AchM1R) within the hippo -campus. Spatial memory was impaired in Alz animals, and while neither pretreatment with DON nor EE alone could significantly restore spatial memory scores in Alz rats, combination therapy was effective. BDNF expression was suppressed in Alz rats and pretreatment with DON plus EE could increase it to the saline levels. The data suggest that a cholinesterase inhibitor and cognitive stimulation can be used effectively in combination to protect cognitive loss in an AD rat model. This additive protective effect may be in part due to the augmented influence this combination on BDNF levels and cholinergic neuronal system within the hippocampus.

AB  - The detrimental effects of prenatal stress (PS) on offspring's neurological and behavioral outcomes are well documented. However, strategies to mitigate these effects are underexplored. This study examines whether prenatal zinc supplementation and treadmill exercise can modulate PS-induced cognitive impairments and neurobiological markers in young and adult male rat offspring, leveraging the established neuroprotective potential of both physical activity and zinc. Pregnant rats were divided into five groups: control, stress, stress + exercise, stress + zinc, and stress + exercise + zinc, with all rats except the control group subjected to restraint stress (gestational days 15-19). Pregnant rats in the exercise groups underwent forced exercise, whereas those in the zinc groups received oral zinc sulfate throughout the pregnancy. At postnatal days 30 and 90, the cognitive function of male offspring was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and the hippocampal gene expression levels of caspase-3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). PS impaired cognitive functions, increased caspase-3 expression, and decreased BDNF and GFAP expression levels in adult rats. Prenatal exercise was found to mitigate PS-induced cognitive deficits primarily through enhancing GFAP expression, whereas prenatal zinc improved PS-induced cognitive impairments mainly through reduced caspase-3 and increased BDNF expression. The combined effect of exercise and zinc was not additive on cognitive functions and biomarkers. Physical activity may alleviate PS-induced cognitive deficits by modulating astrocytic factors, whereas zinc may exert its effects by inhibiting apoptosis via a BDNF-dependent pathway. Further targeted research is necessary to confirm these relationships.

AB  - Background Dromedary or one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) is distinctively acclimatized to survive the arid conditions of the desert environment. It has an excellent ability to compete dehydration with substantial tolerance for rapid dehydration. Therefore, it offers an excellent model for studying osmoregulation. Molecular characterization of Na+/K+ ATPase as a central regulator of electrolyte normohemostasis affords a better understanding of this mechanism in camel. Here is the first to resolve the full-length of alpha-1 subunit of sodium pump (ATP1A1) gene with its differential expression in dromedary tissues. Results The nucleotide sequence for the recovered full cDNA of ATP1A1was submitted to the GenBank (NCBI GenBank accession #MW628635) and bioinformatically analyzed. The cDNA sequence was of 3760 bp length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 3066 bp encoding a putative 1021 amino acids polypeptide with a molecular mass of 112696 Da. Blast search analysis revealed the shared high similarity of dromedary ATP1A1gene with other known ATP1A1genes in different species. The comparative analysis of its protein sequence confirmed the high identity with other mammalian ATP1A1 proteins. Further transcriptomic investigation for different organs was performed by real-time PCR to compare its level of expression among different organs. The results confirm a direct function between the ATP1A1 gene expression and the order of vital performance of these organs. The expression of ATP1A1 mRNA in the adrenal gland and brain was significantly higher than that in the other organs. The noticed down expression in camel kidney concomitant with overexpression in the adrenal cortex might interpret how dromedary expels access sodium without water loss with relative high ability to restrain mineralocorticoid-induced sodium retention on drinking salty water. Conclusion The results reflect the importance of sodium pump in these organs. Na+/K+ ATPase in the adrenal gland and brain than other organs.

AB  - Near-infrared photobiomodulation has been identified as a potential strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying this therapeutic effect remain poorly characterize. Herein, it is illustrate that 1070-nm light induces the morphological alteration of microglia from an M1 to M2 phenotype that secretes exosomes, which alleviates the beta-amyloid burden to improve cognitive function by ameliorating neuroinflammation and promoting neuronal dendritic spine plasticity. The results show that 4 J cm(-2) 1070-nm light at a 10-Hz frequency prompts microglia with an M1 inflammatory type to switch to an M2 anti-inflammatory type. This induces secretion of M2 microglial-derived exosomes containing miR-7670-3p, which targets activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Moreover, it is found that miR-7670-3p reduces ATF6 expression to further ameliorate ER stress, thus attenuating the inflammatory response and protecting dendritic spine integrity of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of 5xFAD mice, ultimately leading to improvements in cognitive function. This study highlights the critical role of exosomes derive from 1070-nm light-modulated microglia in treating AD mice, which may provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of AD with the use of near-infrared photobiomodulation.

AB  - Dexamethasone (DEX) is frequently used to treat women at risk of preterm delivery, but although indispensable for the completion of organ maturation in the fetus, antenatal DEX treatment may exert adverse sex-dimorphic neurodevelopmental effects. Literature findings implicated oxidative stress in adverse effects of DEX treatment. Purinergic signaling is involved in neurodevelopment and controlled by ectonucleotidases, among which in the brain the most abundant are ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (NTPDase1/CD39) and ecto-5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-nucleotidase (e5MODIFIER LETTER PRIMENT/CD73), which jointly dephosphorylate ATP to adenosine. They are also involved in cell adhesion and migration, processes integral to brain development. Upregulation of CD39 and CD73 after DEX treatment was reported in adult rat hippocampus. We investigated the effects of maternal DEX treatment on CD39 and CD73 expression and enzymatic activity in the rat fetal brain of both sexes, in the context of oxidative status of the brain tissue. Fetuses were obtained at embryonic day (ED) 21, from Wistar rat dams treated with 0.5 mg DEX/kg/day, at ED 16, 17, and 18, and brains were processed and used for further analysis. Sex-specific increase in CD39 and CD73 expression and in the corresponding enzyme activities was induced in the brain of antenatally DEX-treated fetuses, more prominently in males. The oxidative stress induction after antenatal DEX treatment was confirmed in both sexes, although showing a slight bias in males. Due to the involvement of purinergic system in crucial neurodevelopmental processes, future investigations are needed to determine the role of these observed changes in the adverse effects of antenatal DEX treatment.

AB  - (1) Background: Astragalus membranaceus (AM) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, but its specific mechanism of action in the brain is still unclear. In this study, we developed a roasting process to maximize the cognitive improvement impact of AM. We focused on enhancing physiological activity to enhance the brain neuron protection effect and alleviate neuronal damage caused by neurodegenerative diseases. (2) Methods: AM was roasted at 260 degrees C for 20, 30, or 40 min, and the hot water extracts were tested on HT22 cells for ROS levels, apoptosis, and antioxidant protein expression. The effect on the BDNF-AKT-CREB pathway under stress was also analyzed. (3) Results: Roasted AM decreased ROS production and the expression of apoptosis-related factors while activating the expression of antioxidant proteins in HT22 cells treated with A beta 25-35. In particular, 30 min roasting (R-AM2) significantly reduced ROS production, inhibited cell death, and increased antioxidant protein expression. The Nrf2 pathway was activated Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 levels were reduced. BDNF and p-CREB expression were increased by 20% and 50-70%, respectively. In the MAPK pathway, p-ERK levels were increased by 30%, and p-P38 levels were increased by approximately 20%. (4) Conclusions: These findings suggest that roasted AM upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in HT22 cells, providing neuroprotective effects by activating the AKT/CREB/BDNF pathway and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, roasted AM shows potential as a neuroprotective agent for preventing or treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, linked to BDNF deficiency.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide are known for their neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders, but their role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of liraglutide on several biological processes, including inflammation, antioxidant defense mechanisms, mitochondrial dynamics, and function, as well as cognitive and behavioral changes in the TLE model. Methods: Low-dose, repeated intraperitoneal injections of lithium chloride-pilocarpine hydrochloride were used to induce status epilepticus (SE) in order to develop TLE in rats. Fifty-six male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected and allocated to the groups. The effects of liraglutide on inflammatory markers (NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1 beta), antioxidant pathways (Nrf-2 and p-Nrf-2), and mitochondrial dynamics proteins (Pink1, Mfn2, and Drp1) were evaluated in hippocampal tissues via a Western blot. Mitochondrial function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined using flow cytometry. Cognitive-behavioral outcomes were assessed using the open-field, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze tests. Results: Our results showed that liraglutide modulates NLRP3-mediated inflammation, reduces oxidative stress, and triggers antioxidative pathways through Nrf2 in SE-induced rats. Moreover, liraglutide treatment restored Pink1, Mfn2, and Drp1 levels in SE-induced rats. Liraglutide treatment also altered the mitochondrial function of PBMCs in both healthy and epileptic rats. This suggests that treatment can modulate mitochondrial dynamics and functions in the brain and periphery. Furthermore, in the behavioral aspect, liraglutide reversed the movement-enhancing effect of epilepsy. Conclusions: This research underscores the potential of GLP-1RAs as a possibly promising therapeutic strategy for TLE.

AB  - EB3 protein is expressed abundantly in the nervous system and transiently enters the dendritic spines at the tip of the growing microtubule, which leads to spine enlargement. Nevertheless, the role of dynamic microtubules, and particularly EB3 protein, in synapse function is still elusive. By manipulating the EB3 expression level, we have shown that this protein is required for a normal dendritogenesis. Nonetheless, EB3 overexpression also reduces hippocampal neurons dendritic branching and total dendritic length. This effect likely occurs due to the speeding neuronal development cycle from dendrite outgrowth to the step when dendritic spines are forming. Implementing direct morphometric characterization of dendritic spines, we showed that EB3 overexpression leads to a dramatic increase in the dendritic spine head area. EB3 knockout oppositely reduces spine head area and increases spine neck length and spine neck/spine length ratio. The same effect is observed in conditions of amyloid-beta toxicity, modeling Alzheimer`s disease. Neck elongation is supposed to be a common detrimental effect on the spine's shape, which makes them biochemically and electrically less connected to the dendrite. EB3 also potentiates the formation of presynaptic protein Synapsin clusters and CaMKII-alpha preferential localization in spines rather than in dendrites of hippocampal neurons, while its downregulation has an opposite effect and reduces the size of presynaptic protein clusters Synapsin and PSD95. EB3 ' s role in spine development and maturation determines its neuroprotective effect. EB3 overexpression makes dendritic spines resilient to amyloid-beta toxicity, restores altered PSD95 clustering, and reduces CaMKII-alpha localization in spines observed in this pathological state.

AB  - The Hippo/YAP pathway plays an important role in the development of cancers. Previous studies have reported that bile acids can activate YAP (Yes Associated Protein) to promote tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a long-established old drug used for cholestasis treatment. So far, the effect of UDCA on YAP signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well defined. This study means to explore relationship of UDCA and YAP in CRC. UDCA suppressed YAP signaling by activating the membrane G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5). TGR5 mainly regulated cAMP/PKA signaling pathway to inhibit RhoA activity, thereby suppressing YAP signaling. Moreover, the restoration of YAP expression alleviated the inhibitory effect of UDCA on CRC cell proliferation. In AOM/DSS-induced CRC model, UDCA inhibited tumor growth in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased expression of YAP and Ki67. UDCA plays a distinguished role in regulating YAP signaling and CRC growth from the primary bile acids and partial secondary bile acids, demonstrating the importance of maintaining normal intestinal bile acid metabolism in cancer patients. It also presents a potential therapeutic intervention for CRC.

AB  - Photothermal neuromodulation is a promising non-electrical neural stimulation technology for treating brain diseases through optically induced cell membrane temperature changes. However, the technology faces limitations in understanding its mechanism and impact on cellular behavior due to the restriction of directly measuring temperature changes at the cell interface from a very close distance during optical stimulation of neural cells, necessitating advancements in high-precision temperature sensing and electrical recording without light interference. This challenge is addressed by developing ultrasensitive cell membrane interface temperature sensors integrated with low-noise electrical recording capabilities. Transparent resistive temperature detectors, composed of a 10 nm thickness of ultrathin Au film fabricated by polyelectrolyte seed layer-induced thermal evaporation, achieved precise measurement and control of temperature changes without significant light interference and self-heating. A transparent electrode composed of the same ultrathin Au layer shows low-noise electrical recordings of neural signals upon photothermal stimulation. Using this multifunctional system, it is demonstrated that an average increase of 2.34 degrees C at neuronal cell surfaces results in over 95% suppression of hippocampal neural spike activities. The approach provides unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of photothermal neuromodulation and its effects on cellular behavior, paving the way for advanced treatments of neurological disorders

AB  - Modified electro-convulsive therapy (MECT) is one of the most potent treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it remains a second-line option due to significant side effects, such as transient memory loss. The relationship between therapeutic efficacy and cognitive impairment warrants further investigation to develop improved treatment regimens. In this review, we examine recent evidence from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies aiming to identify structural and functional brain changes specifically associated with both the antidepressant effects and the amnesic outcomes of MECT. MECT induces widespread alterations across multiple brain systems. Increases in gray matter volume (GMV) have been observed in the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, as well as in subcortical regions such as the hippocampus (HP), amygdala, and striatum. Strengthening of myelination has also been reported along the dorsolateral prefrontal-limbic pathways. Functional changes include increased spontaneous neural activity in prefrontal areas, reorganization of intrinsic connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), and altered functional connectivity (FC) among the DMN, salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). Correlational studies have identified structural and functional alterations linked to antidepressant efficacy, including right hippocampal volume enlargement, prefrontal cortical thickening, reduced iron deposition in the striatum, decreased FC within certain DMN nodes, and enhanced effective connectivity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to the right angular gyrus. In contrast, the amnesic effects have been associated with increased volumes in the left hippocampus and bilateral dentate gyrus; enhanced FC in the left angular gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC); increased FC between the right ventral anterior insula and DLPFC; and reduced FC in the left thalamus and bilateral precuneus. Changes in the hippocampus appear to correlate with both antidepressant efficacy and memory impairment. Clinical studies have found no significant correlation between the severity of memory impairment and the reduction in depressive symptoms, suggesting that the therapeutic and adverse effects may arise from distinct regional or subregional mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, recent findings show that increased right hippocampal volume is significantly associated with reduced depression scores, whereas increased volume in the left dentate gyrus correlates with declines in delayed recall performance. Additionally, enhanced connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and middle occipital gyrus (MOG) has been linked to mood improvement, while decreased FC between the mid-hippocampus and angular gyrus has been associated with impairments in memory integration. In conclusion, current evidence suggests that the antidepressant and memory-impairing effects of MECT may localize to distinct hippocampal subregions. These effects likely result from differential modulation of local neural activity and functional connectivity, leading to divergent behavioral outcomes. Given that both effects may originate in deep and spatially constrained structures such as the hippocampus, small-sample studies and conventional methodologies may fail to differentiate them effectively. Future research should employ large-scale, longitudinal designs utilizing high-field MRI and multimodal neuroimaging to characterize MECTinduced structure-function coupling in the hippocampus and its integration at the network level.
   Additionally, multiscale analyses spanning molecular, circuit, and network dimensions would be beneficial.

AB  - In rat models, it is well-documented that chronic administration of propionic acid (PPA) leads to autism-like behaviors. Although the intranasal (IN) insulin approach is predominantly recognized for its effects on food restriction, it has also been shown to enhance cognitive memory by influencing various proteins, modulating anti-inflammatory pathways in the brain, and reducing signaling molecules such as interleukins. This study seeks to explore the potential therapeutic benefits of IN insulin in a rat model of autism induced by PPA. Thirty male Wistar albino rats were categorized into three cohorts: the control group, the PPA-induced autism (250 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal PPA dosage for five days) group, treated with saline via IN, and the PPA-induced autism group, treated with 25 U/kg/day (250 mu L/kg/day) insulin via IN. All treatments were administered for 15 days. After behavioral testing, all animals were euthanized, and brain tissue and blood samples were collected for histopathological and biochemical assessments. Following insulin administration, a substantial reduction in autism symptoms was observed in all three social behavior tests conducted on the rats. Moreover, insulin exhibited noteworthy capabilities in decreasing brain MDA, IL-2, IL-17, and TNF-alpha levels within autism models. Additionally, there is a notable elevation in the brain nerve growth factor level (p < 0.05) and GDF-15 (p < 0.05). The assessment of cell counts within the hippocampal region and cerebellum revealed that insulin displayed effects in decreasing glial cells and inducing a significant augmentation in cell types such as the Purkinje and Pyramidal cells. The administration of insulin via IN exhibits alleviating effects on autism-like behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological alterations induced by PPA in rats. Insulin-dependent protective effects show anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective roles of insulin admitted nasally.

AB  - It was demonstrated that ginsenosides exert anti-convulsive potentials and interleukin-6 (IL-6) is protective from excitotoxicity induced by kainate (KA), a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Ginsenosides-mediated mitochondrial recovery is essential for attenuating KA-induced neurotoxicity, however, little is known about the effects of ginsenoside Re (GRe), one of the major ginsenosides. In this study, GRe significantly attenuated KA-induced seizures in mice. KA-induced redox changes were more evident in mitochondrial fraction than in cytosolic fraction in the hippocampus of mice. GRe significantly attenuated KA-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress (i.e. increases in reactive oxygen species, 4-hydroxynonenal, and protein carbonyl) and mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. the increase in intra-mitochondrial Ca2+ and the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential). GRe or mitochondrial protectant cyclosporin A restored phospho-signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and IL-6 levels reduced by KA, and the effects of GRe were reversed by the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 and the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP). Thus, we used IL-6 knockout (KO) mice to investigate whether the interaction between STAT3 and IL-6 is involved in the GRe effects. Importantly, KA-induced reduction of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD-2) levels and neurodegeneration (i.e. astroglial inhibition, microglial activation, and neuronal loss) were more prominent in IL-6 KO than in wild-type (WT) mice. These KA-induced detrimental effects were attenuated by GRe in WT and, unexpectedly, IL-6 KO mice, which were counteracted by AG490 and 3-NP. Our results suggest that GRe attenuates KA-induced neurodegeneration via modulating mitochondrial oxidative burden, mitochondrial dysfunction, and STAT3 signaling in mice.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-mediated oestrogen receptor (ER) in modulating the depressive-like behaviours of ovariectomy (OVX) mice and the associated mechanisms. E2 was administrated in OVX mice. The behaviour and physiological changes of OVX mice including immobility time in tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), levels of serum E2, inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress factors, indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and the neurotransmitters mediated by IDO1 activation were then recorded. Cell injury models established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or H2O2 stimulation in HT22 and BV2 cells were employed to further explore the mechanisms of E2's function. E2 treatment improved OVX-induced increase of immobility time in FST and TST. Meanwhile, E2 ameliorated the changes of inflammatory factors (NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha and IL-6), IDO1, IDO1-mediated TRP/KYN pathway and oxidative stress factors (iNOS, MDA, GSH and SOD) in the hippocampus of OVX mice. Interestingly, ER beta inhibitor abolished E2's inhibitory effects on the inflammation and IDO1-mediated TRP/KYN pathway; ER beta inhibitor also abolished E2's anti-oxidative stress effect. In cell experiments, ER beta small interfering RNA (siRNA) pretreatment reversed E2's anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-treated HT22 and BV2 cells and E2's inhibitory effect on IDO1 expression in LPS-treated BV2 cells. ER beta siRNA pretreatment also reversed E2's anti-oxidation effect on H2O2-treated HT22 cells. E2 exert the antidepressant function in OVX mice via ER beta-modulated suppression of NF-kappa B-mediated inflammatory pathway, oxidative stress factors and IDO1-mediated TRP/KYN pathway in the hippocampus.

AB  - In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and animal models of depression, key pathological hallmarks include activation of microglia as well as atrophy and loss of astrocytes. Under certain pathological conditions, microglia can inflict damage to neurons and astrocytes. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how activated microglia induced astrocyte atrophy and loss remain enigmatic. In this study, a depression model induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is utilized. The results show that CSDS induces significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, along with notable astrocyte atrophy and apoptosis, microglial activation, and elevated levels of microglial interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subsequent studies demonstrate that IL-6 released from activated microglia promotes astrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of the P2X7 receptor P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in microglia, which is implicated in the stress response, reduces stress-induced microglial activation, IL-6 release, and astrocyte apoptosis. Direct inhibition of microglia by minocycline corroborates these effects. The selective knockdown of IL-6 in microglia and IL-6 receptors in astrocytes effectively mitigates depression-like behaviors and reduces astrocyte atrophy. This study identifies microglial IL-6 as a key factor that contributes to astrocyte apoptosis and depressive symptoms. Consequently, the IL-6/IL-6R pathway has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of depression.

AB  - Due to the intersection of three mining rights in a mining area, the stability of the rock mass is mutually affected after mining operations. To study the optimal backfill ratio and the surface stability after backfilling in the adjacent goaf areas of the three mines in this mining area, a mineral deposit model is established using Rhino software. The model spans 2500 m in the east-west direction, 3000 m in the north-south direction, and ranges from an underground elevation of -610 m below. FLAC3D software was then used to analyze the surface stability under two different backfill ratios after the complete excavation of the ore body. Additionally, 52 monitoring points were set up at critical buildings and structures. The results revealed that after the complete excavation of the ore body, large-scale surface subsidence occurred in the mining area, with the main subsidence center located in the Yinzhushan mining area. Under backfill condition 1, six monitoring points experienced settlements exceeding 30.00 mm, with a maximum settlement of 53.98 mm. Under backfill condition 2, three monitoring points exceeded 30.00 mm, with a maximum settlement of 51.93 mm. The level displacement deformation at the monitoring points under both conditions met the stability requirements specified by national standards. By comparing the settlements at the monitoring points, it was determined that backfill condition 2 represents the optimal backfill ratio. This study provides a theoretical basis for practical backfilling operations in the mine.

AB  - Hippotherapy has been used for decades and its benefits to human patients have largely been proven, whether being applied to those with physical or mental disabilities. There have been a plethora of animal welfare studies recently, pertaining especially to ridden horses. This study aimed to investigate stress markers in horses during hippotherapy sessions to address the ethical considerations raised by using horses for therapy. A ridden stress ethogram was established and validated specifically for this study via subjective observation and video recording of a ridden session involving intermediate-level riders. The experiment entailed eight healthy horses undergoing two ridden sessions on separate days, one with disabled riders and one with beginners. Several parameters associated with physiological responses to stress were evaluated at rest, such as heart rate, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], serum and salivary cortisol. These parameters as well as the behavioural stress score from the ethogram scale were measured during both sessions. No significant differences were found between heart rate, plasma ACTH, and stress scores. Serum and salivary cortisol were significantly lower during the hippotherapy session than during the session with beginners. The current study found no evidence of compromised welfare when horses were used as a therapeutic aid during hippotherapy sessions compared to their usual ridden activity. Although these results indicate that hippotherapy may be ethically justified as it benefits humans without causing harm to the horses, the present study was small, and the results should be interpreted with caution.

KW  - COMMON HIPPOPOTAMUS
AB  - In January 2017, a Nile hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious) was born approximately six weeks premature at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. Due to the calf's weakened condition and lack of interest from the dam, management at the zoo made the decision to hand-rear the calf. Limited published information was available on hand-rearing this species of hippopotamus (hippo). To devise a nutritionally appropriate recipe, milk samples were acquired from the dam on Days 1, 3, 8, and 9 postpartum, and assayed for sugar, protein, fat, mineral, and water content using standard methods validated for multiple species of mammals at the Smithsonian National Zoo's Nutrition Science Laboratory. The sugar content stayed relatively constant (mean = 4.5%; range: 4.3%-4.7%). The fat consistently increased from 0.48% to 4.24% (mean = 2%). Excluding Day 9, the protein content gradually decreased from 9.56% to 6.39% (mean = 8%). The dry matter (DM) ranged from 14.38% to 16.72% (i.e., water content of 85.62%-83.28%), with the sum of the solids (sugar, protein, fat, and ash) averaging 98.5% of measured DM. Fat content was lower than expected but within the range of other artiodactyls. Between Days 1 and 8, the trend of decreasing protein and increasing fat was consistent with a change from colostrum to mature milk. The sharp increase in fat and protein with a decrease in sugar on Day 9 may indicate the beginning of the involution of the mammary gland due to lack of nursing stimulus. Utilizing this information, the Cincinnati Zoo was able to formulate a successful milk replacement recipe that allowed the calf to be raised through weaning to maturity.

AB  - Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) plays a crucial role in regulating reproductive behavior in vertebrates through the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis. Seahorses exhibit unique male pregnancy behavior, making them an interesting subject for investigating the regulatory mechanisms behind this behavior. In this study, we focused on the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) and obtained the full-length cDNA sequences of three GnRH genes: GnRH1, GnRH2, and GnRH3. Notably, we newly identified GnRH1, filling a gap in previous research that had overlooked this subtype. Through a homologous analysis, we found that the core peptide of GnRH1 in lined seahorses is not common in teleosts, while the core peptides of GnRH2 and GnRH3 are conserved. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the tissue expression patterns of these GnRH genes. Our results showed that all three genes were predominantly expressed in the brain, albeit in different regions. Specifically, GnRH1 was mainly expressed in the hypothalamus, GnRH2 in the optic tectum, and GnRH3 in the telencephalon. Expression dynamics indicated a progressive decrease in GnRH2 and a significant surge in GnRH3 during gonadal development, hinting at an alternating regulatory function. Moreover, GnRH1 and GnRH3 expression levels were considerably higher during pregnancy compared to those in pre-pregnancy and postpregnancy stages, underscoring their critical role in modulating male pregnancy behavior in lined seahorses. Our findings provide insights into the complex interplay of GnRH subtypes in regulating reproductive processes, particularly in the context of male pregnancy behavior in seahorses.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe disabling condition with no cure currently available, which accounts for 60-70% of all dementia cases worldwide. Therefore, the investigation of possible therapeutic strategies for AD is necessary. To this end, animal models corresponding to the main aspects of AD in humans have been widely used. Similar to AD patients, the double transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice show cognitive deficits, hyperlocomotion, amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques in the cortex and hippocampus, and exacerbated inflammatory responses. Recent studies have shown that these neuropathological features could be reversed by stem cell transplantation. However, the effects induced by neural (NSC) and mesenchymal (MSC) stem cells has never been compared in an AD animal model. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether transplantation of NSC or MSC into the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice reverses AD-induced pathological alterations, evaluated by the locomotor activity (open field test), short- and long-term memory (object recognition) tests, A beta plaques (6-E10), microglia distribution (Iba-1), M1 (iNOS) and M2 (ARG-1) microglial phenotype frequencies. NSC and MSC engraftment reduced the number of A beta plaques and produced an increase in M2 microglia polarization in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of stem cell transplantation. NSC also reversed the hyperlocomotor activity and increased the number of microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. No impairment of short or long-term memory was observed in APP/PS1 mice. Overall, this study highlights the potential beneficial effects of transplanting NSC or MSC for AD treatment.

AB  - Autocrine and paracrine factors play key roles in the process of Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), which are secreted by balding dermal papilla cells (DPCs) after dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induction. Camellia seed cake is an oriental oil extraction byproduct, and its extract has been traditionally used to wash hair in China. This study elucidated the hair growth-promoting effects of Camellia seed cake extract (CSCE) in DHT-treated cultured DPCs and its underlying mechanisms. The effect of CSCE on cell viability and release of inflammatory factors IL-6 and IL-1 alpha was performed on human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) incubated with DHT. Relative expression of bax, bcl-2, p53, androgen receptor (AR) and 5 alpha- reductase type II (SRD5A2) was determined by PCR. Senescence-associated was examined by beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) assays. CSCE restored DHT-induced cell damage in a dose-dependent manner, and effectively reduced the production of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha in DHT-treated DPCs. CSCE exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect, which increased the expression of bcl-2, and decreased the expressions of bax and p53 in DHT-incubated DPCs. CSCE also showed an anti-androgenic effect reversing the increase in AR and SRD5A2 expressions in DPCs driven by DHT incubation. In addition, CSCE inhibited the beta-galactosidase enzyme activity and slowed down the cell senescence of DPCs which is crucial for AGA progression. In this study, we found that CSCE may have the potential to prevent and alleviate AGA by abrogating the effect of DHT in cultured DPCs.

AB  - The return of wolves to regions where they had been extirpated has given rise to conflicts among stakeholder groups demonstrating tensions in ecological, economic, and ethical dimensions. This study aims to investigate how psychological distance of stakeholder groups shape ethical attitudes towards wolf management in Germany. Specifically, it addresses the research question how human stakeholder groups with varying psychological distances differ in their ethical attitudes and perspectives on wolves and wolf management, and how Construal Level Theory (CLT) potentially helps to explain these differences. CLT posits that individuals perceive issues at varying levels of psychological distance-spatial, social, temporal, or hypothetical-with greater distance leading to more abstract, generalized evaluations, while closer proximity results in concrete, detailed assessments. A quantitative open-recruited, snowball-sampling online survey was conducted in March 2023, yielding data from 2,896 participants. These participants represent a diverse range of psychological distance, including deeply involved pastoralists, hunters, individuals engaged in both activities, and those uninvolved in either. Descriptive and regression analyses reveal that psychological distance exerts influence on ethically relevant attitudes. Stakeholders with direct wolf exposure perceive wolves as threats and favor restrictive management, whereas uninvolved individuals adopt more abstract, favorable views and rather oppose interventionist strategies. The distinction between these groups becomes more nuanced when differentiated CLT-conceptualized psychological proximity variables are taken into consideration in the regression analyzes. Hypothetical distance variables like a history of attacks by wolves on livestock, social factors such as lower levels of formal education, temporal aspects such as the early stages of wolf re-settlement, and spatial influences such as specific rural settings each contribute to more critical and restrictive ethical perspectives on wolves and wolf management. The findings support CLT's premise and underscores the potential for science-based, sensitive and empathetic participatory decision-making possibly within a review processes by an ethical committee. This holds the potential to acknowledge the psycho-emotional stress of deeply involved human stakeholders and the intrinsic values of non-human animals fostering more inclusive and culturally acceptable management strategies.

AB  - Aberrant lipid metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we identified G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) as a pivotal oncogenic driver that orchestrates lipid metabolic reprogramming to fuel CRC progression. Clinically, GPS2 is overexpressed in CRC and is correlated with aggressive phenotypes. Functionally, GPS2 depletion inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, whereas its overexpression accelerates malignancy. Mechanistically, GPS2 dual-regulates lipid metabolism by facilitating the nuclear translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) to activate lipid synthesis and by increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) transcription to promote fatty acid oxidation. Crucially, we revealed that GPS2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in CRC cells, where it forms biomolecular condensates that promote oncogenic signaling. Through its coiled-coil domain, phase-separated GPS2 directly interacts with the C-terminal kinase domain of large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1), a core kinase of the Hippo pathway, inducing LLPS of LATS1 and suppressing its activity. This inactivation releases YAP, which in turn amplifies SREBP1/PPAR alpha-driven lipid metabolism. Rescue experiments confirmed that YAP reconstitution restores SREBP1 nuclear translocation and PPAR alpha transcription upon GPS2 loss, establishing the LATS1-YAP axis as the central effector of GPS2-mediated lipid metabolic programming. Our study delineates a novel phase separation-dependent mechanism whereby GPS2 spatially reorganizes LATS1-YAP signaling to reprogram lipid metabolism and promote CRC progression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for metabolic intervention in CRC.

AB  - Dynastinae are among the most diverse groups of scarab beetles, with body sizes ranging from 10 to 225 mm. People often focus on larger male beetles with prominent horns, while smaller species, particularly their larvae, are frequently overlooked. In this study, the final-instar larvae of Eophileurus chinensis were observed and described using scanning electron microscopy. The larvae are notable for their coarse punctures on the head capsule, paired angular processes on the labrum, a prominent truncate process on the haptomerum, mandibles with a prominent left S4 tooth and a subtle right one, and thoracic claws flattened at the apex. This unique combination of traits distinguishes them from all previously described species. Additionally, the living strategies underlying their relatively small size and life history strategies were briefly discussed.

AB  - Despite serum ferritin's potential as an iron status indicator, its concentrations vary significantly throughout a black rhinoceros's (Diceros bicornis) life, sometimes irrespective of iron load. We explored acute phase response-related biomarkers, serum amyloid A (SAA) and ceruloplasmin (Cp), to better understand the mechanisms influencing serum ferritin changes in managed black rhinoceroses. The objective was to evaluate the relationships between circulating levels of ferritin, SAA, and Cp in black and white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum). We analyzed banked serum samples collected serially from 11 black (n = 222) and 7 white (n = 134), rhinoceroses (rhinos) and classified samples based on SAA values: clinically healthy (< 1 mg/L), subclinical (1-7 mg/L), or clinically abnormal (> 7 mg/L). In black rhinos, serum ferritin was not different between health status categories (p = 0.5292), nor was it correlated with SAA (p = 0.4164). However, Cp activity was significantly lower in clinically healthy sera (p < 0.0001) and had a moderate positive association with SAA (r = 0.477, p < 0.0001). Among the white rhino samples, only five had SAA values greater than 1 mg/L, limiting the assessment of ferritin and Cp activity in the health context. Minor, yet significant, relationships were observed between serum ferritin and Cp activity, negative in black rhinos (r = -0.206; p = 0.0022) and positive in white rhinos (r = 0.289, p = 0.0008). Cp activity may aid in diagnosing illness in black and white rhinos, based on values observed in sera collected near the time of death. However, acute inflammatory processes do not appear to be one of the primary drivers of the high ferritin concentrations detected in some black rhinos.

AB  - Limited data are available regarding reproductive endocrinology of seahorse. Here, we reported the potential function of spexin (SPX1) in the reproduction of seahorse. SPX1, also known as neuropeptide Q (NPQ), is a novel neuropeptide that coevolved with galanin and kisspeptin. In the current study, the entire open reading frame (ORF) sequence of spx1 of the big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) was cloned and characterized, which is 360 base pairs in length, encoding a 119-amino acid precursor peptide, with a 26-aa signaling peptide and a 14-aa C-terminal amidated mature peptide. Tissue distribution expression profiles of spx1 transcripts were analyzed and revealed that spx1 mRNA could be detected in a variety of tissues, with the highest abundance in the mixture tissues of brain and pituitary. The expression profile of spx1 mRNA in the mixture of brain and pituitary during the first reproductive cycle of the big-belly seahorse was evaluated, which showed that the expression level of spx1 mRNA was highest during the critical period of ovarian and testicular transition from stage II to stage III at 3.5-month old, and high in females with IV-stage, V-stage and VI-stage, as well as in males with the early-stage brood pouch, suggesting that SPX1 may play a crucial role at these stages of gonadal and brood pouch development. Intraperitoneal injection of SPX1 can suppress the mRNA expressions of galr2b and fsh beta in female seahorses, however, it promoted the mRNA expressions of spx1, gal, kiss2, gnrh2, kiss2r, galr1a, galr2b, gnrh3 and gnihr in males, besides, low doses of SPX1 enhanced lh beta mRNA expression, while high dose of SPX1 suppressed it. Intraperitoneal injection of SPX1 did not alter the mRNA levels of spx1, gal, kiss2, galr1a, galr2a, gnihr or plasma 17 beta-E2 in females, nor did it change the mRNA levels of galr2a, gth alpha, fsh beta or plasma 11-KT in males. These results revealed that SPX1 may participate in regulating reproduction of the big-belly seahorse by controlling production of GnRH2, GnRH3, FSH and LH of HPG axis, as well as some key hypothalamic neuropeptides including Kiss and GAL. Above all, our results indicate the presence of a functional SPX1 system in the big-belly seahorse, as well as reveal its potential significance in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction in this species, which also lay a foundation for future research on optimizing fish reproductive performance through the regulation of SPX1.

AB  - "An elephant never forgets" is a popular phrase that refers not only to the elephant's extraordinary ability to remember migration routes but also to its pronounced social long-term memory (SLTM). Previous studies have shown intra- and interspecies SLTM performance, but the ability of elephants to have memories of individual humans has not yet been investigated. We tested this interspecific SLTM using auditory, olfactory, and visual stimuli, each from familiar and unfamiliar persons, in two African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) cows living in a zoo. The two-choice object tests revealed a higher interest in sensory stimuli from familiar keepers they had not seen for 13 years than in unfamiliar people. Statistically significant differences were found for olfactory stimuli. In addition, there was significantly more interest in visual stimuli from current keepers than in stimuli from unfamiliar people. Contrary to the results of a previous study with elephants, this was not observed for olfactory stimuli. Due to the small sample size and magnitude of the influencing factors, that is, outdoor experiment, only spatial separation of the animals, these results only represent indications of the possible interspecific SLTM. Nevertheless, we were able to provide the first empirical evidence that L. africana stores information about specific people over a long period of time. Further studies with larger sample sizes, cross-modal testing, and people disliked by the elephants could provide more insights.

AB  - Learned helplessness (LH) induces cognitive and emotional abnormalities via alteration of synaptic and apoptotic markers in the hippocampus. Given the sericin's neuroprotective effects on different experimental models, this study aimed to address whether sericin is able to reduce LH-induced behavioral and molecular changes in the mouse model. Sixty male mice (3 months old) were randomly divided into control, normal saline (NS), and/or different doses of sericin (Ser [100, 200, and 300 mg/kg]) for 21 days. Accordingly, the animals in NS and sericin-treated groups were subjected to 1 day learned helplessness protocol. Behavioral deficits were evaluated and alterations in both synaptic and apoptotic factors were evaluated in the hippocampus. Induction of LH was associated with behavioral changes (depression and cognitive impairment). On the other hand, the administration of sericin effectively normalized these deficits. At molecular levels, sericin increased the levels of synaptophysin, synapsin-1, and PSD-95, and decreased apoptosis in the hippocampus. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of sericin are not fully understood, our results showed that this effect mediated via modulation of the synaptic and apoptotic proteins in the hippocampus of LH-subjected mice.

AB  - Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (SC) is a traditional sedative in China, with wide applications for treating various neurological disorders. Its polysaccharide component has been gaining increased attention for its potential in nerve protection. While raw SC is the primary focus of current research, its processed products are primarily utilized as clinical medicines. Notably, limited research exists on the mechanisms underlying the effects of wine-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (WSCP) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Therefore, this study seeks to assess the therapeutic impact of WSCP on AD mice and investigate the underlying mechanisms through biochemical and metabolomics analyses. The results demonstrate that WSCP exerts significant therapeutic effects on AD mice by enhancing learning and memory abilities, mitigating hippocampal neuronal damage, reducing abnormal amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition, and attenuating hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Biochemical analysis revealed that WSCP can increase SOD content and decrease MDA, IL-6, and TNF-alpha content in AD mice. Furthermore, serum metabolomic results showed that WSCP intervention can reverse metabolic disorders in AD mice. 43 endogenous metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers for WSCP treatment of AD, and the major metabolic pathways were Ala, Glu and Asp metabolism, TCA cycle. Overall, these findings will provide a basis for further development of WSCP.

AB  - Hippoboscoidea is a specialized group of blood-sucking ectoparasite flies, that have a worldwide distribution and are vectors of many dangerous diseases both in mammals and birds. Of particular importance are their unique abdominal adaptations for the bloodsucking and development of larvae. Morphological peculiarities of male and female tergites in Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, Streblidae and Nycteribiidae were studied. Analysis of abdominal cuticular structures superimposed on phylogenetic relationships, revealed a number of patterns, focused on a general decrease in the size and number of tergites. The female tergites are subject to the reduction, especially 3-7. Tergites 4 and 5, sometimes 7, are more reduced in males. Within the group of mammalian parasites, Melophagini have a more conservative abdominal structure. Analysis of the mtDNA CO1 gene sequences of the superfamily Hippoboscoidea revealed five clusters within three families (Hippoboscidae, Streblidae, Nycteribiidae) and Glossinidae as sister group. The time of divergence of genera of louse flies ranged from 32.0 to 8.6 Ma. Genetic distances between Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, Streblidae and Nycteribiidae were almost identical and ranged from 15.9 to 20.2%.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide problem. Currently, there are no effective drugs for AD treatment. Scrophularia buergeriana Miquel (SB) is a traditional herbal medicine used in Korea to treat various diseases. Our previous studies have shown that ethanol extract of SB roots (SBE, Brainon((R))) exhibits potent anti-amnesic effects in A beta(1-42)- or scopolamine-treated memory impairment mice model and neuroprotective effects in a glutamate-induced SH-SY5Y cell model. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of Brainon((R)) and its mechanism of action in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Brainon((R)) (30 or 100 mg/kg/day) was orally treated to six-month-old SAMP8 mice for 12 weeks. Results revealed that Brainon((R)) administration effectually ameliorated cognitive deficits in Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. Following the completion of behavioral testing, western blotting was performed using the cerebral cortex. Results revealed that Brainon((R)) suppressed A beta(1-42) accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and inflammation and alleviated apoptosis in SAMP8 mice. Brainon((R)) also promoted synaptic function by downregulating the expression of AChE and upregulating the expression of p-CREB/CREB and BDNF. Furthermore, Brainon((R)) restored SAMP8-reduced expression of ChAT and -dephosphorylated of ERK and also decreased AChE expression in the hippocampus. Furthermore, Brainon((R)) alleviated AD progression by promoting mitophagy/autophagy to maintain normal cellular function as a novel finding of this study. Our data suggest that Brainon((R)) can remarkably improve cognitive deficiency with the potential to be utilized in functional food for improving brain health.

AB  - Depredation has become a major concern worldwide as it jeopardises both socio-economic activities and species conservation. While modelling can help to inform the management of these conflicts, effectiveness may be hampered by the complexity of interactions that depredation generates within socio-ecological systems. Based on a systematic literature review, we summarised current practices and identified major gaps and research priorities for depredation modelling. We found that 74% of reviewed studies used statistical models to quantify depredation levels, identify environmental or anthropogenic factors influencing these levels or assess the effectiveness of specific mitigation measures. Only 8% of studies used models incorporating elements related to the three main entities involved in depredation: human activity, depredating species and depredated resource. Such integrated modelling approaches are however crucial to comprehensively assess management trade-offs. We highlighted future research priorities to comprehensively model depredation and inform the management of human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is a key driver of neurological disorders. Evodiamine (EVO), an alkaloid from the traditional Chinese herb Evodia rutaecarpa, possesses potent biological activities, notably anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigates EVO's potential to attenuate LPS-induced neuroinflammation, focusing on identifying its therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action. EVO treatment significantly improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, while also lowering levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, NO, IL-1 beta) in brain organoids. In mice, EVO treatment alleviated behavioral abnormalities, especially in cognition and memory, and lowered hippocampal inflammation marker levels. To elucidate the critical mechanisms by which EVO exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, we analyzed LPS-induced inflammatory injury in BV2 cells and used transcriptomics to investigate whether EVO modulates the C/EBP-beta signaling pathway. Further validation using si-C/EBP-beta confirmed EVO's regulatory effect on the C/EBP-beta-COX2 axis, showing that knockdown significantly reduced pro-inflammatory factor expression, thereby providing neuroprotection. Moreover, molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed a stable interaction between EVO and C/EBP beta, supporting its role in attenuating LPS-induced neuroinflammation. In summary, these findings suggest that EVO regulates inflammation-related pathways by targeting the C/EBP-beta-COX2 axis, offering neuroprotective benefits and mitigating neuroinflammatory responses.

AB  - Proteolytic ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins is a fundamental mechanism to control the communication between cells and their environment. A key protease for membrane protein shedding is ADAM17, which requires a non-proteolytic subunit, either inactive Rhomboid 1 (iRhom1) or iRhom2 for its activity. While iRhom1 and iRhom2 are co-expressed in most tissues and appear to have largely redundant functions, the brain is an organ with predominant expression of iRhom1. Yet, little is known about the spatio-temporal expression of iRhom1 in mammalian brain and about its function in controlling membrane protein shedding in the nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that iRhom1 is expressed in mouse brain from the prenatal stage to adulthood with a peak in early postnatal development. In the adult mouse brain iRhom1 was widely expressed, including in cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. Proteomic analysis of the secretome of primary neurons using the hiSPECS method and of cerebrospinal fluid, obtained from iRhom1-deficient and control mice, identified several membrane proteins that require iRhom1 for their shedding in vitro or in vivo. One of these proteins was 'multiple-EGF-like-domains protein 10' (MEGF10), a phagocytic receptor in the brain that is linked to the removal of amyloid beta and apoptotic neurons. MEGF10 was further validated as an ADAM17 substrate using ADAM17-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, this study discovers a role for iRhom1 in controlling membrane protein shedding in the mouse brain, establishes MEGF10 as an iRhom1-dependent ADAM17 substrate and demonstrates that iRhom1 is widely expressed in murine brain.

AB  - Oxudercine gobies include fully aquatic to highly terrestrial species. In this study, we investigated the anatomy of the feeding apparatus of two species, Parapocryptes serperaster and Pseudapocryptes elongatus, both of which can be regarded as representing early stages of the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial existence. The feeding system of these two species is morphologically similar: they both exhibit a unique orientation of premaxillary (vertical) and dentary (horizontal) teeth; a heterogeneous development of gill rakers among gill arches; strongly curved, large pharyngeal plates studded with numerous papilliform teeth; branchial basket skeletons with nearly equal gill-arch lengths; and a similar configuration of the branchial basket musculature. On the other hand, the number of teeth in Pa. serperaster is more than twice that in Pd. elongatus, both on the premaxillary and dentary bones, while the size of the teeth in Pa. serperaster is only half that in Pd. elongatus both in length and width. Pharyngeal plates and associated muscular and skeletal elements are more posteriorly positioned in Pd. elongatus. These similarities and differences may be explained by different trophic adaptations to herbivory and omnivory during the early transitional stages to life on mudflats. The results are discussed in the context of the two phylogenetic hypotheses of the oxudercine gobies based on their ecology and morphology and on genetic analysis.

AB  - The body mass of zoo animals is a strong indication of the life conditions they receive under human care and how they adapt to them. Hippopotamuses (Hippos) in zoos are often considered overweight, but a comparison between the body mass of wild populations and the zoo population has never been done before. Here, we analysed the records of adult body mass of the global zoo populations of hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius and Choeropsis liberiensis) and compared them with available field data from wild populations found in the literature. Furthermore, we analysed trends in body mass with age and seasonality. Zoo hippos of both species are on average heavier than their wild counterparts. This disparity is of greater extent in pygmy hippos than in common hippos, and it can be visually attested when comparing body condition on photographs of zoo and free-ranging individuals. Both zoo populations display sexual body mass dimorphism, with adult males being on average heavier than adult females. For common hippos, this sexual dimorphism is much more prominent in the zoo population than in wild populations, possibly due to males having the full nutritional potential to grow to larger sizes in zoos. Neither species displays consistent seasonal fluctuations in body mass, contrary to what is described for common hippos in the wild due to fluctuations in the availability of resources. While no immediate population-level health problems seem to be prevalent in either species due to overweight, it nevertheless might hinder the management and breeding of these two endangered species due to high infant mortality and earlier puberty. Changes in zoo hippo nutrition should aim to adjust body mass and body condition to values similar to those observed in wild populations by offering them an appropriate diet and monitoring body condition. Our results also demonstrate that efforts to improve nutrition in the last decade have yielded a positive trend of body mass reduction in pygmy hippos in zoos.

AB  - Background: Albino-induced yellow tea is becoming popular in East China because of its special sensory properties. More and more tea gardeners intend to grow albino-induced yellow tea (Camellia sinensis) plants to meet market demand.
   Results: To help them select the suitable cultivars to grow, agronomic traits (i.e., plant shape, survival rate, plant height, budding density, initial one bud with one leaf development date, albino grade of one bud with three leaves, length of one bud with three leaves, and the cumulative weight of 100 buds), chemical characteristics (i.e., water extract content, tea polyphenols content, free amino acids content, and caffeine content), and sensory evaluation score of six albino-induced yellow tea cultivars which were introduced and cultivated in Ningbo (a city in East China) were assessed. The principal component analysis (PCA) was used for the comprehensive evaluation. It turned out that the six albino-induced yellow tea cultivars were with distinguishable agronomic traits, chemical characteristics, and sensory properties. Four principal components were extracted by PCA and the cumulative variance contribution rate reached 96.773%. Among the six cultivars, "Jinguan Tea", "Zhonghuang No.3", and "Yujinxiang" got the top three highest principal component scores.
   Conclusion: According to the results, albino-induced yellow tea cultivars which are suitable to be introduced and cultivated in Ningbo, China, are "Jinguan Tea", "Zhonghuang No.3", and "Yujinxiang".

AB  - Models play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of Earth's physical nature and environmental systems, aiding in their efficient planning and management. The accuracy and reliability of these models heavily rely on data, which are generally partitioned into subsets for model development and evaluation. Surprisingly, how this partitioning is done is often not justified, even though it determines what model we end up with, how we assess its performance and what decisions we make based on the resulting model outputs. In this study, we shed light on the paramount importance of meticulously considering data partitioning in the model development and evaluation process, and its significant impact on model generalization. We identify flaws in existing data-splitting approaches and propose a forward-looking strategy to effectively confront the "elephant in the room", leading to improved model generalization capabilities.

AB  - Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, CD274 and B7-H1) has been described as a ligand for immune inhibitory receptor programmed death protein 1 (PD-1). With binding to PD-1 on activated T cells, PD-L1 can prevent T cell responses via motivating apoptosis. Consequently, it causes cancers immune evasion and helps the tumor growth; hence, PD-L1 is regarded as a therapeutic target for malignant cancers. The anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint has attained remarkable outcomes in clinical application and has turned to one of the most prevalent anti-cancer drugs. The present study aimed to develop polyclonal heavy chain antibodies targeting PD-L1via Camelus dromedarius immunization. The extra-cellular domain of human PD-L1 (hPD-L1) protein was cloned, expressed, and purified. Afterwards, this recombinant protein was utilized as an antigen for camel immunization to acquire polyclonal camelid sera versus this protein. Our outcomes showed that hPD-L1 protein was effectively expressed in the prokaryotic system. The antibody-based techniques, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and flow cytometry displayed that the hPD-L1 protein was detected by generated polyclonal antibody. Due to the advantages of multi-epitope-binding ability, our study exhibited that camelid antibody is effective to be applied significantly for detection of PD-L1 protein in essential antibody-based studies.& COPY; 2023 Urmia University.

AB  - Regulation of mRNA translation is essential for brain development and function. Translation elongation factor eEF2 acts as a molecular hub orchestrating various synaptic signals to protein synthesis control and participates in hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions. However, whether eEF2 regulates other behaviors in different brain regions has been unknown. Here, we construct a line of Eef2 heterozygous (HET) mice, which show a reduction in eEF2 and protein synthesis mainly in excitatory neurons of the prefrontal cortex. The mice also show lower spine density, reduced excitability, and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). While HET mice exhibit normal learning and memory, they show defective social behavior and elevated anxiety. Knockdown of Eef2 in excitatory neurons of the mPFC specifically is sufficient to impair social novelty preference. Either chemogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in the mPFC or mPFC local infusion of the AMPAR potentiator PF-4778574 corrects the social novelty deficit of HET mice. Collectively, we identify a novel role for eEF2 in promoting prefrontal AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission underlying social novelty behavior.

AB  - As an important member of the Siglec family, SIGLEC-15 plays an important role in osteoclast differentiation, bone remodeling, and tumor immune evasion. In the tumor microenvironment, SIGLEC-15 functions independently of the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway. In this study, the SIGLEC-15 fusion protein (SIGLEC-15-Fc) was successfully expressed and purified using a eukaryotic expression system. This protein was then used as an antigen to immunize camelids, inducing the production of specific nanobodies (VHHs) targeting SIGLEC-15. The resulting nanobodies exhibited a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa. After screening, we identified two nanobody strains, Nb1C8 and Nb2D7, both of which bind SIGLEC-15 without competition. We confirmed the nanobodies' high affinity and stability through Octec platform and stability analyses. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Nb1C8 and Nb2D7 specifically binds to SIGLEC-15 which naturally expressed on bladder cancer cells. This study marks the first development of nanobodies specifically targeting SIGLEC-15, providing a solid foundation for the development of SIGLEC-15-related diagnostic tools and antibody therapeutics.

AB  - Reproductive complications for both male and female zoo-managed African elephants (Loxodonta africana) contribute to the rapidly declining population. In zoo-managed bull elephants, few studies have explored the potential physiological, physical, social, and environmental factors that influence bull fertility, particularly, androgen production. Testosterone is the essential steroid hormone for male sexual maturation and inadequate concentrations can be detrimental for spermatogenesis. Testosterone, fecal glucocorticoid metabolites, leptin, glucose, insulin, and triglycerides were analyzed from weekly fecal and blood serum samples taken over 6 months from six zoo-managed African elephant bulls (10-19 years of age). Testosterone levels were compared to endocrine factors, weekly social and environmental variables, daily musth signs, and body condition scores (BCS). The glucose-to-insulin ratio (G:I) was the only physiological biomarker found to be positively associated with testosterone. Predictive physical variables included Musth Score (+) and Moderate Exercise (+). Bulls with BCS signifying overweight (BCS 4) had lower testosterone (36.6 +/- 1.6 ng/g fecal extraction [FE]) than bulls with healthy BCS 3; 51.2 +/- 4.9 ng/g FE). Numerous social variables influenced testosterone concentrations, including Total Contact Day (+), Female Interaction Day (+), Indirect Contact Day (+), Indirect Contact Night (+) and Total No Contact (-). Both percentage of Time Outdoor and Time Mixed positively influenced testosterone, whereas testosterone decreased for percentage of Time Indoors. Each additional daily browse opportunity increased testosterone by approximately 7 ng/g FE. In managed care, the emphasis should be placed on optimizing these predictors of testosterone production to promote bull reproductive health.

AB  - This paper presents a dynamical neural network framework to understand how catchment systems respond to daily rainfall-runoff processes over time. We developed an interactive Python-based deep neural network (DNN) package called FlowDyn (presented through a JS-based web platform) to simulate and forecast daily streamflow data for >180 gauging stations across the globe. Several DNN models, including long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a hybrid network of convolutional neural network and LSTM (ConvLSTM), as well as an auto encoder (AE) model were developed and integrated into the FlowDyn pipeline to analyze and forecast sequential daily streamflow values that are embedded within a web-based application for demonstration and visualization. Inputs were gathered from different web services, including the catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies (CAMELS), the national climatic data center (NCDC), and the global runoff data center (GRDC). DNN configurations were trained and tested with an average accuracy rating of 0.83 across 183 river basins globally. FlowDyn simulation and performance demonstrated that different DNN models were able to learn both regionally consistent and location-specific hydrological behaviors. Through the findings of this paper, we advocate the merit of applying FlowDyn package in the field of daily rainfall-runoff prediction at both local and global scales.

AB  - Lysine acetylation (Kace) is one of the most important post-translational modifications. It is key to identify Kace sites for understanding regulation mechanisms in Camellia sinensis. In this study, we defined a mathematical formula, named sequence spatial equation (SSE), which could give each amino acid coordinate in 3-D space by rotating and translating. Based on SSE, an optional network SSE-Net was constructed for representing spatial structure information. Centrality metrics of SSE-Net were used to design structure feature vectors for reflecting the importance of sites. The optimal features were fed into classifier to construct model SSE-ET. The results showed that SSE-ET outperformed the other classifiers. Meanwhile, all MCC results were higher than 0.7 for different machine learning, which indicated that SSE-Net was effective for representing Kace sites in Camellia sinensis. Moreover, we implemented the other models on our dataset. The results of comparison showed that SSE-ET was much more powerful than the others. Specifically, the result of SN was nearly 20 % higher than the other models. These results showed that the proposed SSE was a valuable mathematics concept for reflecting 3-D space Kace site information in Camellia sinensis, and SSE-Net may be an essential complementary for biology and bioinformatics research.

AB  - Recent studies indicate a therapeutic potential of increased brain endocannabinoids (eCBs) in anxiety disorders, but the underlying brain circuits are still elusive. Here, it is observed that optogenetic inhibition and activation of anterior basolateral amygdala (aBLA) - ventral hippocampus (vHPC) glutamatergic projections respectively decrease and increase anxiety avoidance behaviors. Then, the contributions of eCBs in aBLA-vHPC projections to anxiety avoidance are investigated by employing three newly developed synapse- and circuit-specific eCB-targeted viral strategies to achieve real-time monitoring of eCB release, in vivo optogenetic activation of CB1 receptors, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes. Prominent eCB release are surprisingly found at aBLA-vHPC glutamatergic synapses during anxiety avoidance, suggesting inhibitory effects of increased eCBs in aBLA-vHPC projections on anxiety avoidance. This idea is further supported by findings that specific activation of CB1 receptors at aBLA-vHPC synapses inhibit presynaptic glutamate release and reduce anxiety avoidance. In contrast, specific knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes at aBLA-vHPC synapses reduce eCB levels at aBLA-vHPC glutamatergic synapses and increase anxiety avoidance. Additionally, inhibition of aBLA-innervated vHPC glutamatergic neurons alleviates anxiety avoidance. Together, these findings reveal counteracting effects of increased eCB signaling in aBLA-vHPC circuits on anxiety avoidance.

AB  - Compounds derived from Curcuma longa L. (C. longa) have been extensively studied and reported to be effective and safe for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, but most research has been focused on curcuminoids derived from C. longa. As neurodegenerative diseases are associated with oxidation and inflammation, the present study aimed to isolate and identify active compounds other than curcuminoids from C. longa to develop substances to treat these diseases. Seventeen known compounds, including curcuminoids, were chromatographically isolated from the methanol extracts of C. longa, and their chemical structures were identified using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Among the isolated compounds, intermedin B exhibited the best antioxidant effect in the hippocampus and anti-inflammatory effect in microglia. Furthermore, intermedin B was confirmed to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p-65 and I kappa B alpha, exerting anti-inflammatory effects and inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species, exerting neuroprotective effects. These results highlight the research value of active components other than curcuminoids in C. longa-derived compounds and suggest that intermedin B may be a promising candidate for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Plant polysaccharides have been reported to possess multiple pharmacological effects that can inhibit the progression of inflammatory diseases. The shell of Camellia oleifera fruits is a byproduct of the C. oleifera industry that is insufficiently utilized. Herein, a novel polysaccharide (CFP-A) was purified from C. oleifera fruit shells, and its structure elucidation and anti-inflammatory activity against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis were investigated. Structural analysis revealed that CFP-A is a neutral heteropolysaccharide with a molecular weight of 5643 Da, primarily comprising arabinose (Ara), galactose (Gal), and glucose (Glc). The main chain of CFP-A was -> 3,6)-alpha-d-Galp-(1 -> 3,6)-alpha-d-Galp-(1 -> 3,6)-alpha-d-Galp-(1 -> 3)-alpha-d-Galp-(1 ->. The branch chains alpha-d-Galp-(1 -> 6)-alpha-d-Galp-(1 ->, alpha-l-Araf-(1 ->[5)-alpha-l-Araf-(1]7 -> 3,5)-alpha-l-Araf-(1 ->, and alpha-l-Araf-(1 ->[4)-alpha-d-Glcp-(1]2 -> were respectively connected at the C6 position of -> 3,6)-alpha-d-Galp-(1 ->. CFP-A reduced the expression levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 beta and the production of nitric oxide in lipopolysaccharide-induced Raw264.7 macrophages; it also downregulated inflammatory factor levels in the colon and alleviated splenic hypertrophy, colonic tissue damage, and apoptosis in DSS-induced colitis. Mechanistically, CFP-A attenuated DSS-induced colonic inflammation in mice by activating the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of CPF-A as a complementary therapy for ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Hippoboscidae is a specialized group of blood-sucking flies that are vectors of many dangerous diseases both in mammals and birds. Hippoboscid flies are vessel feeders. Their feeding apparatus consists of a proboscis enclosed in two maxillary palps. Numerous sensilla form a crown on the tip of the proboscis near the biting apparatus. The proboscis sensilla of representatives of separate lines of evolution - Ornithoicinae, Ornitomyini, Olfersiini, Hippoboscinae and Lipopteninae - were examined. All sensillum crowns are organized in a similar way: short and long basiconic sensilla are located along the edges, with several small styloconic sensilla and 2 large ones between them. In some cases, 1-2 basiconic sensilla are located among the styloconic. The total number of sensilla in the crown of Ornithoicinae is 22, in Ornitomyini - 20, Olfersiini - 20, Hippoboscinae and Lipopteninae - 18. The number of sensilla correlates with the age of the genus. Feeding apparatus of the Ornithoicinae flies is characterized by a greater number of basiconic sensilla compared to styloconic ones. Representatives of Ornitomyini and Olfersiini have an equal number of sensilla of these two types compared to Ornithoicinae. In the representatives of Hippoboscinae and Lipopteninae the number of basiconic sensilla is less than the number of styloconic ones. The decrease in the number of sensilla occurs due to the long basiconic ones. Some basiconic sensilla of mammalian parasites and Olfersiini representatives are usually longer than those of bird parasites.

AB  - Adipose tissue is essential to endotherms for thermoregulation and energy storage as well as functioning as an endocrine organ. Adipose derived hormones, or adipokines, regulate metabolism, energy expenditure, reproduction, and immune function in model systems but are less well studied in wildlife. Female northern elephant seals (NES) achieve high adiposity during foraging and then undergo natural fasts up to five weeks long during haul-outs associated with reproduction and molting, resulting in large changes in adipose reserves. We measured circulating levels of four adipokines: leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and kisspeptin-54, in 196 serum samples from female NES at the beginning and end of their breeding and molting fasts. We examined the relationships between these adipokines and life-history stage, adiposity, mass, cortisol, and an immune cytokine involved in the innate immune response interleukin 6 (IL-6). All four adipokines varied with life-history stage. Leptin concentrations were highest at the beginning of the breeding haul-out. Resistin concentrations were higher throughout the breeding haul-out compared to the molt haul-out. Adiponectin concentrations were highest at the beginning of both haul-outs. Kisspeptin-54 concentrations were highest at the end of the breeding haul-out. Leptin, resistin, and adiponectin were associated with measures of body condition, either adiposity, mass, or both. Resistin, adiponectin, and kisspeptin-54 were associated with circulating cortisol concentrations. Resistin was strongly associated with circulating IL-6, a multifunctional cytokine. Adiponectin was associated with glucose concentrations, suggesting a potential role in tissue-specific insulin sensitivity during life-history stages categorized by high adiposity. Increased cortisol concentrations late in lactation were associated with increased kisspeptin-54, suggesting a link to ovulation initiation in NES. This study suggests dramatic changes in circulating adipokines with life-history and body condition that may exert important regulatory roles in NES. The positive relationship between adiponectin and adiposity as well as the lack of a relationship between leptin and kisspeptin-54 differed from model systems. These differences from biomedical model systems suggest the potential for modifications of expression and function of adipose-derived hormones in species that undergo natural changes in adiposity as part of their life-history.

AB  - Flavonoids are key secondary metabolites in plants and predominantly exist in their glycoside forms. UDPglycosyltransferases (UGTs) glycosylate flavonoids, enhancing their solubility and structural diversity, thereby conferring advantages to both plants and humans. However, no efficient method is currently available to screen for genes associated with flavonoid glycosylation. In this study, a multiomics association analysis was conducted using transcriptomic and metabolomic data, leading to the identification of four genes-CsUGT74Y1, CsUGTL30, CsUGT75L12, and CsUGT73A20-involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoid glycosides from the tea plants. Enzyme activity analyses demonstrated that the four proteins encoded by these genes not only catalyze the biosynthesis of flavonoid 7-O-glucosides but also apigenin xyloside and luteolin xyloside. Additionally, the results of amino acid mutations analysis showed that the active centers for CsUGT74Y1 were including His 54, Lle 62, and Asp 253, for CsUGTL30 were including Lle 133, Arg 392, and Trp 373, for CsUGT75L12 were including Glu 371, Asp 387, and Trp 385, and for CsUGT73A20 were including Asp 288, Phe 289, and Trp 326, respectively. In plants, gene silencing experiments revealed significant increases in flavonoid glycoside content. This study not only provides a reference method for the efficient screening of UGTs involved in the glycosylation of secondary metabolites, but also establishes a molecular foundation for flavonoid xyloside biosynthesis in Camellia sinensis.

AB  - Dysregulated R-loop homeostasis leads to DNA replication stress and genomic instability, a major driver of cancer. However, the role of R-loops in melanoma development remains unclear. We established an R-loop scoring model based on a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset and evaluated the association between the R-loop score with the melanoma immune microenvironment and treatment response. We explored the role of CENPA-mediated changes in R-loop distribution during melanoma progression by DNA/RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing and a series of functional experiments. We found that malignant cells with high R-loop scores may be involved in melanoma progression by modulating immune evasion, metabolic reprogramming, and cancer-related pathways. A cell communication analysis revealed that high-score R-loops play an important role in altering cell-cell interactions and limiting the CD8 + cytotoxic T cell response and T cell accumulation. CENPA silencing induced changes in R-loop distribution, upregulated Hippo signaling activity, and inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, the R-loop score can predict the prognosis and immunotherapy effect of melanoma patients. Our work reveals the potential molecular mechanism by which abnormal R-loops promote melanoma progression, which may help develop anticancer therapies based on R-loops or R-loop regulators.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent and deadly gastrointestinal malignancies, with advanced-stage tumors often exhibiting resistance to both chemotherapy and targeted therapies, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes. Sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), previously implicated in receptor trafficking between early and late endosomes/lysosomes in cancer studies, has an unclear role in CRC tumorigenesis and progression. Our study revealed that SNX1 expression was downregulated in CRC, and its low levels correlated with advanced tumor stages and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Functionally, SNX1 significantly inhibited tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Further experiments showed that SNX1 induced ferroptosis in CRC cells by modulating the PPARs-ACSL1/4 pathway downstream of EGFR signaling. Moreover, glucose deprivation suppressed the Hippo pathway, promoted YAP nuclear translocation, and activated the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), leading to SNX1 downregulation. This subsequently activated EGFR signaling and ultimately suppressed ferroptosis in CRC cells. Notably, the combination of SNX1 overexpression and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment exhibited a synergistic anti-tumor effect in a cell-derived xenograft (CDX) model. These findings underscore the critical role of SNX1 in regulating ferroptosis and tumor progression in CRC and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness in CRC.

AB  - Psoroptes ovis var. cuniculi infestation rapidly causes skin lesion, cutaneous inflammatory and subsequent adap-tive immune response in rabbits. To success feeding and survive on the host skin, this mite should product bio-active molecules to confront host tissue repair and immune defense, but these molecules of this mite remains mostly unknown. Serpins have been proved to involve in diverse biological functions including parasite repro-duction, survival and modulating host defense. Limited information is currently available on serpins from Psoroptes mites. Herein, we identified four novel serpins (PsoSP3-PsoSP6) in P. ovis var. cuniculi using bioinfor-matics and molecular biology techniques. Sequence analysis revealed that PsoSP3-PsoSP6 comprised the com-mon features of typical serpins superfamily including serpin domains, signature or the reactive centre loop (RCL) domain. The recombinant PsoSP4-PsoSP6 (rPsoSP4-rPsoSP6) revealed variable potency inhibition on tryp-sin, chymotrypsin and elastase except for rPsoSP3 in inhibitory activity assays. By quantitative RT-PCR, the ex-pressions of PsoSP3 and PsoSP4 were higher in juvenile mites (larva and nymph) than in adult mites, however, PsoSP5 and PsoSP6 appeared near-exclusive expression in adult female mites. Immunolocalization showed that native PsoSP4 protein was localized in uterus, whilst native PsoSP3, PsoSP5 and PsoSP6 were specif-ically localized in the ovarian nutritive cell (ONC) in ovary. Our findings indicated that PsoSP3-PsoSP6 might play critical roles in development and reproduction physiologies. rPsoSP4-rPsoSP6 might participate in modulating host inflammation, immune response and tissue repair.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy that occurs worldwide and is generally associated with poor prognosis. The development of resistance to targeted therapies such as sorafenib is a major challenge in clinical cancer treatment. In the present study, Ten-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1) was found to be highly expressed in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and knockdown of TET1 can substantially improve the therapeutic effect of sorafenib on HCC, indicating the potential important roles of TET1 in sorafenib resistance in HCC. Mechanistic studies determined that TET1 and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) synergistically regulate the promoter methylation and gene expression of DNA repair-related genes in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. RNA sequencing indicated the activation of DNA damage repair signaling was extensively suppressed by the TET1 inhibitor Bobcat339. We also identified TET1 as a direct transcriptional target of YAP1 by promoter analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Furthermore, we showed that Bobcat339 can overcome sorafenib resistance and synergized with sorafenib to induce tumor eradication in HCC cells and mouse models. Finally, immunostaining showed a positive correlation between TET1 and YAP1 in clinical samples. Our findings have identified a previously unrecognized molecular pathway underlying HCC sorafenib resistance, thus revealing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

AB  - Salivary glands are damaged by radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, which often culminates in radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia that may be permanent. Here, we identified a central role for YAP in the regenerative response of the salivary gland. Activation of the Hippo signaling pathway inhibits the phosphorylation of YAP, leading to its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Using mice with salivary gland injury induced by surgical ligation and salivary gland-derived organoids, we found that YAP nuclear localization in the salivary gland epithelium changed dynamically between homeostasis and regeneration. Whereas local injury had no effect on nuclear YAP localization in saliva-producing acinar cells, it triggered nuclear accumulation of YAP in saliva-transporting ductal cells. Injury also stimulated the proliferation of ductal cells, which were mainly quiescent under homeostatic conditions and in nonregenerating areas distal to the injury site, thus enabling salivary gland regeneration. Overexpressing YAP or driving YAP nuclear translocation by inhibiting upstream Hippo pathway kinases increased the capacity of mouse and human salivary gland cells, including human cells that had been irradiated, to form lobed organoids in vitro. Our results identify a YAP-driven regeneration program in salivary gland ductal cells that could be used to promote salivary gland regeneration after irradiation-induced damage.

AB  - Background Increased Ca2+ entry causes an increase in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytosolic reactive free oxygen species (cyROS), and mitochondrial ROS (miROS) in tumor cells. The cyROS and miROS stimulate the cation channels, including the TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1. Sambucus ebulus L (SEB) (Dwarf Elder) induced both antioxidant and anticancer effects in the human hepatocarcinoma and human colon carcinoma cancer cell lines. We investigated the etiology of colorectal cancer and the impact of three channels, as well as the protective effects of SEB on apoptosis, cyROS, and miROS in the colon of mice with colitis-associated colon cancer (AOM/DSS). Methods A total 28 mice were equally divided into four groups as control, SEB (100 mg/kg/day for 14 days), AOM/DSS, and SEB + AOM/DSS. Azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon cancer associated with colitis was induced in the AOM/DSS groups within 10 weeks. At the end of the experiments, the colon samples were removed from the mice. Results The protein bands of caspase - 3, TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1 were increased by the treatments of AOM/DSS. The levels of apoptosis, cyROS, cleaved caspase - 3, and cleaved caspase - 9, as well as the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, all increased in the AOM/DSS group. Although they were reduced in the SEB and AOM/DSS + SEB groups by the treatments of SEB, TRPA1 (AP18), TRPM2 (ACA), and TRPV1 (capsazepine) antagonists, the apoptotic and oxidant values were further elevated in the AOM/DSS group by the treatments of TRPA1 (cinnamaldehyde), TRPM2 (H2O2), and TRPV1 (capsaicin) agonists. Conclusion The activations of TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1 channels induced the increase of apoptotic and oxidant actions in the colon cancer cells, although their inhibition via SEB treatment decreased the actions. Hence, TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1 activations could be used as effective agents in the treatment of colon tumors.

AB  - There is cumulative evidence that lipid metabolism plays a key role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visualising lipid content in a non-destructive label-free manner can aid in elucidating the AD phenotypes towards a better understanding of the disease. In this study, we combined multiple optical molecular-specific methods, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging, synchrotron radiation-infrared (SR-IR) microscopy, Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, and optical-photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) microscopy with multivariate data analysis, to investigate the biochemistry of brain hippocampus in situ using a mouse model of tauopathy (rTg4510). We observed a significant difference in the morphology and lipid content between transgenic (TG) and wild type (WT) samples. Immunohistochemical staining revealed some degree of microglia co-localisation with elevated lipids in the brain. These results provide new evidence of tauopathy-related dysfunction in a preclinical study at a subcellular level.

AB  - Aster koraiensis Nakai (AK) leaf reportedly ameliorates health problems, such as diabetes. However, the effects of AK on cognitive dysfunction or memory impairment remain unclear. This study investigated whether AK leaf extract could attenuate cognitive impairment. We found that AK extract reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and the expression of inflammatory proteins in lipopolysaccharide- or amyloid-beta-treated cells. AK extract exhibited inhibitory activity of control specific binding on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Scopolamine-induced AD models were used chronically in rats and acutely in mice. Relative to negative controls (NC), hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) activity was increased in rats chronically treated with scopolamine and fed an AK extract-containing diet. In the Y-maze test, spontaneous alterations were increased in the AK extract-fed groups compared to NC. Rats administered AK extract showed increased escape latency in the passive avoidance test. In the hippocampus of rats fed a high-AK extract diet (AKH), the expression of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction-related genes, including Npy2r, Htr2c, and Rxfp1, was significantly altered. In the Morris water maze assay of mice acutely treated with scopolamine, the swimming times in the target quadrant of AK extract-treated groups increased significantly to the levels of the Donepezil and normal groups. We used Tg6799 A beta-overexpressing 5XFAD transgenic mice to investigate A beta accumulation in animals. In the AD model using 5XFAD, the administration of AK extract decreased amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation and increased the number of NeuN antibody-reactive cells in the subiculum relative to the control group. In conclusion, AK extract ameliorated memory dysfunction by modulating ChAT activity and Bcl2-related anti-apoptotic pathways, affecting the expression of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction-related genes and inhibiting A beta accumulation. Therefore, AK extract could be a functional material improving cognition and memory.

Here, we use linear models based on limb bone length and circumference measurements of many living animals to estimate the body mass of giant rhinos, with the help of a new composite skeleton of the giant rhino (Dzungariotherium sp.) from the Qingshuiying Formation, Lingwu, northern China. Our estimate suggests that Dzungariotherium sp. from Lingwu is one of the largest giant rhinos known, with a body mass of 20,558 kg. Under the limitation of materials, we estimated the body mass of giant rhinos in as many species as possible by different methods. The body masses of other giant rhinos are also estimated with adjustments based on the new composite skeleton. The data obtained on Dzungariotherium have been considered together with other data on giant rhinos to observe the evolutionary tendency of the group at a large geological scale. It shows that giant rhinos experienced a rapid body size increase since the Late Eocene and divided into three stages, coinciding with the global temperature falling and the spread of the open environment.

AB  - Prenatal opioid exposure might disturb epigenetic programming in the brain of neonatal offspring with various consequences for gene expressions and behaviors. This study determined whether altered trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) in the promoter of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) gene with neural cell apoptosis was involved in the ventral-medial striatum, an important brain region for withdrawal symptoms, of neonatal rat offspring from morphine-addicted mothers. Female adult rats were injected with morphine before gestation and until 14 days after giving birth. On postnatal day 14 (P14), rat offspring from morphine-addicted mothers were subjected to an opioid-withdrawal protocol and were analyzed 2 or 8 h after administration of that protocol. Expressions of the TNF-alpha protein, H3K4me3 in the tnf-alpha promoter gene, and neural cell apoptosis within the ventral-medial striatum of neonatal rat offspring were evaluated. In the absence of significant opioid withdrawal (2 h after initiation of the opioid-withdrawal protocol on P14), prenatal morphine exposure led to increased levels of H3K4me3 in the tnf-alpha promoter gene, of the TNF-alpha protein, and of neural cell apoptosis within the ventral-medial striatum of neonatal rat offspring. Following opioid withdrawal (8 h after initiation of the opioid-withdrawal protocol on P14), differential expression of H3K4me3 in the tnf-alpha promoter gene locus and upregulation of the level of TNF-alpha protein expression were further enhanced in these offspring. In addition, increased levels of caspase-3 and neural cell apoptosis were also observed. Taken together, this study revealed that prenatal opioid exposure can activate an epigenetic histone mechanism which regulates proinflammatory factor generation, which hence, led to cell apoptotic damage within the ventral-medial striatum of neonatal rat offspring from morphine-addicted mothers. More importantly, the opioid-withdrawal episode may provide augmented effects for the abovementioned alterations and could lead to deleterious effects in the neonatal brain of such offspring.

AB  - Upon a drastic decline of the giraffe population in the wild, conservation efforts and therefore the role of zoos have become more important than ever. With their unique opportunities, zoos provide excellent conditions to study animal behavior, expanding the knowledge about the giraffe's behavior repertoire and their ability to adapt. This study therefore examined the nocturnal behavior of 63 giraffe living in 13 different EAZA zoos across Germany and the Netherlands. Giraffe were observed and videos recorded via infrared sensitive cameras during the winter seasons 2015-2018. The observation period spanned nightly from 17:00 to 7:00. Thus, 198 nights, with a total of 2772 h were recorded and analyzed. Linear mixed models were then used to assess potential biological and environmental factors influencing behavior during the dark phase. Results show that individual variables such as age, subspecies and motherhood determined nocturnal activity and sleep behavior most. Among the variables studied, husbandry conditions and environmental factors complying with EAZA standards had no influence on the giraffe's nocturnal behavior. By combining nocturnal activity analyses and an assessment of potential influencing factors, our findings present a holistic approach to a better understanding of captive giraffe behavior and allow for management implications.

AB  - Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes hospitalizations and mortality worldwide, there are no approved neuroprotective treatments, partly due to a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TBI neuropathology and neuroprotection. We previously reported that the administration of low-dose methamphetamine (MA) induced significant functional/cognitive improvements following severe TBI in rats. We further demonstrated that MA mediates neuroprotection in part, via dopamine-dependent activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Here, we further investigated the proteomic changes within the rat cortex and hippocampus following mild TBI (TM), severe TBI (TS), or severe TBI plus MA treatment (TSm) compared to sham operated controls. We identified 402 and 801 altered proteins (APs) with high confidence in cortical and hippocampal tissues, respectively. The overall profile of APs observed in TSm rats more closely resembled those seen in TM rather than TS rats. Pathway analysis suggested beneficial roles for acute signaling through IL-6, TGF beta, and IL-1 beta. Moreover, changes in fibrinogen levels observed in TSm rats suggested a potential role for these proteins in reducing/preventing TBI-induced coagulopathies. These data facilitate further investigations to identify specific pathways and proteins that may serve as key targets for the development of neuroprotective therapies.

AB  - An in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis and mechanisms of sleep disorders is important for finding reliable treatments and interventions in the future. This study aims to explore the effect of sleep deprivation by modified multiple platform-water maze (MMP-WM) on rat neurological function and Tau protein in the hippocampus, as well as the intervention effect of remimazolam. First, 40 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into a control group (no treatment), a Rem group (remimazolam), an MMP-WM group (sleep deprivation model in rats established by MMP-WM), and a combined group (MMP-WM + remimazolam). Five rats were randomly selected from each group for behavior tests at 1 d and 7 d of drug administration or sleep deprivation for Morris water maze and open field test. After that, the rats were executed, the hippocampus was isolated for Nissl staining, and the protein expression of phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was measured by immunohistochemistry. At 1 d, the status in the MMP-WM group was more similar to that in the control group The MMP-WM group showed sparsely arranged hippocampal CA1 neurons, reduced number of Nissl bodies, prolonged escape latency, decreased number of platform crossings and percentage of activity time in the central region, substantially increased p-Tau expression. In contrast, the combined group showed significant improvement in nerve injury, behavior test results, p-Tau at 7 d compared with the MMPWM group and the same group at 1 d. In addition, detection of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotransmitter levels in the cerebrospinal fluid also showed improved neurologic function in the combined group. These results confirm tha MMP-WM was effective in the establishment of sleep deprivation rat model that accurately reflects the pathological manifestations of sleep disorders in human, and the use of remimazolam effectively reversed the pathological damage in sleep-deprived rats.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and the accompanying affective disorders are serious side effects, and their resolution is not guaranteed. Oxidative stress and elevated levels of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) have been detected in the peripheral and central nervous systems of animals with neuropathic pain provoked by several antineoplastic drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX). Several studies have further indicated that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition could be an approach for treating chronic pain, but its impact on the anxiodepressive-like behaviors and memory deficits related to PTX-provoked neuropathy has not yet been investigated. MCC950 is a potent and specific inhibitor of the NLRP3 pathway that acts through inhibiting NLRP3 activation and inflammasome formation. We hypothesized that the administration of MCC950 could alleviate the affective and cognitive disorders accompanying PTX-provoked neuropathy. Using male C57BL/6 mice, we assessed the effects of MCC950 on the mechanical and thermal allodynia, anxiodepressive-like behavior, and memory deficits incited by this taxane. The results indicated that the intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg of MCC950 twice daily for three consecutive days fully reversed the PTX-induced mechanical and thermal allodynia. This treatment also completely attenuated the anxiolytic (p < 0.004) and depressive-like behaviors (p < 0.022) and memory deficits (novel object recognition test; p < 0.0018) incited by PTX. These actions were mainly achieved through blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the sciatic nerve, amygdala, and hippocampus, and oxidative stress in the amygdala and hippocampus. MCC950 also normalized the p-ERK 1/2 overexpression in the sciatic nerve and apoptotic responses in the sciatic nerve and the amygdala. This study suggests that MCC950 might be a promising treatment for PTX-induced mental illnesses and neuropathy.

AB  - Ginseng is known to possess anti-aging potential. Klotho mutant mice exhibit phenotypes that resemble the phenotype of the human aging process. Similar to Klotho deficient mice, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer vascular damage and cognitive impairment, which might upregulate the angiotensin II AT1 receptor. Since AT1 receptor expression was more pronounced than endothelin ET-1 expression in the hippocampus of aged Klotho deficient (+/-) mice, we focused on the AT1 receptor in this study. Ginsenoside Re (GRe), but not ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), significantly attenuated the increase in AT1 receptor expression in aged Klotho deficient mice. Both GRe and the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan failed to attenuate the decrease in phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3 in aged Klotho deficient (+/-) mice but significantly activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated signaling. Both GRe and losartan attenuated the increased NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aged Klotho deficient mice. Furthermore, of all the antioxidant enzymes, GRe significantly increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. GRe significantly attenuated the reduced phosphorylation of ERK and CREB in GPx-1 knockout mice; however, genetic overexpression of GPx1 did not significantly affect them in aged mice. Klotho-, Nrf2-, and GPx-1-immunoreactivities were co-localized in the same cells of the hippocampus in aged Klotho wild-type mice. Both the GPx inhibitor mercaptosuccinate and Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol counteracted the effects of GRe on all neurobehavioral impairments in aged Klotho deficient (+/-) mice. Our results suggest that GRe attenuates all alterations, such as AT1 receptor expression, NOX-, ROS-, and GPx-levels, and cognitive dysfunction in aged Klotho deficient (+/-) mice via upregulation of Nrf2/GPx1/ERK/CREB signaling.

AB  - In agreement with the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, prenatal exposure of Sprague-Dawley rats to the antimitotic agent methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) at gestational day 17 produces long-lasting behavioral alterations such as social withdrawal and cognitive impairment in adulthood, mimicking a schizophrenia-like phenotype. These abnormalities were preceded at neonatal age both by the delayed appearance of neonatal reflexes, an index of impaired brain maturation, and by higher 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) brain levels. Schizophrenia-like deficits were reversed by early treatment [from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 8] with the CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist AM251 (0.5 mg/kg/day). By contrast, early CB1 blockade affected the behavioral performance of control rats which was paralleled by enhanced 2-AG content in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These results suggest that prenatal MAM insult leads to premorbid anomalies at neonatal age via altered tone of the endocannabinoid system, which may be considered as an early marker preceding the development of schizophrenia-like alterations in adulthood.

AB  - Depressive disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, simple, non-invasive brain stimulation technique showing considerable effectiveness in improving depressive symptoms. Most studies to date have applied anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in line with the hypothesis that depressed patients exhibit relative hypoactivity in the left DLPFC compared to the right. Considering the emerging role of the cerebellum in emotional processes, we aimed to study the effect of combining bilateral cerebellar tDCS with the commonly used bifrontal stimulation in patients with severe depression. This open-label pilot study entailed the simultaneous administration of bilateral cerebellar (anode over the left cerebellum, cathode over the right cerebellum) and bilateral frontal (anode over the left DLPFC, cathode over the right DLPFC) tDCS to patients (N = 12) with treatment-resistant depression. The 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were selected as outcome measures. Electric fields distribution originating from this novel electrode montage was obtained by a computational method applied to a realistic human head model. We observed a 30% reduction of both clinician-rated and self-reported severity of depressive symptoms after only five days (10 sessions) of treatment. Younger age was associated with greater clinical improvement. Adverse events were similar to those of the conventional electrodes montage. The modelling studies demonstrated that the electric fields generated by each pair of electrodes are primarily distributed in the cortical areas under the electrodes. In conclusion, the cerebellum could represent a promising adjunctive target for tDCS interventions in patients with TRD, particularly for younger patients.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of mepolizumab in patients affected by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in real-life. A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted on severe CRSwNP patients treated with mepolizumab. Nasal endoscopic polyp score (NPS), visual analogue scale (VAS) symptom score, sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22), asthma control test (ACT) score, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), eosinophils blood cells and prednisone intake were assessed at baseline and after 6 months. A total of 55 patients were included; 49 patients (89%) presented with asthma; aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) in 28 patients (51%). A statistically significant decrease in the SNOT-22 score was observed (median difference -63; 95% CI: -68; -58; p < 0.001) with median t0 76 and IQR (61;90) to t6 10 (5;15). A reduction in NPS, median t0 NPS 4; (IQR:4;6), median t6 NPS 1; (IQR:0;1) p < 0.001, was greater in patients with AERD. The median baseline VAS score was 6 (IQR:6;7) and the differences between t0 and t6 were statistically significant p < 0.001. Significant changes in blood eosinophils cells, median t0 500 cell/mcl (IQR:340;830), median t6 97 cell/mcl (IQR:60;160) p < 0.001, were greater in patients with AERD. Mepolizumab treatment effects have been demonstrated with significantly reduced symptoms, polyp scores, blood eosinophils and systemic corticosteroid use, resulting in an increased health-related quality of life in patients with severe CRSwNP, regardless of the presence or absence of asthma or AERD.

AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the effect of vaccination with an inactivated virus vaccine (IVV) or modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine on the corpus luteum (CL). On d0, synchronized beef cows were treated with MLV (n = 70; BoviShield Gold FP5VL5), IVV (n = 16; ViraShield 6VL5HB), or were unvaccinated controls (n = 5). Plasma was collected from treated animals on d0 and every other day through d22. Plasma was analyzed for concentrations of progesterone and 15 cytokines. Between d10 and d13, selected females (n = 13) were ovariectomized; controls were slaughtered on d15/16 to obtain CL for histological evaluation. There were reduced numbers of large luteal cells (LLC) in MLV compared to IVV and controls (P P < 0.0001), but IVV were similar to controls (P P = 0.11). MLV had decreased LLC percentage compared to controls, and IVV were intermediate (P P < 0.0001, MLV: 1.57 +/- 0.33 %, IVV: 2.99 +/- 0.30 %, Control: 6.45 +/- 0.33 %). Based on progesterone concentrations, 24 % MLV and 0 % IVV had an abnormal cycle following vaccination. Overall, MLV had reduced progesterone concentrations (P P = 0.02; MLV: 3.61 +/- 0.22; IVV: 4.81 +/- 0.46 ng/mL). The new CL that formed following an abnormal cycle in MLV had the greatest percentage (35.56 +/- 5.5%) of apoptotic cells. Treatment by cycle status interaction, and time significantly affected IFN-gamma, IP-10, MIP-1(3, and MCP-1(P P < 0.03), with several time points having elevated concentrations in abnormally cycling MLV animals. Collectively, this demonstrates MLV vaccination around estrus negatively influenced LLC, progesterone, and increased luteal apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

TI  - RGS12 is a novel tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma that inhibits YAP-TEAD1-Ezrin signaling
T2  - ONCOGENE
LA  - English
AB  - Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignancy of the bone that predominantly affects children and adolescents. Hippo pathway is a crucial regulator of organ size and tumorigenesis. However, how Hippo pathway regulates the occurrence of osteosarcoma is largely unknown. Here, we reported the regulator of G protein signaling protein 12 (RGS12) is a novel Hippo pathway regulator and tumor suppressor of osteosarcoma. Depletion of Rgs12 promotes osteosarcoma progression and lung metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Our data showed that the knockdown of RGS12 upregulates Ezrin expression through promoting the GNA12/13-RhoA-YAP pathway. Moreover, RGS12 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of YAP/TEAD1 complex through its PDZ domain function to inhibit the expression and function of the osteosarcoma marker Ezrin. PDZ domain peptides of RGS12 can inhibit the development of intratibial tumor and lung metastases. Collectively, this study identifies that the RGS12 is a novel tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma through inhibiting YAP-TEAD1-Ezrin signaling pathway and provides a proof of principle that targeting RGS12 may be a therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Can in vitro maturation (IVM) and developmental competence of human oocytes be improved by co-culture with ovarian support cells (OSCs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: OSC-IVM significantly improves the rates of metaphase II (MII) formation and euploid Day 5 or 6 blastocyst formation, when compared to a commercially available IVM system.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: IVM has historically shown highly variable performance in maturing oocytes and generating oocytes with strong developmental capacity, while limited studies have shown a positive benefit of primary granulosa cell co-culture for IVM. We recently reported the development of OSCs generated from hiPSCs that recapitulate dynamic ovarian function in vitro.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was designed as a basic science study, using randomized sibling oocyte specimen allocation. Using pilot study data, a prospective sample size of 20 donors or at least 65 oocytes per condition were used for subsequent experiments. A total of 67 oocyte donors were recruited to undergo abbreviated gonadotropin stimulation with or without hCG triggers and retrieved cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were allocated between the OSC-IVM or control conditions (fetal-like OSC (FOSC)-IVM or media-only IVM) in three independent experimental design formats. The total study duration was 1 April 2022 to 1 July 2023.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Oocyte donors between the ages of 19 and 37 years were recruited for retrieval after informed consent, with assessment of anti-Mullerian hormone, antral follicle count, age, BMI and ovarian pathology used for inclusion and exclusion criteria. In experiment 1, 27 oocyte donors were recruited, in experiment 2, 23 oocyte donors were recruited, and in experiment 3, 17 oocyte donors and 3 sperm donors were recruited. The OSC-IVM culture condition was composed of 100 000 OSCs in suspension culture with hCG, recombinant FSH, androstenedione, and doxycycline supplementation. IVM controls lacked OSCs and contained either the same supplementation, FSH and hCG only (a commercial IVM control), or FOSCs with the same supplementation (Media control). Experiment 1 compared OSC-IVM, FOSC-IVM, and a Media control, while experiments 2 and 3 compared OSC-IVM and a commercial IVM control. Primary endpoints in the first two experiments were the MII formation (i.e. maturation) rate and morphological quality assessment. In the third experiment, the fertilization and embryo formation rates were assessed with genetic testing for aneuploidy and epigenetic quality in blastocysts.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We observed a statistically significant improvement (similar to 1.5x) in maturation outcomes for oocytes that underwent IVM with OSCs compared to control Media-IVM and FOSC-IVM in experiment 1. More specifically, the OSC-IVM group yielded a MII formation rate of 68% +/- 6.83% SEM versus 46% +/- 8.51% SEM in the Media control (P = 0.02592, unpaired ttest). FOSC-IVM yielded a 51% +/- 9.23% SEM MII formation rate which did not significantly differ from the media control (P = 0.77 unpaired t-test). Additionally, OSC-IVM yielded a statistically significant similar to 1.6x higher average MII formation rate at 68% +/- 6.74% when compared to 43% +/- 7.90% in the commercially available IVM control condition (P = 0.0349, paired t-test) in experiment 2. Oocyte morphological quality between OSC-IVM and the controls did not significantly differ. In experiment 3, OSC-IVM oocytes demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in Day 5 or 6 euploid blastocyst formation per COC compared to the commercial IVM control (25% +/- 7.47% vs 11% +/- 3.82%, P = 0.0349 logistic regression). Also in experiment 3, the OSC-treated oocytes generated blastocysts with similar global and germline differentially methylated region epigenetic profiles compared commercial IVM controls or blastocysts after either conventional ovarian stimulation.
   LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: While the findings of this study are compelling, the cohort size remains limited and was powered on preliminary pilot studies, and the basic research nature of the study limits generalizability compared to randomized control trials. Additionally, use of hCG-triggered cycles results in a heterogenous oocyte cohort, and potential differences in the underlying maturation state of oocytes pre-IVM may limit or bias findings. Further research is needed to clarify and characterize the precise mechanism of action of the OSC-IVM system. Further research is also needed to establish whether these embryos are capable of implantation and further development, a key indication of their clinical utility.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Together, these findings demonstrate a novel approach to IVM with broad applicability to modern ART practice. The controls used in this study are in line with and have produced similar to findings to those in the literature, and the outcome of this study supports findings from previous co-culture studies that found benefits of primary granulosa cells on IVM outcomes. The OSC-IVM system shows promise as a highly flexible IVM approach that can complement a broad range of stimulation styles and patient populations. Particularly for patients who cannot or prefer not to undergo conventional gonadotropin stimulation, OSC-IVM may present a viable path for obtaining developmentally competent, mature oocytes.

AB  - Sorghum is an important food crop commonly used for brewing, feed, and bioenergy. Certain genotypes of sorghum contain high concentrations of condensed tannins in seeds, which are beneficial, such as protecting grains from herbivore bird pests, but also impair grain quality and digestibility. Previously, we identified Tannin1 and Tannin2, each with three recessive causal alleles, regulate tannin absence in sorghum. In this study, via characterizing 421 sorghum accessions, we further identified three novel recessive alleles from these two genes. The tan1-d allele contains a 12-bp deletion at position 659 nt and the tan1-e allele contains a 10-bp deletion at position 771 nt in Tannin1. The tan2-d allele contains a C-to-T transition, which results in a premature stop codon before the bHLH domain in Tannin2, and was predominantly selected in China. We further developed KASP assays targeting these identified recessive alleles to efficiently genotype large populations. These studies provide new insights in sorghum domestication and convenient tools for breeding programs.

AB  - A variety of the classic green tea plant, Camellia sinensis, was developed and is exclusive to Kenya. Due to high content of anthocyanin polyphenols in its leaves, the beverage obtained from this variety is purple in color and is the origin of the name purple tea. This work had two main purposes. The first one was to identify and quantify the major anthocyanin polyphenols in a hot water aqueous extract of the purple tea leaves. The second one was to test the hypothesis if this extract is capable of inhibiting triglyceride absorption considering that anthocyanin polyphenolics have been frequently associated to antilipidemic effects. Parallel experiments were always done with a similar green tea extract for comparison purposes. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities of both tea varieties are similar. The purple tea extract, however, was strongly inhibitory toward the pancreatic lipase (minimal IC50 = 67.4 mu g mL(-1)), whereas the green tea preparation was a weak inhibitor. Triglyceride digestion in mice was inhibited by the purple tea extract starting at 100 mg kg(-1) dose and with a well-defined dose dependence. Green tea had no effect on triglyceride digestion at doses up to 500 mg kg(-1). The latter effect is probably caused by several components in the purple tea extract including non-anthocyanin and anthocyanin polyphenols, the first ones acting solely via the inhibition of the pancreatic lipase and the latter by inhibiting both the lipase and the transport of free fatty acids from the intestinal lumen into the circulating blood. The results suggest that the regular consumption of Kenyan purple tea can be useful in the control of obesity.

TI  - Ketogenic diet attenuates cognitive dysfunctions induced by hypoglycemia via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent pathways
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION

KW  - ADULT NEUROGENESIS
KW  - GUT MICROBIOME
AB  - Hypoglycemia can potentially cause severe damage to the central nervous system. The ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by high-fat and extremely low-carbohydrate content, can modulate homeostasis and nutrient metabolism, thereby influencing body health. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of KD on hypoglycemia-induced brain injury have not been thoroughly investigated. We aimed to explore the modulating effects of KD on cognitive functions and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In this study, one-month-old mice were fed with KD for 2 weeks, and the changes in the gut microbiota were detected using the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing method. The hypoglycemic model of mice was established using insulin, and the potential protective effect of KD on hypoglycemia-induced brain injury in mice was evaluated through immunofluorescence staining, western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and Golgi staining. Our results showed that the intestinal flora of Dorea increased and Rikenella decreased in KD-fed mice. KD can not only alleviate anxiety-like behavior induced by hypoglycemia, but also increase the proportion of mushroom dendritic spines in the hippocampus by modulating changes in the gut microbiota. KD regulated synaptic plasticity by increasing the levels of SPN, PSD95, and SYP, which relieve cognitive impairment caused by hypoglycemia. Moreover, KD can promote the proliferation and survival of adult neural stem cells in the hippocampus, while reducing apoptosis by suppressing the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 and ATF6 endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in mice with hypoglycemia. This study provides new evidence for demonstrating that KD may alleviate cognitive dysfunctions caused by hypoglycemia by modulating the gut microbiota.

AB  - Three new (1-3) and six known rotenoids (5-10), along with three known isoflavones (11-13), were isolated from the leaves of Millettia oblata ssp. teitensis. A new glycosylated isoflavone (4), four known isoflavones (14-18), and one known chalcone (19) were isolated from the root wood extract of the same plant. The structures were elucidated by NMR and mass spectrometric analyses. The absolute configuration of the chiral compounds was established by a comparison of experimental ECD and VCD data with those calculated for the possible stereoisomers. This is the first report on the use of VCD to assign the absolute configuration of rotenoids. The crude leaves and root wood extracts displayed anti-RSV (human respiratory syncytial virus) activity with IC50 values of 0.7 and 3.4 mu g/mL, respectively. Compounds 6, 8, 10, 11, and 14 showed anti-RSV activity with IC50 values of 0.4-10 mu M, while compound 3 exhibited anti-HRV-2 (human rhinovirus 2) activity with an IC50 of 4.2 mu M. Most of the compounds showed low cytotoxicity for laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells; however compounds 3, 11, and 14 exhibited low cytotoxicity also in primary lung fibroblasts. This is the first report on rotenoids showing antiviral activity against RSV and HRV viruses.

AB  - In this study, based on the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance theory of autism, the time window of GABA switch, the role of K-Cl co-transporter 2 (KCC2) in adjustment GABA switch, and brain permeability to erythropoietin (EPO), the effects of postnatal -EPO and- nano- erythropoietin (NEPO) have been evaluated in the valproic acid (VPA) rat model of autism. The VPA was administered for animal modeling of autism at gestational day (GD) 12.5 (600 mg/kg). Male offsprings were injected with EPO and NEPO in a clinically proper postnatal dosing regimen on postnatal days (PND) 1-5, and autistic-like behaviors were tested at the end of the first month. Then animals were sacrificed, and neuron morphology and KCC2 expression were examined by Nissl staining and Western blot. According to our findings, high-dose NEPO improved autism-associated phenotypes. Neuroprotective effects of EPO and NEPO have been shown in the hippocampus. Postnatal NEPO treatment reversed KCC2 expression abnormalities induced by prenatal VPA. Our results might support the role of KCC2 in ASD and the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance hypothesis. We suggested Nano- erythropoietin and other KCC2 interventions as a new approach to the early treatment and prevention of autism.

AB  - The aging brain undergoes major changes in its topology. The mechanisms by which the brain mitigates age-associated changes in topology to maintain robust control of brain networks are unknown. Here we use diffusion MRI data from cognitively intact participants (n = 480, ages 40-90) to study age-associated differences in the average controllability of structural brain networks, topological features that could mitigate these differences, and the overall effect on cognitive function. We find age-associated declines in average controllability in control hubs and large-scale networks, particularly within the frontoparietal control and default mode networks. Further, we find that redundancy, a hypothesized mechanism of reserve, quantified via the assessment of multi-step paths within networks, mitigates the effects of topological differences on average network controllability. Lastly, we discover that average network controllability, redundancy, and grey matter volume, each uniquely contribute to predictive models of cognitive function. In sum, our results highlight the importance of redundancy for robust control of brain networks and in cognitive function in healthy-aging.
   A diffusion MRI study suggests that redundancy could mitigate the effects of age-associated changes in brain topology to support the average controllability of brain networks middle and old age.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Yuanzhi Powder (YZP), a classical Chinese medicine formula, is good at tonifying heart-Qi and improving cognitive ability. YZP has been reported to show therapeutic effect on alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Aim of the study: This study was conducted to observe the effects of YZP on improving the cognitive abilities of SAMP8 mice, and explore the involved mechanisms on inhibiting the excessive accumulation of phosphorylated tau.Material and methods: Thirty SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into five groups: AD group, AD + DO group, AD + YZP group, AD + LAC group and AD + LAC + YZP group. Age-matched SAMR1 mice were served as CTL group. AD + LAC group and AD + LAC + YZP group received 1 mu g Lactacystin solution via intra-cerebroventricular injection. All mice (except the CTL group and AD + LAC group) were intragastrically administrated for 8 consecutive weeks. Then, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was conducted for evaluation of learning and memory abilities. The pathological changes of hippocampal CA1 were observed by Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. The expression of 26S proteasome in the hippocampus was measured by Western Blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expressions of total tau (Tau5) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pS199, pT231 and pS396) were detected by WB. The aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau and the binding ability of tau protein to microtubules were evaluated respectively by immunostaining and Thioflavin-S staining and double-label immunofluorescence.Results: SAMP8 mice showed serious cognitive impairment in behavioral tests. However, treatment of YZP significantly ameliorated the cognitive deficits of SAMP8 mice. The H&E staining suggested that YZP could protect against neuronal loss in SAMP8 mice. The IHC and WB results showed that YZP increases 26S proteasome expression in SAMP8 mice and 26S proteasome expression was effectively inhibited by Lactacystin. Meanwhile, The WB results demonstrated that YZP can inhibit the expression of hyperphosphorylated tau (pT231, pS396 and pS199). Furthermore, the immunostaining and Thioflavin-S staining and double-label immunofluorescence results indicated that YZP attenuates the excessive aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau and enhances the binding ability of tau to stabilize microtubules in SAMP8 mice.Conclusions: YZP could enhance cognitive performance and learning of AD, ameliorate tau pathology and significantly improve the binding ability of tau to microtubules, based potentially on inhibiting the excessive aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau via the 26Sproteasome pathway but not necessarily the only one.

TI  - (-)-Epicatechin exerts positive effects on anxiety in high fat diet-induced obese mice through multi-genomic modifications in the hippocampus
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
KW  - STRESS
AB  - Obesity is associated with increased occurrence of cognitive and mood disorders. While consumption of high-fat diets (HFD) and associated obesity could have a detrimental impact on the brain, dietary bioactives may mitigate these harmful effects. We previously observed that (-)-epicatechin (EC) can mitigate HFD-induced anxiety-associated behaviors in mice. The aim of our study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of EC actions in the hippocampus which underlies its anti-anxiety effects in HFD-fed mice using a multi-genomic approach. Healthy eight-week old male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 24 weeks either: (A) a control diet containing 10% total calories from fat; (B) a HFD containing 45% total calories from fat; or (C) the HFD supplemented with 20 mg EC per kg body weight. Hippocampi were isolated for genomic analysis using Affymetrix arrays, followed by in-depth bioinformatic analyses. Genomic analysis demonstrated that EC induced significant changes in mouse hippocampal global gene expression. We observed changes in the expression of 1001 protein-coding genes, 241 miRNAs, and 167 long non-coding RNAs. Opposite gene expression profiles were observed when the gene expression profile obtained upon EC supplementation was compared to the profile obtained after consumption of the HFD. Functionality analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes regulate processes involved in neurofunction, inflammation, endothelial function, cell-cell adhesion, and cell signaling. In summary, the capacity of EC to mitigate anxiety-related behaviors in HFD-induced obese mice can be in part explained by its capacity to exert complex genomic modifications in the hippocampus, counteracting changes driven by consumption of the HFD and/or associated obesity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile is a commonly used Mongolian in folk medicine used to treat cerebral nervous system diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, nerve injury and cognitive function, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and coronary heart disease. Eerdun wurile may effect anti-postoperative cognitive function. Aim of the study: To investigate the molecular mechanism of the Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile Basic Formula (EWB) in improving postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) based on Network pharmacology, and to confirm involvement of the SIRT1/p53 signal pathway, one of the key signal pathways, by using the POCD mouse model. Material and methods: Obtain compounds and disease-related targets through TCMSP, TCMID, PubChem, PharmMapper platforms, GeneCards, and OMIM databases, and screen intersection genes; Use Cytoscape soft-ware to build a "drug-ingredient-disease-target" network, and the STRING platform for protein interaction analysis.; R software was used to analyze the function of gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment.; AutoDock Vina software for active components and core targets to Perform molecular docking. The POCD mouse model was prepared by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the morphological changes of hippocampal tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Western blot, immunofluorescence and TUNEL were used to verify the results of network pharmacological enrichment analysis. Results: There were 110 potential targets for improving POCD by EWB, 117 items were enriched by GO, and 113 pathways were enriched by KEGG, among which the SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway was related to the occurrence of POCD. Quercetin, kaempferol, vestitol, beta-sitosterol and 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone in EWB can form stable conformations with low binding energy with core target proteins IL-6, CASP3, VEGFA, EGFR and ESR1. Animal experiments showed that compared with the POCD model group, the EWB group could significantly improve the apoptosis in the hippocampus of the mice, and significantly down-regulate the expression of Acetyl-p53 protein (P < 0.05). Conclusion: EWB can improve POCD with the characteristics of multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway synergistic effects. Studies have confirmed that EWB can improve the occurrence of POCD by regu-lating the expression of genes related to the SIRT1/p53 signal pathway, which provides a new target and basis for the treatment of POCD.

AB  - The potential therapeutic value of cynarin, a phenolic compound derived from artichoke, in treating epilepsy has not yet been reported. The present study evaluated the effects of cynarin on a kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure rat model and its potential mechanism. Cynarin was administered through oral gavage at a dosage of 10 mg kg-1 daily for 7 days before the induction of seizures with KA (15 mg kg-1) via intraperitoneal injection. The results showed that pretreatment with cynarin effectively attenuated the KA-induced seizure score and electroencephalogram (EEG) changes and prevented neuronal loss and glial cell activation in the hippocampi of KA-treated rats. In addition, pretreatment with cynarin dramatically prevented the aberrant levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), p-I kappa B, p65-NF kappa B, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) induced by KA administration in hippocampal tissues. Additionally, KA substantially increased hippocampal glutamate levels and decreased cerebral blood flow, which were significantly alleviated by pretreatment with cynarin. The observed effects of cynarin were comparable to those of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the serum AST, ALT, creatinine, or bilirubin levels between the cynarin-treated rats and the control rats. Cynarin has a neuroprotective effect on a rat model of seizures induced by KA, reducing seizures, gliosis, inflammatory cytokines, and glutamate elevation and increasing cerebral blood flow. Thus, cynarin has therapeutic potential for preventing epilepsy.

AB  - Hydrogen gas (H2) is an antioxidant with demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy. In this study, we administered H2 via inhalation to rats to evaluate its effects on seizures induced by kainic acid (KA) injection and the underlying mechanism. The animals were intraperitoneally injected with KA (15 mg/kg) to induce seizures. H2 was inhaled 2 h once a day for 5 days before KA administration. The seizure activity was evaluated using Racine's convulsion scale and electroencephalography (EEG). Neuronal cell loss, glial cell activation, and the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, CCL2, and CCL3), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the hippocampus were assessed. The cerebral blood flow of the rats was also evaluated. The results revealed that KA-treated rats presented increased seizure intensity; increased neuronal loss and astrocyte activation; increased levels of ROS, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, CCL2, and CCL3; and reduced Nrf2 phosphorylation levels. Pretreatment with H2 inhalation significantly attenuated seizure intensity; prevented neuronal loss; decreased microglial and astrocytic activation; decreased ROS, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, CCL2 and CCL3 levels; and increased Nrf2 levels. Inhalation of H2 also prevented the KA-induced decrease in cerebral blood flow. These results suggest that pretreatment with H2 inhalation ameliorates KA-induced seizures and inhibits the inflammatory response and oxidative stress, which protects neurons.

AB  - Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), which is widely used for anti-HIV-1. Evidences revealed that several central nervous system side effects could be observed in mice and patients with administration of EFV. However, the detailed mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term EFV treatment on cognitive functions and the potential underlying mechanisms in mice. We maintained C57BL/6 mice aged 2 months with treatment containing 40 or 80 mg/kg/day EFV for 5 months, while control group treated with saline. The cognitive functions were evaluated by novel object recognition test, Barnes maze test and Morris water maze. The results showed significant short-term memory impairment in 40 and 80 mg/kg groups, and notable spatial learning and memory impairments in 80 mg/kg group, without any spontaneous activity alteration. Moreover, EFV induced impairments in dendritic integrity and synaptic plasticity in hippocampus. Furthermore, Significant increases were observed in the expression levels of pro-IL-1 beta, a similar tendency of TNF-alpha and phosphorylation of p65 of the 80 mg/kg group compared with control group. These results imply that long-term EFV treatment causes synaptic dysfunction resulting in cognitive deficits, which might be induced by the enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha via activating NF-kappa B pathway.

AB  - Clasmatodendrosis is an autophagic astroglial death showing extensive swollen cell bodies with vacuoles and disintegrated/beaded processes. This astroglial degeneration is closely relevant to the synchronous epileptiform discharges. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the roles of clasmatodendrosis in spontaneous seizure activity are still unknown. The 2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-oleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid methyl ester (CDDO-Me; RTA 402) is one of the activators for nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that is a redox-sensitive transcription factor. In the present study, we explored the effects of CDDO-Me on clasmatodendrosis in chronic epilepsy rats, which could prevent epilepsy-related complications. In the present study, clasmatodendritic astrocytes showed reduced Nrf2 expression and its nuclear accumulation, which were restored by CDDO-Me. CDDO-Me also abrogated heat shock protein 25 (HSP25) upregulation in clasmatodendritic astrocytes by regulating extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2)-specificity protein 1 (SP1)- and Src-casein kinase 2 (CK2)-phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta)-bax-interacting factor 1 (Bif-1)-mediated signaling pathways in chronic epilepsy rats. In addition, CDDO-Me ameliorated spontaneous seizure duration, but not seizure frequency and behavioral seizure severity. Therefore, our findings suggest that clasmatodendrosis may affect seizure duration in chronic epilepsy rats, and that CDDO-Me may attenuate autophagic astroglial degeneration by regulating various signaling pathways.

AB  - Ferulago angulata, a medicinal plant of the Apiaceae family, is known for its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective effects. This study investigated the protective potential of F. angulata total extract against memory impairment induced by amyloid beta-peptide (A beta 25-35) in rats. A beta 25-35 was bilaterally administered into the CA1 region of the hippocampus in male Wistar rats for four consecutive days. Starting from the first surgery day, rats received oral treatment with F. angulata extract (400 mg/kg) or Rivastigmine (1.5 mg/kg) for 16 consecutive days. Morris water maze tests conducted from days 14 to 17 evaluated the learning and memory performance, followed by biochemical and molecular assays on isolated hippocampi. F. angulata extract significantly reversed A beta-induced deficits in learning and memory. In the A beta group, monoamine oxidase A and B enzyme activities and gene expression increased, along with elevated acetylcholinesterase gene expression but decreased enzyme activity compared to the control group. Treatment with F. angulata extract mitigated all these abnormalities. Safety assessments revealed no alterations in blood biochemistry or histology following F. angulata extract treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that F. angulata extract possesses neuroprotective properties, and ameliorates A beta-induced memory deficits by modulating monoamine oxidase enzyme activity and acetylcholinesterase levels without significant adverse effects. Thus, this safe herbal extract shows promise for further exploration in Alzheimer's disease research and potential therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the sharp reduction of estrogen is one of the important reasons for the high incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly women, but there is currently no such drug for treatment of AD. Our group first designed and synthesized a novel compound R-9-(4fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-10,10,-Hydrogen-6-hydrogen-benzopyran named FMDB. In this study, our aim is to investigate the neuro-protective effects and mechanism of FMDB in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. 6 months old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were intragastrical administered with FMDB (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg) every other day for 8 weeks. LV-ER beta-shRNA was injected bilaterally into the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice to knockdown estrogen receptor beta (ER beta). We found that FMDB ameliorated cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests, increased hippocampal neurogenesis and prevented hippocampal apoptotic responses in APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, FMDB activated nuclear ER beta mediated CBP/p300, CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, and membrane ER beta mediated PI3K/Akt, CREB and BDNF signaling in the hippocampus. Our study demonstrated the contributions and mechanism of FMDB to cognition, neurogenesis and apoptosis in APP/ PS1 mice. These lay the experimental foundation for the development of new anti-AD drugs.

AB  - This Review highlights the need for targeting Alzheimer's disease in the preclinical stage for an effective therapeutic strategy. The authors provide an update on candidate therapies in development, current preclinical Alzheimer's disease trials, recruitment challenges and future directions.
   Longitudinal multimodal biomarker studies reveal that the continuum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes a long latent phase, referred to as preclinical AD, which precedes the onset of symptoms by decades. Treatment during the preclinical AD phase offers an optimal opportunity for slowing the progression of disease. However, trial design in this population is complex. In this Review, we discuss the recent advances in accurate plasma measurements, new recruitment approaches, sensitive cognitive instruments and self-reported outcomes that have facilitated the successful launch of multiple phase 3 trials for preclinical AD. The recent success of anti-amyloid immunotherapy trials in symptomatic AD has increased the enthusiasm for testing this strategy at the earliest feasible stage. We provide an outlook for standard screening of amyloid accumulation at the preclinical stage in clinically normal individuals, during which effective therapy to delay or prevent cognitive decline can be initiated.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Saffron, a traditional Chinese medicine, is derived from Crocus sativus L. stigmas and has been reported to possess neuroprotective properties and potentially contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation. Safranal, a potent monothyral aldehyde, is a main component of saffron that has been reported to have antiepileptic activity. However, the specific mechanism by which safranal suppresses epileptic seizures via its antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties is unclear. Aim: To evaluate the effect of safranal on seizure severity, inflammation, and postictal neuronal apoptosis in a mouse model of pentetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and explore the underlying mechanism involved. Materials and methods: The seizure stage and latency of stage 2 and 4 were quantified to assess the efficacy of safranal in mitigating PTZ-induced epileptic seizures in mice. Electroencephalography (EEG) was employed to monitor epileptiform afterdischarges in each experimental group. The cognitive abilities and motor functions of the mice were evaluated using the novel object recognition test and the open field test, respectively. Neurons were quantified using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Additionally, bioinformatics tools were utilized to predict the interactions between safranal and specific target proteins. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins, and inflammatory factor levels were analyzed through western blotting. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) concentrations in brain tissue were assessed by ELISA. Results: Safranal decreased the average seizure stage and increased the lantency of stage 2 and 4 seizures in PTZinduced epileptic mice. Additionally, safranal exhibited neuroprotective effects on hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons and reduced hyperactivity caused by postictal hyperexcitability. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that safranal can bind to five specific proteins, including GSK-3 beta. By promoting Ser9 phosphorylation and inhibiting GSK-3 beta activity, safranal effectively suppressed the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Moreover, the findings indicate that safranal treatment can decrease TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels in the cerebral tissues of epileptic mice and downregulate mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, Caspase 9, and Caspase 3. Conclusion: Safranal can suppress the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis through GSK-3 beta inactivation, suggesting that it is a promising therapeutic agent for epilepsy treatment.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tanshinone-I (TSNI), a member of the mainly active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Dan Shen), which is widely used for the treatment for modern clinical diseases including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, has been reported to show the properties of anti-oxidation, anti inflammation, neuroprotection and other pharmacological actions. However, whether TSNI can improve neuron survival and neurological function against transient focal cerebral ischemia (tMCAO) in mice is still a blank field. Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of TSNI on ischemic stroke (IS) induced by tMCAO in mice and explore the potential mechanism of TSNI against IS by combining network pharmacology approach and experimental verification. Materials and methods: In this study, the pivotal candidate targets of TSNI against IS were screened by network pharmacology firstly. Enrichment analysis and molecular docking of those targets were performed to identify the possible mechanism of TSNI against IS. Afterwards, experiments were carried out to further verify the mechanism of TSNI against IS. The infarct volume and neurological deficit were evaluated by 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Longa respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe neuronal death in the hippocampus and cortical regions by detecting the change of NeuN. The predicting pathways of signaling related proteins were assessed by Western blot in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results: In vivo, TSNI was found to dose-dependently decrease mice?s cerebral infarct volume induced by tMCAO. In vitro, pretreatment with TSNI could increase cell viability of HT-22 cell following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD/R). Moreover, the results showed that 125 candidate targets were identified, Protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway was significantly enriched by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 (MAPK1) and AKT1 could be bound to TSNI more firmly by molecular docking analysis, which implies that TSNI may play a role in neuroprotection through activating AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Meanwhile, TSNI was confirmed to significantly protect neurons from injury induced by IS through activating AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study clarifies that the mechanism of TSNI against IS might be related to AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, which may provide the basic evidence for further development and utilization of TSNI.

AB  - Sinomenine is the main bioactive ingredient of the medicinal plant Sinomenium acutum with neuroprotective potential. This study was designed to assess beneficial effect of sinomenine in alleviation of trimethyltin (TMT)-induced cognitive dysfunction. TMT was administered i.p. (8 mg/kg, once) and sinomenine was daily given p.o. 1 h after TMT for 3 weeks at doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg. Cognitive performance was assessed in various behavioral tests. In addition, oxidative stress- and inflammation-associated factors were measured and histochemical evaluation of the hippocampus was conducted. Sinomenine at a dose of 100 mg/kg significantly and partially increased discrimination index in novel object recognition (NOR), improved alternation in short-term Y maze, increased step-through latency in passive avoidance paradigm, and also reduced probe trial errors and latency in the Barnes maze task. Moreover, sinomenine somewhat prevented inappropriate hippocampal changes of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein carbonyl, nitrite, superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 6 (IL 6), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, beta secretase 1 (BACE 1) activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) with no significant effect on glutathione (GSH), catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and myeloperoxidase (MPO). In addition, lower reactivity (IRA) for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as an index of astrocyte activity was observed and loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons was attenuated following sinomenine treatment. This study demonstrated that sinomenine could lessen TMT-induced cognitive dysfunction which is partly due to its attenuation of hippocampal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

AB  - COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has rapidly spread globally causing hundreds of millions of infections and over two million deaths. The potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown, however sequence analysis has provided plausible potential candidate species. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enable its entry into host cells and establish infection. We analyzed the binding surface of ACE2 from several important animal species to begin to understand the parameters for the ACE2 recognition by the SARSCoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We employed Shannon entropy analysis to determine the variability of ACE2 across its sequence and particularly in its RBD interacting region, and assessed differences between various species' ACE2 and human ACE2. Recombinant ACE2 from human, hamster, horseshoe bat, cat, ferret, and cow were evaluated for RBD binding. A gradient of binding affinities were seen where human and hamster ACE2 were similarly in the low nanomolar range, followed by cat and cow. Surprisingly, horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) and ferret (Mustela putorius) ACE2s had poor binding activity compared with the other species' ACE2. The residue differences and binding properties between the species' variants provide a framework for understanding ACE2-RBD binding and virus tropism. http://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/478/19/3671/921960/bcj-2020-0908.pdf by

AB  - Stem cells in adult mammalian tissues are held in a reversible resting state, known as quiescence, for prolonged periods of time. Recent studies have greatly increased our understanding of the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes that underlie stem cell quiescence. However, the transcription factor code that actively maintains the quiescence program remains poorly defined. Similarly, alternative splicing events affecting transcription factors in stem cell quiescence have been overlooked. Here we show that the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor LEF1, a central player in canonical beta-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling, undergoes alternative splicing and switches isoforms in quiescent neural stem cells. We found that active beta-catenin and its partner LEF1 accumulated in quiescent hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cell (Q-NSPC) cultures. Accordingly, Q-NSPCs showed enhanced TCF/LEF1-driven transcription and a basal Wnt activity that conferred a functional advantage to the cultured cells in a Wnt-dependent assay. At a mechanistic level, we found a fine regulation of Lef1 gene expression. The coordinate upregulation of Lef1 transcription and retention of alternative spliced exon 6 (E6) led to the accumulation of a full-length protein isoform (LEF1-FL) that displayed increased stability in the quiescent state. Prospectively isolated GLAST + cells from the postnatal hippocampus also underwent E6 retention at the time quiescence is established in vivo. Interestingly, LEF1 motif was enriched in quiescence-associated enhancers of genes upregulated in Q-NSPCs and quiescence-related NFIX transcription factor motifs flanked the LEF1 binding sites. We further show that LEF1 interacts with NFIX and identify putative LEF1/NFIX targets. Together, our results uncover an unexpected role for LEF1 in gene regulation in quiescent NSPCs, and highlight alternative splicing as a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in the transition from stem cell activation to quiescence.

AB  - Cyberbullying is a remarkable issue in the Arabic-speaking world, affecting children, organizations, and businesses. Various efforts have been made to combat this problem through proposed models using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches utilizing natural language processing (NLP) methods and by proposing relevant datasets. However, most of these endeavors focused predominantly on the English language, leaving a substantial gap in addressing Arabic cyberbullying. Given the complexities of the Arabic language, transfer learning techniques and transformers present a promising approach to enhance the detection and classification of abusive content by leveraging large and pretrained models that use a large dataset. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid model using transformers trained on extensive Arabic datasets. It then fine-tunes the hybrid model on a newly curated Arabic cyberbullying dataset collected from social media platforms, in particular Twitter. Additionally, the following two hybrid transformer models are introduced: the first combines CAmelid Morphologically-aware pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (CAMeLBERT) with Arabic Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (AraGPT2) and the second combines Arabic BERT (AraBERT) with Cross-lingual Language Model RoBERTa (XLM-R). Two strategies, namely, feature fusion and ensemble voting, are employed to improve the model performance accuracy. Experimental results, measured through precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and Area Under the Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC), demonstrate that the combined CAMeLBERT and AraGPT2 models using feature fusion outperformed traditional DL models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), as well as other independent Arabic-based transformer models.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate, through in vivo and biochemical methodologies, the effect of trans,trans-farnesol (12.5, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg, p.o.) acute administration, adopting different behavioral and neurochemical parameters associated with an acute induced-depression model in mice. The initial results showed that, the oral treatment with trans,trans-farnesol, at the dose of 100 mg/kg induced a possible antidepressant-like effect in animals subjected to forced swim test (FST) and reserpine-induced akinesia. In addition, it was observed that the compound in question has an effect size and properties similar to imipramine (prototype of tricyclic antidepressants), but devoid of proconvulsant adverse effect. In biochemical assays, the pretreatment with trans,transfarnesol, at a dose of 100 mg/kg (p.o.), decreased the hippocampal concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and restored striatal levels of noradrenaline and serotonin in mice subjected to FST. Altogether, these results suggest that trans,trans-farnesol showed a significant antidepressant-like effect, which seems to be mediated by the antagonism of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, reduction of oxidative stress and the modulation of noradrenaline and serotonin content in the central nervous system.

AB  - Non-clustered protocadherins (ncPcdhs) are adhesive molecules with spatio-temporally regulated overlapping expression in the developing nervous system. Although their unique role in neurogenesis has been widely studied, their combinatorial role in brain physiology and pathology is poorly understood. Using probabilistic cell typing by in situ sequencing, we demonstrate combinatorial inter- and intra-familial expression of ncPcdhs in the developing mouse cortex and hippocampus, at single-cell resolution. We discovered the combinatorial expression of Protocadherin-19 (Pcdh19), a protein involved in PCDH19-clustering epilepsy, with Pcdh1, Pcdh9 or Cadherin 13 (Cdh13) in excitatory neurons. Using aggregation assays, we demonstrate a code-specific adhesion function of PCDH19; mosaic PCDH19 absence in PCDH19+9 and PCDH19 + CDH13, but not in PCDH19+1 codes, alters cell-cell interaction. Interestingly, we found that PCDH19 as a dominant protein in two heterophilic adhesion codes could promote trans-interaction between them. In addition, we discovered increased CDH13-mediated cell adhesion in the presence of PCDH19, suggesting a potential role of PCDH19 as an adhesion mediator of CDH13. Finally, we demonstrated novel cis-interactions between PCDH19 and PCDH1, PCDH9 and CDH13. These observations suggest that there is a unique combinatorial code with a cell- and region-specific characteristic where a single molecule defines the heterophilic cell-cell adhesion properties of each code.

AB  - Raw milk is one of the most important vehicles for transmitting various pathogens, especially Escherichia coli (E. coli). Multidrug-resistant pathogens are highly prevalent among mastitic cows in various dairy farms worldwide. Therefore, our current study is based on the identification of E. coli from mastitic cow's milk and their resistance to various antibacterial agents. As well, the impact of camel's urine on multi-drug resistant E. coli were also evaluated. Thirty-three E. coli isolates were recovered from 254 milk samples. All strains were initially identified phenotypically by culturing on specific media and Vitek 2 Compact System. The protein fingerprinting technique was used as a confirmatory method. The Stx1,Stx2 and eae genes were also verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The antimicrobial resistance of E. coli strains was tested by the Vitek 2 AST-GN69 cards. Thirty multi-drug resistant E. coli strains (20 from mastitic milk and 10 from clinical samples) were laboratory tested with different concentrations (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%) of virgin and breeding camel's urine, using the paper disc diffusion method. Our findings showed that 93.94% of E. coli strains were recognized by the Vitek (TM) 2 system. The results of proteomic investigation illustrated that 100% of E. coli strains were identified at log values >= 2.00. The genotypic identification of the three virulence genes illustrated that 90.1%, 63.64%, and 30.55% of E. coli strains were able to carry the Stx1, eae, and Stx2 genes, respectively. Most strains of E. coli showed strong resistance against cefazolin (78.79%), ceftazidime (66.67%), cefotaxime (60.61%), ceftriaxone (54.55%), and cefepime (39.40%). The results of the antibacterial effect of camel's urine revealed that the mean inhibitory zones of virgin camel's urine were 28 mm, 17 mm, and 14 mm, for the concentrations of 100%, 75%, and 50%, respectively. Whereas; the inhibitory zones for the breeding camel's urine were 18 mm, 0 mm, and 0 mm, for the concentrations of 100%, 75%, and 50%, respectively. We concluded that the majority of E. coli strains were able to harbor some virulence genes and resist many antibiotics. Our study also provided a robust evidence that the camel's urine, particularly from the virgin camels has robust antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant E. coli strains.

AB  - The accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides is a crucial factor in the neuronal degeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study investigated the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms of shrimp shell extract (SSE) and liposome-encapsulated SSE (SSE/L) against A beta 1-42-induced neuronal damage and death in rats. Intracerebroventricular infusion of A beta 1-42 effectively induced memory decline, as observed in a reduction of the rat's discriminating ability in the novel object recognition and novel object location tasks. Oral pretreatment with 100 mg/kg of SSE demonstrated no preventive effect on the memory decline induced by A beta 1-42 infusion. However, treatment with SSE/L 100 mg/kg BW effectively attenuated memory deficits in both behavioral assessments following two and four weeks after A beta 1-42 infusion. Moreover, SSE/L exerted neuroprotective effects by reducing lipid peroxidation and increasing Nrf2/HO-1 expression. There was a significant decrease in Iba1 and GFAP (biomarkers of microglia and astrocyte activity, respectively), as well as a decrease in the levels of NF-kappa B expression and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the cortical and hippocampal tissues. Treatment with SSE/L also reduced the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 while raising the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. In addition, the beneficial effects of SSE/L were along with the effects of a positive control commercial astaxanthin (AST). The findings of this study indicated that SSE/L provided neuroprotective effects on A beta 1-42-induced AD rats by ameliorating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptotic cell death. Therefore, SSE/L might be employed to prevent and mitigate A beta accumulation-induced neurotoxicity in AD.

AB  - Hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy results from the interruption of oxygen delivery and blood flow to the brain. In the developing brain, it can lead to a brain injury, which is associated with high mortality rates and comorbidities. The hippocampus is one of the brain regions that may be affected by hypoxia-ischemia with consequences on cognition. Unfortunately, clinically approved therapeutics are still scarce and limited. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to test three repurposed drugs with good pharmacological properties to evaluate if they can revert, or at least attenuate, the deleterious effects of hypoxia-ischemia in an in vitro model. Edaravone, perampanel, and metformin are used for the treatment of stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, some forms of epileptic status, and diabetes type 2, respectively. Through cell viability assays, morphology analysis, and detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in two different cell lines (HT-22 and SH-SY5Y), we found that edaravone and low concentrations of perampanel are able to attenuate cell damage induced by hypoxia and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Metformin did not attenuate hypoxic-induced events, at least in the initial phase. Among these repurposed drugs, edaravone emerged as the most efficient in the attenuation of events induced by hypoxia-ischemia, and the safest, since it did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity, even in high concentrations, and induced a decrease in ROS. Our results also reinforce the view that ROS and overexcitation play an important role in the pathophysiology of hypoxia-ischemia brain injury.

Preliminary intermittent hypoxia training alleviates the damage of sustained normobaric hypoxia on human hematological indexes and cerebral white matter. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2022.Study Objectives: We aimed to examine the effects of preliminary intermittent hypoxia training (IHT) on human hematological indexes and cerebral white matter (WM) after exposure to a simulated altitude of 4,300 m.Methods: We recruited 20 young healthy volunteers. Participants were then randomized to either the IHT group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). We measured the physiological function of the control group at sea level and after exposure to a simulated altitude of 4,300 m, respectively. The IHT group performed the above tests at three time points: before and after hypoxia training, and after exposure to a simulated altitude of 4,300 m, respectively.Results: We found that mean SpO(2) during day 10 of hypoxia training showed a significant increase compared with mean SpO(2) on day 1 (88.3% +/- 1.5% vs. 90.0% +/- 1.6%, p < 0.05), and erythrocyte P-50 of post-training was significantly increased compared with pretraining (37.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg vs. 45.9 +/- 6.4 mmHg, p < 0.05). Mean SpO(2) measures after acute exposure to high altitude exhibited a significant difference, with the IHT group showing significantly greater SpO(2) than the control group (73.8% +/- 3.7% vs. 77.4% +/- 3.2%, p < 0.05), and the Lake Louise Score was also lower than the control group (2.55 +/- 2.1 vs. 6.67 +/- 2.5, p < 0.05). After daily IHT, brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasma levels of participants in the IHT group did not change but significantly increased in response to high-altitude hypoxia (103.5% +/- 70.4% vs. 29.7% +/- 73.2%, p < 0.05). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plasma level did not change before and after IHT in the IHT group, whereas the IL-10 plasma level of the control group after high-altitude exposure was significantly higher. Furthermore, we found that fractional anisotropy values in the left corticospinal tract and splenium of the corpus callosum in the IHT group were significantly higher than those in the control group after high-altitude hypoxia.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that IHT alleviates the damage of sustained normobaric hypoxia on human hematological indexes and cerebral WM.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Compound Zaoren Granules (CZG), an optimized herbal formulation based on the traditional Chinese medicine prescription Suanzaoren decoction, are designed specifically for insomnia treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying its efficacy in treating insomnia are not yet fully understood. Aim of the study: The research investigated the mechanisms of CZG's improvement in insomnia by regulating cAMP/CREB signaling pathway and metabolic profiles. Methods: The main components of CZG were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Subsequently, these validated components were applied to network pharmacological analysis to predict signaling pathways associated with insomnia. We evaluated the effect of CZG on BV-2 cells in vitro. We also evaluated the behavioral indexes of CUMS combined with PCPA induced insomnia in rats. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to observe the pathological damage of hippocampus. ELISA was used to detect the levels of various neurotransmitters, orexins, HPA axis, and inflammatory factors in insomnia rats. Then we detected the expression of cAMP/CREB signaling pathway through ELISA, WB, and IHC. Finally, the metabolomics was further analyzed by using UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS to investigate the changes in the hippocampus of insomnia rats and the possible metabolic pathways were also speculated. Results: The results of CZG in vitro experiments showed that CZG has protective and anti-inflammatory effects on LPS induced BV-2 cells. A total of 161 chemical components were identified in CZG. After conducting network pharmacology analysis through these confirmed components, we select the cAMP/CREB signaling pathway for further investigate. The behavioral research results on insomnia rats showed that CZG significantly prolonged sleep time, mitigated brain tissue pathological damage, and exhibited liver protective properties. CZG treats insomnia by regulating the content of various neurotransmitters, reducing levels of orexin, HPA axis, and inflammatory factors. It can also treat insomnia by upregulating the expression of the cAMP/CREB signaling pathway. Hippocampus metabolomics analysis identified 69 differential metabolites associated with insomnia. The metabolic pathways related to these differential metabolites have also been predicted. Conclusion: These results indicate that CZG can significantly prolong sleep time. CZG is used to treat insomnia by regulating various neurotransmitters, HPA axis, inflammatory factors, cAMP/CREB signaling pathways, and metabolic disorders.

AB  - With age, protein damage accumulates and increases the risk of age-related diseases. The proteasome activator PA28 alpha beta is involved in protein damage clearance during early embryogenesis and has demonstrated protective effects against proteinopathy. We have recently discovered that adult female mice overexpressing PA28 alpha (PA28 alpha OE) have enhanced learning and memory, and protein extracts from their hippocampi prevent aggregation more efficiently than wild type. In this study, we investigated the effect of overexpressing PA28 alpha on aging using C57BL/6NxBALB/c F2 hybrid mice. We found that the hippocampal anti-aggregation effect was maintained in young adult (7 months) to middle-aged (15 months) and old (22 months) PA28 alpha OE females. While the PA28 alpha OE influence on learning and memory gradually decreased with aging, old PA28 alpha OE females did not display the typical drop in explorative behavior-a behavioral hallmark of aging-but were as explorative as young mice. PA28 alpha OE lowered PA28-dependent proteasome capacity in both heart and hippocampus, and there was no indication of lower protein damage load in PA28 alpha OE. The life span of PA28 alpha OE was also similar to wild type. In both wild type and PA28 alpha OE, PA28-dependent proteasome capacity increased with aging in the heart, while 26S and 20S proteasome capacities were unchanged in the timepoints analyzed. Thus, PA28 alpha OE females exhibit improved hippocampal ability to prevent aggregation throughout life and enhanced cognitive capabilities with different behavioral outcomes dependent on age; improved memory at early age and a youth-like exploration at old age. The cognitive effects of PA28 alpha beta combined with its anti-aggregation molecular effect highlight the therapeutical potential of PA28 alpha beta in combating proteinopathies.

AB  - In vivo neuroimaging studies have established several reproducible volumetric sex differences in the human brain, but the causes of such differences are hard to parse. While mouse models are useful for understanding the cellular and mechanistic bases of sex-specific brain development, there have been no attempts to formally compare human and mouse neuroanatomical sex differences to ascertain how well they translate. Addressing this question would shed critical light on the use of the mouse as a translational model for sex differences in the human brain and provide insights into the degree to which sex differences in brain volume are conserved across mammals. Here, we use structural magnetic resonance imaging to conduct the first comparative neuroimaging study of sex-specific neuroanatomy of the human and mouse brain. In line with previous findings, we observe that in humans, males have significantly larger and more variable total brain volume; these sex differences are not mirrored in mice. After controlling for total brain volume, we observe modest cross-species congruence in the volumetric effect size of sex across 60 homologous regions (r=0.30). This cross-species congruence is greater in the cortex (r=0.33) than non-cortex (r=0.16). By incorporating regional measures of gene expression in both species, we reveal that cortical regions with greater cross-species congruence in volumetric sex differences also show greater cross-species congruence in the expression profile of 2835 homologous genes. This phenomenon differentiates primary sensory regions with high congruence of sex effects and gene expression from limbic cortices where congruence in both these features was weaker between species. These findings help identify aspects of sex-biased brain anatomy present in mice that are retained, lost, or inverted in humans. More broadly, our work provides an empirical basis for targeting mechanistic studies of sex-specific brain development in mice to brain regions that best echo sex-specific brain development in humans.

AB  - The present work shows the biochemical and structural fundamentals for the stress induced anxiety and stress adjustment response of the CA3 hippocampus area. Adult male Wistar rats were repeatedly exposed to a 3 h day restraint stress, for either 3 or 6 days. The concentration of corticosterone and testosterone in the CA3 hippocampus area was divergent, while oxidative stress was progressively increased during the stress exposure. The mitochondrial lysis in the CA3 neurons confirmed the oxidative stress events. Immunohistochemical findings showed that oligodendrocytes (OCs) proliferation and neuroglobin (Ngb) expression were stimulated, whereas MeCP2 expression was decreased as a balance reaction in stress exposure under corticosterone signaling. Remarkably, ultrastructural changes such as mitochondrial lysis, endoplasmic reticulum swelling, and perivascular lysis with platelets adherence to endothelium in the CA3 area were seen in the 6th day of restraining. The anxiety-like behavior was noticed 6 days later after stress exposure. These results suggest that the duration of the exposure, but not the intensity of the stress, is the key factor in the stress-buffering function by the CA3 hippocampus area via up-regulation of the Ngb-OCs bionome. The imbalance of the Ngb-OCs communication may be involved in the development of CA3-dependent anxious behavior.

AB  - Major depressive disorder has become an increasingly serious disease in the world. However, convenient antidepressants have low efficacy and slow onset defects, which is dangerous for suicidal tendency patients. Nowadays, rapid antidepressant research has become the focus. Merazin hydrate (MH), a component of the natural herb Fructus Aurantii, has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, the mechanism of its rapid antidepressant-like effects was still elusive like that of ketamine. The study aimed to reveal the relationship between the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH and mTOR signaling, which is closely related to rapid antidepressants. The results showed that a single administration of MH was capable of reversing the behavioral defects at 2 h in two classic depressive models including learned helplessness (LH) and chronic mild stress (CMS). Moreover, the phosphorylated expression of mTOR, reduced by LH or CMS, was upregulated after a single administration of MH, and the expressions of BDNF and synaptic proteins in the hippocampus were also reversed 2 h later, similar to ketamine. Moreover, LH increased the expressions of eNOS, IL-10, and TNF-alpha in serum, which were all reversed by a single dose of MH at 2 h, similar to ketamine. Furthermore, we used rapamycin, an antagonist of mTOR, to confirm whether the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH depend on mTOR or not. We found that inhibiting the activation of mTOR blocked the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH, which also inhibited the upregulation of expressions of BDNF and PSD95. To sum up, the rapid antidepressant effect of MH depended on the activation of mTOR to regulate downstream BNDF and synaptic protein expressions.

AB  - The interaction of Rabphilin-3A (Rph3A) with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in hippocampal neurons plays a pivotal role in the synaptic retention of this receptor. The formation of a Rph3A/NMDAR complex is needed for the induction of long-term potentiation and NMDAR-dependent hippocampal behaviors, such as spatial learning. Moreover, Rph3A can also interact with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) through the formation of a complex with myosin Va. Here, we used a confocal imaging approach to show that Rph3A overexpression in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures is sufficient to promote increased dendritic spine density. This morphological event is correlated with an increase in GluN2A-containing NMDARs at synaptic membranes and a decrease in the surface levels of GluA1-containing AMPARs. These molecular and morphological modifications of dendritic spines are sufficient to occlude the spine formation induced by long-term potentiation, but do not prevent the spine loss induced by long-term depression. Overall, our results demonstrate a key role for Rph3A in the modulation of structural synaptic plasticity at hippocampal synapses that correlates with its interactions with both NMDARs and AMPARs.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) is characterized by tissue repair/remodeling and the subepithelial stroma region in whose nasal mucosa has been reported by us to have thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) prostanoid (TP) receptor and overexpress connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between TP receptor activation and CTGF production/function in human CRSsNP nasal mucosa stromal fibroblasts. We found that TP agonists including U46619 and IBOP ([1S-[1 alpha,2 alpha(Z),3 beta(1E,3 S*),4 alpha]]-7-[3-[3-hydroxy-4-(4-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid) could promote CTGF protein/messenger RNA expression and secretion. The pharmacological intervention and TP activation assay with U46619 identified the possible participation of PKC mu, PKC delta, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation/activation in the CTGF induction. Moreover, a phorbol ester-phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) exhibited a similar cellular signaling and CTGF production profile to that elicited by TP activation. However, further small interfering RNA interference analysis revealed that only NF-kappa B and PKC delta-CREB pathways were necessarily required for TP-mediated CTGF production, which could not be completely supported by those findings from PMA. Finally, in a functional assay, although CTGF did not affect fibroblast proliferation, TP-mediated CTGF could drive novel self-migration in fibroblasts both in the scratch/wound healing and transwell apparatus assays. Meanwhile, the overall staining for stress fibers and formation of the lamellipodia and filopodia-like structures was concomitantly increased in the treated migrating cells. Collectively, we provided here that novel TP mediates CTGF production and self-migration in human nasal fibroblasts through NF-kappa B and PKC delta-CREB signaling pathways. More importantly, we also demonstrated that thromboxane, TP receptor, CTGF, and stromal fibroblasts may act in concert in the tissue remodeling/repair process during CRSsNP development and progression.

AB  - Circadian rhythm disruptions have been implicated in numerous health issues, including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer disease (AD). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vital for neuronal plasticity and cognitive function, is regulated by the circadian clock and exerts protective effects against AD. Thus, we investigated the impact of circadian rhythm disorders (CRDs) on cognitive impairment and explored the underlying neurobiological mechanisms by assessing BDNF and amyloid-beta (A beta) levels. We divided male C57BL/6 mice into three groups (n = 30): a control group (normal 12/12 hour light-dark cycle) and two CRD model groups (3/3 and 22/22 hour cycles, respectively). After 12 weeks, we assessed cognitive functions using the Morris water maze. Following behavioral tests, hippocampal levels of BDNF and A beta were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. CRDs significantly impaired learning and memory, as evidenced by longer times to reach and find the platform in the CRD groups (p < 0.01). Furthermore, BDNF levels were notably decreased and A beta levels increased in the CRD groups compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Thus, CRDs elicit cognitive impairment by reducing BDNF levels and increasing A beta deposition in the hippocampus.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone that plays a dual role: it regulates erythropoiesis and works as a neuroprotector, the synthesis of which is activated by brain cells in response to hypoxia. Several clinical trials showed that administration of EPO against anemia caused the improvement of cognitive brain functions, however the mechanisms of this action have not yet been characterized. Recently, the usage of Carbamylated darbepoetin (CdEpo), which is neuroprotective but lacks hematopoietic activity and has a more prolonged half-life, has become an attractive tool. The influence of administration of 100 ng/mL CdEpo on the activity and ultrastructural organization of mature hippocampal cultures in normoxic conditions was assessed. It was found that the application of CdEpo in normoxic conditions causes a negative neurotropic influence on neuronal activity that was measured via calcium imaging. Calcium imaging data revealed that CdEpo caused a decrease in the frequency of calcium oscillations; however, the duration of calcium events slightly increased. The decrease in neuronal activity upon administration of CdEpo coincided with compartment-dependent ultrastructural changes. In axons, there was an increase in total mitochondrial area with a decrease in mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum contact surface, and in neuronal soma, there was an increase in the surface of intermitochondrial contacts.

AB  - Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a key regulator of centriole biogenesis, has recently been shown to play key roles in tumorigenesis. Blocking PLK4 expression by interference or targeted drugs exhibits attractive potential in improving the efficacy of chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the role of PLK4 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is still undefined. In this study, we discover that PLK4 is a potential target for the treatment of DLBCL, and demonstrate the efficacy of a PLK4 inhibitor when used in combination with doxorubicin. Pharmaceutical inhibition of PLK4 with CFI-400945 inhibited DLBCL cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death. The anti-tumor effects were accompanied by mitotic defects, including polyploidy and cytokinesis failure. Activation of p53 and Hippo/YAP tumor suppressor signaling pathway was identified as the potential mechanisms driving CFI-400945 activity. Moreover, CFI-400945 treatment resulted in activation of DNA damage response. Combining CFI-400945 with doxorubicin markedly delayed tumor progression in DLBCL xenografts. Finally, PLK4 was increased in primary DLBCL tissues and cell lines. High levels of PLK4 expression were associated with poor survival in the patients receiving CHOP-based treatment, implicating PLK4 as a predictive biomarker of DLBCL chemosensitivity. These results provide the therapeutic potential of CFI-400945 both as monotherapy or in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of DLBCL.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a complex disease resulting from aberrant synaptic plasticity that may be caused by abnormal serotonergic signaling. Using a combination of behavioral, biochemical, and imaging methods, we analyze 5-HT7R/MMP-9 signaling and dendritic spine plasticity in the hippocampus in mice treated with the selective 5-HT7R agonist (LP-211) and in a model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)induced depressive-like behavior. We show that acute 5-HT7R activation induces depressive-like behavior in mice in an MMP-9-dependent manner and that post mortem brain samples from human individuals with depression reveal increased MMP-9 enzymatic activity in the hippocampus. Both pharmacological activation of 5-HT7R and modulation of its downstream effectors as a result of CUS lead to dendritic spine elongation and decreased spine density in this region. Overall, the 5-HT7R/MMP-9 pathway is specifically activated in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus during chronic stress and is crucial for inducing depressive-like behavior.

AB  - Aim of the study was to optimize and produce beta-mannanase at fermenter scale by using cheaper minimal media. Increased production of beta-mannanase from Microbacterium camelliasinensis CIAB417 was achieved by heterologous expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The scale-up production of beta-mannanase was optimized from shake flask to 5-L fermenter. The cost-effective minimal media (M9 +e) without any vitamins was found to be most effective and optimized for culturing the cells. The same media displayed no significant fluctuation in the pH while culturing the cells for the production of beta-mannanase both at shake flask and fermenter level. Additionally, E. coli cells were able to produce similar amount of dry cell weight and recombinant betamannanase both in the presence of micro and macro-oxygen environment. The optimized media was demonstrated to show no significant drop in pH throughout the recombinant protein production process. In one litre medium, 2.0314 g dry weight of E. coli cells yielded 1.8 g of purified recombinant beta-mannanase. The purified enzyme was lyophilized and demonstrated to hydrolyse locust bean gum to release mannooligosaccharides.

AB  - Gastrointestinal symptoms are common health problems found during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Trimethyltin-induced rat is known as an animal model of hippocampal degeneration with no data on enteric neurodegeneration. This study aimed to investigate the effect of trimethyltin (TMT) induction on the gastrointestinal tract. A 28-day animal study with male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 months old, 150-200 g) given a single TMT injection (8 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) was conducted. The number of neurons in the colonic myenteric plexus was measured using stereological estimation. Histological scoring of colon inflammation, immunohistochemistry of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and quantitative PCR were conducted. This study showed neuronal loss in the colonic myenteric plexus of TMT-induced rat model of neurodegeneration. Minor colon inflammation characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and slightly higher expression of TNF-a in the colon mucosa were observed in the TMT-induced rat. However, the gut microbiota composition of the TMT-induced rat was not different from that of the control rats. This study demonstrates that TMT induces colonic myenteric plexus neurodegeneration and minor colon inflammation, which suggests the potential of this animal model to elucidate the communication between the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - During development, neurons achieve a stereotyped neuron typespecific morphology, which relies on dynamic support by microtubules (MTs). An important player is the augmin complex (hereafter augmin), which binds to existing MT filaments and recruits the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC), to form branched MTs. In cultured neurons, augmin is important for neurite formation. However, little is known about the role of augmin during neurite formation in vivo. Here, we have revisited the role of mammalian augmin in culture and then turned towards the class four Drosophila dendritic arborization (c4da) neurons. We show that MT density is maintained through augmin in cooperation with the gamma-TuRC in vivo. Mutant c4da neurons show a reduction of newly emerging higher-order dendritic branches and in turn also a reduced number of their characteristic space-filling higher-order branchlets. Taken together, our data reveal a cooperative function for augmin with the gamma-TuRC in forming enough MTs needed for the appropriate differentiation of morphologically complex dendrites in vivo.

AB  - Objective: The specific purpose of this study is to investigate the impact exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AMSC) has on non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and the relative applications. Methods: circ_100395, miR-141-3p, and LATS2 were expressed and detected in NSCLC and paracancerous tissues as well as NSCLC cell lines. Pearson correlation analysis, Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay and RNA pull-down assay were used to validate their expression and interaction, respectively. After isolation and culture of AMSCs, exosomes were extracted and identified. EdU, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cell colony formation assay were used to distinguish the biological activity of the cells. Expression Hippo/YAP signalling pathway-related proteins were measured by western blotting. Subsequently, tumour volume and weight were confirmed based on xenograft nude mice models, Ki-67 and LATS2 expression was observed by immunohistochemistry. Results: circ_100395 was lowly expressed in NSCLC tissues or cells. The negative correlations and interactions were confirmed between circ_100395 and miR-141-3p, miR-141-3p, and LATS2. AMSC-derived exosomes with overexpression of circ_100395 (exo-circ_100395) significantly inhibited the biological activity as well as EMT of H1650 cells and Hippo/YAP signalling pathway activity. In addition, exo-circ_100395 markedly reduced tumour volume and weight as well as Ki-67 and LASP1 expression in vivo. However, overexpressed miR-141-3p or knocked down LATS2 alleviated the above effects. Conclusion: Exo-circ_100395 can increase LATS2 expression by sponging miR-141-3p to regulate Hippo/YAP signalling pathway, thereby inhibiting NSCLC malignant transformation.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides L. is a deciduous shrub that contains many unique bioactive substances. This sea buckthorn possesses anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular protective properties. Herein, the effects of phenylpropyl compounds extracted from H. rhamnoides L. on doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity were evaluated in zebrafish. Cardiac injury in zebrafish was induced using 35 mu M Dox for 96 h, and 30 mu M phenylpropanoid compounds were used as the protective treatment. The cardioprotective effects and mechanisms of the four phenylpropanoids were investigated using microscopy, behavioral analysis, acridine orange staining, western blotting, flow cytometry, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The extracted phenylpropanoids could significantly relieve Dox-induced cardiac injury in zebrafish and inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The mechanisms of action were mainly related to the stability of mitochondrial biogenesis and function maintained by phenylpropanoids in zebrafish. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the protective effect of sea buckthorn against myocardial injury in zebrafish. Our findings provide support for the further research and development of sea buckthorn and its components.

AB  - Human genetic and animal model studies indicate that brain microglial inflammation is a primary driver of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Inflammasome-activated Caspase-1 (Casp1) is associated with both AD microglial inflammation and neuronal degeneration. In mice, Casp1 genetic ablation or VX-765 small molecule inhibition of Casp1 given at onset of cognitive deficits strongly supports the association between microglial inflammation and cognitive impairment. Here, VX-765 significantly improved episodic and spatial memory impairment eight months after the onset of cognitive impairment in aged AD mice with significant amyloid beta peptide (A beta) accumulation and microglial inflammation. Unexpectedly, while cognitive improvement was associated with dendritic spine density and hippocampal synaptophysin level recovery, VX-765 only slightly decreased A beta deposition and did not alter biochemically-measured A beta levels. Furthermore, increased hippocampal Iba1(+)-microglia, GFAP(+)-astrocytes, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha levels were unaltered by VX-765. These results support the hypothesis that neuronal degeneration, not A beta or microglial inflammation, drives cognitive impairment in AD.

AB  - Lin28a is an RNA binding protein and increasing evidence has indicated its role in regulating female fertility. Lin28a has been reported to be involved in ovarian follicle activation. However, its role and mechanisms in regulating primordial follicle activation have not yet been explored. To test whether overexpression of Lin28a activates ovarian primordial follicles, studies were conducted in wild type (WT) and Lin28a Tg mice. Female Lin28a Tg mice at 4-month old exhibited significantly smaller litter size and fewer ovulated oocytes when compared with the WT mice. By 6-month of age, these parameters in Lin28a Tg mice were less than 20% of the WT mice. At postnatal day (PD) 14, the number of primordial follicles was significantly decreased but the number of primary follicles was significantly increased in the transgenic mice. The number of primordial follicles, secondary and antral follicles in these mice were drastically reduced at PD21. In the ovary of Lin28a Tg mice, there were activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and its downstream mTOR pathway. Interestingly, overexpression of Lin28a, which can also act as transcriptional activator, activated Wnt signaling through enhancing the transcription of Wnt co-receptor LRP5. In conclusion, overexpression of Lin28a induced a primary ovarian insufficiency phenotype in long term via facilitating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling leading to activation of primordial follicles.

AB  - Stressful life events are considered major risk factors for the development of several psychiatric disorders, though people differentially cope with stress. The reasons for this are still largely unknown but could be accounted for by individual genetic variants, previous life events, or the kind of stressors. The human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met variant, which was found to impair intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, has been associated with increased susceptibility to develop several neuropsychiatric disorders, although there is still some controversial evidence. On the other hand, acute stress has been consistently demonstrated to promote the release of glutamate in cortico-limbic regions and altered glutamatergic transmission has been reported in psychiatric disorders. However, it is not known if the BDNF Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affects the stress-induced presynaptic glutamate release. In this study, we exposed adult male BDNFVal/Val and BDNFVal/Met knock-in mice to 30 min of acute restraint stress. Plasma corticosterone levels, glutamate release, protein, and gene expression in the hippocampus were analyzed immediately after the end of the stress session. Acute restraint stress similarly increased plasma corticosterone levels and nuclear glucocorticoid receptor levels and phosphorylation in both BDNFVal/Val and BDNFVal/Met mice. However, acute restraint stress induced higher increases in hippocampal presynaptic release of glutamate, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), and levels of the immediate early gene c-fos of BDNFVal/Met compared to BFNFVal/Val mice. Moreover, acute restraint stress selectively increased phosphorylation levels of synapsin I at Ser(9) and at Ser(603) in BDNFVal/Val and BDNFVal/Met mice, respectively. In conclusion, we report here that the BDNF Val66Met SNP knock-in mice display an altered response to acute restraint stress in terms of hippocampal glutamate release, CREB phosphorylation, and neuronal activation, compared to wild-type animals. Taken together, these results could partially explain the enhanced vulnerability to stressful events of Met carriers reported in both preclinical and clinical studies.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that both CS and LiCl possess anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activities. We prepared chondroitin sulfate-Li (CS-Li) and investigated its effect on AD and explored the possible mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo. We found that CS-Li could inhibit amyloid beta (A beta) aggregation and protect SH-SY5Y cells from A beta(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. In D-gal and AlCl3-induced AD mouse model, CS-Li improves the spatial learning and memory abilities of AD mice, reverses the nuclear pyknosis and cell edema, and increases the survival rate of neurons in hippocampus of mice. Moreover, CS-Li significantly increased the levels of GSH-Px, Na+/K+-ATPase, and ChAT and decreased the levels of MDA and AchE in AD mice. Western blot results demonstrated that CS-Li could decrease the hyperphosphorylation of tau (Ser396/Ser404) by regulating the expression of p-GSK-3 beta (Ser9) and PP2A and inhibit the expression of proinflammatory factors through inhibiting NF-kappa B nuclear translocation by activating the MAPK signaling pathways. In a word, CS-Li can delay AD development through multitarget processes, including A beta aggregation inhibition, oxidative stress damage, tau hyperphosphorylation, and inflammatory response, thereby improves learning and memory abilities.

AB  - Deep reinforcement learning is one of the research hotspots in artificial intelligence and has been successfully applied in many research areas; however, the low training efficiency and high demand for samples are problems that limit the application. Inspired by the rapid learning mechanisms of the hippocampus, to address these problems, a hierarchical episodic control model extending episodic memory to the domain of hierarchical reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper. The model is theoretically justified and employs a hierarchical implicit memory planning approach for counterfactual trajectory value estimation. Starting from the final step and recursively moving back along the trajectory, a hidden plan is formed within the episodic memory. Experience is aggregated both along trajectories and across trajectories, and the model is updated using a multi-headed backpropagation similar to bootstrapped neural networks. This model extends the parameterized episodic memory framework to the realm of hierarchical reinforcement learning and is theoretically analyzed to demonstrate its convergence and effectiveness. Experiments conducted in four-room games, Mujoco, and UE4-based active tracking highlight that the hierarchical episodic control model effectively enhances training efficiency. It demonstrates notable improvements in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional environments, even in cases of sparse rewards. This model can enhance the training efficiency of reinforcement learning and is suitable for application scenarios that do not rely heavily on exploration, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, robot control, computer vision applications, and so on.

AB  - We isolated and characterized Limosilactobacillus reuteri PSC102 and evaluated its probiotic, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties. We preliminarily isolated 154 candidates from pig feces and analyzed their Gram nature, morphology, and lactic acid production ability. Based on the results, we selected eight isolates and tested their ability to produce digestive enzymes. Finally, we identified one isolate using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, namely, L. reuteri PSC102. We tested its probiotic properties in vitro, including extracellular enzyme activities, low pH and bile salt tolerance, autoaggregation and coaggregation abilities, adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antibiotic susceptibility, and hemolytic and gelatinase activities. Antioxidant activity was determined using 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical scavenging and reducing power assays. The antibacterial activity of this strain and its culture supernatant against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were evaluated using a time-kill assay and disk diffusion method, respectively. L. reuteri PSC102 exhibited tolerance toward low pH and bile salt and did not produce harmful enzymes or possess hemolytic and gelatinase activities.

AB  - Combination drug therapy has become an effective strategy to control inflammation. Lipophilic grape seed proanthocyanidin (LGSP) and camellia oil (CO) have been independently investigated to show anti-inflammatory effects, but their synergistic anti-inflammatory effects are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic anti-inflammatory effects of LGSP and CO. The anti-inflammatory activity of LGSP and CO individual or in combination on RAW264.7 cells was detected by MTT assay, Griess reagent, RT-PCR, 2 ',7 '-dichlorfluoroescein diacetate and Western blot analysis. The combined treatment of LGSP with CO (20 mu g/mL and 1 mg/mL) synergistically suppressed the production of NO, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and ROS. Further studies showed that the synergistic effect was attributed to their suppression of the activation of NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential synergistic effect between LGSP and CO in LPS-induced inflammation.

AB  - Existing models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) may not fully recapitulate the pathophysiology of the disease. To generate more pathophysiologically relevant FTD models, we engineered MAPT knockin mouse lines carrying triple mutations, among which the MAPTP301S;Int10+3;S320Fline exhibited robust tau pathology starting before 6 months of age. Severe tau accumulation was predominantly observed in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala with milder involvement of the cortex and hippocampus, leading to synaptic loss, brain atrophy, and FTD-like behavioral abnormalities. Crossbreeding MAPTP301S;Int10+3;S320F mice with App knockin, AppNL-G-F, mice markedly enhanced tau pathology in the cortex and hippocampus, highlighting the interplay between b-amyloid and tau. These findings establish the mutant mice as valuable models for investigating the mechanisms underlying FTD and other tauopathies, providing a relevant platform for in vivo drug screening.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that almost half of all cancers occur due to DNA damage. For the early diagnosis of cancer, a highly sensitized and swift identification for TP53 is needed since the corresponding TP53 protein is effectively recognized as "the guardian of the genome." To improve the detection sensitivity, numerous analytical methods were previously used for the determination of the TP53 protein, including denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Currently, immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) that are simple to use, stable over time, and show low interference are regarded as valuable tools for the quick screening of food and environmental monitoring along with clinical diagnosis. ICTs often have limited sensitivity even if a variety of novel reporters possessing optimum photostability and improved brightness are used as signal-intensity reporters. Compared with N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) or luminol, a novel luminescent probe, 2 ',6 '-diMethyl-4 '-(N-succiniMidyloxycarbonyl) phenyl-10-sulfopropylacridiniuM-9-carboxylate (NSP-DMAE-NHS) has achieved a much higher efficiency, improvement in the biosensor's performance, and amplification of the signal without causing any damage to the biomolecule in terms of its biochemical activity. In this study, the reagent strip method was initially used to detect TP53 fusion protein by combining the advantages of NSP-DMAE-NHS and immunochromatography. In our experiment, the control and study lines on the strips were immobilized through HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and TP53 antigen, respectively. The optimized concentration of the anti-TP53 antibody-NSP-DMAE-NHS immunoconjugates was then added to the TP53 antigen samples. After, the test strips were inserted and left in the aforementioned buffer solution for an additional 20 min. Finally, a lab-made luminous measurement device was used to analyze the corresponding control and study lines on the strips. Under optimized conditions, this method was found to be ultrasensitive, with a wide range of linear responses from 0.0008 ng mL(-1) to 1 mu g mL(-1) and a limit of detection of 0.0008 ng mL(-1) (0.013 pM). Thus, a novel competitive chemiluminescent assay based on reagent strips was established for the determination of the TP53 fusion proteins. The strategy has potential applications for ultrasensitive detection in the early diagnosis of cancer.

AB  - The fluorimetry method for assaying cellobiohydrolase activity (CBHA), originally developed for pure cultures of microorganims, has been modified for studying samples of the digestive tract content of wild small mammals. Several fixation methods for the samples have been studied. The optimal fixation agent is 86% glycerol. A mathematical model of the dependence of the measured CBHA values on the concentration of chyme in samples has been developed. The model confirmed the effect of the chyme concentration on the analyzed results in the range of 5-15 g/L. The optimal concentration of chyme is equal to 10 g/L; i.e., a sample should contain 0.2 g of chyme in 1 mL of 86% glycerol, so the sample collection and fixation could be easily performed in the field.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes amyloid beta (A(3) plaque formation in regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, which have a cognitive function. Besides oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and acetylcholine, the degeneration of glutamatergic pathways in individuals with AD causes acetylcholine accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus, leading to the formation of A(3 plaque. Herein, we investigated the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) which are Cannabis saliva components on AD-like cognitive deficit induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of A(31-42. Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups: i) Control, ii) Alzheimer, iii) Alzheimer+CBD, and iv) Alzheimer+CBG. The AD model was induced by icv injection of A(31-42 and then CBD and CBG treatments were administrated for 2 weeks. Open field test, passive avoidance test, and Morris' water maze test were performed, and on 15th day, the rats were decapitated. Hippocampus and cerebral cortex were removed from the brain, and levels of interleukin-1(3 (IL-1(3) and tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were measured by ELISA, and A(31-42 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically. There was no significant difference between the groups in the parameters evaluated by the open field test. In passive avoidance and Morris's water maze tests, both CBD and CBG enhanced the learning-memory functions impaired by AD. CBD and CBG treatments successfully reduced the levels of TNF-a and IL-1(3 in AD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased expression of A(31-42 in CBD and CBG treatment groups. CBD and CBG treatments improved learning and memory deficits in the A(31-42 induced AD model. We implicate that these experimental findings would lead to better avenues for targeted studies on C. saliva (a natural product of herbal origin and its components) that can potentially be developed for AD treatment.

AB  - Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is marked by prolonged and excessive worry, physical signs of anxiety, and associated neuroinflammation. Traditional treatments, like pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), often leave residual symptoms and have high relapse rates. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of algorithm-based modular psychotherapy (MoBa), a combination of CBT and mindfulness meditation as validated by the research domain criteria (RDoC), in reducing anxiety and neuroinflammation in GAD. A longitudinal design was used, with 50 patients with GAD undergoing a 12-week MoBa treatment. The patients were investigated pre- and post-treatment using MRI to measure neuroinflammatory markers (DBSI-RF, diffusion-basis spectral imaging-based restricted fraction) in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). Results indicated significant reductions in both anxiety symptoms and MRI RF values in the amygdala, suggesting decreased neuroinflammation. A reduction in anxiety was associated with the amelioration of neuroinflammation in the amygdala. These results suggest that MoBa is effective in alleviating both the psychological and neuroinflammatory aspects of GAD, offering a promising personalized treatment approach. Future research should focus on long-term effects and the mechanisms through which MoBa impacts neuroinflammation and anxiety.

AB  - Memory helps guide behavior, but which experiences from the past are prioritized? Classic models of learning posit that events associated with unpredictable outcomes as well as, paradoxically, predictable outcomes, deploy more attention and learning for those events. Here, we test reinforcement learning and subsequent memory for those events, and treat signed and unsigned reward prediction errors (RPEs), experienced at the reward-predictive cue or reward outcome, as drivers of these two seemingly contradictory signals. By fitting reinforcement learning models to behavior, we find that both RPEs contribute to learning by modulating a dynamically changing learning rate. We further characterize the effects of these RPE signals on memory and show that both signed and unsigned RPEs enhance memory, in line with midbrain dopamine and locus-coeruleus modulation of hippocampal plasticity, thereby reconciling separate findings in the literature.

AB  - For the non-invasive assessment of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), surrogates like pulse wave transit time (PWTT) have been proposed. The aim of this study was to invasively validate for which kind of PAP (systolic, mean, or diastolic) PWTT is the best surrogate parameter. To assess both PWTT and PAP in six healthy pigs, two pulmonary artery Mikro-Tip (TM) catheters were inserted into the pulmonary vasculature at a fixed distance: one in the pulmonary artery trunk, and a second one in a distal segment of the pulmonary artery. PAP was raised using the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 (TXA) and by hypoxic vasoconstriction. There was a negative linear correlation between PWTT and systolic PAP (r = 0.742), mean PAP (r = 0.712) and diastolic PAP (r = 0.609) under TXA. During hypoxic vasoconstriction, the correlation coefficients for systolic, mean, and diastolic PAP were consistently higher than for TXA-induced pulmonary hypertension (r = 0.809, 0.778 and 0.734, respectively). Estimation of sPAP, mPAP, and dPAP using PWTT is feasible, nevertheless slightly better correlation coefficients were detected for sPAP compared to dPAP. In this study we establish the physiological basis for future methods to obtain PAP by non-invasively measured PWTT.

AB  - Simultaneous fiber photometry and optogenetics is a powerful emerging technique for precisely studying the interactions of neuronal brain networks. However, spectral overlap between photometry and optogenetic components has severely limited the application of an all-optical approach. Due to spectral overlap, light from optogenetic stimulation saturates the photosensor and occludes photometry fluorescence, which is especially problematic in physically smaller model organism brains like mice. Here, we demonstrate the multi-frequency interpolation X-talk removal algorithm (MuFIX or mu FIX) for recovering crosstalk-contaminated photometry responses recorded with lock-in amplification. mu FIX exploits multifrequency lock-in amplification by modeling the remaining uncontaminated data to interpolate across crosstalk-affected segments (R 2 approximate to 1.0); we found that this approach accurately recovers the original photometry response after demodulation (Pearson's r approximate to 1.0). When applied to crosstalk-contaminated data, mu FIX recovered a photometry response closely resembling the dynamics of noncrosstalk photometry recorded simultaneously. Upon further verification using simulated and empirical data, we demonstrated that mu FIX reproduces any signal that underwent simulated crosstalk contamination (r approximate to 1.0). We believe adopting mu FIX will enable experimental designs using simultaneous fiber photometry and optogenetics that were previously not feasible due to crosstalk.

AB  - The treatment of chronic wounds still challenges modern medicine because of these wounds' heterogenic pathophysiology. Processes such as inflammation, ischemia and bacterial infection play major roles in the progression of a chronic wound. In recent years, preclinical wound models have been used to understand the underlying processes of chronic wound formation. However, the wound models used to investigate chronic wounds often lack translatability from preclinical models to patients, and often do not take exaggerated inflammation into consideration. Therefore, we aimed to investigate prolonged inflammation in a porcine wound model by using resiquimod, a TLR7 and TLR8 agonist. Pigs received full thickness excisional wounds, where resiquimod was applied daily for 6 days, and untreated wounds served as controls. Dressing change, visual documentation and wound scoring were performed daily. Biopsies were collected for histological as well as gene expression analysis. Resiquimod application on full thickness wounds induced a visible inflammation of wounds, resulting in delayed wound healing compared to non-treated control wounds. Gene expression analysis revealed high levels of IL6, MMP1 and CD68 expression after resiquimod application, and histological analysis showed increased immune cell infiltration. By using resiquimod, we were able to show that prolonged inflammation delayed wound healing, which is often observed in chronic wounds in patients. The model we used shows the importance of inflammation in wound healing and gives an insight into the progression of chronic wounds.

AB  - Trazodone is an efficacious atypical antidepressant acting both as an SSRI and a 5HT2A and 5HT2C antagonist. Antagonism to H1-histaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic receptors is responsible for a sleep-promoting action. We studied long-term gene expression modulations induced by chronic trazodone to investigate the molecular underpinning of trazodone efficacy. Rats received acute or chronic treatment with trazodone or citalopram. mRNA expression of growth factor and circadian rhythm genes was evaluated by qPCR in the prefrontal cortex (PFCx), hippocampus, Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and hypothalamus. CREB levels and phosphorylation state were evaluated using Western blotting. BDNF levels were significantly increased in PFCx and hippocampus by trazodone and in the NAc and hypothalamus by citalopram. Likewise, TrkB receptor levels augmented in the PFCx after trazodone and in the amygdala after citalopram. FGF-2 and FGFR2 levels were higher after trazodone in the PFCx. The CREB phosphorylation state was increased by chronic trazodone in the PFCx, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Bmal1 and Per1 were increased by both antidepressants after acute and chronic treatments, while Per2 levels were specifically augmented by chronic trazodone in the PFCx and NAc, and by citalopram in the PFCx, amygdala, and NAc. These findings show that trazodone affects the expression of neurotrophic factors involved in antidepressant responses and alters circadian rhythm genes implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, thus shedding light on trazodone's molecular mechanism of action.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication of cognitive decline after surgery and anesthesia. Sevoflurane, as a commonly used anesthetic, was found to cause POCD. Nudix Hydrolase 21 (NUDT21), a conserved splicing factor, has been reported to exert important functions in multiple diseases' progression. In this study, the effect of NUDT21 on sevoflurane-induced POCD was elucidated. Results showed that NUDT21 was down-regulated in the hippocampal tissue of sevoflurane-induced rats. Morris water maze test results revealed that overexpression of NUDT21 improved sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. In addition, TUNEL assay results indicated that enhanced NUDT21 alleviated sevoflurane-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, overexpression of NUDT21 suppressed the sevoflurane-induced LIMK2 expression. Taken together, NUDT21 alleviates sevoflurane-induced neurological damage in rats by down-regulating LIMK2, providing a novel target for the prevention of sevoflurane-induced POCD.

AB  - Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) is a prevalent perioperative neurological complication in older patients and has common characteristics such as acute cognitive dysfunction, impaired memory, and inattention. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSCs-Exo) are enclosed by a lipid bilayer contain proteins, DNA, miRNA, and other components, which are important mediators of intercellular communication. It has been reported that exosomes could play an important role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, nerve injury, and other neurological diseases. In this study, we examined the effects of MSCs-Exo on dNCR aged mice after exploratory laparotomy and evaluated their potential regulatory mechanisms. We found that MSCs-Exo treatment ameliorated cognitive impairment in dNCR aged mice. MSCs-Exo inhibit hippocampus ferroptosis and increase the expression of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in dNCR aged mice. Interestingly, the above effects of MSCs-Exo on dNCR aged mice were abolished by SIRT1 selective inhibitor EX-527. In conclusion, these findings indicated that MSCs-Exo can ameliorate cognitive impairment by inhibiting hippocampus ferroptosis in dNCR aged mice via activating SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, providing a potential avenue for the treatment of dNCR.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease associated with the production of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies and other antibodies that predominantly affects women with a wide range of lesions. Although neuropsychiatric lupus erythematosus (NPSLE), characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms related to cerebrovascular diseases or depression, ranks high in severity, no specific treatment has been defined. Two-carba cyclic phosphatidic acid (2ccPA), a derivative of cyclic phosphatidic acid, was isolated from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum in 1992. 2ccPA treatment suppresses neuroinflammation and promotes tissue repair in mouse multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury models. In this study, we performed behavioral tests on MRL/lpr mice as an NPSLE model. MRL/lpr mice showed increased depression-like behaviors compared with control mice, which were significantly suppressed by 2ccPA treatment. The expression of CD68, an M1 phenotypic marker of microglia, was significantly elevated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of MRL/lpr mice, which was significantly suppressed by 2ccPA treatment. In contrast, the expression of Arginase1, an M2 phenotypic marker of microglia, was significantly increased by 2ccPA treatment. Compared to control mice, MRL/lpr mice showed higher plasma levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies, which are mainly involved in SLE pathogenesis. 2ccPA treatment decreased these levels in the MRL/lpr mice. These results suggest that 2ccPA treatment suppresses behavioral abnormalities by promoting a microglial phenotypic switch from M1 to M2 in MRL/lpr mice.

AB  - Abrogating synaptotoxicity in age-related neurodegenerative disorders is an extremely promising area of research with significant neurotherapeutic implications in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our studies using human clinical samples and mouse models demonstrated that aberrantly elevated phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is associated with amyloid beta (A beta) and tau-driven synaptic dysfunction and underlying memory deficits. While knocking out the lipolytic PLD1 gene is not detrimental to survival across species, elevated expression is implicated in cancer, cardiovascular conditions and neuropathologies, leading to the successful development of well-tolerated mammalian PLD isoform-specific small molecule inhibitors. Here, we address the importance of PLD1 attenuation, achieved using repeated 1 mg/kg of VU0155069 (VU01) intraperitoneally every alternate day for a month in 3xTg-AD mice beginning only from similar to 11 months of age (with greater influence of tau-driven insults) compared to age-matched vehicle (0.9% saline)-injected siblings. A multimodal approach involving behavior, electrophysiology and biochemistry corroborate the impact of this pre-clinical therapeutic intervention. VU01 proved efficacious in preventing in later stage AD-like cognitive decline affecting perirhinal cortex-, hippocampal- and amygdala-dependent behaviors. Glutamate-dependent HFS-LTP and LFS-LTD improved. Dendritic spine morphology showed the preservation of mushroom and filamentous spine characteristics. Differential PLD1 immunofluorescence and co-localization with A beta were noted.

AB  - Steroid hormones are essential biomolecules for human physiology as they modulate the endocrine system, nervous function and behaviour. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota is directly involved in the production and metabolism of steroid hormones in the periphery. However, the influence of the gut microbiota on levels of steroids acting and present in the brain (i.e., neuroactive steroids) is not fully understood. Therefore, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we assessed the levels of several neuroactive steroids in various brain areas and the plasma of germ-free (GF) male mice and conventionally colonized controls. The data obtained indicate an increase in allopregnanolone levels associated with a decrease in those of 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol (3 alpha-diol) in the plasma of GF mice. Moreover, an increase of dihydroprogesterone and isoallopregnanolone in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex was also reported. Changes in dihydrotestosterone and 3 alpha-diol levels were also observed in the hippocampus of GF mice. In addition, an increase in dehydroepiandrosterone was associated with a decrease in testosterone levels in the hypothalamus of GF mice. Our findings suggest that the absence of microbes affects the neuroactive steroids in the periphery and the brain, supporting the evidence of a microbiota-mediated modulation of neuroendocrine pathways involved in preserving host brain functioning.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is a serious chronic neurological disorder, which is accompanied by recurrent seizures. Repeated seizures cause physical injuries and neuronal dysfunction and may be a risk of cancer and vascular diseases. However, many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have side effects of mood alteration or neurocognitive function, a reduction in neuron excitation, and the inhibition of normal activity. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of secondary metabolites of Trichoderma harzianum cultural filtrate (ThCF) when adjusting different electrolytes and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus of epileptic rats. Methods: Cytotoxicity of ThCF against LS-174T cancer cells was assessed using a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Quantitative estimation for some neurotransmitters, electrolytes in sera or homogenate of hippocampi tissues, and mRNA gene expression for ion or voltage gates was assessed by quantitative Real-Time PCR. Results: Treatment with ThCF reduces the proliferative percentage of LS-174T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. ThCF administration improves hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia in the sera of the epilepticus model. ThCF rebalances the elevated levels of many neurotransmitters and reduces the release of GABA and acetylcholine-esterase. Also, treatments with ThCF ameliorate the downregulation of mRNA gene expression for some gate receptors in hippocampal homogenate tissues and recorded a highly significant elevation in the expression of SCN1A, CACNA1S, and NMDA. Conclusion: Secondary metabolites of Trichoderma (ThCF) have cytotoxic activity against LS-174T (colorectal cancer cell line) and anxiolytic-like activity through a GABAergic mechanism of action and an increase in GABA as inhibitory amino acid in the selected brain regions and reduced levels of NMDA and DOPA. The present data suggested that ThCF may inhibit intracellular calcium accumulation by triggering the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. Therefore, the present results suggested further studies on the molecular pathway for each metabolite of ThCF, e.g., 6-pentyl-ff-pyrone (6-PP), harzianic acid (HA), and hydrophobin, as an alternative drug to mitigate the side effects of AEDs.

AB  - The emerging role of FERM domain-containing protein 6 (FRMD6) in cancer progression has been revealed in several malignancies. However, its relevance on thyroid cancer is not well understood. This work evaluated the possible role and mechanism of FRMD6 in thyroid cancer. We demonstrated that FRMD6 expression was downregulated in thyroid cancer by analyzing the Cancer Genome Atlas data. Remarkable reductions in FRMD6 expression were also confirmed in the clinical specimens and cell lines of thyroid cancer. The upregulation of FRMD6 restrained the proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of thyroid cancer. Moreover, FRMD6 overexpression significantly increased the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Further molecular research demonstrated that the overexpression of FRMD6 increased the phosphorylation levels of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1, large tumor suppressor 1, and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and prohibited the activation of YAP1. The re-expression of constitutively active YAP1 strikingly reversed FRMD6-induced tumor-inhibiting effects. Thyroid cancer cells overexpressing FRMD6 had a weakened ability to form xenograft tumors in vivo in nude mice. Overall, the overexpression of FRMD6 produces remarkable tumor-inhibiting effects in thyroid cancer by inhibiting oncogenic YAP1.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, which can result in diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI). Recent studies have indicated that gut microbiota plays a significant role in the development of DCI. Tangliping Decoction (TLP), a traditional Chinese medicine compound, contains various active ingredients that have been shown to regulate the microecology of gut microbiota and potentially improve DCI. However, it remains unclear whether TLP can improve DCI by modulating gut microbiota, as well as which specific component is primarily responsible for these effects. Purpose: Assess the impact of TLP on alleviating DCI and investigate the contribution of quercetin (QR), the core blood-absorbed component of TLP, in this process. and investigate the underlying mechanisms through which TLP and QR enhance DCI by modulating gut microbiota composition. Study design and methods: Initially, experiments such as morris water maze (MWM), morphological analysis, and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing from DCI mice, were performed to validate the pharmacological efficacy of TLP in mitigating DCI. The results indicated that TLP possesses the capacity to modulate the composition and quantity of gut microbiota and safeguard the integrity of the gut barrier and brain barrier. Secondly, high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) combined with network pharmacology methods were used to screen for blood-absorbed components, suggesting that QR may be a potential core blood-absorbed component of TLP in the treatment of DCI. Subsequently, the pharmacological efficacy of QR in ameliorating DCI was confirmed, and the characteristics of gut microbiota as well as the permeability of the gut and brain barrier, were assessed. Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments were conducted, wherein fecal matter from TLP and QR-treated mice (donor mice) was transplanted into pseudo-sterile DCI mice with antibiotic-induced depletion of gut microbiota. This approach aimed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which TLP and QR improve DCI through the modulation of the structure, composition, and abundance of gut microbiota. Results: TLP and QR have the potential to enhance learning and memory capabilities in DCI mice, as well as reduce homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and restore homeostasis model assessment-beta function (HOMA- beta), leading to increased fasting insulin (FIN) levels and decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Simultaneously, the administration of FMT from donor mice to pseudo-sterile DCI mice has been shown to alter the composition and abundance of gut microbiota, leading to amelioration of pathological damage in the colon and hippocampal tissues. Ultimately, FMT utilizing fecal suspensions from donor mice treated with TLP and QR improved cognitive function in pseudo-sterile DCI mice, restore gut microbiota dysbiosis, and maintained the integrity of the gut and brain barriers. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that TLP and its core component, QR, which is absorbed into the bloodstream, improve DCI through a gut microbiota-dependent mechanism, providing further evidence for gut microbiota as a therapeutic target for DCI treatment.

AB  - Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a major public health concern and strongly contributes to human epilepsy cases worldwide. However, an effective treatment and prevention remains a matter of intense research. The present study provides new insights into the gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A))-stabilizing protein ubiquilin-1 (ubqln1) and its regulation in mouse models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in vitro epilepsy. We performed label-free quantification on isolated cortical GABAergic interneurons from GAD67-GFP mice that received unilateral TBI and discovered reduced expression of ubqln1 24 h post-TBI. To investigate the link between this regulation and the development of epileptiform activity, we further studied ubqln1 expression in hippocampal and cortical slices. Epileptiform events were evoked pharmacologically in acute brain slices by administration of picrotoxin (PTX, 50 mu M) and kainic acid (KA, 500 nM) and recorded in the hippocampal CA1 subfield using Multi-electrode Arrays (MEA). Interestingly, quantitative Western blots revealed significant decreases in ubqln1 expression 1-7 h after seizure induction that could be restored by application of the non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor nialamide (NM, 10 mu M). In picrotoxin-dependent dose-response relationships, NM administration alleviated the frequency and peak amplitude of seizure-like events (SLEs). These findings indicate a role of the monoamine transmitter systems and ubqln1 for cortical network activity during posttraumatic epileptogenesis.

KW  - BINDING
AB  - Hippocampal area CA2 has emerged as a functionally and molecularly distinct part of the hippocampus and is necessary for several types of social behavior including social aggression. As part of the unique molecular profile of both mouse and human CA2, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; Nr3c2) appears to play a critical role in controlling CA2 neuron cellular and synaptic properties. To better understand the fate (or state) of the neurons resulting from MR conditional knockout, we use a spatial transcriptomics approach. We find that without MRs, 'CA2' neurons acquire a CA1-like molecular phenotype. Additionally, we find that neurons in this area appear to have a cell size and density more like that in CA1. These findings support the idea that MRs control CA2's 'state', at least during development, resulting in a CA1-like 'fate'.

AB  - Sexual dimorphism widely exists in animals and is reflected in different forms; of these, body mass dimorphism is the most prominent. Studies on the development and adaptation mechanism of sexual dimorphism in body mass can help us to understand how animals adapt to their environment via sexual dimorphism. As this has not been widely reported in Rhinopithecus, this study explores the ontogenetic development pattern of sexual dimorphism in the body mass of R. bieti, and interprets the causes resulting in extreme sexual dimorphism. The results showed that a significant dimorphism appears when females enter the reproductive period, reaching the maximum when males are mature for reproduction. It was determined that a period of decline begins after 8 years of age, and that males had a longer growth period than females. The large sexual dimorphism in body mass in R. bieti can be explained by both Bergmann's and Rensch's rules; however, the females' choice for males may not be significantly related to it. Overall, environmental adaptation, a distinctive alimentary system, and complex social structure have allowed R. bieti to have remarkable sexual dimorphism in body mass compared to other colobines. This study will undoubtedly highlight the same issues on the other 26 primate species in China, particularly the colobines, which will enrich research designs and enlarge research focus on China's primatology.Sexual dimorphism exists widely in animals, manifesting in different forms, such as body size, color, shape, unique characteristics, behavior, and sound. Of these, body mass dimorphism is the most obvious. Studies of evolutionary and ontogenetic development and adaptation mechanisms of animals' sexual dimorphism in body mass (SDBM), allow us to understand how environment, social group size, diet, and other external factors have driven the selection of sexual dimorphism. There are fewer reports of the ontogenetic development of sexual dimorphism in body mass in Rhinopithecus. This study explores the ontogenetic development pattern of SDBM in wild black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (R. bieti), and the causes resulting in extreme sexual dimorphism compared to other colobines. A significant dimorphism with a ratio of 1.27 (p < 0.001) appears when females enter the reproductive period around six years old, reaching a peak (1.85, p < 0.001) when males become sexually mature. After the age of eight, the SDBM falls to 1.78, but is still significant (p < 0.001). The results also indicate that males had a longer body mass growth period than females (8 years vs. 5 years); females in larger breeding units had a significantly higher SDBM than those in smaller ones (2.12 vs. 1.93, p < 0.01). A comparative analysis with other colobines further clarifies that Rhinopithecus and Nasalis, which both have multilevel social organization, have the highest degree of SDBM among all colobines. The large SDBM in R. bieti can be explained through Bergman's and Rensch's rules. Overall, environmental adaptation, a distinctive alimentary system, and a complex social structure contribute to R. bieti having such a remarkable SDBM compared to other colobines. In addition, we found that females' choice for males may not be significantly related to the development of SDBM.

AB  - N-terminal methylation is an important posttranslational modification that regulates protein/DNA interactions and plays a role in many cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, mitosis, and transcriptional regulation. Our generation of a constitutive knockout mouse for the N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1 demonstrated its loss results in severe developmental abnormalities and premature aging phenotypes. As premature aging is often accompanied by neurodegeneration, we more specifically examined how NRMT1 loss affects neural pathology and cognitive behaviors. Here we find that Nrmt1(-/-) mice exhibit postnatal enlargement of the lateral ventricles, age-dependent striatal and hippocampal neurodegeneration, memory impairments, and hyperactivity. These morphological and behavior abnormalities are preceded by alterations in neural stem cell (NSC) development. Early expansion and differentiation of the quiescent NSC pool in Nrmt1(-/-) mice is followed by its subsequent depletion and many of the resulting neurons remain in the cell cycle and ultimately undergo apoptosis. These cell cycle phenotypes are reminiscent to those seen with loss of the NRMT1 target retinoblastoma protein (RB). Accordingly, we find misregulation of RB phosphorylation and degradation in Nrmt1(-/-) mice, and significant de-repression of RB target genes involved in cell cycle. We also identify novel de-repression of Noxa, an RB target gene that promotes apoptosis. These data identify N alpha-methylation as a novel regulatory modification of RB transcriptional repression during neurogenesis and indicate that NRMT1 and RB work together to promote NSC quiescence and prevent neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - The growing issue of antimicrobial resistance poses a significant challenge for microbiological research, driving the need for alternative antibiotics with minimal side effects. Zygophyllum coccineum, commonly referred to as "Tebtab" in Arabic and "Red Spinepod" in English, has traditionally been utilized as forage for camels and ruminants. While its antimicrobial activity against human pathogens has been documented, its efficacy against animal pathogens remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate the phytochemical composition, biological activities, and antimicrobial potential of water and organic-solvent extracts of Zygophyllum coccineum against a range of reference microbial strains and animal pathogens. The findings revealed that all extracts exhibited notable antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities attributed to their bioactive constituents. Among them, the ethyl acetate extract displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects against bacterial and fungal strains. Additionally, this extract demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity and showed promising cytotoxic activity against lung (A549) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. These results underscore the potential of Zygophyllum coccineum as a valuable natural resource for developing antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic therapies for applications in both human and veterinary medicine.

AB  - Previous studies have revealed that the side effects of anticancer drugs induce a decrease of neurogenesis. Methotrexate (MTX), one of anticancer drugs, can induce lipid peroxidation as an indicator of oxidative stress in the brain. Melatonin has been presented as an antioxidant that can prevent oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage via the activation of antioxidant enzymes associated with the increase of neurogenesis. The aims of the present study are to examine the neuroprotective effect of melatonin on the neurotoxicity of MTX on neurogenesis and the changes of protein expression and antioxidant enzyme levels in adult rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into four groups: vehicle, MTX, melatonin, and melatonin+MTX groups. The vehicle group received saline solution and 10% ethanol solution, whereas the experimental groups received MTX (75 mg/kg, i.v.) and melatonin (8 mg/kg, i.p.) treatments. After the animal examination, the brains were removed for p21 immunofluorescence staining. The hippocampus and PFC were harvested for Western blot analysis and biochemical assessments of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The immunofluorescence result showed that coadministration with melatonin diminished p21-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, indicating a decrease of cell cycle arrest. Melatonin reduced the levels of MDA and prevented the decline of antioxidant enzyme activities in rats receiving MTX. In the melatonin+MTX group, the protein expression results showed that melatonin treatment significantly upregulated synaptic plasticity and an immature neuron marker through enhancing brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and doublecortin (DCX), respectively. Moreover, melatonin ameliorated the antioxidant defense system by improving the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in rats receiving MTX. These findings suggested that the effects of melatonin can ameliorate MTX toxicity by several mechanisms, including an increase of endogenous antioxidants and neurogenesis in adult rat hippocampus and PFC.

AB  - Obesity is one of the biggest and most costly health challenges the modern world encounters. Substantial evidence suggests that the risk of metabolic syndrome or obesity formation may be affected at a very early stage of development, in particular through fetal and/or neonatal overfeeding. Outcomes from epidemiological studies indicate that maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation has a profound impact on adult neurogenesis in the offspring. In the present study, an intergenerational dietary model employing overfeeding of experimental mice during prenatal and early postnatal development was applied to acquire mice with various body conditions. We investigated the impact of the maternal high-energy diet during pregnancy and lactation on adult neurogenesis in the olfactory neurogenic region involving the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and some behavioral tasks including memory, anxiety and nociception. Our findings show that a maternal high-energy diet administered during pregnancy and lactation modifies proliferation and differentiation, and induced degeneration of cells in the SVZ/RMS of offspring, but only in mice where extreme phenotype, such as significant overweight/adiposity or obesity is manifested. Thereafter, a maternal high-energy diet enhances anxiety-related behavior in offspring regardless of its body condition and impairs learning and memory in offspring with an extreme phenotype.

AB  - Complement C5a protein has been shown to play a major role in tissue regeneration through interaction with its receptor (C5aR) on target cells. Expression of this receptor has been reported in the nervous system which, upon injury, has no treatment to restore the lost functions. This work aimed at investigating the Complement C5a effect on axonal growth after axotomy in vitro. Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from embryonic Wistar rats. Cell expression of C5aR mRNA was verified by RT-PCR while its membrane expression, localization, and phosphorylation were investigated by immunofluorescence. Then, the effects of C5a on injured axonal growth were investigated using a 3D-printed microfluidic device. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that the primary cultures contained only mature neurons (93%) and astrocytes (7%), but no oligodendrocytes or immature neurons. Immunofluorescence revealed a co-localization of NF-L and C5aR only in the mature neurons where C5a induced the phosphorylation of its receptor. C5a application on injured axons in the microfluidic devices significantly increased both the axonal growth speed and length. Our findings highlight a new role of C5a in regeneration demonstrating an enhancement of axonal growth after axotomy. This may provide a future therapeutic tool in the treatment of central nervous system injury.

AB  - PKN1 (protein kinase N1), a serine/threonine protein kinase family member, is associated with various cancers. However, the role of PKN1 in gliomas has rarely been studied. We suggest that PKN1 expression in glioma specimens is considerably upregulated and positively correlates with the histopathological grading of gliomas. Knocking down PKN1 expression in glioblastoma (GBM) cells inhibits GBM cell proliferation, invasion and migration and promotes apoptosis. In addition, yes-associated protein (YAP) expression, an essential effector of the Hippo pathway contributing to the oncogenic role of gliomagenesis, was also downregulated. In contrast, PKN1 upregulation enhances the malignant characteristics of GBM cells and simultaneously upregulates YAP expression. Therefore, PKN1 is a promising therapeutic target for gliomas. Raloxifene (Ralo), a commonly used selective oestrogen-receptor modulator to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, was predicted to target PKN1 according to the bioinformatics team from the School of Mathematics, Tianjin Nankai University. We showed that Ralo effectively targets PKN1, inhibits GBM cells proliferation and migration and sensitizes GBM cells to the major chemotherapeutic drug, Temozolomide. Ralo also reverses the effect of PKN1 on YAP activation. Thus, we confirm that PKN1 contributes to the pathogenesis of gliomas and may be a potential target for Ralo adjuvant glioma therapy.

AB  - Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) may develop depression, which can affect their rehabilitation. However, the underlying mechanism of depression in SCI patients remains unclear. Previous studies have revealed increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the rat hippocampus after SCI, accompanied by depression-like behaviors. However, the role of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in SCI-induced depression remains unclear. In this study, we used an aneurysm clip-induced rat SCI model to investigate whether p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the hippocampus is associated with depression-like behaviors in rats after SCI. Behavioral testing revealed that SB203580, a p38 MAPK signaling inhibitor, reduced depression-like behaviors. Western blotting and morphological analyses showed that SB203580 inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus after SCI. Additionally, SB203580 reduced the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that SB203580 can inhibit hippocampal remodeling and the neuroimmune response in the rat hippocampus after SCI. Therefore, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the hippocampus plays a key role in the depression-like behaviors induced by SCI. The inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation may represent a mechanism to protect against hippocampal injury induced by SCI.

AB  - Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent urological malignancy. We aim to identify novel biomarkers for BLCA and elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screened from GSE38264 and GSE130598 datasets, we constructed protein-protein interaction networks to identify hub genes, whose expression was validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The malignant phenotype of BLCA cells was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, Transwell, and wound-healing assays. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining were employed to evaluate BLCA development in mouse xenograft models. The protein expression was detected by Western blot. PLK1, AURKA, AURKB, CDK1, ERBB2, ERBB3, FGFR1, FYN, ABL1, and PRKDC were hub genes with predictive value for BLCA. Among them, PLK1 was selected as a key target of BLCA. PLK1 knockdown inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of BLCA cells. In vivo, PLK1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth. Silencing PLK1 activated the Hippo pathway in BLCA cells and tumor tissues. The Hippo pathway inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effects of PLK1 silencing on malignant phenotype of BLCA cells. PLK1 knockdown exerts an inhibitory effect on BLCA via activating the Hippo pathway, which presents promising therapeutic strategies for BLCA.

AB  - Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may show mild cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation in the hippocampus mediates cognitive impairment in rat models of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Treatment with rifaximin reverses cognitive impairment in a large proportion of cirrhotic patients with MHE. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aims of this work were to assess if rats with mild liver damage, as a model of NAFLD, show neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and impaired cognitive function, if treatment with rifaximin reverses it, and to study the underlying mechanisms. Mild liver damage was induced with carbon-tetrachloride. Infiltration of immune cells, glial activation, and cytokine expression, as well as glutamate receptors expression in the hippocampus and cognitive function were assessed. We assessed the effects of daily treatment with rifaximin on the alterations showed by these rats. Rats with mild liver damage showed hippocampal neuroinflammation, reduced membrane expression of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, and impaired spatial memory. Increased C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2), infiltration of monocytes, microglia activation, and increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were reversed by rifaximin, that normalized NMDA receptor expression and improved spatial memory. Thus, rifaximin reduces neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function in rats with mild liver damage, being a promising therapy for patients with NAFLD showing mild cognitive impairment.

AB  - Mitochondrial transplantation (MTx) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, yet its scalability and cross-species feasibility remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the dose-dependent uptake and molecular effects of xenogeneic mitochondrial transplantation (xeno-MTx) using rat-derived mitochondria in mouse neuronal systems. HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells and a murine model of cardiac arrest-induced global cerebral ischemia were used to assess mitochondrial uptake, gene expression, and mitochondrial DNA presence. Donor mitochondria were isolated from rat pectoralis muscle and labeled with MitoTracker dyes. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed a dose-dependent increase in donor mitochondrial uptake in vitro. Quantitative PCR demonstrated a corresponding increase in rat-specific mitochondrial DNA and upregulation of Mfn2 and Bak1, with no changes in other fusion, fission, or apoptotic genes. Inhibitor studies indicated that mitochondrial internalization may involve actin-dependent macropinocytosis and cholesterol-sensitive endocytic pathways. In vivo, rat mitochondrial DNA was detected in mouse brains post-xeno-MTx, confirming donor mitochondrial delivery to ischemic tissue. These findings support the feasibility of xeno-MTx and its dose-responsive biological effects in neuronal systems while underscoring the need for further research to determine long-term functional outcomes and clinical applicability.

AB  - We aimed to investigate whether polydatin could suppress stress-induced depression-and anxiety-like behaviors in a mouse model. Mice were divided into the control group, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) exposure group, and CUMS mice treated with polydatin group. Following CUMS exposure and polydatin treatment, mice were subjected to behavioral assays to assess depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors. Synaptic function was determined by the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and synaptophysin (SYN) in the hippocampus and cultured hippocampal neurons. The number and length of dendrites were assessed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Finally, we investigated the effect of polydatin on CUMS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in the hippocampus by measuring inflammatory cytokine levels, oxidative stress markers such as reactive oxygen species, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, as well as components of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Polydatin alleviated CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in forced swimming, tail suspension and sucrose preference tests, and anxiety-like behaviors in marble-burying and elevated plus maze tests. Polydatin increased the number and length of dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons from mice exposed to CUMS and alleviated CUMS-induced synaptic deficits by restoring BDNF, PSD95, and SYN levels in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, polydatin inhibited CUMS-induced hippocampal inflammation and oxidative stress and suppressed the activation of NF kappa B and Nrf2 pathways. Our study suggests that polydatin may be an effective drug for the treatment of affective disorders through inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Our current findings warrant further study to investigate the potential clinical application of polydatin.

AB  - The search for new molecular targets whose modulation can reduce nerve cell dysfunction and neuronal death during ischemic damage is one of the most significant issues in both fundamental and clinical neurobiology. Various kinase enzymes are often considered to be such promising targets since they are involved in key molecular cascades that regulate cell adaptation to stress factors. Our work is devoted to the study of the role of two kinases-SRC and IKK beta-in maintaining the neural networks' functional activity under a hypoxic condition in vivo and in vitro. SRC kinase is a cytoplasmic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase. It is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation; its expression in nerve cells changes during hypoxia. IKK beta kinase is involved in the regulation of the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which is a pleiotropic regulator of many cellular signaling pathways. We have shown that blockade of SRC and IKK beta kinases by selective inhibitors maintains cell viability in modeling hypoxic damage in vitro but does not allow for the preservation of the bioelectrical activity of neurons. Studies in vivo have shown the neuroprotective effect of SRC but not IKK beta kinase inhibition in the modeling of cerebral ischemia in mice.

AB  - Depression is linked to changes in GABAergic inhibitory neurons, especially parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, which are susceptible to redox dysregulation. Olanzapine (Olz) is an atypical antipsychotic whose mode of action remains unclear. We determined the effect of Olz on PV-positive (+) and glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) + cell numbers in the layers of dorsal hippocampus (dHIPP) cornu ammonis (CA1-CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions in rats exposed to chronic social isolation (CSIS), which is an animal model of depression. Antioxidative enzymes and proinflammatory cytokine levels were also examined. CSIS decreased the PV+ cell numbers in the Stratum Oriens (SO) and Stratum Pyramidale (SP) of dCA1 and dDG. It increased interleukin-6 (IL-6), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) levels, and it decreased catalase (CAT) protein levels. Olz in CSIS increased the number of GAD67+ cells in the SO and SP layers of dCA1 with no effect on PV+ cells. It reduced the PV+ and GAD67+ cell numbers in the Stratum Radiatum of dCA3 in CSIS. Olz antagonizes the CSIS-induced increase in CuZnSOD, CAT and SOCS3 protein levels with no effect on IL-6. Data suggest that the protective Olz effects in CSIS may be mediated by altering the number of PV+ and GAD67+ cells in dHIPP subregional layers.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease nowadays that causes memory impairments. It is characterized by extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (A beta), intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), and other pathological features. Trilobatin (TLB), a natural flavonoid compound isolated from Lithocarpuspolystachyus Rehd., has emerged as a neuroprotective agent. However, the effects and mechanisms of TLB on Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. In this research, different doses of TLB were orally introduced to 3xFAD AD model mice. The pathology, memory performance, and Toll-like receptor 4- (TLR4-) dependent inflammatory pathway protein level were assessed. Here, we show that TLB oral treatment protected 3xFAD AD model mice against the A beta burden, neuroinflammation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic degeneration, hippocampal neuronal loss, and memory impairment. The TLR4, a pattern recognition immune receptor, has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease-related neuroinflammation. We found that TLB suppressed glial activation by inhibiting the TLR4-MYD88-NF kappa B pathway, which leads to the inflammatory factor TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 reduction. Our study shows that TLR4 might be a key target of TLB in AD treatment and suggests a multifaceted target of TLB in halting AD. Taken together, our findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect of TLB in AD treatment.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis provides a regenerative resource for neural tissue and enhances neural plasticity, which is beneficial for brain functional rehabilitation post stroke. Recently, an increasing number of metabolic drugs have been reported to attenuate behavioral symptoms in neurodegeneration or psychiatric disorders via promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Bioeffects of catapol show its potential as an antidiabetic though it has been previously widely indicated to perform the neuroprotective functions. However, the systematic evidence to support the behavioral effects of catapol to PSD model and what is the role of adult neurogenesis in such effects remains unexplored. In current study, we created the PSD model by combining MCAO procedure and CORT feeding. The treatment of catapol strikingly reduced the depressive/anxiety behavior in PSD model. Moreover, treatment of catapol also improved the cognitive functions. Immunofluorescence indicates that catapol could promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis in PSD model, and TMZ treatment further confirmed the role of the hippocampal neurogenesis in catapol's therapeutic effects to PSD. Cultural neurons also indicates that PI3K is the key signal in regulating catapol mediated neurogenesis. By administrating the PI3K specific inhibitor, we found that PI3K is the key to mediate the behavioral effects of catapol to PSD. In conclusion, catapol could perform as the effective drug to treat PSD via the PI3K mediated adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a top priorityfor pharmacoresistantepilepsy treatment, while less-invasive wireless DBS is an urgentpriority but challenging. Herein, we developed a conceptual wirelessDBS platform to realize local electric stimulation via 1D-structuredmagnetoelectric Fe3O4@BaTiO3 nanochains(FBC). The FBC was facilely synthesized via magnetic-assisted interfacecoassembly, possessing a higher electrical output by inducing largerlocal strain from the anisotropic structure and strain coherence.Subsequently, wireless magnetoelectric neuromodulation invitro was synergistically achieved by voltage-gated ion channelsand to a lesser extent, the mechanosensitive ion channels. Furthermore,FBC less-invasively injected into the anterior nucleus of the thalamus(ANT) obviously inhibited acute and continuous seizures under magneticloading, exhibiting excellent therapeutic effects in suppressing bothhigh voltage electroencephalogram signals propagation and behavioralseizure stage and neuroprotection of the hippocampus mediated viathe Papez circuit similar to conventional wired-in DBS. This workestablishes an advanced antiepilepsy strategy and provides a perspectivefor other neurological disorder treatment.

AB  - This study represents the comprehensive anatomical analysis of the arterial circulation at the base of the encephalon in caracal (Caracal caracal), a member of the Felidae family. Caracals are found in various environments in Africa and Asia, and their conservation status is threatened by hunting and habitat loss. This study was conducted on 14 post-mortem specimens obtained from zoos. Three different methods were used to prepare the specimens-corrosive preparation, latex specimen preparation, and computer tomography imaging. This study revealed a configuration of the arterial circulation in the caracal encephalon resembling the shape of the number eight. The presence of the rostral communicating artery in this species is of particular significance, as it is associated with an increased ability to detect dehydration in the forebrain. This adaptation plays a crucial role in responding to challenges related to hydration. Comparative anatomical analysis with other felids highlighted differences in the shape and configuration of the encephalon's arterial circulation. This study also discussed the obliteration of the extracranial segment of the internal carotid artery in adult caracals, a feature shared with other Felidae members.

AB  - Despite the availability of antibiotic therapy, tuberculosis (TB) is prevailing as a leading killer among human infectious diseases, which highlights the need for better intervention strategies to control TB. Several animal model systems, including mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates have been developed and explored to understand TB pathogenesis. Although each of these models contributes to our current understanding of host-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) interactions, none of these models fully recapitulate the pathological spectrum of clinical TB seen in human patients. Recently, humanized mouse models are being developed to improvise the limitations associated with the standard mouse model of TB, including lack of necrotic caseation of granulomas, a pathological hallmark of TB in humans. However, the spatial immunopathology of pulmonary TB in humanized mice is not fully understood. In this study, using a novel humanized mouse model, we evaluated the spatial immunopathology of pulmonary Mtb infection with a low-dose inoculum. Humanized NOD/LtSscidIL2R gamma null mice containing human fetal liver, thymus, and hematopoietic CD34+ cells and treated with human cytokines were aerosol challenged to implant <50 pathogenic Mtb (low dose) in the lungs. At 2 and 4 weeks post infection, the tissue bacterial load, disease pathology, and spatial immunohistology were determined in the lungs, liver, spleen, and adipose tissue using bacteriological, histopathological, and immunohistochemical techniques. The results indicate that implantation of <50 bacteria can establish a progressive disease in the lungs that transmits to other tissues over time. The disease pathology in organs correspondingly increased with the bacterial load. A distinct spatial distribution of T cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells were noted in the lung granulomas. The kinetics of spatial immune cell distribution were consistent with the disease pathology in the lungs. Thus, the novel humanized model recapitulates several key features of human pulmonary TB granulomatous response and can be a useful preclinical tool to evaluate potential anti-TB drugs and vaccines.

AB  - Hippocamposeptal (HS) neurons send GABAergic projections from the hippocampus to the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DBB) as part of a reciprocal loop that is critical for memory. HS neurons are proposed to be particularly sensitive to the deleterious effects of pathological exposure to amyloid-beta (A beta), as would occur during Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is not known how HS GABA release in the MS/DBB is altered during the progression of AD. To target HS neurons in a mouse model of AD, we crossed SST-Cre mice to 5XFAD mice and performed stereotaxic injections of Cre-dependent AAV containing mCherry/channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into the hippocampus of offspring at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months. We used optogenetics to selectively stimulate HS terminals while performing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from MS/DBB neurons in slices. There was a transient reduction in HS-inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude in female 5XFAD mice at 6 months, but no difference in males at any age, and no difference in paired-pulse ratio in either sex at any age. When bath applying the GABA(B)R agonist, baclofen, we found a larger decrease in HS-IPSC amplitude in 5XFAD females at 9 months and 5XFAD males at 12 months. In 12-month-old 5XFAD females, response to baclofen was significantly reduced. These data suggest that there is a transient increase in responsiveness to GABA(B)R activation in 5XFAD mice that occurs earlier in females than in males. These sex-specific changes to HS function are likely to impact the relay of information between the hippocampus and MS/DBB.<br />

AB  - Insects on corpses could be a useful tool for the detection of exogenous substances such as drugs of abuse. The identification of exogenous substances in carrion insects is critical for proper estimation of the postmortem interval. It also provides information about the deceased person that may prove useful for forensic purposes. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Fourier transform mass spectrometry is a highly sensitive analytical technique that can identify substances even at very low concentrations, such as in the case of searching for exogenous substances in larvae. In this paper, a method is proposed for the identification of morphine, codeine, methadone, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) in the larvae of Lucilia sericata, a common carrion fly widely distributed in temperate areas of the world. The larvae, which were reared on a pig meat substrate, were killed once they reached their third stage by immersion in hot water at 80 & DEG;C and aliquoted into 400 mg samples. The samples were fortified with 5 ng of morphine, methadone and codeine. After solid-phase extraction, the samples were processed with a liquid chromatograph coupled to a Fourier transform mass spectrometer. This qualitative method has been validated and tested on larvae from a real case. The results lead to the correct identification of morphine, codeine, methadone and their metabolites. This method could prove useful in cases where toxicological analysis must be conducted on highly decomposed human remains, where biological matrices are very limited. Furthermore, it could help the forensic pathologist to better estimate the time of death, as the growth cycle of carrion insects can undergo changes if exogenous substances are taken.

In the present work, we for the first time conducted in vitro experiments using the AMPA receptor blockers DNQX and GYKI 52466 and the Trk receptor blocker K252a. It is shown that the neuroprotective effect of CPG depends on the activation of both AMPA and Trk receptors.

AB  - Across vertebrate species, sleep consists of repeating cycles of NREM followed by REM. However, their respective functions, and their stereotypic cycling pattern are not well understood. Using a simplified biophysical network model, we investigate the potential role of cholinergic modulation, acting via the muscarinic receptors, on network dynamics and memory consolidation. We show that low and high cholinergic levels associated with NREM and REM sleep, respectively, may play critical, sequential roles in memory consolidation. The network dynamics that facilitate these roles arise through alteration of neural excitability and changes to network-wide excitatory/inhibitory balance. At low acetylcholine (ACh) levels, reduced activation of inhibitory neurons leads to network-wide disinhibition and bursts of synchronized activity led by engram neurons, driving recruitment of additional excitatory neurons into the engram. In contrast, at high ACh levels, increased network inhibition suppresses firing in all but the most strongly recruited excitatory neurons, pruning the expanded engram population. Together, these results provide a testable hypothesis regarding the role of sleep state-specific cholinergic modulation in the process of memory consolidation.

AB  - The pathology of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is related to astrocyte-inflammation associated with aquaporin-4 (AQP4). The aim here is to investigate the effects of AQP4 associated with SAE and reveal its underlying mechanism causing cognitive impairment. The in vivo experimental results reveal that AQP4 in peripheral blood of patients with SAE is up-regulated, also the cortical and hippocampal tissue of cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) mouse brain has significant rise in AQP4. Furthermore, the data suggest that AQP4 deletion could attenuate learning and memory impairment, attributing to activation of astrocytic autophagy, inactivation of astrocyte and downregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by CLP or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, the activation effect of AQP4 knockout on CLP or LPS-induced PPAR-gamma inhibiting in astrocyte is related to intracellular Ca2+ level and sodium channel activity. Learning and memory impairment in SAE mouse model are attenuated by AQP4 knockout through activating autophagy, inhibiting neuroinflammation leading to neuroprotection via down-regulation of Na(v)1.6 channels in the astrocytes. This results in the reduction of Ca2+ accumulation in the cell cytosol furthermore activating the inhibition of PPAR-gamma signal transduction pathway in astrocytes.

AB  - It is well known that exercise produces analgesic effects (exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH)) in animal models and chronic pain patients, but the brain mechanisms underlying these EIH effects, especially concerning the emotional aspects of pain, are not yet fully understood. In this review, we describe drastic changes in the mesocorticolimbic system of the brain which permit the induction of EIH effects. The amygdala (Amyg) is a critical node for the regulation of emotions, such as fear and anxiety, which are closely associated with chronic pain. In our recent studies using neuropathic pain (NPP) model mice, we extensively examined the association between the Amyg and EIH effects. We found that voluntary exercise (VE) activated glutamate (Glu) neurons in the medial basal Amyg projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) lateral shell, while it almost completely suppressed NPP-induced activation of GABA neurons in the central nucleus of the Amyg (CeA). Furthermore, VE significantly inhibited activation of pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus-CA1 region, which play important roles in contextual fear conditioning and the retrieval of fear memory. This review describes novel information concerning the brain mechanisms underlying EIH effects as a result of overcoming the fear-avoidance belief of chronic pain.

AB  - Cognitive deficits are the core feature of schizophrenia and effective treatment strategies are still missing. Previous studies have reported that fisetin promotes long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in normal rodents and other model animals of neurological diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of fisetin on synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits caused by a brief disruption of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) with dizocilpine (MK-801) during early development in rats. The cognitive performance was examined by the Morris water maze task and a fear conditioning test. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity was investigated by field potential recording. The expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and cognition-related proteins was measured by western blotting. We found that intraperitoneal administration of fisetin rescued hippocampus-dependent spatial and contextual fear memory in MK-801 rats. In parallel with these behavioral results, fisetin treatment in MK-801 rats reversed the impairment of hippocampal LTP. At the molecular level, fisetin treatment selectively increased the phosphorylation and surface expression of AMPA receptor subunit 1 (GluA1) in MK-801-treated rats. Moreover, fisetin restored the phosphorylation levels of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinaseII (CaMKII), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) in MK-801-treated rats. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fisetin treatment can reverse the deficits of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory in a male rat model of schizophrenia by restoring the phosphorylation and surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunit, suggesting fisetin as a promising therapeutic candidate for schizophrenia-associated cognitive deficits.

AB  - We traced the changes in GABAergic parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons of the hippocampus and reticulo-thalamic nucleus (RT) as possible underlying mechanisms of the different local cortical and hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) microstructures during the non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep compared with anesthesia-induced unconsciousness by two anesthetics with different main mechanisms of action (ketamine/diazepam versus propofol). After 3 h of recording their sleep, the rats were divided into two experimental groups: one half received ketamine/diazepam anesthesia and the other half received propofol anesthesia. We simultaneously recorded the EEG of the motor cortex and hippocampus during sleep and during 1 h of surgical anesthesia. We performed immunohistochemistry and analyzed the PV and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) expression. PV suppression in the hippocampus and at RT underlies the global theta amplitude attenuation and hippocampal gamma augmentation that is a unique feature of ketamine-induced versus propofol-induced unconsciousness and NREM sleep. While PV suppression resulted in an increase in hippocampal PSD-95 expression, there was no imbalance between inhibition and excitation during ketamine/diazepam anesthesia compared with propofol anesthesia in RT. This increased excitation could be a consequence of a lower GABA interneuronal activity and an additional mechanism underlying the unique local EEG microstructure in the hippocampus during ketamine/diazepam anesthesia.

AB  - Neuregulins (NRGs) and their cognate neuronal receptor ERBB4, which is expressed in GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons, regulate numerous behaviors in rodents and have been identified as schizophrenia at-risk genes. ErbB4 transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate isoforms that either include (Cyt-1) or exclude (Cyt-2) exon 26, which encodes a cytoplasmic domain that imparts ErbB4 receptors the ability to signal via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Although ErbB4 Cyt-1/2 isoforms have been studied in transfected cultured cells, their functions in vivo remain unknown. Here, we generated ErbB4-floxed (ErbB4-Cyt1(fl/fl)) mice to investigate the effects of germline (constitutive) and conditional (acute) deletions of the Cyt-1 exon. Overall receptor mRNA levels remain unchanged in germline ErbB4 Cyt-1 knockouts (Cyt-1 KOs), with all transcripts encoding Cyt-2 variants. In contrast to mice lacking all ErbB4 receptor function, GABAergic interneuron migration and number are unaltered in Cyt-1 KOs. However, basal extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex are increased in Cyt-1 heterozygotes. Despite these neurochemical changes, Cyt-1 heterozygous and homozygous mice do not manifest behavioral abnormalities previously reported to be altered in ErbB4 null mice. To address the possibility that Cyt-2 variants compensate for the lack of Cyt-1 during development, we microinjected an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-recombinase (AAV-Cre) into the DA-rich ventral tegmental area of adult ErbB4-Cyt1(fl/fl) mice to acutely target exon 26. These conditional Cyt-1 KOs were found to exhibit behavioral abnormalities in the elevated plus maze and startle response, consistent with the idea that late exon 26 ablations may circumvent compensation by Cyt-2 variants. Taken together, our observations indicate that ErbB4 Cyt-1 function in vivo is important for DA balance and behaviors in adults.

AB  - The Hippo pathway effectors Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and its homolog TAZ are transcriptional coactivators that control gene expression by binding to TEA domain (TEAD) family transcription factors. The YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex is a key regulator of cancer-specific transcriptional programs, which promote tumor progression in diverse types of cancer, including breast cancer. Despite intensive efforts, the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex in cancer has remained largely undruggable due to an incomplete mechanistic understanding. Here, we report that nuclear phosphoinositides function as cofactors that mediate the binding of YAP/TAZ to TEADs. The enzymatic products of phosphoinositide kinases PIPKI alpha and IPMK, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (P(I3,4,5)P3), bridge the binding of YAP/TAZ to TEAD. Inhibiting these kinases or the association of YAP/TAZ with PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 attenuates YAP/TAZ interaction with the TEADs, the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes, and breast cancer cell motility. Although we could not conclusively exclude the possibility that other enzymatic products of IPMK such as inositol phosphates play a role in the mechanism, our results point to a previously unrecognized role of nuclear phosphoinositide signaling in control of YAP/TAZ activity and implicate this pathway as a potential therapeutic target in YAP/TAZ-driven breast cancer.
   The YAP-TEAD transcriptional regulators play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, but activation of this pathway remains incompletely understood at the molecular level. This study implicates nuclear inositol phospholipids as molecular glue mediating YAP-TEAD interaction, required for full activation of the YAP-TEAD complex in breast cancer.YAP binds to phosphoinositide species via a polybasic motif located in its TEAD-binding domain. Phosphoinositides generated by lipid kinases, i.e., PIPKIa and IPMK, facilitate the binding of YAP to TEAD. Inhibition of PIPKIa and IPMK, or blockade of phosphoinositide binding to YAP, diminishes the expression of YAP target genes. The phosphoinositide-driven enhancement of YAP-TEAD complex formation promotes breast cancer cell motility.
   Phosphoinositide products of lipid kinases PIPKIa and IPMK bind to the transcriptional co-activator YAP and enhance its interaction with the transcription factor TEAD.

AB  - Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) aim to optimize patient care by assisting physicians during the decision-making process. However, guideline adherence is highly affected by its unstructured format and aggregation of background information with disease-specific information. The objective of our study is to extract disease-specific information from CPG for enhancing its adherence ratio. In this research, we propose a semi-automatic mechanism for extracting disease-specific information from CPGs using pattern-matching techniques. We apply supervised and unsupervised machine-learning algorithms on CPG to extract a list of salient terms contributing to distinguishing recommendation sentences (RS) from non-recommendation sentences (NRS). Simultaneously, a group of experts also analyzes the same CPG and extract the initial patterns "Heuristic Patterns" using a group decision-making method, nominal group technique (NGT). We provide the list of salient terms to the experts and ask them to refine their extracted patterns. The experts refine patterns considering the provided salient terms. The extracted heuristic patterns depend on specific terms and suffer from the specialization problem due to synonymy and polysemy. Therefore, we generalize the heuristic patterns to part-of-speech (POS) patterns and unified medical language system (UMLS) patterns, which make the proposed method generalize for all types of CPGs. We evaluated the initial extracted patterns on asthma, rhinosinusitis, and hypertension guidelines with the accuracy of 76.92%, 84.63%, and 89.16%, respectively. The accuracy increased to 78.89%, 85.32%, and 92.07% with refined machine-learning assistive patterns, respectively. Our system assists physicians by locating disease-specific information in the CPGs, which enhances the physicians' performance and reduces CPG processing time. Additionally, it is beneficial in CPGs content annotation.

AB  - Endocannabinoid system activity declines with age in the hippocampus, along with the density of the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1). This process might contribute to brain ageing, as previous studies showed that the constitutive deletion of the CB1 receptor in mice leads to early onset of memory deficits and histological signs of ageing in the hippocampus including enhanced pro-inflammatory glial activity and reduced neurogenesis. Here we asked whether the CB1 receptor exerts its activity locally, directly influencing hippocampal ageing or indirectly, accelerating systemic ageing. Thus, we deleted the CB1 receptor site-specifically in the hippocampus of 2-month-old CB1(flox/flox) mice using stereotaxic injections of rAAV-Cre-Venus viruses and assessed their social recognition memory four months later. Mice with hippocampus-specific deletion of the CB1 receptor displayed a memory impairment, similarly as observed in constitutive knockouts at the same age. We next analysed neuroinflammatory changes in the hippocampus, neuronal density and cell proliferation. Site-specific mutant mice had enhanced glial cell activity, up-regulated levels of TNF alpha in the hippocampus and decreased cell proliferation, specifically in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Our data indicate that a local activity of the CB1 receptor in the hippocampus is required to maintain neurogenesis and to prevent neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.

AB  - Stressors cause activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and a systemic inflammatory response. As a newly proposed cell death manner in recent years, necroptosis occurs in a variety of tissue damage and inflammation. However, the role of necroptosis in HPA axis activation remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of necroptosis and its role in HPA activation in a porcine stress model induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Several typical stress behaviors like fever, anorexia, shivering and vomiting were observed in piglets after LPS injection. HPA axis was activated as shown by increased plasma cortisol concentration and mRNA expression of pituitary corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) and adrenal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). The mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6 in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal gland was elevated by LPS, accompanied by the activation of necroptosis indicated by higher mRNA expression of necroptosis signals including receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP) 1, RIP3, and phosphorylated mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Furthermore, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of necroptosis, inhibited necroptosis indicated by decreased mRNA levels of RIP1, RIP3, MLKL, and phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5) in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal gland. Nec-1 also decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-beta and inhibited the activation of the HPA axis indicated by lower plasma cortisol concentration and mRNA expression of adrenal type 2 melanocortin receptor (MC2R) and StAR. These findings suggest that necroptosis is present and contributes to HPA axis activation induced by LPS. These findings provide a potential possibility for necroptosis as an intervention target for alleviating HPA axis activation and stress responses.

AB  - The ketogenic diet (KD) is well known for its neuroprotective effect, but little is known about its prophylactic efficacy against chronic sleep deprivation (SD) induced cognitive deficiency. An emerging study indicated that ferroptosis plays an important role in neurologic diseases but has been rarely reported in chronic SD. Here, we investigated the prophylactic effects of a medium-chain triglyceride-enriched KD (MKD) and a long-chain triglyceride-enriched KD (LKD) on cognitive deficiency and revealed the underlying mechanism focused on ferroptosis in chronic SD model mice. The results showed that the MKD exhibited stronger effects than the LKD on improving cognitive deficiency via suppressing ferroptosis and improving synaptic plasticity. Further mechanism results indicated that MKD produced higher Sirt3 protein levels than LKD, which probably contributed to the synergistic effect of beta hydroxybutyric acid and decanoic acid. Our finds provide novel evidence for the KD as a safe and feasible dietary intervention to prevent chronic SD-induced cognitive deficiency, and suggest a better choice of medium-chain fatty acid-enriched KD.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, primarily affects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). In addition to severe motor dysfunction, PD patients appear apparent cognitive impairments in the late stage. Cognitive dysfunction is accompanied by synaptic transmission damage in the hippocampus. Cordycepin has been reported to alleviate cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative diseases.
   Purpose: The study aimed to estimate the protection roles of cordycepin on cognitive dysfunction in PD model and explore the potential mechanisms.
   Methods: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to establish the PD model in vivo and in vitro experiments. In the in vivo experiments, the C57BL / 6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with MPTP and intragastric administration with cordycepin. Open field test (OFT) was used to estimate the exercise ability. Spontaneous alternation behavioral (SAB) and morris water maze (MWM) tests were used to evaluate the learning and memory abilities. The hippocampal slices from C57BL / 6 and Kunming mice in the in vitro experiments were used to record field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) by electrophysiological methods. Western blotting was used to examine the level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the in vivo experiments and the levels of adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors (A(1)R and A(2A)R) in the in vitro experiments, respectively. The drugs of MPTP, cordycepin, DPCPX and SCH58261 were perfused through dissolving in artificial cerebrospinal fluid.
   Results: Cordycepin could significantly reduce the impairments on motor, exploration, spatial learning and memory induce by MPTP. MPTP reduced the amplitude of LTP in hippocampal CA1 area but cordycepin could improve LTP amplitudes. Cordycepin at dosage of 20 mg/kg also increased the TH level in SN. In the in vitro experiments, MPTP inhibited synaptic transmission in hippocampal Schaffer-CA1 pathway with a dose-dependent relationship, while cordycepin could reverse the inhibition of synaptic transmission. Furthermore, the roles of cordycepin on synaptic transmission could been attenuated in the presence of the antagonists of A(1)R and A(2A)R, DPCPX and SCH58261, respectively. Interestingly, the level of A(2A)R rather than A(1)R in hippocampus was significantly decreased in the cordycepin group as compared to the control.
   Conclusion: The present study has showed that cordycepin could improve cognitive function in the PD model induced by MPTP through regulating the adenosine A(2A) receptors. These findings were helpful to provide a new strategy for the dementia caused by Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Necroptosis, an actively researched form of programmed cell death closely related to the inflammatory response, is important in a variety of disorders and diseases. However, the relationship between necroptosis and muscle protein degradation in cachexia is rarely reported. This study aimed to elucidate whether necroptosis played a crucial role in muscle protein degradation in a cachexia model of weaned piglets induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In Experiment 1, the piglets were intraperitoneally injected with LPS to construct the cachexia model, and sacrificed at different time points after LPS injection (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h). In Experiment 2, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a necroptosis blocker, was pretreated in piglets before the injection of LPS to inhibit the occurrence of necroptosis. Blood and longissimus dorsi muscle samples were collected for further analysis. In the piglet model with LPS-induced cachexia, the morphological and ultrastructural damage, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-& alpha;, interleukin (IL)-1 & beta;, and IL-6 were dynamically elicited in longissimus dorsi muscle. Further, protein concentration and protein/DNA ratio were dynamically decreased, and protein degradation signaling pathway, containing serine/threonine kinase (Akt), Forkhead box O (FOXO), muscular atrophy F-box (MAFbx), and muscle ring finger protein 1 (MuRF1), was dynamically activated in piglets after LPS challenge. Moreover, mRNA and protein expression of necroptosis signals including receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP)1, RIP3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), were time-independently upregulated. Subsequently, when Nec-1 was used to inhibit necroptosis, the morphological damage, the increase in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the reduction in protein content and protein/DNA ratio, and the activation of the protein degradation signaling pathway were alleviated. These results provide the first evidence that necroptosis mediates muscle protein degradation in cachexia by LPS challenge.

AB  - Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is the leading cause of heart failure and has an extremely complicated pathogenesis. TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) is recognized as an important transcription factor that plays a key regulatory role in cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to explore the role of TEAD1 in cardiac hypertrophy and to clarify the regulatory role of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-mediated modifications. First, the expression level of TEAD1 in patients with heart failure, mice, and cardiomyocytes is investigated. It is discovered that TEAD1 is modified by SUMO1 during cardiac hypertrophy and that the process of deSUMOylation is regulated by SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1). Lysine 173 is an essential site for TEAD1 SUMOylation, which affects the protein stability, nuclear localization, and DNA-binding ability of TEAD1 and enhances the interaction between TEAD1 and its transcriptional co-activator yes-associated protein 1 in the Hippo pathway. Finally, adeno-associated virus serotype 9 is used to construct TEAD1 wild-type and KR mutant mice and demonstrated that the deSUMOylation of TEAD1 markedly exacerbated cardiomyocyte enlargement in vitro and in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy. The results provide novel evidence that the SUMOylation of TEAD1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for hypertrophy-related heart failure.

AB  - We examine similar and differential effects of two senolytic treatments, ABT-263 and dasatinib + quercetin (D + Q), in preserving cognition, markers of peripheral senescence, and markers of brain aging thought to underlie cognitive decline. Male F344 rats were treated from 12 to 18 months of age with D + Q, ABT-263, or vehicle, and were compared to young (6 months). Both senolytic treatments rescued memory, preserved the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and prevented the age-related decline in hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function associated with impaired cognition. Senolytic treatments decreased senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the plasma (IL-1 beta, IP-10, and RANTES), with some markers more responsive to D + Q (TNFa) or ABT-263 (IFN?, leptin, EGF). ABT-263 was more effective in decreasing senescence genes in the spleen. Both senolytic treatments decreased the expression of immune response and oxidative stress genes and increased the expression of synaptic genes in the dentate gyrus (DG). However, D + Q influenced twice as many genes as ABT-263. Relative to D + Q, the ABT-263 group exhibited increased expression of DG genes linked to cell death and negative regulation of apoptosis and microglial cell activation. Furthermore, D + Q was more effective at decreasing morphological markers of microglial activation. The results indicate that preserved cognition was associated with the removal of peripheral senescent cells, decreasing systemic inflammation that normally drives neuroinflammation, BBB breakdown, and impaired synaptic function. Dissimilarities associated with brain transcription indicate divergence in central mechanisms, possibly due to differential access.

AB  - Computational simulations with data-driven physiological detail can foster a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in cognition. Here, we utilize the wealth of cellular properties from Hippocampome.org to study neural mechanisms of spatial coding with a spiking continuous attractor network model of medial entorhinal cortex circuit activity. The primary goal is to investigate if adding such realistic constraints could produce firing patterns similar to those measured in real neurons. Biological characteristics included in the work are excitability, connectivity, and synaptic signaling of neuron types defined primarily by their axonal and dendritic morphologies. We investigate the spiking dynamics in specific neuron types and the synaptic activities between groups of neurons. Modeling the rodent hippocampal formation keeps the simulations to a computationally reasonable scale while also anchoring the parameters and results to experimental measurements. Our model generates grid cell activity that well matches the spacing, size, and firing rates of grid fields recorded in live behaving animals from both published datasets and new experiments performed for this study. Our simulations also recreate different scales of those properties, e.g., small and large, as found along the dorsoventral axis of the medial entorhinal cortex. Computational exploration of neuronal and synaptic model parameters reveals that a broad range of neural properties produce grid fields in the simulation. These results demonstrate that the continuous attractor network model of grid cells is compatible with a spiking neural network implementation sourcing data-driven biophysical and anatomical parameters from Hippocampome.org. The software (version 1.0) is released as open source to enable broad community reuse and encourage novel applications.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common sinonasal condition that debilitates quality of life. Nasal sprays are inefficient for targeting the sinuses because of the highly inertial atomised droplets. This study evaluated sinus drug delivery via a nebuliser in a human nasal cavity using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of different breathing conditions. The nebuliser was quantified through high-speed imaging of the spray plume and average velocity, while laser diffraction was used for droplet size distributions. A CT scan was acquired of a 75-year-old male with a confirmed diagnosis of CRS, and airway segmentation was performed to extract the nasal cavity and sinuses. Virtual surgery was then performed on the computational model. Two nozzle designs for the nebuliser under normal breathing, slow exhalation, and breath hold were investigated. The results demonstrated that drug delivery with a fully blocked nostril with a breath hold notably improved deposition targeting the maxillary sinuses and ethmoid sinuses, while using a nozzle that allowed co-flow of air was recommended for targeting the frontal and sphenoid sinuses.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an intellectual developmental disorder characterized, inter alia, by deficits in the short-term processing of neural information, such as sensory processing and working memory. The primary cause of FXS is the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), which is profoundly involved in synaptic function and plasticity. Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may play important roles in functions that are affected by FXS. Recent evidence points to the crucial involvement of the presynaptic calcium sensor synaptotagmin-7 (Syt-7) in STSP. However, how the loss of FMRP affects STSP and Syt-7 have been insufficiently studied. Furthermore, males and females are affected differently by FXS, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible changes in STSP and the expression of Syt-7 in the dorsal (DH) and ventral (VH) hippocampus of adult males and females in a Fmr1-knockout (KO) rat model of FXS. We found that the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and frequency facilitation/depression (FF/D), two forms of STSP, as well as the expression of Syt-7, are normal in adult KO males, but the PPR is increased in the ventral hippocampus of KO females (6.4 +/- 3.7 vs. 18.3 +/- 4.2 at 25 ms in wild type (WT) and KO, respectively). Furthermore, we found no gender-related differences, but did find robust region-dependent difference in the STSP (e.g., the PPR at 50 ms: 50.0 +/- 5.5 vs. 17.6 +/- 2.9 in DH and VH of WT male rats; 53.1 +/- 3.6 vs. 19.3 +/- 4.6 in DH and VH of WT female rats; 48.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 19.1 +/- 3.3 in DH and VH of KO male rats; and 51.2 +/- 3.3 vs. 24.7 +/- 4.3 in DH and VH of KO female rats). AMPA receptors are similarly expressed in the two hippocampal segments of the two genotypes and in both genders. Also, basal excitatory synaptic transmission is higher in males compared to females. Interestingly, we found more than a twofold higher level of Syt-7, not synaptotagmin-1, in the dorsal compared to the ventral hippocampus in the males of both genotypes (0.43 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02 in DH and VH of WT male rats, and 0.6 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.04 in DH and VH of KO male rats) and in the WT females (0.97 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.09 in DH and VH). These results point to the susceptibility of the female ventral hippocampus to FMRP loss. Importantly, the different levels of Syt-7, which parallel the higher score of the dorsal vs. ventral hippocampus on synaptic facilitation, suggest that Syt-7 may play a pivotal role in defining the striking differences in STSP along the long axis of the hippocampus.

AB  - Neuronal hyperactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway may play a role in driving the pathological sequelae that follow status epilepticus. Animal studies using pharmacological tools provide support for this hypothesis, however, systemic inhibition of mTOR-a growth pathway active in every mammalian cell-limits conclusions on cell type specificity. To circumvent the limitations of pharmacological approaches, we developed a viral/genetic strategy to delete Raptor or Rictor, inhibiting mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively, from excitatory hippocampal neurons after status epilepticus in mice. Raptor or Rictor was deleted from roughly 25% of hippocampal granule cells, with variable involvement of other hippocampal neurons, after pilocarpine status epilepticus. Status epilepticus induced the expected loss of hilar neurons, sprouting of granule cell mossy fiber axons and reduced c-Fos activation. Gene deletion did not prevent these changes, although Raptor loss reduced the density of c-Fos-positive granule cells overall relative to Rictor groups. Findings demonstrate that mTOR signaling can be effectively modulated with this approach and further reveal that blocking mTOR signaling in a minority (25%) of granule cells is not sufficient to alter key measures of status epilepticus-induced pathology. The approach is suitable for producing higher deletion rates, and altering the timing of deletion, which may lead to different outcomes.

AB  - Camels are essential to the livelihoods of pastoral communities in dry and semi-arid regions. Although camel research in Europe is not as prominent as in camel-rearing regions, it has gained considerable interest in recent years, focusing on various aspects such as disease transmission, genetics, and the nutritional benefits of camel products. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of camel research in Europe. It evaluates the evolution of this field, emphasizing publication trends, citation impact, collaboration networks and emerging topics. Data was sourced from the Scopus database and 1385 documents were analyzed. The analysis was conducted using VOSviewer and the Bibliometrix package in R Studio. The analysis revealed steady growth in camel research output, with a 5.51% annual increase from 1995 to 2024. A total of 5094 authors contributed to the field, with an average of 22.61 citations per document and 77.69% of documents are from international collaboration. European countries, particularly France, the UK, and Germany acted as key hubs for international collaboration. The bibliometric analysis identified five main keyword clusters in camel research in Europe. These clusters include themes such as camel physiology and veterinary medicine, the nutritional and biochemical properties of camel milk, infectious disease and antibiotic resistance, zoonotic diseases and genetics, and immunology and molecular biology, reflecting the diverse research areas within this field. Future research should focus on expanding sources, including non-English publications, and exploring advanced technologies such as genomics and AIto enhance the understanding of camel biology and its global impact.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and degenerative disorder accompanied by cognitive decline, which could be promoted by mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa(2+)) homeostasis Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a key channel of mCa(2+) uptake, may be a target for AD treatment. In the present study, we reveal for the first time that MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons improves the memory performance of APP/PS1/tau mice through radial arm maze task. Western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Golgi staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ELISA results demonstrate that MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons upregulates the levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin (SYP), and increases the numbers of synapses and dendritic spines. Meanwhile, MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons decreases the neuroinflammatory response induced by astrogliosis and high levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, and improves the PINK1-Parkin mitophagy signaling pathway and increases the level of Beclin-1 but decreases the level of P62. In addition, MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons recovers the average volume and number of mitochondria. These data confirm that MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons improves the memory performance of APP/PS1/tau mice through ameliorating the synapse structure and function, relieving the inflammation response and recovering mitophagy, indicating that MCU inhibition has the potential to be developed as a novel therapy for AD.

AB  - Maternal stress (MS) has long-term effects on fetal brain development and consequently increases the risk of neuropsychiatric diseases in the offspring, however, the mechanism that links between early life stress and subsequent neuropsychiatric diseases is still not clear. It is well known that both neuroinflammation and autophagy dysfunction contributes to the pathology of psychiatric disorders. We hypothesized that MS might alter autophagy function and activate the neuroimmune response in the pup's brain. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of MS on the expression of the autophagy biomarker and neuroimmune response in the hippocampus of rat pups. Results revealed that MS-induced a long-term decrease of LC3B-II throughout the postnatal periods, together with an increase of IL-6 and IL-10 in the hippocampus of rat pups during adolescence. These changes lasted at least until adulthood. Results from the In vitro studies showed that a partially toxic dose of corticosterone (CORT) induced a significant decrease of LC3B-II, together with an increase of IL-6 and IL-10, in the SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, suppression of autophagy by mycophenolic acid (MPA) leads to an increased IL-6 and IL-10 expression in the CORT-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Findings suggested that CORT decreased autophagy dysfunction could activate neuroimmune response in the SH-SY5Y cells. Results from this study provides initial evidence for the relationship between stress hormone, autophagy dysfunction, and neuroimmune activation, which may be the linking mechanism between early-life stress and subsequent neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), whereas the role of bone marrow immune cells in the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear. Here, the study reveals that compared to matched healthy individuals, AD patients have higher circulating grancalcin (GCA) levels, which negatively correlate with cognitive function. Bone marrow-derived GCA(+) immune cells, which secret abundant GCA and increase during aging, preferentially invaded the hippocampus and cortex of AD mouse model in a C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 10 (CCR10)-dependent manner. Transplanting GCA(+) immune cells or direct stereotaxic injection of recombinant GCA protein intensified amyloid plaque load and aggravated cognitive and memory impairments. In contrast, genetic ablation of GCA in the hematopoietic compartment improves cognitive and memory function. Mechanistically, GCA competitively binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in microglia, thus inhibiting phagocytosis and clearance of A beta and potentiating neuropathological changes. Importantly, GCA-neutralizing antibody treatment rejuvenated cognitive and memory function and constrained AD progression. Together, the study demonstrates a pathological role of GCA(+) immune cells instigating cognitive and memory decline, suggesting that GCA(+) immune cells can be a potential target for innovative therapeutic strategies in AD.

AB  - As a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) interacts with numerous nucleic acids and proteins and is involved in various cellular functions. Available literature indicates that it can regulate dendritic spine density through the extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK) - brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway, which is crucial to retain the synaptic plasticity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and mouse depression models. However, ERK upstream regulatory kinase has not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, it remains unexplored whether hnRNPK may impact the depressive condition via the ERK pathway. The present study addressed this issue by integrating approaches of genetics, molecular biology, behavioral testing. We found that hnRNPK in the brain was mainly distributed in the hip-pocampal neurons; that it was significantly downregulated in mice that displayed stress-induced depression-like behaviors; and that the level of hnRNPK markedly decreased in MDD patients from the GEO database. Further in vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that the changes in the expressions of BDNF and PSD95 and in the phos-phorylation of ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) paralleled the variation of hnRNPK levels in the ventral hippocampal neurons in mice with depression-like behaviors. Finally, esketamine treatment significantly increased the level of hnRNPK in mice. These findings evidence that hnRNPK involved in the pathogenesis of depression via the ERK-BDNF pathway, pinpointing hnRNPK as a potential therapeutic target in treating MDD patients.

AB  - This paper investigated the effect of kangaroo mother care (KMC) in the early postpartum period on cortisol levels and immune factors in breast milk. This quasi-experimental study was conducted at the obstetrics clinic of a university hospital in western Turkiye. The sample consisted of 63 mothers and their infants. All mothers had a cesarean delivery. Participants were divided into control (n = 32) and experimental groups (n = 31). The control group received routine care at the clinic. The experimental group received KMC for the first 3 days after birth in addition to the routine care at the clinic. Milk samples were collected on the third day after delivery to examine cortisol, IgA, IgM, and IgG levels. All parameters were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The experimental group had lower cortisol levels (17.740 +/- 1.438) than the control group (18.503 +/- 1.449) (p < .05). This result showed that the difference between the two groups was clinically significant (effect size = .53). There was no significant difference in IgA, IgM, and IgG levels between the groups (p > .05). The experimental and control groups had similar immunological factors, but the former had lower cortisol levels than the latter. Therefore, healthcare professionals should encourage mothers to provide KMC to their infants as soon as possible.

AB  - The present study examined the medium- and long-term effects of early environmental enrichment (EE) on neuromotor, nociceptive, cognitive, behavioral, and neurochemical parameters in newborn rats repeatedly exposed to morphine. The study employed 90 Wistar rats: 10 adult nulliparous females and 80 male pups. Litter was split into standard and EE housing. Following, half of each litter received saline (S) or morphine (M) injections, resulting in four groups: SC + S, EE + S, SC + M, and EE + M. EE was applied from PND1 to PND21, while morphine or saline was given daily (5 mu g/s.c.) from PND8 to PND14. Neuromotor development was similar between groups. In the OF test, morphine reduced outer and total crossings, whereas EE increased inner crossings and rearings. Adult rats showed a decrease in outer and total crossings and grooming and an increase in rearing. EE increased the number of protected and unprotected head dipping. Adult rats showed an increase in protected head dipping. Adult rats showed a lower recognition index, and, when exposed to EE, a lower anxiety index and analgesia. EE increased brainstem and hippocampal BDNF levels. Adult rats had increased hypothalamus, spinal cord, and brainstem BDNF levels, an increase in the spinal cord, and decreased hypothalamus TNF-alpha levels. This study demonstrated that early-life EE raises BDNF levels in the brainstem and hippocampus of rats and modifies their behaviors (such as nociception, exploration, and anxiety) in a state-dependent manner (morphine and age).

AB  - Cuprizone is commonly used to induce neuronal demyelination in mice. In the present study, we compared the cuprizone-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum and investigated the effects of cuprizone on proliferating cells and neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus of young adult and aged mice. 5-week- and 23-month-old mice were fed a normal diet or a 0.2% cuprizone-enriched diet for 5 weeks. Mice fed a cuprizone-supplemented diet showed a significant reduction in myelin basic protein-positive structures in the corpus callosum, with the reduction in myelinated fibers being confirmed by electron microscopic analysis. In addition, we observed a marked increase in Ki67-positive proliferating cells and doublecortin-immunoreactive neuroblasts in young adult mice in response to cuprizone treatment, although not in aged mice, as the basal levels of these cells were significantly lower in these older mice. Furthermore, Ser133-phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB)-positive nuclei and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were significantly reduced in young adult mice following cuprizone treatment in young adult, although again not in the aged mice. However, in both young adult and aged mice, there were no significant reductions in hippocampal mature neurons in response to cuprizone treatment. These observations indicate that in the mice of both age groups a cuprizone-supplemented diet contributes to an increase in demyelination in the corpus callosum and neural progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus, although the damage is more pronounced in young adult mice. This demyelination and reduction in neural progenitor cells may be associated with changes in the levels of BDNF and pCREB in the dentate gyrus.

AB  - Several experimental and clinical findings suggest that ethanol consumption during pregnancy activates an oxidative-inflammatory cascade followed by wide apoptotic neurodegeneration within several brain areas, including the hippocampus. Crocin can protect neurons because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. This study evaluated the crocin protective impact on ethanol-related neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus of rat pups exposed to alcohol over postnatal days. Ethanol (5.25 g/kg) was administrated in milk solution (27.8 ml/kg) by intragastric intubation 2-10 days after birth. The animals received crocin (15, 30, and 45 mg/kg) 2-10 days after birth. The hippocampus-dependent memory and spatial learning were evaluated 36 days after birth using the Morris water maze task. Further, the concentrations of TNF-alpha and antioxidant enzymes were determined using ELISA assay to examine the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Also, immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(Iba-1), and caspase-3 expression. The administration of crocin significantly attenuated spatial memory impairment (P < 0.01) after ethanol neurotoxicity. Also, crocin led to a significant enhancement in SOD (P < 0.05) and GSH-PX (P < 0.01), whereas it caused a reduction in the TNF-alpha and MDA concentrations compared to the ethanol group (P < 0.01). Moreover, the hippocampal level of caspase-3 (P < 0.01) and the number of GFAP and Iba-1-positive cells decreased in the crocin group (P < 0.001). Crocin suppresses apoptotic signaling mediated by the oxidative-inflammatory cascade in rat pups exposed to ethanol after birth.

AB  - Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a neuronal protein mediating multiple functions, with its absence resulting in one of the most common monogenic causes of autism, Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Analyses of FXS pathophysiology have identified a range of aberrations in synaptic signaling pathways and plasticity associated with group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. These studies, however, have mostly focused on the post-synaptic functions of FMRP and mGlu receptor activation, and relatively little is known about their presynaptic effects. Neurotransmitter release is mediated via multiple forms of synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion, each of which contributes to specific neuronal functions. The impacts of mGlu receptor activation and loss of FMRP on these SV fusion events remain unexplored. Here we combined electrophysiological and fluorescence imaging analyses on primary hippocampal cultures prepared from an Fmr1 knockout (KO) rat model. Compared to wild-type (WT) hippocampal neurons, KO neurons displayed an increase in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs), as well as spontaneous SV fusion events. Pharmacological activation of mGlu receptors in WT neurons caused a similar increase in spontaneous SV fusion and sEPSC frequency. Notably, this increase in SV fusion was not observed when spontaneous activity was blocked using the sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin. Importantly, the effect of mGlu receptor activation on spontaneous SV fusion was occluded in Fmr1 KO neurons. Together, our results reveal that FMRP represses spontaneous presynaptic SV fusion, whereas mGlu receptor activation increases this event. This reciprocal control appears to be mediated via their regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability.

AB  - Motor deficit is a core symptom of Rett syndrome, a rare neurological disease caused in most cases by mutations of the methyl-CpG-binding protein2 (MECP2) gene. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors improve motor coordination in Mecp2 heterozygous (Het) mice and serotonin depletion prevented this effect. Here, we assess alterations in indole levels in various brain regions and whether boosting brain serotonin synthesis with the serotonin precursors tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin rescued motor coordination deficit of Mecp2 Het mice. Motor coordination was assessed in the accelerated rotarod during and after systemic administration of serotonin precursors for 2-3 weeks. Since no data are available, the effect of alpha-lactalbumin on tryptophan, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels was evaluated in various brain regions in order to identify the dose of ALAC to evaluate on motor coordination. As compared to WT, Mecp2 Het mice show reduced levels of serotonin in the whole brain, hippocampus, brainstem and cerebral cortex, but not the striatum. Reduced levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were observed in the hippocampus and brainstem. Doses of serotonin precursors increasing brain tryptophan and/or serotonin production and metabolism had no effect on motor coordination. The results indicate that boosting serotonin synthesis is not sufficient to improve motor coordination of Mecp2 Het mice.

AB  - Renewable energy resources have received attention due to concerns about oil depletion and climate change consequences. In the aviation sector, the development of renewable aviation fuel is identified as a promising alternative to replace fossil jet fuel in the current infrastructure. Thus, obtaining the alternative optimal designs to satisfy the upcoming demand has become a crucial factor. Therefore, a mathematical model of biojet fuel production supply, by hydroprocessing inedible oils (such as Jatropha curcas, camelina, palm stearin, and Ricinus communis), was proposed along with renewable hydrogen production (produced from residual biomass in oil extraction). Considering the Mexican airport network, it was possible to identify the best economic scenario with a profit of 16,893,146 USD/y and 27.6% CO, emission reduction, in comparison with fossil jet fuel use. Additionally, the best solutions show that it is possible to satisfy the national jet fuel demand (4,157.5 ktonne/y) with the produced renewable fuel jet and even increase the profit using surplus sales (315 ktonne/y). This is possible with the amount of biomass harvested in 26 states in Mexico, and only 11 biojet fuel production facilities are installed.

AB  - Novel treatments, screening, and detection methods have prolonged the lives of numerous cancer patients worldwide. Unfortunately, existing and many promising new chemotherapeutics can cause deleterious, off-target side effects in normal tissue and organ systems. The central and peripheral nervous systems are widely recognized as frequent off-target effectors of anticancer drugs which can produce persistent neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms collectively termed "chemo-brain". Following chemotherapy, patients report several forms of cognitive impairment occurring acutely and sometimes persisting years after treatment. There are no effective treatments for cognitive decline induced by chemotherapeutics, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized and understood. In this study, we find that chronic treatment with two common chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and gemcitabine, impairs brain region-specific metabolism, hippocampus-dependent memory formation, and stress response behavior. This corresponds to reduced hippocampal synaptic excitability, altered neuronal signal transduction, and neuroinflammation. These findings underline that a better understanding of the basic pathological consequences of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment is the first step toward improving cancer treatment survivorship.

AB  - Existing research methods for biological effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) are comparison between groups, with inability to exclude individual differences in cell sensitivity or changes in conditions during experiment. This work proposed a method for real-time effects observation of ELF-EMFs in the same cell and same condition. The stability domain was used to identify the stability of hippocampal neurons before ELF-EMFs exposure. At the time of electromagnetic field intervention (t=60 s), ELF-EMFs were exposed to hippocampal neurons at 0, 0.09, 0.38, 0.76, 7.33 and 14.78 mT, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ fluorescence response curves of hippocampal neurons were recorded in real-time, and the autocorrelation function between ELF-EMFs and fluorescence response was established. The results showed as follows: (1) The step properties of fluorescence response were clear at the burst times of ROS and Ca2+, which were important indicator to identify the real-time response; (2) The response time of ROS and Ca2+ to ELF-EMFs were delayed and inconsistent; (3) ROS and Ca2+ had dose-dependent response to ELF-EMFs; (4) The response of ROS to ELF-EMFs was complex; (5) The response of Ca2+ to ELF-EMFs was asymptotically stable. When correlation function exceeded 0.3, the real-time response of ELF-EMFs and ROS/Ca2+ was correlated. It was concluded that a real-time response method of intracellular ROS and Ca2+ to ELF-EMFs exposure was feasible for the evaluation of electromagnetic bioeffects.

AB  - Wushen (WS) is a mixed food containing 55 natural products that is beneficial to human health. This study aimed to reveal the preventive effect of WS on aging via a combined analysis of gut microbiome and metabolome. Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were used as aging model and senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice as control. The mice were fed four diet types; control diet (for SAMR1 mice), standard diet (for SAMP8 mice, as SD group), WS diet, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT; transplanted from aging-WS mice). Our results showed that the weight, food intake, neurological function, and general physical conditions significantly improved in WS-fed mice compared to those fed with SD. The CA1 hippocampal region in WS-fed aged mice showed fewer shriveled neurons and increased neuronal layers compared to that of the SD group. WS-fed mice showed a decrease in malondialdehyde and an increase in superoxide dismutase levels in the brain; additionally, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels significantly decreased, whereas IL-2 levels and the proportion of lymphocytes, CD3+CD8+ T, and CD4+IFN gamma+T cells increased in WS-fed mice. After fed with WS, the abundance of Ruminococcus and Butyrivibrio markedly increased, whereas Lachnoclostridium and Ruminiclostridium significantly decreased in the aging mice. In addition, 887 differentially expressed metabolites were identified in fecal samples, among these, Butyrivibrio was positively correlated with D-glucuronic acid and Ruminococcus was positively associated with 5-acetamidovalerate. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the impact of WS on aging, and WS may be a valuable diet for preventing aging.

AB  - Recent investigations of COVID-19 have largely focused on the effects of this novel virus on the vital organs in order to efficiently assist individuals who have recovered from the disease. In the present study we used hippocampal tissue samples extracted from people who died after COVID-19. Utilizing histological techniques to analyze glial and neuronal cells we illuminated a massive degeneration of neuronal cells and changes in glial cells morphology in hippocampal samples. The results showed that in hippocampus of the studied brains there were morphological changes in pyramidal cells, an increase in apoptosis, a drop in neurogenesis, and change in spatial distribution of neurons in the pyramidal and granular layer. It was also demonstrated that COVID-19 alter the morphological characteristics and distribution of astrocyte and microglia cells. While the exact mechanism(s) by which the virus causes neuronal loss and morphology in the central nervous system (CNS) remains to be determined, it is necessary to monitor the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on CNS compartments like the hippocampus in future investigations. As a result of what happened in the hippocampus secondary to COVID-19, memory impairment may be a long-term neurological complication which can be a predisposing factor for neurodegenerative disorders through neuroinflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms.

AB  - Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) has been reported to play an important role in various cancers. We found that high FABP5 expression was associated with poor histological differentiation and vascular invasion. High FABP5 expression indicated a poor prognosis. Downregulation of FABP5 suppressed cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the Hippo signaling pathway was related to FABP5. We found that overexpression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) could partially reverse the effect of FABP5 knockdown on growth and apoptosis. The FABP5 inhibitor SBFI-26 suppressed the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of gastric cancer (GC) cells and interfered with the Hippo signaling pathway by inhibiting YAP1. Our data suggested that FABP5 might act as a potential target associated with the Hippo signaling pathway for GC treatment.

AB  - Posture patterns of sows or gilts could reflect their welfare, estrus, and health status. However, due to the large animal-to-staff ratio at sow farms, there is not yet a solution to closely monitor individual sows' posture patterns to determine their estrus status and make other managemental decisions. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models in recognizing sows' posture patterns using images of a LiDAR camera. The camera equipped on a wall-mounted robotic platform was used to take images of 21 sows from the back view at a 5-minute interval. Four types of images (IR: infrared image, DI: depth image, PCI: point cloud image, PCI_IR: point cloud image with IR as the alpha channel) were used to identify the postures of individual sows. Five CNN models were evaluated in this study, including SP_CNN (5 layers), VGG16, MobileNet, Xception, and DenseNet121. Results showed that the image types had no significant impact on the validation accuracy of posture recognition (99.8 & PLUSMN; 0.2%, p > 0.1). Statistical results indicate that VGG16 required significantly more time (t = 2,218 ms) than the other four models in processing single images without significantly improving identification accuracy. The SP_CNN model had a significantly lower validation accuracy (99.6%) and used significantly less image processing time (t = 91 ms) than the rest of the models. It was found that for SP_CNN, DI images outperformed the other three types of images. Although no significant difference was found in validation accuracy (99.91% & PLUSMN; 0.04%) among MobileNet, Xception, and Densnet121. The MobileNet required significantly less time to process single images (t = 210 ms). The Xception model with PCI_IR images showed the highest test accuracy (98.6%). The results also show that both hourly and daily activity levels (standing or sitting) were significantly higher on the day of the onset of estrus than the values on the previous days. Meanwhile, the daily idle level (lateral lying) decreased significantly from two days prior to the onset of estrus. The decrease in daily idle level was drastic on the day of onset of estrus (12.9 & PLUSMN; 7.1%) and before (15.0 & PLUSMN; 12.0%). The study also found that monitoring intervals should not exceed 15 min for accurately quantifying sows' activity levels. The study concluded that posture patterns derived from the robotic imaging system could help detect sows' estrus status.

AB  - The ancient Indian medical system, Ayurveda, has identified numerous plants with antioxidant properties as beneficial for treating neurological diseases. The active ingredients in herbal plants are utilized to modulate synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative disorders. Different strategies are used to treat neuronal diseases and their secondary consequences by modifying synaptic plasticity. Because herbal remedies are inexpensive and have fewer adverse effects, they are advantageous. The main strategies for achieving this were to study the phases of in vivo Tagetes Erecta (Marigold) Extract (MaQxan (TM) (20:2) administration in rats and, secondly, to study the potency of gene expression alteration on BDNF, TrkB, CREB, CAMKII, NMDA-R, nAChR, mGluR, and MAPK genes in the hippocampus. This study demonstrated that Tagetes Erecta (Marigold) Extract (MaQxan(TM ()20:2) at medium and high doses (10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg) modulated the genes for BDNF, TrKB, CAMKII, NMDA-R, nAChR, mGluR, and MAP-K, showing neurotransmitter and synaptic plasticity control efficacy in animal models. Our study advances knowledge of the effects of Tagetes erecta (Marigold) extract (MaQxan (TM) (20:2)) on the central nervous system. Our results reveal that MaQxan (TM) (20:2) significantly enhances memory retention and synaptic plasticity while maintaining neuronal integrity. Hence, the synaptic plasticity improvement shown by MaQxan (TM) (20:2) can be attributed to the expression of plasticity-related proteins within the hippocampus, indicating its potential as a novel intervention for enhancing neurotransmission and cognitive function. These findings suggest that MaQxan (TM) (20:2) may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for improving synaptic plasticity and alleviating depression and stress-related cognitive deficits.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with behavioral and cognitive impairments. Unfortunately, the drugs the Food and Drug Administration currently approved for AD have shown low effectiveness in delaying the progression of the disease. The focus has shifted to non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) because of the challenges associated with pharmacological treatments for AD. One such intervention is environmental enrichment (EE), which has been reported to restore cognitive decline associated with AD effectively. However, the therapeutic mechanisms by which EE improves symptoms associated with AD remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the alleviating effects of EE on AD symptoms using histological, proteomic, and neurotransmitter-related analyses. Wild-type (WT) and 5XFAD mice were maintained in standard housing or EE conditions for 4 weeks. First, we confirmed the mitigating effects of EE on cognitive impairment in an AD animal model. Then, histological analysis revealed that EE reduced A beta accumulation, neuroinflammation, neuronal death, and synaptic loss in the AD brain. Moreover, proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that EE enhanced synapse- and neurotransmitter-related networks and upregulated synapse- and neurotransmitter-related proteins in the AD brain. Furthermore, neurotransmitter-related analyses showed an increase in acetylcholine and serotonin concentrations as well as a decrease in polyamine concentration in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice raised under EE conditions. Our findings demonstrate that EE restores cognitive impairment by alleviating AD pathology and regulating synapse-related proteins and neurotransmitters. Our study provided neurological evidence for the application of NPIs in treating AD.

AB  - Atherosclerosis, the major underlying pathology of cardiovascular disease, commences with the binding and trapping of lipids on modified proteoglycans, with hyperelongated glycosaminoglycan chains. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta stimulates glycosaminoglycan elongation in vascular smooth muscle cells. We have recently shown that this TGF-beta signaling pathway involves reactive oxygen species (ROS). YY-11 is a dodecapeptide derived from camel milk and it has antioxidant activity. We have investigated the role of YY-11 in blocking ROS signaling and downstream atherogenic responses. YY-11 inhibited TGF-beta stimulated ROS production and inhibited the expression of genes for glycosaminoglycan chain elongation as a component of an in vitro model of atherosclerosis. This study provides a biochemical mechanism for the role of camel milk as a potential nutritional product to contribute to the worldwide amelioration of cardiovascular disease. Practical applications The identification of readily accessible foods with antioxidant properties would provide a convenient and cost-effective approach community wide reducing oxidative stress induced pathologies such as atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that camel milk-derived peptide is an antioxidant that can inhibit growth factor-mediated proteoglycan modification in vitro. As proteoglycan modification is being recognized as one of the earliest atherogenic responses, these data support the notion of camel milk as a suitable nutritional product to contribute to the prevention of early stage of atherosclerosis development.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks include amyloid-beta eta (A beta) and tau proteins aggregates, neurite degeneration, microglial activation with cognitive impairment. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/Glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (PI3K/AKT/GSK-3) pathway is essential for neuroprotection, cell survival and proliferation by blocking apoptosis. This study aimed to assess protective role of nanocurcumin (NCMN) as strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with elucidating its synergistic effects with Donepezil as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on AD in rats via modulating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathway. The experiment was performed on 70 male Wistar albino rats divided into seven groups (control, NCMN, Donepezil, AD-model, Donepezil cotreatment, NCMN only co-treatment, and NCMN+Donepezil combined treatment). Behavioral and biochemical investigations as cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, nitric oxide, superoxidedismutase, and catalase), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Tau, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1), Glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK-3 beta) and toll-like receptor-4 were evaluated. Treatment with NCMN improved memory, locomotion, neuronal differentiation by activating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathway. These results were confirmed by histological studies in hippocampus.

AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a subtype of bile duct cancer usually diagnosed late with a low survival rate and no satisfactorily systemic treatment. Recently, regorafenib has been accepted as a second-line treatment for CCA patients. In this study, we investigated the potential signal transduction pathways mediated by regorafenib. We established a transcriptomic database for regorafenib-treated CCA cells using expression microarray chips. Our data indicate that regorafenib inhibits yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activity in various CCA cells. In addition, we demonstrated that YAP1 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, including E-cadherin and SNAI2. We further examined YAP1 activity, phosphorylation status, and expression levels of YAP1 downstream target genes in the regorafenib model. We found that regorafenib dramatically suppressed these events in CCA cells. Moreover, in vivo results revealed that regorafenib could significantly inhibit lung foci formation and tumorigenicity. Most importantly, regorafenib and amphiregulin (AREG) neutralize antibody exhibited synergistic effects against CCA cells. In a clinical setting, patients with high YAP1 and EMT expression had a worse survival rate than patients with low YAP1, and EMT expression did. In addition, we found that YAP1 upregulated the downstream target amphiregulin in CCA. Our findings suggest that AREG neutralizing antibody antibodies combined with regorafenib can reverse the CCA metastatic phenotype and EMT in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide novel therapeutic strategies to combat the metastasis of CCA.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also known as WWTR1) are core downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, which is involved in diverse biological processes. The oncogenic effects of YAP and TAZ in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have recently been reported; however, their roles in SCLC remain unclear. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on lung cancer tissues and Western blotting (WB) on lung cancer cell lines were performed to examine the expression of YAP1. Genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 was then used to knockout the YAP1 gene in the H69AR cell line. An RNA-sequence analysis, gene ontology (GO) analysis, WB, cell counting assay, invasion assays, and xenograft studies were conducted on these cells to investigate the biological roles of YAP1. IHC revealed that insulinoma-associated protein 1 was expressed in most cases (28 out of 32 cases), while only four cases expressed YAP1. The knockout of YAP1 in H69AR cells, a chemically induced SCLC-Y subtype, reduced cell proliferation and invasion capacity and restored drug sensitivity. Xenograft assays revealed that the knockout of YAP1 suppressed cell proliferation. Tumor tissues showed the expression of neuroendocrine markers and a low Ki-67 index. In SCLC, YAP1 plays an important role in biological functions, such as cell proliferation, EMT, drug sensitivity, and neuroendocrine differentiation.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the human population, for which there is currently no cure. The cause of AD is unknown; however, the toxic effects of amyloid-beta (A beta) are believed to play a role in its onset. To investigate this, we examined changes in global protein levels in a hippocampal synaptosome fraction of the Amyloid Precursor Protein swe/Presenelin 1 dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD at 6 and 12 months of age (moa). Data independent acquisition (DIA), or Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical fragment-ion (SWATH), was used for a quantitative label-free proteomics analysis. We first assessed the usefulness of a recently improved directDIA workflow as an alternative to conventional DIA data analysis using a project-specific spectral library. Subsequently, we applied directDIA to the 6- and 12-moa APP/PS1 datasets and applied the Mass Spectrometry Downstream Analysis Pipeline (MS-DAP) for differential expression analysis and candidate discovery. We observed most regulation at 12-moa, in particular of proteins involved in A beta homeostasis and microglial-dependent processes, like synaptic pruning and the immune response, such as APOE, CLU and C1QA-C. All proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025777.

AB  - Previous studies have reported that 4,6 '-Anhydrooxysporidinone (SSF2-2), isolated from Fusarium lateritium SSF2, has neuroprotective effects on the HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cell line. However, the anti-cancer effect of SSF2-2 remains unclear. Here, we examined the viability of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated with SSF2-2 or left untreated using a cell viability assay kit. The underlying molecular mechanism was further investigated by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry studies. The results demonstrated that SSF2-2 inhibited the viability of MCF-7 cells. Treatment with SSF2-2 increased the levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-7, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and LC3B. Additionally, SSF2-2 significantly increased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3II and LC3-positive puncta in MCF-7 cells.

AB  - The BTBR T(+)Itpr3(tf)/J (BTBR/J) strain is one of the most valid models of idiopathic autism, serving as a potent forward genetics tool to dissect the complexity of autism. We found that a sister strain with an intact corpus callosum, BTBR TF/ArtRbrc (BTBR/R), showed more prominent autism core symptoms but moderate ultrasonic communication/normal hippocampus-dependent memory, which may mimic autism in the high functioning spectrum. Intriguingly, disturbed epigenetic silencing mechanism leads to hyperactive endogenous retrovirus (ERV), a mobile genetic element of ancient retroviral infection, which increases de novo copy number variation (CNV) formation in the two BTBR strains. This feature makes the BTBR strain a still evolving multiple-loci model toward higher ASD susceptibility. Furthermore, active ERV, analogous to virus infection, evades the integrated stress response (ISR) of host defense and hijacks the transcriptional machinery during embryonic development in the BTBR strains. These results suggest dual roles of ERV in the pathogenesis of ASD, driving host genome evolution at a long-term scale and managing cellular pathways in response to viral infection, which has immediate effects on embryonic development. The wild-type Draxin expression in BTBR/R also makes this substrain a more precise model to investigate the core etiology of autism without the interference of impaired forebrain bundles as in BTBR/J.

AB  - The present investigation explored the potential neuroprotective role of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-mediated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like symptoms. Rats were distributed into four treatment groups equally: control, ZnONPs (4 mg/kg b.wt.), AlCl3 (100 mg/kg b.wt.), and ZnONPs + AlCl3 groups. Rats were treated for 42 consecutive days. ZnONPs injection into AlCl3-treated rats suppressed the development of oxidative challenge in the cortical and hippocampal tissues, as demonstrated by the decreased neuronal pro-oxidants (malondialdehyde and nitric oxide), and the increased glutathione and catalase levels. Additionally, ZnONPs injection showed anti-inflammatory potency in response to AlCl3 by decreasing levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta. Moreover, pretreatment with ZnONPs prevented neuronal cell loss by decreasing the level of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and enhancing the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2. Furthermore, ZnONPs ameliorated the disturbed acetylcholinesterase activity, monoamines (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin), excitatory (glutamic and aspartic acids), and inhibitory amino acids (GABA and glycine) in response to AlCl3 exposure. These findings indicate that ZnONPs may have the potential as an alternative therapy to minimize or prevent the neurological deficits in AD model by exhibiting antioxidative, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and neuromodulatory effects.

AB  - Aging is accompanied by macro-structural alterations in the brain that may relate to age-associated cognitive decline. Animal studies could allow us to study this relationship, but so far it remains unclear whether their structural aging patterns correspond to those in humans. Therefore, by applying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deformation-based morphometry (DBM), we longitudinally screened the brains of male RccHan:WIST rats for structural changes across their average lifespan. By combining dedicated region of interest (ROI) and voxel-wise approaches, we observed an increase in their global brain volume that was superimposed by divergent local morphologic alterations, with the largest aging effects in early and middle life. We detected a modality-dependent vulnerability to shrinkage across the visual, auditory, and somato-sensory cortical areas, whereas the piriform cortex showed partial resistance. Furthermore, shrinkage emerged in the amygdala, subiculum, and flocculus as well as in frontal, parietal, and motor cortical areas. Strikingly, we noticed the preservation of ectorhinal, entorhinal, retrosplenial, and cingulate cortical regions, which all represent higher-order brain areas and extraordinarily grew with increasing age. We think that the findings of this study will further advance aging research and may contribute to the establishment of interventional approaches to preserve cognitive health in advanced age.

AB  - Depression, a major global health issue, is closely associated with imbalances in gut microbiota and altered intestinal functions. This study investigates the antidepressant potential of a composite of Geniposide (GP) and Nanocrystalline Cellulose (NCC), focusing on its effects on the gut-brain axis. Utilizing network pharmacology, GP was identified as a key compound targeting the BCL2 gene in depression management. Experimental approaches, including a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in mice, cellular assays, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), were used to evaluate the composite's effectiveness. Results indicate that GP activates the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by upregulating BCL2, enhancing intestinal barrier integrity, and balancing gut flora. These mechanisms contribute to its positive effects on hippocampal function and depressive-like behaviors in mice, suggesting that the GP-NCC composite could be a promising avenue for developing depression therapies that target gut health.

AB  - The therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited, underscoring the critical need for finding an effective regulator of A beta 42 production. In this study, with 489 human postmortem brains, we revealed that homotrimer G protein subunit gamma 5 (GNG5) expression is upregulated in the hippocampal-entorhinal region of pathological AD compared with normal controls, and is positively correlated with A beta pathology. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that increased GNG5 significantly promotes A beta pathology and A beta 42 production. Mechanically, GNG5 regulates the cleavage preference of gamma-secretase towards A beta 42 by directly interacting with the gamma-secretase catalytic subunit presenilin 1 (PS1). Moreover, excessive GNG5 increases the protein levels and the activation of Rab5, leading to the increased number of early endosomes, the major cellular organelle for production of A beta 42. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence revealed co-interaction of A beta 42 with GPCR family CXCR2, which is known as the receptor for IL-8, thus facilitating the dissociation of G-proteins beta gamma from alpha subunits. Treatment of A beta 42 in neurons combined with structure prediction indicated A beta 42 oligomers as a new ligand of CXCR2, upregulating gamma subunit GNG5 protein levels. The co-localizations of GNG5 and PS1, CXCR2 and A beta 42 were verified in eight human brain regions. Besides, GNG5 is significantly reduced in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cerebral cortex or serum of AD patients compared with healthy cognition controls. In brief, GNG5 is a novel regulator of A beta 42 production, suggesting its clinical potential as a diagnosis biomarker and the therapeutic target for AD.The GNG5 content in EVs derived from serum and brain tissue of patients with AD significantly reduced. The GNG5 expression in the hippocampal-entorhinal neurons of donors with pathological AD significantly increased, and can exist in homotrimer subtypes. GNG5 expression positively correlates with A beta pathology and A beta 42 production. Homotrimer-GNG5 binds to the gamma-secretase catalytic subunit PS1 and preferentially generates A beta 42 in early endosome. GNG5 leads to enhanced Rab5 protein and activation levels, increased number of early endosome, promoting A beta 42 production. Further, A beta 42 binds to CXCR2 to upregulate GNG5 levels in a feedback loop.

AB  - Exposure to high ambient temperature is a stressor that influences both biological and behavioral functions and has been previously shown to have an extensive impact on brain structure and function. Physiological, cellular and behavioral responses to heat-stress (HS) (40-41 degrees C, 2 h) were evaluated in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of HS exposure before predator-scent stress (PSS) exposure (i.e., HS preconditioning) was examined. Finally, a possible mechanism of HS-preconditioning to PSS was investigated. Immunohistochemical analyses of chosen cellular markers were performed in the hippocampus and in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Plasma corticosterone levels were evaluated, and the behavioral assessment included the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the acoustic startle response (ASR) paradigms. Endogenous levels of heat shock protein (HSP)-70 were manipulated using an amino acid (L-glutamine) and a pharmacological agent (Doxazosin). A single exposure to an acute HS resulted in decreased body mass (BM), increased body temperature and increased corticosterone levels. Additionally, extensive cellular, but not behavioral changes were noted. HS-preconditioning provided behavioral resiliency to anxiety-like behavior associated with PSS, possibly through the induction of HSP-70. Targeting of HSP-70 is an attractive strategy for stress-related psychopathology treatment.

AB  - Aging is accompanied by a decline in cognition that can be due to a lower IGF-I level. We studied response facilitation induced in primary somatosensory (S1) cortical neurons by repetitive stimulation of whiskers in young and old mice. Layer 2/3 and 5/6 neurons were extracellularly recorded in young (<= 6 months of age) and old (>= 20 month of age) anesthetized mice. IGF-I injection in S1 cortex (10 nM; 0.2 mu L) increased whisker responses in young and old animals. A stimulation train at 8 Hz induced a long-lasting response facilitation in only layer 2/3 neurons of young animals. However, all cortical neurons from young and old animals showed long-lasting response facilitation when IGF-I was applied in the S1 cortex. The reduction in response facilitation in old animals can be due to a reduction in the IGF-I receptors as was indicated by the immunohistochemistry study. Furthermore, a reduction in the performance of a whisker discrimination task was observed in old animals. In conclusion, our findings indicate that there is a reduction in the synaptic plasticity of S1 neurons during aging that can be recovered by IGF-I. Therefore, it opens the possibility of use IGF-I as a therapeutic tool to ameliorate the effects of heathy aging.

AB  - Background: Arthropods represent the largest and most diverse phylum on Earth, playing a pivotal role in the biosphere. One key to their evolutionary success is their ability to feed on plant material. However, their endogenous enzymatic repertoire, which contributes to plant digestion, remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. Results: We analyzed 815 arthropod proteomes and identified a total of 268,171 carbohydrate-active modules. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between enzymatic content and feeding habits, with herbivorous species possessing significantly higher enzyme levels. We identified widespread carbohydrate-active families across the AA, CBM, GH, and GT classes, and observed a progressive increase in taxa-exclusive families in more recent arthropod lineages. Notably, we highlighted the impact of the transition from ametabolous to holometabolous development on carbohydrate metabolism, as well as the ecological adaptations of different species groups. By reconstructing the ancestral enzymatic profiles of arthropods, we identified significant fluctuations in 10 carbohydrate-active families over time. Conclusions: Our analysis advances the understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms utilized by the megadiverse phylum Arthropoda. We emphasize the critical role of herbivory as a selective force shaping enzymatic strategies, particularly those involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The distribution and exclusivity of carbohydrate-active families across different arthropod groups provide insights into their evolutionary trajectories and offer a clearer picture of the metabolic pathways that led their ancestors to their present forms.

AB  - The PSEN1 Delta E9 mutation causes a familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by shifting the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) towards the generation of highly amyloidogenic A beta 42 peptide. We have previously shown that the PSEN1 Delta E9 mutation in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes increases A beta 42 production and impairs cellular responses. Here, we injected PSEN1 Delta E9 mutant astrosphere-derived glial progenitors into newborn mice and investigated mouse behavior at the ages of 8, 12, and 16 months. While we did not find significant behavioral changes in younger mice, spatial learning and memory were paradoxically improved in 16-month-old PSEN1 Delta E9 glia-transplanted male mice as compared to age-matched isogenic control-transplanted animals. Memory improvement was associated with lower levels of soluble, but not insoluble, human A beta 42 in the mouse brain. We also found a decreased engraftment of PSEN1 Delta E9 mutant cells in the cingulate cortex and significant transcriptional changes in both human and mouse genes in the hippocampus, including the extracellular matrix-related genes. Overall, the presence of PSEN1 Delta E9 mutant glia exerted a more beneficial effect on aged mouse brain than the isogenic control human cells likely as a combination of several factors.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a new form of iron-dependent cell death. A growing body of evidence suggests that abnormal ferroptosis is involved in developing neurodegenerative diseases. 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a major bioactive component of licorice with multiple biological activities including neuroprotection. Give the role of ferroptosis in the neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of GA might be associated with its ability to protect neuro-cells from ferroptosis. Results demonstrated that GA was able to prevent a well-known ferroptosis inducer ferroptosis inducer 56 (FIN56)-triggered ferroptosis in HT22 mouse neuronal cell. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that the protection of GA on ferroptosis is attributed its inhibiting effect on cellular labile iron accu-mulation and up-regulating coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) levels. The findings of the present study uncovered a novel mechanism involved in the neuroprotective effect of GA, and imply that GA could be developed as a novel agent to manage ferroptosis-related diseases.

AB  - BG45 is a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) with selectivity for HDAC3. Our previous study demonstrated that BG45 can upregulate the expression of synaptic proteins and reduce the loss of neurons in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice (Tg). The entorhinal cortex is a pivotal region that, along with the hippocampus, plays a critical role in memory in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology process. In this study, we focused on the inflammatory changes in the entorhinal cortex of APP/PS1 mice and further explored the therapeutic effects of BG45 on the pathologies. The APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into the transgenic group without BG45 (Tg group) and the BG45-treated groups. The BG45-treated groups were treated with BG45 at 2 months (2 m group), at 6 months (6 m group), or twice at 2 and 6 months (2 and 6 m group). The wild-type mice group (Wt group) served as the control. All mice were killed within 24 h after the last injection at 6 months. The results showed that amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition and IBA1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes in the entorhinal cortex of the APP/PS1 mice progressively increased over time from 3 to 8 months of age. When the APP/PS1 mice were treated with BG45, the level of H3K9K14/H3 acetylation was improved and the expression of histonedeacetylase1, histonedeacetylase2, and histonedeacetylase3 was inhibited, especially in the 2 and 6 m group. BG45 alleviated A beta deposition and reduced the phosphorylation level of tau protein. The number of IBA1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes decreased with BG45 treatment, and the effect was more significant in the 2 and 6 m group. Meanwhile, the expression of synaptic proteins synaptophysin, postsynaptic density protein 95, and spinophilin was upregulated and the degeneration of neurons was alleviated. Moreover, BG45 reduced the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Closely related to the CREB/BDNF/NF-kB pathway, the expression of p-CREB/CREB, BDNF, and TrkB was increased in all BG45 administered groups compared with the Tg group. However, the levels of p-NF-kB/NF-kB in the BG45 treatment groups were reduced. Therefore, we deduced that BG45 is a potential drug for AD by alleviating inflammation and regulating the CREB/BDNF/NF-kB pathway, and the early, repeated administration of BG45 can play a more effective role.

AB  - Inactivating mutations in the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) result in Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome, a severe form of psychomotor retardation, while inactivating mutations in another TH transporter, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1c1 (OATP1C1), are linked to juvenile neurodegeneration. These diseases point to essential roles for TH transporters in CNS function. We recently defined the presence of Mct8 in adult hippocampal progenitors and mature granule cell neurons and unraveled cell-autonomous and indirect requirements for Mct8 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we investigated whether Oatp1c1 is involved in the hippocampal neurogenic process in concert with Mct8. We detected Oatp1c1 gene expression activity and transcripts in subsets of progenitors, neurons and niche cells in the dentate gyrus. Absence of Oatp1c1 resulted in increased neuroblast and reduced immature neuron numbers in 6-month-old Oatp1c1ko and Mct8/Oatp1c1 double knockout (M/Odko) mice. Reduced EdU-label retention in Mct8ko and M/Odko mice confirmed the impact of Mct8 on neuron formation. In contrast, no significant effect of Oatp1c1 loss on granule cell neuron production and anxiety-like behavior in the open field arena were seen. Together, our results reinforce that distinct actions of each TH transporter are required at multiple stages to ensure proper adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment. Despite extensive research, the underlying causes of late-onset AD (LOAD) are still in progress. This study aimed to establish a network of competing regulatory interactions involving circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) connected to LOAD. A systematic analysis of publicly available expression data was conducted to identify integrated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the hippocampus of LOAD patients. Subsequently, gene co-expression analysis identified modules comprising highly expressed DEGs that act cooperatively. The competition between co-expressed DEGs and miRNAs/RBPs and the simultaneous interactions between circRNA and miRNA/ RBP revealed a complex ceRNA network responsible for post-transcriptional regulation in LOAD. Hippocampal expression data for miRNAs, circRNAs, and RBPs were used to filter relevant relationships for AD. An integrated topological score was used to identify the highly connected hub gene, from which a brain core ceRNA subnetwork was generated. The Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) coding for the RBP FMRP emerged as the prominent driver gene in this subnetwork. FMRP has been previously related to AD but not in a ceRNA network context. Also, the substantial number of neurodevelopmental genes in the ceRNA subnetwork and their related biological pathways strengthen that AD shares common pathological mechanisms with developmental conditions. Our results enhance the current knowledge about the convergent ceRNA regulatory pathways underlying AD and provide potential targets for identifying early biomarkers and developing novel therapeutic interventions.

AB  - The pathological accumulation of a-synuclein (a-Syn) and the transmission of misfolded a-Syn underlie a-synucleinopathies. Increased plasma a-Syn levels are associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, but it is still unknown whether the cognitive deficits in a-synucleinopathies have a common vascular pathological origin. Here, it is reported that combined injection of a-Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) in the unilateral substantia nigra pars compacta, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex results in impaired spatial learning and memory abilities at 6 months post-injection and that this cognitive decline is related to cerebral microvascular injury. Moreover, insoluble a-Syn inclusions are found to form in primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) through lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3)-dependent a-Syn PFFs endocytosis, causing poly(ADP-ribose)-driven cell death and reducing the expression of tight junction proteins in BMVECs. Knockout of Lag3 in vitro prevents a-Syn PFFs from entering BMVECs, thereby reducing the abovementioned response induced by a-Syn PFFs. Deletion of endothelial cell-specific Lag3 in vivo reverses the negative effects of a-Syn PFFs on cerebral microvessels and cognitive function. In short, this study reveals the effectiveness of targeting Lag3 to block the spread of a-Syn fibrils to endothelial cells in order to improve cognition.

AB  - Recently, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have been attracting extensive interests in a widespread appli-cation, but the little information on the risk assessments of GQDs could impose a restriction on their contributions in the neuroscience. In this study, the intranasal administration of amino group functiona-lized GQDs (A-GQDs) was observed to enhance the number of neuronal cell death, trigger ferroptosis ac-tivities, i.e. ferrous iron overload and lipid peroxidation as well as cause inflammatory reactions in hippocampus. Meanwhile, these adverse effects were found in BV2 microglial cells treated with A-GQDs, which were all attenuated by a ferroptosis-specific inhibitor ferrostain-1 (Fer-1). The inflammatory re-sponses to A-GQDs in BV2 cells were evidenced as the increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha that was attributed to the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) released from ferroptosis-occurred cells. The nuclear transference of yes-associated protein (YAP), an effector in Hippo signaling pathway, regulated by the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was then found to play a critical role in A-GQDs triggering ferroptosis through transcriptionally mediating transferrin receptor protein (TFRC) and arachidonate lipoxygenase 3 (ALOXE3) to increase levels of ferrous iron and lipid per-oxides, respectively. The findings not only highlight the importance of risk assessments on QDs containing low toxic component, but also provide toxic biomarkers for the interventions of GQDs in the brain.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nearly one billion individuals worldwide suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and are potentially impacted by related neurodegeneration. TFEB is considered a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, but little is known about its role in neuronal oxidative stress and resultant injury induced by OSA. This study aimed to investigate these issues. Here, we demonstrated that neuronal TFEB induction is repressed in OSA mouse models. Activation of a TFEB-dependent autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) reduces hippocampal neuronal cell death and mitigates OSA-related cognitive impairment. Neuronal NRF2 induction was also found to be defective in OSA mouse models. A series of staining assays for HO1, SOD3, ROS, GSH, 8-OHdG, MDA and PI revealed that enhancement of NRF2 expression restores neuronal redox balance and protects hippocampal neurons. We then identified a novel interplay between TFEB-dependent ALP and NRF2-mediated relief of oxidative stress. Inhibition of NRF2 hinders TFEB expression and lysosomal biogenesis. Conversely, knockdown of TFEB or blocking autophagy dampens the antioxidative effect of NRF2. Our findings highlight the unexpected and crucial role of TFEB-dependent ALP as a downstream event of NRF2 in NRF2-promoted redox balance. This study provides novel insights into the mechanism behind NRF2-driven antioxidative action and the regulation of TFEBdependent ALP.

AB  - Background: Endogenous phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)) play a fundamental role in inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, apoptosis and cellular senescence. Neurotoxins with PLA(2) activity are found in snake venoms from the Elapidae and Viperidae families. The mechanism of action of these neurotoxins have been studied using hippocampal and cerebellar neuronal cultures showing [Ca2+]i increase, mitochondrial depolarization and cell death. Astrocytes are rarely used as a model, despite being modulators at the synapses and responsible for homeostasis and defense in the central nervous system. Preserving the cell division ability, they can be utilized to study the cell proliferation process. In the present work cultured astrocytes and glioblastoma cells were employed to characterize the action of beta-micrustoxin (previously named Mlx-9), a PLA 2 isolated from Micrurus lemniscatus snake venom. The beta-micrustoxin structure was determined and the cell proliferation, cell cycle phases and the regulatory proteins p53, p21 and p27 were investigated.
   Methods: beta-micrustoxin was characterized biochemically by a proteomic approach. Astrocytes were obtained by dissociation of pineal glands from Wistar rats; glioblastoma tumor cells were purchased from ATCC and Sigma and cultured in DMEM medium. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay; cell proliferation and cell cycle phases were analyzed by flow cytometry; p53, p21 and p27 proteins were studied by western blotting and immunocytochemistry.
   Results: Proteomic analysis revealed fragments on beta-micrustoxin that aligned with a PLA(2) from Micrurus lemniscatus lemniscatus previously identified as transcript ID DN112835_C3_g9_i1/m.9019. beta-micrustoxin impaired the viability of astrocytes and glioblastoma tumor cells. There was a reduction in cell proliferation, an increase in G2/M phase and activation of p53, p21 and p27 proteins in astrocytes.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that beta-micrustoxin from Micrurus lemniscatus venom could inhibit cell proliferation through p53, p21 and p27 activation thus imposing cell cycle arrest at the checkpoint G2/M.

AB  - We have previously demonstrated that circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are essential to the beneficial effect of young serum on the skeletal muscle regenerative cascade. Here, we show that infusions of young serum significantly improve age-associated memory deficits, and that these effects are abolished after serum depletion of EVs. RNA-seq analysis of the choroid plexus demonstrates EV-mediated effects on genes involved in barrier function and trans-barrier transport. Comparing the differentially expressed genes to recently published chronological aging clock genes reveals a reversal of transcriptomic aging in the choroid plexus. Following young serum treatment, the hippocampal transcriptome demonstrates significant upregulation of the anti-aging gene Klotho, along with an abrogated effect after EV depletion. Transcriptomic profiling of Klotho knockout and heterozygous mice shows the downregulation of genes associated with transport, exocytosis, and lipid transport, while upregulated genes are associated with activated microglia. The results of our study indicate the significance of EVs as vehicles to deliver signals from the periphery to the brain and the importance of Klotho in maintaining brain homeostasis.

AB  - Our previous studies demonstrated that enzymatic removal of highly sulfated heparan sulfates with heparinase 1 impaired axonal excitability and reduced expression of ankyrin G at the axon initial segments in the CA1 region of the hippocampus ex vivo, impaired context discrimination in vivo, and increased Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity in vitro. Here, we show that in vivo delivery of heparinase 1 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus elevated autophosphorylation of CaMKII 24 h after injection in mice. Patch clamp recording in CA1 neurons revealed no significant heparinase effects on the amplitude or frequency of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, while the threshold for action potential generation was increased and fewer spikes were generated in response to current injection. Delivery of heparinase on the next day after contextual fear conditioning induced context overgeneralization 24 h after injection. Co-administration of heparinase with the CaMKII inhibitor (autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide) rescued neuronal excitability and expression of ankyrin G at the axon initial segment. It also restored context discrimination, suggesting the key role of CaMKII in neuronal signaling downstream of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and highlighting a link between impaired CA1 pyramidal cell excitability and context generalization during recall of contextual memories.

AB  - Explaining changes at the gene level that occur during neurodegeneration in the CA3 area is crucial from the point of view of memory impairment and the development of post-ischemic dementia. An ischemic model of Alzheimer's disease was used to evaluate changes in the expression of genes related to amyloid transport in the CA3 region of the hippocampus after 10 min of brain ischemia with survival of 2, 7 and 30 days and 12, 18 and 24 months. The quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay revealed that the expression of the LRP1 and RAGE genes involved in amyloid transport was dysregulated from 2 days to 24 months post-ischemia in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. LRP1 gene expression 2 and 7 days after ischemia was below control values. However, its expression from day 30 to 24 months, survival after an ischemic episode was above control values. RAGE gene expression 2 days after ischemia was below control values, reaching a maximum increase 7 and 30 days post-ischemia. Then, after 12, 18 and 24 months, it was again below the control values. The data indicate that in the CA3 area of the hippocampus, an episode of brain ischemia causes the increased expression of the RAGE gene for 7-30 days during the acute phase and that of LRP1 from 1 to 24 months after ischemia during the chronic stage. In other words, in the early post-ischemic stage, the expression of the gene that transport amyloid to the brain increases (7-30 days). Conversely, in the late post-ischemic stage, amyloid scavenging/cleaning gene activity increases, reducing and/or preventing further neuronal damage or facilitating the healing of damaged sites. This is how the new phenomenon of pyramidal neuronal damage in the CA3 area after ischemia is defined. In summary, post-ischemic modification of the LRP1 and RAGE genes is useful in the study of the ischemic pathways and molecular factors involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR) is a key regulator of brain plasticity encoding learning and memory. In addition to glutamate, NMDAR activation requires the binding of the co-agonist D-serine. The beta-amyloid (A ss) peptide which accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD), affects the D-serine-dependent NMDAR activation in vitro, but whether this alteration would significantly contribute to AD-related pathophysiology and memory deficits remains unclear. Herein, we report a decrease in the maximal pool of recruitable NMDAR and in the expression of NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation together with impaired basal neurotransmission at CA3/CA1 synapses from hippocampal slices of 5xFAD mouse, an AD-related model with elevated A ss levels. The NMDAR synaptic impairments develop from 1.5 to 2 months of age with the initial rise of A ss and is correlated to a transient increase in D-serine levels. Deficits in working and spatial memories as well as cognitive flexibility then occurred in 10-12 months-old animals. Importantly, the NMDA-related synaptic deregulations (but not the altered basal neurotransmission) and behavioral impairments (working and cognitive flexibility) are prevented or reduced (spatial memory) in 5xFAD mice devoid of D-serine after genetic deletion of its synthesis enzyme serine racemase. Altogether, these results therefore provide in vivo evidence for the implication of D-serine at least in the early pathogenic signatures of AD driven by the increase in amyloid load suggesting that the recent proposal of preventive therapy of AD by administration of the precursor L-serine remains questionable.

   Methods: The chemical composition of D. kiusiana var. atrocaulis was clarified using multiple chromatography technologies and spectroscopic analysis. The anti-neuroinflammatory effects of the identified components were evaluated in LPS-induced BV-2 cells by monitoring the production of nitric oxide. C57BL/6 mice were used to construct a neuroinflammatory model by injecting LPS into the lateral ventricle of the brain. The most promising component was evaluated in vivo by measuring the number of Iba-1 cells and expression of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism involved in the activation of the NF-kappa B pathway was investigated using western blot and immunofluorescence.
   Results: Thirty-two constituents (1-32), including five new compounds, were successfully identified from D. kiusiana var. atrocaulis. Compounds 3, 5, 12-15, and 20 (IC50 values from 5.41 to 57.27 mu M) could considerably inhibit the LPS-induced production of NO in BV-2 cells, displaying stronger anti-neuroinflammatory activities than that of minocycline (IC50 = 67.08 mu M). The concentration of the most potential compound 13 (IC50 5.41 mu M) was 5.4% of the ethyl acetate fraction. Acutissimalignan B (13) could reduce the mRNA expression of iNOs, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, inhibit the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, and inhibit the nuclear translocation of NK-kappa B p65 in BV-2 cells induced by LPS. Moreover, in the LPS-induced mouse model, compound 13 was found to exert anti-neuroinflammatory activity by attenuating the activation of microglia in the cortex and hippocampus, repressing the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NK-kappa B p65, and decreasing the mRNA expression of iNOs, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in the cortex.
   Conclusion: We found that D. kiusiana var. atrocaulis had an inhibitory activity on neuroinflammation. In addition, the main active component (-)-acutissimalignan B (13) showed anti-neuroinflammatory effects in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Its mechanism of action may be associated with the inhibition of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Our current findings provide new information on D. kiusiana var. atrocaulis in the treatment of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Complex brain functions, including learning and memory, arise in part from the modulatory role of astrocytes on neuronal circuits. Functionally, the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits differences in the acquisition of long-term potentiation (LTP) between day and night. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of astrocyte morphology plays an important role in the functional circuitry of hippocampal learning and memory, specifically in the DG. Standard microscopy techniques, such as differential interference contrast (DIC), present insufficient contrast for detecting changes in astrocyte structure and function and are unable to inform on the intrinsic structure of the sample in a quantitative manner. Recently, gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) has been developed to upgrade a DIC microscope with quantitative capabilities such as single-cell dry mass and volume characterization. Here, we present a methodology for combining GLIM and electrophysiology to quantify the astrocyte morphological behavior over the day-night cycle. Colocalized measurements of GLIM and fluorescence allowed us to quantify the dry masses and volumes of hundreds of astrocytes. Our results indicate that, on average, there is a 25% cell volume reduction during the nocturnal cycle. Remarkably, this cell volume change takes place at constant dry mass, which suggests that the volume regulation occurs primarily through aqueous medium exchange with the environment.

AB  - Plants are able to produce various types of crystals through metabolic processes, serving functions ranging from herbivore deterrence to photosynthetic efficiency. However, the structural analysis of these crystals has remained challenging due to their small and often imperfect nature, which renders traditional X-ray diffraction techniques unsuitable. This study explores the use of Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (microED) as a novel method for the structural analysis of plant-derived microcrystals, focusing on Armeria maritima (Milld.), a halophytic plant known for its biomineralisation capabilities. In this study, A. maritima plants were cultivated under controlled laboratory conditions with exposure to cadmium and thallium to induce the formation of crystalline deposits on their leaf surfaces. These deposits were analysed using microED, revealing the presence of sodium chloride (halite), sodium sulphate (th & eacute;nardite), and calcium sulphate dihydrate (gypsum). Our findings highlight the potential of microED as a versatile tool in plant science, capable of providing detailed structural insights into biomineralisation processes, even from minimal and imperfect crystalline samples. The application of microED in this context not only advances the present understanding of A. maritima's adaptation to saline environments but also opens new avenues for exploring the structural chemistry of biomineralisation in other plant species. Our study advocates for the broader adoption of microED in botanical research, especially when dealing with challenging crystallographic problems.

AB  - Human mutations of the Na+-activated K+ channel Slack (KCNT1) are associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Accordingly, Slack knockout mice (Slack(-/-)) exhibit cognitive flexibility deficits in distinct behavioral tasks. So far, however, the underlying causes as well as the role of Slack in hippocampus-dependent memory functions remain enigmatic. We now report that infant (P6-P14) Slack(-/-) lack both hippocampal LTD and LTP, likely due to impaired NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling. Postsynaptic GluN2B levels are reduced in infant Slack(-/-), evidenced by lower amplitudes of NMDAR-meditated excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Low GluN2B affected NMDAR-mediated Ca2+-influx, rendering cultured hippocampal Slack(-/-)neurons highly insensitive to the GluN2B-specific inhibitor Ro 25-6981. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 at S845, which is involved in AMPAR endocytosis during homeostatic and neuromodulator-regulated plasticity, is reduced after chemical LTD (cLTD) in infant Slack(-/-). We additionally detect a lack of mGluR-induced LTD in infant Slack(-/-), possibly caused by upregulation of the recycling endosome-associated small GTPase Rab4 which might accelerate AMPAR recycling from early endosomes. Interestingly, LTP and mGluR LTD, but not LTD and S845 dephosphorylation after cLTD are restored in adult Slack(-/-). This together with normalized expression levels of GluN2B and Rab4 hints to developmental "restoration" of LTP expression despite Slack ablation, whereas in infant and adult brain, NMDAR-dependent LTD induction depends on this channel. Based on the present findings, NMDAR and vesicular transport might represent novel targets for the therapy of intellectual disability associated with Slack mutations. Consequently, careful modulation of hippocampal Slack activity should also improve learning abilities.

AB  - Metabolic dysregulation is one of the most common causes of pediatric neurodegenerative disorders. However, how the disruption of ubiquitous and essential metabolic pathways predominantly affect neural tissue remains unclear. Here we use mouse models of a childhood neurodegenerative disorder caused by AMPD2 deficiency to study cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to selective neuronal vulnerability to purine metabolism imbalance. We show that mouse models of AMPD2 deficiency exhibit predominant degeneration of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, despite a general reduction of brain GTP levels. Neurodegeneration-resistant regions accumulate micron-sized filaments of IMPDH2, the rate limiting enzyme in GTP synthesis, while these filaments are barely detectable in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore, we show that IMPDH2 filament disassembly reduces GTP levels and impairs growth of neural progenitor cells derived from individuals with human AMPD2 deficiency. Together, our findings suggest that IMPDH2 polymerization prevents detrimental GTP deprivation, opening the possibility of exploring the induction of IMPDH2 assembly as a therapy for neurodegeneration.
   Macromolecular assembly of metabolic enzymes is emerging as a mechanism to regulate and compartmentalize metabolic reactions within cells.

AB  - Restricted repetitive behaviors (RRB) encompass a variety of inflexible behaviors, which are diagnostic for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite being requisite diagnostic criteria, the neurocircuitry of these behaviors remains poorly understood, limiting treatment development. Studies in translational animal models show environmental enrichment (EE) reduces the expression of RRB, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify functional connectivity alterations associated with RRB and its attenuation by EE in C58 mice, an animal model of RRB. Extensive differences were observed between C58 mice and C57BL/6 control mice. Higher RRB was associated with altered connectivity between the somatosensory network and reticular thalamic nucleus and between striatal and sensory processing regions. Animals housed in EE displayed increased connectivity between the somatosensory network and the anterior pretectal nucleus and hippocampus, as well as reduced connectivity between the visual network and area prostriata. These results suggest aberrant sensory perception is associated with RRB in C58 mice. EE may reduce RRB by altering functional connectivity in pain and visual networks. This study raises questions about the role of sensory processing and pain in RRB development and identifies new potential intervention targets.

AB  - The pathological changes of Alzheimer???s disease (AD) begin 10???20 years before clinical onset, and it is therefore desirable to identify effective methods for early diagnosis. The nasal mucosa is a target tissue for measuring AD-related biomarkers because the olfactory nerve is the only cranial nerve that is exposed to the external environment. We describe an autopsy case of rapidly advanced juvenile AD (JAD), focusing on the olfactory system. The formation of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuropil threads was examined in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and olfactory and respiratory epithelia in the bilateral olfactory clefts. Neurodegenerative changes in the olfactory and respiratory epithelia and the pathological deposition of amyloid ??42 (A??42) and phosphorylated tau were also examined. As a result, senile plaques, NFTs, and neuropil threads were found in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. NFTs were also found in the olfactory epithelium. Degenerated olfactory cells and their axons stained positive for phosphorylated tau. Supporting cells in the degenerated olfactory epithelium stained positive for A??42. In conclusion, pathological biomarkers of AD were expressed in the degenerated olfactory epithelium of this JAD patient. This observation suggests that nasal samples may be useful for the diagnosis of AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Previous study has demonstrated lancao decoction (LC), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) fomula and recorded in "Huangdineijing", has a therapeutic effect on cognitive impairment (early clinical manifestations of alzheimer's disease (AD), which suggests that LC may have potential therapeutic advantages for AD. Whether LC has the therapeutic effect on AD and its potential mechanisms were still further indicated. Aim of the study: In this study, we aimed to uncover the potential advantage and neuronal mechanisms of LC in the treatment of AD in APP/PS1 mice in the hippocampus. Methods and materials: We chose APP/PS1 mice to combing with behavioral tests including morris water maze (MWM) or y-maze to determine the role of LC in the therapeutic actions of AD. Network pharmacology was used to screen potential targets and pathways involving in LC's treatments of AD. Western blot was used to detect the phosphorylated expressions of proteins in hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice in the hippocampus. Pharmacological interventions were used to elucidate the relationship between the role of LC in the treatment of AD and the pathway, as well as the upstream and downstream interactions with neuronal activities. Results: According to our previous LC effective dose (2.5 g/kg), the dose was also able to significantly reduce the latency to the platform, and significantly increase the number of crossing times and time spend in the target quadrant in APP/PS1 mice in MWM, which was consistent with donepezil (DON) after 14 days chronic treatments. Network pharmacology showed that PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways were closely associated with LC's treatments of AD, and protein autophosphorylation played a role in this process. The phosphorylated expressions of PI3K and AKT were obviously reduced in APP/PS1 mice in the hippocampus, which were both reversed by LC or DON. The phosphorylated expressions of MAPK including P38, JNK and ERK were also significantly reduced in APP/PS1 mice hippocampus, but only the phosphorylated expression of ERK was reversed by LC or DON. Inhibiting the activities of PI3K/AKT pathway by LY294002 blocked LC's improvement of behavioral deficits in APP/PS1 mice, including reducing latency to platform and increasing the number of crossings time in MWM in APP/PS1 mice, which also blunted LC's up-regulated phosphorylated expressions of PI3K, AKT and ERK in the hippocampus. Moreover, suppressing the activities of ERK by PD98059 also blocked LC's improvement of ADrelated behavioral deficits including decreasing latency to new arm and increasing time in new arm in y-maze

AB  - It is well recognized that changes in the extracellular concentration of calcium ions influence the excitability of neurons, yet what mechanism(s) mediate these effects is still a matter of debate. Using patch-clamp recordings from rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we examined the contribution of G-proteins and intracellular calcium-dependent signaling mechanisms to changes in intrinsic excitability evoked by altering the extracellular calcium concentration from physiological (1.2 mM) to a commonly used experimental (2 mM) level. We find that the inhibitory effect on intrinsic excitability of calcium ions is mainly expressed as an increased threshold for action potential firing (with no significant effect on resting membrane potential) that is not blocked by either the G-protein inhibitor GDP beta S or the calcium chelator BAPTA. Our results therefore argue that in the concentration range studied, G-protein coupled calcium-sensing receptors, non-selective cation conductances, and intracellular calcium signaling pathways are not involved in mediating the effect of extracellular calcium ions on intrinsic excitability. Analysis of the derivative of the action potential, dV/dt versus membrane potential, indicates a current shift towards more depolarized membrane potentials at the higher calcium concentration. Our results are thus consistent with a mechanism in which extracellular calcium ions act directly on the voltage-gated sodium channels by neutralizing negative charges on the extracellular surface of these channels to modulate the threshold for action potential activation.image

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus(1). Advancing age leads to a decline in neurogenesis, which is associated with impaired cognition(2,3). The cellular mechanisms causing reduced neurogenesis with advancing age remain largely unknown. We genetically labeled NSCs through conditional recombination driven by the regulatory elements of the stem-cell-expressed gene GLI family zinc finger 1 (Gli1) and used chronic intravital imaging to follow individual NSCs and their daughter cells over months within their hippocampal niche(4,5). We show that aging affects multiple steps, from cell cycle entry of quiescent NSCs to determination of the number of surviving cells, ultimately causing reduced clonal output of individual NSCs. Thus, we here define the developmental stages that may be targeted to enhance neurogenesis with the aim of maintaining hippocampal plasticity with advancing age.

AB  - Serotonergic psychedelics have potential therapeutic effects in treating anxiety and mood disorders, often after a single dose, and are suggested to have plasticity-inducing action. However, a comprehensive mechanism of action is still lacking. Here, we investigated how a single dose of the short-acting 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) acts on gene expression from microdissected brain regions (anterior cingulate cortex - ACC; basolateral amygdala - BLA; ventral hippocampus CA1 region - vCA1 and dentate gyrus-DG) of naive and stressed mice. Specifically, we compared gene expression of Arc, Zif268, BDNF, CREB, mTORC1, NR2A, TRIP8b, and NFkB in mice injected with 5-MeO-DMT or saline at different time points (1 h, 5 h, or 5 days prior). 5-MeO-DMT altered mRNA expression of immediate early genes Arc and ZiF268 in the ACC, BLA, and vCA1, while NR2A expression was decreased after 5 h in the vCA1. We also found a long-term increase in TRIP8b, a gene related to the modulation of neuronal activity, in the vCA1 after 5 days. Behaviorally, 5-MeO-DMT treated mice showed mixed anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects in the elevated plus maze and open field test 24 h or 5 days after treatment. However, pre-treated mice subjected to acute stress showed both lower corticosterone levels and robust anxiolytic effects of 5-MeO-DMT administration. Together, our findings provide insights into the molecular actions of 5-MeO-DMT in the brain related to anxiolytic effects of behavior.

AB  - Intracranial electrical kilohertz stimulation has recently been shown to achieve similar therapeutic benefit as conventional frequencies around 140 Hz. However, it is unknown how kilohertz stimulation influences neural activity in the mammalian brain. Using cellular calcium imaging in awake mice, we demonstrate that intracranial stimulation at 1 kHz evokes robust responses in many individual neurons, comparable to those induced by conventional 40 and 140 Hz stimulation in both the hippocampus and sensorimotor cortex. The evoked responses at the single-cell level are shaped by prominent network inhibition and critically depend on brain region. At the network level, all frequencies lead to pronounced population suppression except 1 kHz in the cortex, which evokes balanced excitatory and inhibitory population effects. Thus, kilohertz stimulation robustly modulates neural activity at both the single-neuron and population network levels through mechanisms distinct from conventional frequency stimulation, highlighting the clinical potential of intracranial kilohertz neuromodulation.

AB  - This study was to explore the mechanism of action of nanomaterial-loaded clarithromycin (CLA) after sinusitis surgery. Under the guidance of dynamic enhanced scanning (DES). 120 patients with sinusitis admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University from July 2019 to March 2020 were selected and divided into a control group and an observation group according to the random number table method, with 60 cases in each group. Then, the CLA-containing nano-polylactic acid material was prepared, observed with the scanning electron microscope (SEM), and its drug release ability was tested. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus surgery under general anesthesia. After the surgery was completed, patients in the control group were given only CLA capsules, and patients in the observation group were given freshly prepared nanomaterial-loaded CLA, and both groups of patients were continuously observed for two weeks. After that, the patients were examined using the dynamic enhancement computed tomography (CT). The clinical efficacy, serum interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels of the two groups of patients were observed. The secretions of the patients' sinuses were performed with microbial bacterial culture, and the results were observed and recorded. Results showed that the characterization and analysis of the nano drug-carrying preparation suggested that the polylactic acid nanomembrane showed linear fiber morphology, relatively dense distribution, not greatly different fiber diameter, and small porosity. Characterization under a field of view (FOV) of 500 um showed that the fiber surface was smooth and rich in content. The release of CLA showed a gradual and steady upward trend. On the 25th day, nearly 50% of the dose had been released, and it had reached more than 90% of the total release on the 55th day. According to the statistics on the clinical efficacy of patients, it was found that the number of cured and effective patients in the observation group was higher than that of the control group, while the number of ineffective cases was much lower than that of the control group. The dynamic enhanced CT examination results of the patients in the control group after treatment showed that the soft tissue mass on the posterior right side of the nasopharynx was reduced, but the pharyngeal suture still existed; while those in the observation group showed that the plain scan density was uniform, and the mastoid air cells were clear on both sides. The number of cases with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (S. saprophyticus), and Pasteurella multocida infections in the observation group were observably lower than those of the control group (P< 0.05), and it was the same case for the levels of serum IL-4, IL-8, and TNF-alpha. Conclusion: after dynamic enhanced CT scanning, it can be found that the nanomaterialloaded CLA increased the utilization rate of the drug, showing good clinical efficacy, and effectively improved the clinical symptoms of patients, achieving the therapeutic effect.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are complex pathologies influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, ultimately leading to synaptic plasticity dysfunction. Altered expression levels of neuronal glycoprotein GPM6a or polymorphisms within the GPM6A gene are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, depression, and claustrophobia. This protein promotes neurite outgrowth, filopodia formation, dendritic spine, and synapse maintenance in vitro. Although strong evidence suggests that its extracellular domains (ECs) are responsible for its function, the molecular mechanisms linking GPM6a to the onset of such diseases remain unknown. To gain knowledge of these mechanisms, we characterized new non-synonymous polymorphisms (nsSNPs) within the ECs of GPM6a. We identified six nsSNPs (T71P, T76I, M154V, F156Y, R163Q, and T210N) that impair GPM6a-induced plasticity in neuronal cultures without affecting GPM6a expression, folding, and localization to the cell membrane. However, we observed that some of these modified GPM6a's distribution at the cell membrane. Additionally, one of the nsSNPs exhibited alterations in GPM6a oligomerization, highlighting the importance of this amino acid in establishing homophilic cis interactions. Furthermore, we observed that the ability of GPM6a's extracellular domains to interact and induce cell aggregation was significantly decreased in several of the nsSNP variants studied here. Altogether, these results provide new insights into the key residues within GPM6a's extracellular regions that are crucial for its self-association, which is essential for promoting neuronal morphogenesis. Besides, these findings highlight the importance of reverse genetics approaches to gain knowledge on GPM6a's mechanisms of action and the genetic susceptibility of certain GPM6A variants.

AB  - Reliable methods to quantify dynamic signaling changes across diverse pathways are needed to better understand the effects of disease and drug treatment in cells and tissues but are presently lacking. Here, we present SigPath, a targeted mass spectrometry (MS) assay that measures 284 phosphosites in 200 phosphoproteins of biological interest. SigPath probes a broad swath of signaling biology with high throughput and quantitative precision. We applied the assay to investigate changes in phospho-signaling in drug-treated cancer cell lines, breast cancer preclinical models, and human medulloblastoma tumors. In addition to validating previous findings, SigPath detected and quantified a large number of differentially regulated phosphosites newly associated with disease models and human tumors at baseline or with drug perturbation. Our results highlight the potential of SigPath to monitor phosphoproteomic signaling events and to nominate mechanistic hypotheses regarding oncogenesis, response, and resistance to therapy.

AB  - This research aims to test the suitability of a blend of Camelina sativa biodiesel and acetylated diethyl ether as fuel for compression ignition (CI) engines in terms of engine emission, performance, and combustion properties. A Kiloskar TV 1 diesel engine was used to test the fuel samples: Camelina sativa biodiesel (71% v/v) and dimethyl ether blend (29% v/v) (CD), Camelina sativa biodiesel (71% v/v), diethyl ether (20% v/v), and acetylene (9% v/v) (CDA), and conventional diesel. Based on the analyses, the CDA and CD gave higher BTEs of 4.8 and 3.7% than the diesel fuels. The heat release rates (HRRs) were higher than those recorded for the conventional diesel with a longer combustion duration for the blends. Moreover, the CDA fuel gave the lowest CO2, HC, CO, smoke, and NOx emissions. The resulting peak emissions for the blends are in the following increasing order: unburnt HC (CDA (97) < CD (105) < Diesel (110) < CB (111 g/kWh), NOx (CDA (176) < CD (208) < CB (392) < Diesel (500) g/kWh), and CO (CDA (284) < CD (301) < CB (520) < Diesel (541) g/kWh. The remarkable performance of the CDA fuel is due to the synergistic effect of the DEE acetylene in the biodiesel, which culminated in improved heat ratios, engine stability, air excess coefficient (lambda (lambda) as well as moderate vibrations and noise.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The miRNA miR-106b-5p has been linked to epilepsy, but its specific role and mechanism of action remain unclear. This was investigated in the present study using a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and an in vitro system of HT22 hippocampal cells treated with Mg2+-free solution and cocultured with BV2 microglia cells. We found that inhibiting miR-106b-5p expression promoted microglia M2 polarization, reduced the inflammatory response, and alleviated neuronal injury. These effects involved modulation of the repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa)-Rac1-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling axis. Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting miR-106b-5p or downstream factors can be effective in preventing epileptogenesis or treating epilepsy.

AB  - Objective: Methamphetamine (METH) is one of the most widely used addictive drugs, and addiction to it is on the rise all over the world. METH abuse has long-term damaging effects that reduce memory and impair cognitive functions. According to studies, the observed effects are strongly related to the nerve cell damage caused by METH, which leads to neurotoxicity. Some of these intra-neuronal events include dopamine oxidation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone produced primarily by the kidneys and, in small quantities, by the liver. Studies have shown that EPO exhibits considerable neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of EPO on METH neurotoxicity.Methods: Initially, 48 male Wistar rats, weighing 250-300 g, were randomly assigned to four groups: control (n = 12), METH (n = 12), and METH+EPO (2500, 5000 IU/kg/IP- n = 12). METH was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 40 mg per kg of body weight (four injections of 10 mg every two hours) to induce neurotoxicity. EPO was injected at doses of 2500 and 5000 IU/kg seven days after the last METH administration (ip). Morris water maze test was performed following EPO injection (1 day after the last dose) to assess spatial memory. The brains were removed after the behavioral test, biochemical evaluations and immunohistochemistry (caspase-3 and GFAP) was performed. Results: The results showed that EPO treatment significantly improved spatial memory impairment (P < 0.01), compared to the METH group, EPO was a significant reduction in malondialdehyde and TNF-alpha (P < 0.01), as well as an increase in superoxide dismutase (P < 0.05) and glutathione-PX (P < 0.01). Furthermore, EPO treatment significantly reduced the number of GFAP positive cells (P < 0.01) and caspase 3 (P < 0.001) in the hippocampus (CA1 region). Conclusions: The study findings suggested that EPO may have great neuroprotective effects on METH neurotoxicity due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties.

AB  - Background: Cornus officinalis Sieb. Et Zucc. has the efficacy of tonifying the marrow and filling up the essence, breaking up the accumulation and opening up the orifices. Our research team found that CoS extracts were protective against A beta 25 -35 -induced memory impairment in mice. However, the pharmacodynamic components and mechanisms by which CoS improves AD have yet to be thoroughly explored and investigated. Purpose: This study focused on exploring the bioactive components and pharmacodynamic mechanisms of CoS aqueous extract underlying mitochondrial damage and neuroinflammation to improve A beta 25 -35 -induced AD. Methods: AD mouse models were generated using A beta 25 -35 brain injections. Different doses of CoS aqueous extract were orally administered to mice for 28 days. The cognitive function, neuronal and synaptic damage, mitochondrial damage (mitochondrial length, mitochondrial fusion fission -related protein expression), neuroglial activation, and immune inflammatory factor and ERK pathway -related protein levels of mice were assessed. The CoS aqueous extracts components were identified using UPLC-TQ/MS and screened for cellular activity. Midivi-1 (Drp1 inhibitor) or PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) was added to A beta 25 -35 -exposed PC12 cells to assess whether CoS and its active compounds mMorB and CorE regulate mitochondrial fission through ERK/Drp1. PC12-N9 cells were cocultured to investigate whether mMorB and CorE could regulate mitochondrial division through the ERK pathway to modulate neuroinflammation. Results: CoS improved exploration and memory in AD mice, reduced synaptic and mitochondrial damage in their hippocampus, and modulated disturbed mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, CoS inhibited ERK pathway signaling and attenuated abnormal activation of glial cells and secondary immune inflammatory responses. Additionally, in vitro experiments revealed that CoS and its compounds 7 beta-O-methylmorroniside (mMorB) and Cornusdiridoid E (CorE) ameliorated mitochondrial injury caused by A beta 25 -35 in PC12 cells through inhibition of the ERK/Drp1 pathway. Meanwhile, mMorB and CorE ameliorated cellular inflammation by inhibiting the Ras/ ERK/CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - Background: Virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a promising tool for cognitive rehabilitation in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These patients often endure significant cognitive impairments, which are associated with decreased quality of life and increased disease burden. Traditional treatments are limited in improving cognitive functions, making VR-based interventions an area of growing interest. Objective: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of VR-based interventions on cognitive function in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders by synthesizing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for RCTs from January 2010 to December 2024. Studies were included if they evaluated the impact of VR-based interventions on cognitive outcomes in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by 2 researchers. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) as effect size. Results: A total of 21 RCTs involving 1051 participants were included. Overall, VR-based interventions significantly improved cognitive functions of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.33-1.01, z=3.85; P<.001). Subgroup analyses revealed significant benefits for cognitive rehabilitation training (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 0.33-1.17, z=3.53; P<.001), exergame-based training (SMD 1.09, 95% CI 0.26-1.91, z=2.57; P=.01), and telerehabilitation and social functioning training (SMD 2.21, 95% CI 1.11-3.32, z=3.92; P<.001). Conversely, immersive cognitive training, music attention training, and vocational and problem-solving skills training did not yield significant improvements (z=1.86, P=.06; z=0.35, P=.72; z=0.88, P=.38; respectively). Disease-type subgroup analyses indicated significant improvements in schizophrenia (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.22-1.62, z=2.58; P=.01), and mild cognitive impairment (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 0.16-1.35, z=2.47; P=.01), but not in brain injuries, Parkinson disease, or stroke (z=0.34, P=.73; z=1.26, P=.21; z=1.16, P=.24; respectively). Conclusions: This meta-analysis revealed that VR-based interventions can improve cognitive functions among individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders, with notable improvements observed in cognitive rehabilitation training, exergame-based training, and tele-rehabilitation and social functioning training. These results offer valuable evidence supporting the use of VR technology in rehabilitation for neuropsychiatric conditions and inform the optimization of future intervention approaches.

AB  - Microglial activation-mediated neuroinflammation is a major contributor to neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia. The Fractalkine (FKN)/CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) axis plays a critical role in regulating microglial activation and neuroinflammation. The aim of this study is to ascertain the role and mechanism of FKN/CX3CR1 axis in hypoxic postconditioning (HPC)-induced anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects on transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI). We found that HPC suppressed microglial activation and alleviated neuroinflammation in hippocampal CA1 after tGCI. Meanwhile, HPC upregulated the expression of FKN and CX3CR1 in neurons, but it downregulated the expression of CX3CR1 in glial cells after tGCI. In addition, the overexpression of FKN induced by the administration of FKN-carried lentivirus reduced microglial activation and inhibited neuroinflammation in CA1 after tGCI. Furthermore, silencing CX3CR1 with CX3CRi-carried lentivirus in CA1 after tGCI suppressed microglial activation and neuroinflammation and exerted neuroprotective effects. Finally, the overexpression of FKN caused a marked increase of neuronal CX3CR1 receptors, upregulated the phosphorylation of Akt, and reduced neuronal loss of rats in CA1 after tGCI. These findings demonstrated that HPC protected against neuronal damage in CA1 of tGCI rats through inhibiting microglial activation and activating Akt signaling pathway via FKN/CX3CR1 axis.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (Neonatal HIE) is a common but serious disease caused by perinatal asphyxia injury in newborns. Elevated neuronal apoptosis plays an important role in the injury process post hypoxia ischemia of the brain, which accurate mechanism is still worthy to be studied. Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) possesses the protective effect in ischemia-reperfusion in multiple organs, including livers and hearts. The main purpose of this work was to investigate whether CREG was involved in alleviating neonatal HIE and explore the possible mechanisms. We found that CREG expression was downregulated in the hippocampus of neonatal HIE rats as well as oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-treated hippocampal neurons. Besides, CREG overexpression promoted survival while inhibited apoptosis in OGD/R-induced hippocampal neurons accompanied by AKT signaling activation, which could be reversed by CREG silence. In addition, the protective effects of CREG overexpression could be antagonized by AKT deactivation, indicating the function of CREG was attributed by regulating AKT pathway. Collectedly, we demonstrated that CREG protected hippocampal neurons from hypoxic ischemia-induced injury through regulating survival and apoptosis via activating AKT signaling pathway.

AB  - Purposeful induction of fever for healing, including the treatment of epilepsy, was used over 2000 years ago by Hippocrates. More recently, fever has been demonstrated to rescue behavioral abnormalities in children with autism. However, the mechanism of fever benefit has remained elusive due in large part to the lack of appropriate human disease models recapitulating the fever effect. Pathological mutations in the IQSEC2 gene are frequently seen in children presenting with intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy. We recently described a murine A350V IQSEC2 disease model, which recapitulates important aspects of the human A350V IQSEC2 disease phenotype and the favorable response to a prolonged and sustained rise in body core temperature in a child with the mutation. Our goal has been to use this system to understand the mechanism of fever benefit and then develop drugs that can mimic this effect and reduce IQSEC2-associated morbidity. In this study, we first demonstrate a reduction in seizures in the mouse model following brief periods of heat therapy, similar to what was observed in a child with the mutation. We then show that brief heat therapy is associated with the correction of synaptic dysfunction in neuronal cultures of A350V mice, likely mediated by Arf6-GTP.

AB  - A reduced dendritic complexity, especially in regions such as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, has been linked to the pathophysiology of some neuropsychiatric disorders, in which synaptic plasticity and functions such as emotional and cognitive processing are compromised. For this reason, the identification of new therapeutic strategies would be enriched by the search for metabolites that promote structural plasticity. The present study evaluated the dendritogenic potential of the ethanol extract of Lippia alba, an aromatic plant rich in flavonoids and terpenes, which has been widely used in traditional medicine for its presumed analgesic, anxiolytic, and antidepressant potential. An in vitro model of rat cortical neurons was used to determine the kinetics of the plant's effect at different time intervals. Changes in morphological parameters of the neurons were determined, as well as the dendritic complexity, by Sholl analysis. The extract promotes the outgrowth of dendritic branching in a rapid and sustained fashion, without being cytotoxic to the cells. We found that this effect could be mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, which is involved in mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, differentiation, and survival. The evidence presented in this study provides a basis for further research that, through in vivo models, can delve into the plant's therapeutic potential.

AB  - Ischemic accumulation of succinate causes cerebral damage by excess production of reactive oxygen species. However, it is unknown whether ischemic accumulation of succinate affects neural stem cell proliferation. In this study, we established a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. We found that succinate levels increased in serum and brain tissue (cortex and hippocampus) after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation stimulated primary neural stem cells to produce abundant succinate. Succinate can be converted into diethyl succinate in cells. Exogenous diethyl succinate inhibited the proliferation of mouse-derived C17.2 neural stem cells and increased the infarct volume in the rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Exogenous diethyl succinate also increased the succinylation of the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 but repressed Cdc42 GTPase activity in C17.2 cells. Increasing Cdc42 succinylation by knockdown of the desuccinylase Sirt5 also inhibited Cdc42 GTPase activity in C17.2 cells. Our findings suggest that ischemic accumulation of succinate decreases Cdc42 GTPase activity by induction of Cdc42 succinylation, which inhibits the proliferation of neural stem cells and aggravates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

AB  - Tea is an important beverage source of dietary polyphenols and well known for containing phenolic structure diversity. A series of phenylpropanoid-substituted catechins, flavonols, flavan-3-hexoside, and proanthocyanidin are present in different herbs with various biological activities, inspiring our exploration of phenylpropanoid-substituted ester type of catechins (PSECs) due to the enrichment of galloylated catechins in tea. In this study, we used a guiding-screening-location-isolation integrated route including creating a hypothesized PSEC dataset, MS/MS data acquiring, construction of molecular networks, and traditional column chromatography and preliminarily identified 14 PSECs by MS/MS spectrum. Two of these PSECs were further purified and elucidated by NMR and CD spectra. Further MS detection in tea products and fresh leaves suggests that the production of the two new compounds was enhanced during tea processing. The synthesis mechanism was proposed to obtain these types of components for further investigation on their roles in human health protection. This study provides an example for the exploration of new functional ingredients from food sources guided by MS/MS data-based networking, and also new insights into the reaction mechanism to form new catechin conjugates among polyphenols in green tea.

AB  - Thousand-and-one-amino acid kinase 3 (TAOK3) is a serine and threonine kinase that belongs to the STE-20 family of kinases. Its absence reduces T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and increases the interaction of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, a major negative regulator of proximal TCR signaling, with the kinase LCK, a component of the core TCR signaling complex. Here, we used mouse models and human cell lines to investigate the mechanism by which TAOK3 limits the interaction of SHP-1 with LCK. The loss of TAOK3 decreased the survival of naive CD4+ T cells by dampening the transmission of tonic and ligand-dependent TCR signaling. In mouse T cells, Taok3 promoted the secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in response to TCR activation in a manner that depended on Taok3 gene dosage and on Taok3 kinase activity. TCR desensitization in Taok3-/- T cells was caused by an increased abundance of Shp-1, and pharmacological inhibition of Shp-1 rescued the activation potential of these T cells. TAOK3 phosphorylated threonine-394 in the phosphatase domain of SHP-1, which promoted its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The loss of TAOK3 had no effect on the abundance of SHP-2, which lacks a residue corresponding to SHP-1 threonine-394. Modulation of SHP-1 abundance by TAOK3 thus serves as a rheostat for TCR signaling and determines the activation threshold of T lymphocytes.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, characterized by visual deficits and cognitive impairment. However, current therapies have limited efficacy. Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether Lycium barbarum extract (LBE) can mitigate the decline in brain and visual function in mouse models of AD during the middle and late stages. Methods: The chemical constituents of LBE were identified using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. LBE was administered daily to 5xFAD mice for one month and to 3xTG mice for two months, via the intragastric route, until the middle and late stages of AD. Visual and brain functions were assessed through behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. The structure of the hippocampal region and retina was evaluated using immunostaining. RNA sequencing and western blotting were performed to explore potential mechanisms. Results: Sixteen compounds were identified in LBE, with lycibarbarspermidines and rutin being the major components. Functionally, LBE significantly improved memory and light responses of retinal ganglion cells in both 5xFAD and 3xTG mice. It also enhanced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and cortical visual function in 3xTG mice. Structurally, LBE reduced hippocampal A beta deposits in 5xFAD mice and Tau phosphorylation in 3xTG mice. In the retinas of 3xTG mice, LBE increased ganglion cell survival and inhibited inflammation and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, LBE restored the expression of WNT5a/b and KRAS, and inhibited GSK3(3 activation in the retinas of 3xTG mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that LBE can alleviate visual and brain function deterioration in various AD mouse models, even at the middle or late stages, possibly through the activation of the WNT pathway leading to the inhibition of Tau phosphorylation. This study reveals a novel mechanism of LBE action and proposes a promising strategy for treating AD patients using natural plant extracts, even at advanced stages.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment. Gut microbiota dysfunction (dysbiosis) is implicated in the pathology of AD and is associated with several detrimental consequences, including neurotransmitter depletion, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and insulin resistance, which all contribute to the onset of AD. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Probiotics Fermentation Technology (PFT), a kefir product, in alleviating AD symptoms via regulation of the gut microbiota using a streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced AD mouse model and to compare its activity with simvastatin, which has been proven to effectively treat AD. Mice received one intracerebroventricular injection of STZ (3 mg/kg). PFT (100, 300, 600 mg/kg) and simvastatin (20 mg/kg) were administered orally for 3 weeks. PFT supplementation mitigated STZ-induced neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus, restored hippocampal acetylcholine levels, and improved cognition in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were accompanied by reductions in oxidative damage, proinflammatory cytokine expression, apoptosis, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PFT hindered amyloid plaque accumulation via the enhancement of insulin-degrading enzyme. These beneficial effects were comparable to those produced by simvastatin. The results suggest that PFT can alleviate AD symptoms by regulating the gut microbiota and by inhibiting AD-related pathological events.

AB  - A comprehensive approach to the mineral composition of black teas of different origins was studied using the Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS) method, supported by chemometric tools including Principal Component Analysis PCA) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Significant differences between the teas from seven countries (Japan, Nepal, Kenya, Iran, Sri Lanka, India, and China) were shown. K was the main element determined in all teas, with an average concentration of 11,649 mg/kg, followed by Ca, Mg and Mn. In general, regarding all investigated black teas, the element content was ranked in the following order: K > Ca > Mg > Mn > Fe > Na > Zn > Cu. The applied chemometric methods allowed us to recognize black tea clusters based on their mineral composition and place of cultivation, and allowed us to find correlations between particular elements in black teas. The performed analyses revealed interesting correlations between the concentration of various elements in black teas: K was negatively correlated with Na, Fe, Mn and Cu; K was positively correlated with the content of Ca and Mg. Significant positive correlations between Mn and Fe and Mn and Zn in the studied black tea samples were also revealed. It was shown that mineral composition may be a significant factor regarding the origin of the black tea, not only considering the country, but also the region or province.

AB  - Iron and oxygen deficiencies are common features in pathophysiological conditions, such as ischemia, neurological diseases, and cancer. Cellular adaptive responses to such deficiencies include repression of mitochondrial respiration, promotion of angiogenesis, and cell cycle control. We applied a systematic proteomics analysis to determine the global proteomic changes caused by acute hypoxia and chronic and acute iron deficiency (ID) in hippocampal neuronal cells. Our analysis identified over 8600 proteins, revealing similar and differential effects of each treatment on activation and inhibition of pathways regulating neuronal development. In addition, comparative analysis of ID-induced proteomics changes in cultured cells and transcriptomic changes in the rat hippocampus identified common altered pathways, indicating specific neuronal effects. Transcription factor enrichment and correlation analysis identified key transcription factors that were activated in both cultured cells and tissue by iron deficiency, including those implicated in iron regulation, such as HIF1, NFY, and NRF1. We further identified MEF2 as a novel transcription factor whose activity was induced by ID in both HT22 proteome and rat hippocampal transcriptome, thus linking iron deficiency to MEF2-dependent cellular signaling pathways in neuronal development. Taken together, our study results identified diverse signaling networks that were differentially regulated by hypoxia and ID in neuronal cells.

AB  - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common diseases in elderly men and causes lower urinary tract symptoms due to excessive proliferation of prostate stromal and epithelial cells. The present study investigated the improving effect of BenPros, an edible natural product mixture (green tea extract, soybean extract and camellia japonica oil), against the development of BPH in vitro and in vivo. BenPros treatment showed inhibitory ability on testosterone-induced androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and 5 alpha-reductase protein expression in LNCap-LN3 cells and anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-induced increases in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in RAW264.7 cells. In a testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH rat model, BenPros decreased the up-regulated serum 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and PSA levels. Moreover, BenPros also significantly reduced PSA protein expression in prostate tissue. Furthermore, TP-induced increased expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were reduced by BenPros, resulting in an increase in the Bcl-2/BCL2-related X ratio. These regulatory abilities of BenPros on BPH inducing markers also reduced prostate size and epithelial thickness based on histological analysis. These results indicate that BenPros has a protective ability against BPH in vitro and in vivo, and it may be a promising candidate as a functional food in regulating BPH.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) is common, but its mechanism is largely unknown. Huang-Lian-Jie-Du (HLJD) decoction is a classical and powerful prescription in China. It consists of four medicinal plants and is widely used in traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Studies have shown that HLJD decoction is effective in treating obesity, depression, and so on. However, the therapeutic mechanism of HLJD is still poorly understood.
   Purpose: Our study aimed to explore whether inflammatory factors and Trem2/Dap12/Syk pathway are involved in this process and whether HLJD treatment can repair cognitive impairment in HFD-induced obesity.
   Methods: To obtain the obese mice, male mice were treated with HFD (60 Kcal% fat) for 16 weeks. After an additional eight weeks, HLJD decoction was administered orally at doses of 4 and 8 g/kg daily for eight weeks. The mice were then subjected to four behavior tests. A beta 42, total Tau, inflammatory-related, and microglial dysregulation-related markers expression were measured. Molecular docking analysis was also conducted to predict the interaction of the chemical constituents of HLJD with human TREM2, DAP12, and SYK. HLJD at doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 mu g/mL or limonin at concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 mu M were used to treat BV2 cells for 24 h. CCK8 assay and Trem2, Dap12, Syk, and p-Syk expression were measured.
   Results: Our study revealed that cognitive impairment was evident in mice treated with HFD, indicating the impact of obesity on cognitive function. The expression of A beta 42 and total Tau in the hippocampus (HIP) was significantly higher in obese (HFD-V) mice compared to normal control (NC-V) mice. The Il6, Il1b, and Il10 mRNA expression levels were also markedly increased in the HIP of obese mice. Furthermore, Trem2, Dap12, p-Syk, and Iba1 expression were elevated in the HIP of obese mice. Importantly, HLJD treatment was found to repair cognitive impairment and lower the protein expression of A beta 42, Tau, Trem2, Dap12, p-Syk, and the expression of Il6, Il1b, and Il10 mRNA in HIP of HFD-V mice. The increased expression of Trem2, Dap12, p-Syk, and Iba1 in HIP after HFD consumption could be reduced after receiving HLJD decoction. The compound Limonin showed a well-predicted binding energy with TREM2, DAP12, and SYK. BV2 cells with HLJD or limonin detected the mRNA expressions of Trem2/Dap12. HLJD at 25 and 50 mu g/mL decreased Trem2, Dap12, and p-Syk protein levels in BV2 cells.
   Conclusion: These results reveal that HLJD treatment could alleviate cognitive impairment in HFD-induced obese mice by controlling the activation of the Trem2/Dap12 pathway and reducing Syk phosphorylation in HIP microglia. HLJD and limonin suppressed Trem2/Dap12/Syk signaling pathway in BV2 cells. HLJD therapy might represent a novel treatment for patients with cognitive impairment induced by obesity.

AB  - Anxiety and depressive disorders are closely associated; however, the pathophysiology of these disorders remains poorly understood. Further exploration of the mechanisms involved in anxiety and depression such as the stress response may provide new knowledge that will contribute to our understanding of these disorders. Fifty-eight 8-12-week-old C57BL6 mice were separated into experimental groups by sex as follows: male controls (n = 14), male restraint stress (n = 14), female controls (n = 15) and female restraint stress (n = 15). These mice were taken through a 4-week randomised chronic restraint stress protocol, and their behaviour, as well as tryptophan metabolism and synaptic proteins, were measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adrenal catecholamine regulation was also measured. The female mice showed greater anxiety-like behaviour than their male counterparts. Tryptophan metabolism was unaffected by stress, but some basal sex characteristics were noted. Synaptic proteins were reduced in the hippocampus in stressed females but increased in the prefrontal cortex of all female mice. These changes were not found in any males. Finally, the stressed female mice showed increased catecholamine biosynthesis capability, but this effect was not found in males. Future studies in animal models should consider these sex differences when evaluating mechanisms related to chronic stress and depression.

AB  - Hibernation is an adaptation that allows animals such as the Arctic ground squirrel (AGS) to survive the absence of food or water during the winter season. Understanding mechanisms of metabolic suppression during hibernation torpor promises new therapies for critical care. The activation of the Adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)AR) has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for entrance into hibernation with a winter season sensitization to the agonist, but the role of the A(1)AR in seasonal sensitization is unknown. In the current study, we characterize the A(1)AR in the forebrain, hippocampus and hypothalamus of summer and torpid AGS. For the first time, we define the pharmacological characteristics of the A(1)AR agonist, N-6-cyclohexyladenosine and the A(1)AR antagonist dipropylcyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) in the AGS brain. In addition, we test the hypothesis that increased A(1)AR agonist efficacy is responsible for sensitization of the A(1)AR during the torpor season. The resulting S-35-GTP gamma S binding data indicate an increase in agonist potency during torpor in two out of three brain regions. In addition to S-35-GTP gamma S binding, [H-3]DPCPX saturation and competition assays establish for the first-time pharmacological characteristics for the A(1)AR agonist, N-6-cyclohexyladenosine and the A(1)AR antagonist dipropylcyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) in AGS brain.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from autism to intellectual disability display sex-biased prevalence and phenotypical presentations. Despite increasing knowledge about temporospatial cortical map development and genetic variants linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, when and how sex-biased neural circuit derailment may arise in diseased brain remain unknown. Here, we identify in mice that serotonin uptake transporter (SERT) in non-serotonergic neurons - hippocampal and prefrontal pyramidal neurons - confers sex-biased effects specifically during neural circuit development. A set of gradient-patterned CA3 pyramidal neurons transiently express SERT to clear extracellular serotonin, coinciding with hippocampal synaptic circuit establishment. Ablating pyramidal neuron SERT (SERTPyramid Delta) alters dendritic spine developmental trajectory in the hippocampus, and precipitates sex -biased impairments in long-term activity-dependent hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive behaviors. Transcriptomic analyses identify sex-biased alterations in gene sets associated with autism, dendritic spine structure, synaptic function and male-specific enrichment of dysregulated genes in glial cells in early postnatal SERTPyramid Delta hippocampus. Our data suggest that SERT function in these pyramidal neurons underscores a temporal-and brain region -specific regulation of normal sex-dimorphic circuit development and a source for sex-biased vulnerability to cognitive and behavioral impairments.

AB  - Obesity has become a public health problem in recent decades, and during pregnancy, it can lead to an increased risk of gestational complications and permanent changes in the offspring resulting from a process known as metabolic programming. The offspring of obese dams are at increased risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), even in the absence of high-fat diet consumption. NAFLD is a chronic fatty liver disease that can progress to extremely severe conditions that require surgical intervention with the removal of the injured tissue. Liver regeneration is necessary to preserve organ function. A range of pathways is activated in the liver regeneration process, including the Hippo, TGF beta, and AMPK signaling pathways that are under epigenetic control. We investigated whether microRNA modulation in the liver of the offspring of obese dams would impact gene expression of Hippo, TGF beta, and AMPK pathways and tissue regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx). Female Swiss mice fed a standard chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) before and during pregnancy and lactation were mated with male control mice. The offspring from control (CT-O) and obese (HF-O) dams weaned to standard chow diet until day 56 were submitted to PHx surgery. Prior to the surgery, HF-O presented alterations in miR-122, miR-370, and Let-7a expression in the liver compared to CT-O, as previously shown, as well as in its target genes involved in liver regeneration. However, after the PHx (4 h or 48 h post-surgery), differences in gene expression between CT-O and HF-O were suppressed, as well as in microRNA expression in the liver. Furthermore, both CT-O and HF-O presented a similar regenerative capacity of the liver within 48 h after PHx. Our results suggest that survival and regenerative mechanisms induced by the partial hepatectomy may overcome the epigenetic changes in the liver of offspring programmed by maternal obesity.

AB  - Ginsenoside F1, the metabolite of Rg1, is one of the most important constituents of Panax ginseng. Although the effects of ginsenosides on amyloid beta (A beta) aggregation in the brain are known, the role of ginsenoside F1 remains unclear. Here, we investigated the protective effect of ginsenoside F1 against A beta aggregation in vivo and in vitro. Treatment with 2.5 mu M ginsenoside F1 reduced A beta-induced cytotoxicity by decreasing A beta aggregation in mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a (N2a) and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines. Western blotting, real-time PCR, and siRNA analysis revealed an increased level of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP). Furthermore, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis confirmed that ginsenoside F1 could pass the blood-brain barrier within 2 h after administration. Immunostaining results indicate that ginsenoside F1 reduces A beta plaques in the hippocampus of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) double-transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. Consistently, increased levels of IDE and NEP protein and mRNA were observed after the 8-week administration of 10 mg/kg/d ginsenoside F1. These data indicate that ginsenoside F1 is a promising therapeutic candidate for AD.

AB  - Background Optogenetic tools allow precise manipulation of neuronal activity via genetically encoded light-sensitive proteins. Currently available optogenetic inhibitors are not suitable for prolonged use due to short-lasting photocurrents, tissue heating, and unintended changes in ion distributions, which may interfere with normal neuron physiology. To overcome these limitations, a novel potassium channel-based optogenetic silencer, named PACK, was recently developed. The PACK tool has two components: a photoactivated adenylyl cyclase from Beggiatoa (bPAC) and a cAMP-dependent potassium channel, SthK, which carries a large, long-lasting potassium current in mammalian cells. Previously, it has been shown that activating the PACK silencer with short light pulses led to a significant reduction of neuronal firing in various in vitro and acute in vivo settings. Here, we examined the viability of performing long-term studies in vivo by looking at the inhibitory action and side effects of PACK and its components in healthy and epileptic adult male mice. Results We targeted hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA1) pyramidal cells using a viral vector and enabled illumination of these neurons via an implanted optic fiber. Local field potential (LFP) recordings from CA1 of freely moving mice revealed significantly reduced neuronal activity during 50-min intermittent (0.1 Hz) illumination, especially in the gamma frequency range. Adversely, PACK expression in healthy mice induced chronic astrogliosis, dispersion of pyramidal cells, and generalized seizures. These side effects were independent of the light application and were also present in mice expressing bPAC without the potassium channel. Light activation of bPAC alone increased neuronal activity, presumably via enhanced cAMP signaling. Furthermore, we applied bPAC and PACK in the contralateral hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice following a unilateral injection of intrahippocampal kainate. Unexpectedly, the expression of bPAC in the contralateral CA1 area was sufficient to prevent the spread of spontaneous epileptiform activity from the seizure focus to the contralateral hippocampus. Conclusion Our study highlights the PACK tool as a potent optogenetic inhibitor in vivo. However, further refinement of its light-sensitive domain is required to avoid unexpected physiological changes.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the neuroprotective effects of various exercise intensities in a mouse model of depressive behavior disorders. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into a control group, depressive disorder group (RST), moderate-intensity sustained exercise group (RST_MICT), high-intensity sustained exercise group (RST_HICT), and high-intensity interval exercise group (RST_HIIT). The animal model was established by applying restraint stress (RST) at 2 h/day for 14 days. Behavioral function was better in all exercise groups, especially in the RST_HIIT group, than in the RST group. Factors related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor showed higher levels in the exercise groups than in the RST group. The levels of 4-hydroxynonenal, an oxidative stress index, were significantly lower in the exercise groups than in the RST group. Malondialdehyde levels were lower in the exercise groups than in the RST group, but the difference was not significant. The analysis of serotonin and corticosterone, indicators of depression, revealed positive results in the exercise groups. The neuroplasticity-related variables c-fos and glial fibrillary acidic protein were more positive in the RST_HIIT group than in the RST group. Thus, HIIT improved neuroplasticity, oxidative stress, and neurotrophic factors in the depressive disorder model, indicating its potential for preventing and treating depression.

AB  - Effects of modulation of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (GR and MR, respectively) on acute neuroinflammatory response were studied in the dorsal (DH) and ventral (VH) parts of the hippocampus of male Wistar rats. Local neuroinflammatory response was induced by administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to the DH. The modulation of GR and MR was performed by dexamethasone (GR activation), mifepristone, and spironolactone (GR and MR inhibition, respectively). Experimental drugs were delivered to the dentate gyrus of the DH bilaterally by stereotaxic injections. Dexamethasone, mifepristone, and spironolactone were administered either alone (basal conditions) or in combination with LPS (neuroinflammatory conditions). Changes in expression levels of neuroinflammation-related genes and morphology of microglia 3 days after intrahippocampal administration of above substances were assessed. Dexamethasone alone induced a weak proinflammatory response in the hippocampal tissue, while neither mifepristone nor spironolactone showed significant effects. During LPS-induced neuroinflammation, GR activation suppressed expression of selected inflammatory genes, though it did not prevent appearance of activated forms of microglia. In contrast to GR activation, GR or MR inhibition had virtually no influence on LPS-induced inflammatory response. The results suggest glucocorticosteroids ambiguously modulate specific aspects of neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus of rats at molecular and cellular levels.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by cognitive inflexibility and social deficits. Probiotics have been demonstrated to play a promising role in managing the severity of ASD. However, there are no effective probiotics for clinical use. Identifying new probiotic strains for ameliorating ASD is therefore essential. Using the maternal immune activation (MIA)-based offspring ASD-like mouse model, a probiotic-based intervention strategy was examined in female mice. The gut commensal microbe Parabacteroides goldsteinii MTS01, which was previously demonstrated to exert multiple beneficial effects on chronic inflammation-related-diseases, was evaluated. Prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure induced leaky gut-related inflammatory phenotypes in the colon, increased LPS activity in sera, and induced autistic-like behaviors in offspring mice. By contrast, P. goldsteinii MTS01 treatment significantly reduced intestinal and systemic inflammation and ameliorated disease development. Transcriptomic analyses of MIA offspring indicated that in the intestine, P. goldsteinii MTS01 enhanced neuropeptide-related signaling and suppressed aberrant cell proliferation and inflammatory responses. In the hippocampus, P. goldsteinii MTS01 increased ribosomal/mitochondrial and antioxidant activities and decreased glutamate receptor signaling. Together, significant ameliorative effects of P. goldsteinii MTS01 on ASD relevant behaviors in MIA offspring were identified. Therefore, P. goldsteinii MTS01 could be developed as a next-generation probiotic for ameliorating ASD.

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia in the elderly. Unfortunately, no cure for AD is available to date. Increasing evidence has proved the roles of misfolded protein aggregation due to impairment of the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) in the pathogenesis of AD, and thus making TFEB (transcription factor EB), which orchestrates ALP, as a promising target for treating AD. As a complementary therapy, acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) has been commonly used for treating human diseases. Although the beneficial effects of acupuncture for AD have been primarily studied both pre-clinically and clinically, the real efficacy of acupuncture on AD remains inconclusive and the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated the cognitive-enhancing effect of three-needle EA (TNEA) in an animal model of AD with beta-amyloid (A beta) pathology (5xFAD). TNEA reduced APP (amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein), C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP and A beta load, and inhibited glial cell activation in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of 5xFAD. Mechanistically, TNEA activated TFEB via inhibiting the AKT-MAPK1-MTORC1 pathway, thus promoting ALP in the brains. Therefore, TNEA represents a promising acupuncture therapy for AD, via a novel mechanism involving TFEB activation.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an inflammatory sequence. It can lead to distant organ injury, including damage to the central nervous system (CNS), mediated by increased circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. It can also lead to increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. However, the effect of AKI on the inflammatory response of the brain has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we observed the effect of AKI on BBB permeability, microglia and astrocyte activation, and neuronal toxicity in the brain. The striatum and ventral midbrain, known to control overall movement, secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine. The activation of microglia and astrocytes present in this area causes neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The activation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which are responsible for important functions, including memory, learning, concentration, and language, can trigger nerve cell apoptosis. The activation of astrocytes and microglia at this site is also involved in the inflammatory response associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid. In the situation of kidney ischemia reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI, activation of microglia and astrocytes were observed in the striatum, ventral midbrain, hippocampus, and cortex. However, neuronal cell death was not observed until 48 h.

AB  - There is an unmet need for a stable and nonreactogenic vaccine against the bioterrorism agent, Coxiella burnetii, causing Q fever. Here a safe, effective, and non-reactogenic Q fever vaccine is developed by employing self-assembled particles (CPs) composed of cross-reacting material 197, a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin. CPs are designed that incorporate selected C. burnetii antigens and assemble them inside engineered Escherichia coli at high yields. A cost-effective manufacturing process enables the production of CP-based Q fever vaccine candidates. Four vaccine candidates are developed, including a T-cell epitope-based vaccine (CP-COX), and one that comprises two immunodominant antigens, Com1 and YbgF. The latter is tested separately (CP-Com1, CP-YbgF) or as a mixture (CP-Com1/CP-YbgF). Initial immunogenicity studies in mice reveal that the mixed CP-Com1/YbgF elicits the highest antibody titers with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of approximate to 100 000 and induction of TH1 and TH2 cytokines. CP-Com1/YbgF is further evaluated in guinea pigs, demonstrating its safety and efficacy, as shown by the absence of adverse reactions and a significant reduction in febrile responses compared to alum upon challenge with C. burnetii. Together, the study shows the potential of CPs for the development of a safe and immunogenic subunit Q fever vaccine.
   The non-toxic diphtheria toxin variant, the CRM197 (cross-reacting material 197) protein, is engineered for in vivo assembly of particles incorporating Q fever antigens to serve as Q fever vaccine. A cost-effective manufacturing process is developed to generate ambient-temperature stable vaccine particles. These CRM197 protein particles are safe and induce protective immune responses against Q fever in an animal model.image

AB  - Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common congenital defects during neurulation. Spina bifida is a type of NTD that can occur in different forms. Since myelomeningocele (MMC) is the most severe form of spina bifida, finding a satisfactory treatment for MMC is a gold standard for the treatment of spina bifida. The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) demonstrated that intrauterine treatment of spina bifida could ameliorate the complications associated with spina bifida and would also reduce the placement of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt by 50%. Recently developed tissue engineering (TE) approaches using scaffolds, stem cells, and growth factors allow treatment of the fetus with minimally invasive methods and promising outcomes. The application of novel patches with appropriate stem cells and growth factors leads to better coverage of the defect with fewer complications. These approaches with less invasive surgical procedures, even in animal models with similar characteristics as the human MMC defect, paves the way for the modern application of less invasive surgical methods. Significantly, the early detection of these problems and applying these approaches can increase the potential efficacy of MMC treatment with fewer complications. However, further studies should be conducted to find the most suitable scaffolds and stem cells, and their application should be evaluated in animal models. This review intends to discuss advanced TE methods for treating MMC and recent successes in increasing the efficacy of the treatment.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) provokes lifelong CNS dysfunction, including an increased susceptibility to seizure disorders. We investigated hippocampal excitability in vitro in the offspring of dams exposed to a mild ethanol concentration throughout pregnancy (ethanol 15%v/v in drinking water). Hippocampal slices were prepared from the offspring at a young (Y, 21-30 postnatal days, PND) or adult (A, 60 PND) age, with controls from same age normal rats (N). Synchronous spontaneous interictal-type epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were induced by bathing the slices in Mg2+-free ACSF or in 4-Aminopyridine (4-AR 50 mu M) and were recorded from CA1 pyramidal layer of temporal (T) and septal slices (S). Hippocampal slices readily generated IEDs following NMDA receptor activation or K+ conductance block, with frequency and duration depending on location (septa) or temporal), age, the activating mechanism, and prior conditioning (N or PAE). From the two media, 4-AP induced higher frequency (always), shorter duration (mostly) IEDs compared to Mg2+-free ACSF. Temporal IED frequency increased with age, whereas septa! was stable, indicating an earlier maturation of the latter part. The hippocampal "T to S" (high to low) excitability gradient appeared at/later than the end of the first postnatal month and mostly concerned discharge frequency. Discharge duration generally decreased with maturation but appeared to depend on many factors, including conditioning. Prenatal alcohol exposure differentiated the control of synchronous discharges by NMDA receptors and K+ conductances, and their developmental evolution, thus suggesting potential mechanisms for aberrant hippocampal neuronal network function.

AB  - Brain models typically focus either on low-level biological detail or on qualitative behavioral effects. In contrast, we present a biologically-plausible spiking-neuron model of associative learning and recognition that accounts for both human behavior and low-level brain activity across the whole task. Based on cognitive theories and insights from machine-learning analyses of M/EEG data, the model proceeds through five processing stages: stimulus encoding, familiarity judgement, associative retrieval, decision making, and motor response. The results matched human response times and source-localized MEG data in occipital, temporal, prefrontal, and precentral brain regions; as well as a classic fMRI effect in prefrontal cortex. This required two main conceptual advances: a basal-ganglia-thalamus action-selection system that relies on brief thalamic pulses to change the functional connectivity of the cortex, and a new unsupervised learning rule that causes very strong pattern separation in the hippocampus. The resulting model shows how low-level brain activity can result in goal-directed cognitive behavior in humans.
   Despite large research enterprises in the past decade, it is still unknown how our cognitive system is implemented by the immense complexity of the neurons in our brains. Here, we present a large-scale computational model of the human brain that explains how low-level neural activity can lead to functional, goal-directed behavior. Previous models typically either focused on low-level biological detail or on part-task, qualitative behavioral effects. In contrast, the current model is biologically plausible through the use of spiking neurons, and accounts both for human behavior and neuroimaging data across a whole task. The model's mechanisms are based on detailed machine-learning analyses of neuroimaging data, as well as on cognitive theories of associative recognition.

AB  - Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder which is the primary cause of dementia in the elderly. Telomere attrition has been proposed as a hallmark of aging. Our study aimed to explore the mechanism of the protection of telomere 1 (POT1) in regulating telomere length and affecting cellular senescence in AD. The AD mouse model was established by d-galactose and aluminum chloride, and the water maze test and dark avoidance test were used to detect the behaviors of mice and confirm the success of AD mouse model. AD cell model was established with HT22 cells induced by A beta(42) oligomers. POT1 expression in the AD model was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cellular telomere length in hippocampal tissue was analyzed by telomere restriction fragment. Localization of intracellular POT1, telomerase, and telomeres was analyzed by immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Dual-luciferase assay was used to validate the targeted binding relationship between microRNA-340-5p (miR-340-5p) and POT1. After inhibiting POT1 expression, the symptoms of AD in mice were improved. A beta(1-42) deposition was reduced, whereas telomere length and telomerase activity was increased. Dual-luciferase assay verified the binding relationship between miR-340-5p and POT1. An increase in miR-340-5p expression could alleviate cellular senescence and AD symptoms. miR-340-5p increased cellular telomere length and delayed cell senescence by inhibiting POT1 expression to improve AD symptoms. This study made a conclusion that miR-340-5p increased cellular telomere length and delayed cell senescence by inhibiting POT1 expression to improve AD symptoms in mice.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has been shown to be intimately associated with adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ). Adult neurogenesis declines in aging rodents and primates. However, the role of BMP signaling in the age-related neurogenesis decline remains elusive and the effect of BMP4 on adult SVZ neurogenesis remains controversial. Here, the expression of BMP4 and its canonical effector phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8 (p-Smad1/5/8) in the murine SVZ and SGZ were found to be increased markedly with age. We identified Id3 as a major target of BMP4 in neuronal stem cells (NSCs) of both neurogenic regions, which exhibited a similar increase during aging. Intracerebroventricular infusion of BMP4 activated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and upregulated Id3 expression, which further restrained NeuroD1, leading to attenuated neurogenesis in both neurogenic regions and defective differentiation in the SGZ. Conversely, noggin, a potent inhibitor of BMP4, demonstrated opposing effects. In support of this, BMP4 treatment or lentiviral overexpression of Id3 resulted in decreased NeuroD1 protein levels in NSCs of both neurogenic regions and significantly inhibited neurogenesis. Thus, our findings revealed that the increased BMP4 signaling with age inhibited adult neurogenesis in both SVZ and SGZ, which may be attributed at least in part, to the changes in the Id3-NeuroD1 axis.

AB  - The nucleocytoplasmic translocation of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) controls the growth of animal tissues and organs. YAP1 binds to transcription factors in the nucleus to activate the transcrip-tion of proliferation and anti-apoptotic genes. The Hippo pathway prevents the nuclear translocation of YAP1 by phosphorylating YAP1, while mechanical forces promote it by opening the nuclear pore complex and stimulating other signaling pathways. Recently we found that Protein salvador homolog 1 (SAV1), a component of the Hippo pathway, interacts with filamin A (FLNA) in a force-dependent manner, raising a possibility that the Hippo pathway is regulated by mechanical force through the FLNA-SAV1 axis. To test this hypothesis, we generated conditional knock-in (KI) mice expressing non-Flna-binding mutant Sav1 in hepatocytes by crossing with mice carrying Cre recombinase driven by the serum albumin (alb) gene promoter. Unexpectedly, the insertion of the flox cassette skipped exon 2, resulting in a shorter Sav1 in all the transgenic mice. Since exon 2 encodes a fragment containing a Flna-binding domain, we analyzed both point mutant KI and exon 2-deleted mutant mice. Here we show that disruption of the Flna-Sav1 interaction in the mouse liver promotes apoptosis and suppresses tissue and organ growth without affecting the phosphorylation level of Yap1. These results provide evidence that the growth of animal tissues and organs is regulated by apoptosis downstream of the force-dependent FLNA-SAV1 interaction, at least in part.

AB  - Clinical and preclinical studies report the implication of 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptors (5-HT(4)Rs) in depression and anxiety. Here, we tested whether the absence of 5-HT4Rs influences the response to the antidepressant fluoxetine in mice subjected to chronic corticosterone administration, an animal model of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the effects of chronic administration of fluoxetine in corticosterone-treated wild-type (WT) and 5-HT4R knockout (KO) mice were evaluated in the open-field and novelty suppressed feeding tests. As 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are critically involved in depression and anxiety, we further evaluated 5-HT1A receptor functionality by [S-35]GTP gamma S autoradiography and BDNF mRNA expression by in situ hybridization techniques. We found that 5-HT4R KO and WT mice displayed anxiety- and depressive-like behavior following chronic administration of corticosterone, as evidenced in the open-field and novelty suppressed feeding tests. In the open-field, a decreased central activity was observed in naive and corticosterone-treated mice of both genotypes following chronic fluoxetine administration. In the novelty suppressed feeding test, a predictive paradigm of antidepressant activity, chronic treatment with fluoxetine reverted the latency to eat in both genotypes. The antidepressant also potentiated the corticosterone-induced desensitization of the 5-HT1AR in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Further, chronic fluoxetine increased BDNF mRNA expression in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in corticosterone-treated mice of both genotypes. Therefore, our findings indicate that the behavioral effects of fluoxetine in the corticosterone model of depression and anxiety appear not to be dependent on 5-HT(4)Rs.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a widely planted woody oil crop with economic significance because it does not occupy cultivated land. The sugar-derived acetyl-CoA is the basic building block in fatty acid synthesis and oil synthesis in C. oleifera fruit; however, sugar metabolism in this species is uncharacterized. Herein, the changes in sugar content and metabolic enzyme activity and the transcriptomic changes during C. oleifera fruit development were determined in four developmental stages (CR6: young fruit formation; CR7: expansion; CR9: oil transformation; CR10: ripening). CR7 was the key period of sugar metabolism since it had the highest amount of soluble sugar, sucrose, and glucose with a high expression of genes related to sugar transport (four sucrose transporters (SUTs) or and one SWEET-like gene, also known as a sugar, will eventually be exported transporters) and metabolism. The significant positive correlation between their expression and sucrose content suggests that they may be the key genes responsible for sucrose transport and content maintenance. Significantly differentially expressed genes enriched in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway were observed in the CR6 versus CR10 stages according to KEGG annotation. The 26 enriched candidate genes related to sucrose metabolism provide a molecular basis for further sugar metabolism studies in C. oleifera fruit.

AB  - Beyond deficits in hippocampal-dependent episodic memory, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) features sensory impairment in visual cognition consistent with extensive neuropathology in the retina. 12A12 is a monoclonal cleavage specific antibody (mAb) that in vivo selectively neutralizes the AD-relevant, harmful N-terminal 20-22 kDa tau fragment(s) (i.e., NH(2)htau) without affecting the full-length normal protein. When systemically injected into the Tg2576 mouse model overexpressing a mutant form of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), APPK670/671L linked to early onset familial AD, this conformation-specific tau mAb successfully reduces the NH(2)htau accumulating both in their brain and retina and, thus, markedly alleviates the phenotype-associated signs. By means of a combined biochemical and metabolic experimental approach, we report that 12A12mAb downregulates the steady state expression levels of APP and Beta-Secretase 1 (BACE-1) and, thus, limits the Amyloid beta (A beta) production both in the hippocampus and retina from this AD animal model. The local, antibody-mediated anti-amyloidogenic action is paralleled in vivo by coordinated modulation of the endocytic (BIN1, RIN3) and bioenergetic (glycolysis and L-Lactate) pathways. These findings indicate for the first time that similar molecular and metabolic retino-cerebral pathways are modulated in a coordinated fashion in response to 12A12mAb treatment to tackle the neurosensorial Afi accumulation in AD neurodegeneration.

AB  - Quercitrin (Qc) is a well-known flavonoid compound that exerts anti-inflammation effects on various diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant-like response of Qc and its underlying mechanisms concerning neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behaviors. The results showed a single dose of Qc (10 mg/kg) produced an antidepressant-like effect at 2 h postadministration and lasted for at least 3 days. The expressions of neuroplasticity signaling molecules of pCREB/BDNF/PSD95/Synapsin1 were upregulated at 2 h, and ERK signaling was upregulated for 3 days in the hippocampus after a single administration of Oc or ketamine. A 5-day treatment of LPS led to depression-like behaviors, including reduced sucrose preference and increased immobility in the tail suspension test or forced swim test, which were all reversed by a single dose of Qc. In LPStreated mice, Qc reduced the levels of inflammation-related factors including IL-10, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha in serum, as well as the activations of PI3K/AKT/NF-kappa B and MEK/ERK pathways in the hippocampus. Moreover, Qc restored the expressions of pCREB/ BDNF/PSD95/Synapsin1 signaling in the hippocampus that were impaired by LPS. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, but not PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, produced effects similar to Qc. LY294002 also restored the expressions of pCREB/BDNF/PSD95/Synapsin1 signaling in the hippocampus impaired by LPS. Additionally, subeffective doses of Qc and LY294002 induced behavioral and molecular synergism. Together, the depression-like behaviors in LPS-treated mice were alleviated by a single dose of Qc likely via inhibition of the activations PI3K/AKT/NF-kappa B inflammation signaling and subsequent improvement of neuroplasticity.

AB  - Camellia hainanica is one of the camellia plants distributed in tropical regions, and its regeneration system and genetic transformation are affected by callus browning. However, the underlying mechanism of Camellia hainanica callus browning formation remains largely unknown. To investigate the metabolic basis and molecular mechanism of the callus browning of Camellia hainanica, histological staining, high-throughput metabolomics, and transcriptomic assays were performed on calli with different browning degrees (T1, T2, and T3). The results of histological staining revealed that the brown callus cells had obvious lignification and accumulation of polyphenols. Widely targeted metabolomics revealed 1190 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs), with 53 DAMs annotated as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. Comparative transcriptomics revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the T2 vs. T1 associated with the biosynthesis and regulation of flavonoids and transcription factors in Camellia hainanica. Among them, forty-four enzyme genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis were identified, including phenylalaninase (PAL), 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase (4CL), naringenin via flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS), Chalcone synthase (CHS), Chalcone isomerase (CHI), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate transferase (HCT), Dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), anthocyanin reductase (LAR), anthocyanin synthetase (ANS), and anthocyanin reductase (ANR). Related transcription factors R2R3-MYB, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and WRKY genes also presented different expression patterns in T2 vs. T1. These results indicate that the browning of calli in Camellia hainanica is regulated at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels. The oxidation of flavonoids and the regulation of related structural genes and transcription factors are crucial decisive factors. This study preliminarily revealed the molecular mechanism of the browning of the callus of Camellia hainanensis, and the results can provide a reference for the anti-browning culture of Camellia hainanica callus.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects a large part of the aging population. It is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia and associated with neurocognitive dysfunction. One hypothesis is that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions could be altered by exosomes. Exosomes are nanovesicles found in biological fluids. Through the study of exosomes and their content in tau and amyloid beta (A beta), the aim of this study was to show how exosomes could be used as biomarkers of OSAS and of their cognitive disorders. Two groups of 15 volunteers from the PROOF cohort were selected: severe apnea (AHI > 30) and control (AHI < 5). After exosome isolation from blood serum, we characterized and quantified them (CD81, CD9, CD63) by western blot and ELISAs and put them 5 h in contact with an in vitro BBB model. The apparent permeability of the BBB was measured using sodium-fluorescein and TEER. Cell ELISAs were performed on tight junctions (ZO-1, claudin-5, occludin). The amount of tau and A beta proteins found in the exosomes was quantified using ELISAs. Compared to controls, OSAS patients had a greater quantity of exosomes, tau, and A beta proteins in their blood sera, which induced an increase in BBB permeability in the model and was reflected by a loss of tight junction' expression. Elderly patients suffering severe OSAS released more exosomes in serum from the brain compartment than controls. Such exosomes increased BBB permeability. The impact of such alterations on the risk of developing cognitive dysfunction and/or neurodegenerative diseases is questioned.

AB  - Apart from dopaminergic neurotoxicity, exposure to rotenone, a commonly used insecticide in agriculture, also adversely affects hippocampal and cortical neurons, resulting in cognitive impairments in mice. We recently established a role of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in rotenone-elicited deficits of cognition, yet the mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the involvement of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) catalytic subunit gp91(phox) in rotenone-induced cognitive deficits and the associated mechanisms. Our study demonstrated that rotenone exposure elevated expression of gp91(phox) and phosphorylation of the NOX2 cytosolic subunit p47(phox), along with NADPH depletion in the hippocampus and cortex of mice, indicating NOX2 activation. Specific knockdown of gp91(phox) in microglia via adeno-associated virus delivery resulted in reduced microglial activation, proinflammatory gene expression and improved learning and memory capacity in rotenone-intoxicated mice. Genetic deletion of gp91(phox) also reversed rotenone-elicited cognitive dysfunction in mice. Furthermore, microglial gp91(phox) knockdown attenuated neuronal damage and synaptic loss in mice. This intervention also suppressed iron accumulation, disruption of iron-metabolism proteins and iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and restored the balance of ferroptosis-related parameters, including GPX4, SLC711, PTGS2, and ACSL4 in rotenone-lesioned mice. Intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis with liproxstatin-1 conferred protection against rotenone-induced neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction in mice. In summary, our findings underscored the contribution of microglial gp91(phox)-dependent neuroinflammation and ferroptosis to learning and memory dysfunction in rotenone-lesioned mice. These results provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits associated with pesticide-induced Parkinsonism, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for intervention.

AB  - Multifactorial interactions, including nutritional state, likely participate in neurodegeneration's pathogenesis and evolution. Dysregulation in methionine (Met) metabolism could lead to the development of hyperhomocysteinaemia (hHcy), playing an important role in neuronal dysfunction, which could potentially lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathological features. This study combines proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) with immunohistochemical analysis to examine changes in the metabolic ratio and histomorphological alterations in the dorsal rat hippocampus (dentate gyrus-DG) subjected to a high Met diet. Male Wistar rats (420-480 g) underwent hHcy evoked by a Met-enriched diet (2 g/kg of weight/day) lasting four weeks. Changes in the metabolic ratio profile and significant histomorphological alterations have been found in the DG of hHcy rats. We have detected increased morphologically changed neurons and glial cells with increased neurogenic markers and apolipoprotein E positivity parallel with a diminished immunosignal for the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor 1 in hHcy animals. A Met diet induced hHcy, likely via direct Hcy neurotoxicity, an interference with one carbon unit metabolism, and/or epigenetic regulation. These conditions lead to the progression of neurodegeneration and the promotion of AD-like pathological features in the less vulnerable hippocampal DG, which presents a plausible therapeutic target.

AB  - Senile plaques consisting of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides are a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A beta peptides are heterogeneous regarding the exact length of their amino- and carboxy-termini. A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-42 are often considered to represent canonical "full-length" A beta species. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed the distribution of A beta 1-x, A beta x-42 and A beta 4-x species in amyloid deposits in the subiculum, hippocampus and cortex in 5XFAD mice during aging. Overall plaque load increased in all three brain regions, with the subiculum being the area with the strongest relative plaque coverage. In the subiculum, but not in the other brain regions, the A beta 1-x load peaked at an age of five months and decreased thereafter. In contrast, the density of plaques positive for N-terminally truncated A beta 4-x species increased continuously over time. We hypothesize that ongoing plaque remodeling takes place, leading to a conversion of deposited A beta 1-x peptides into A beta 4-x peptides in brain regions with a high A beta plaque burden.

AB  - Developmental exposure to nonylphenol (NP) results in irreversible impairments of the central nervous system (CNS). The neural precursor cell (NPC) pool located in the subgranular zone (SGZ), a substructure of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, is critical for the development of hippocampal circuits and some hippocampal functions such as learning and memory. However, the effects of developmental exposure to NP on this pool remain unclear. Thus, our aim was to clarify the impacts of developmental exposure to NP on this pool and to explore the potential mechanisms. Animal models of developmental exposure to NP were created by treating Wistar rats with NP during pregnancy and lactation. Our data showed that developmental exposure to NP decreased Sox2-and Ki67-positive cells in the SGZ of offspring. Inhibited activation of Shh signaling and decreased levels of its downstream mediators, E2F1 and cyclins, were also observed in pups developmentally exposed to NP. Moreover, we established the in vitro model in the NE-4C cells, a neural precursor cell line, to further investigate the effect of NP exposure on NPCs and the underlying mechanisms. Purmorphamine, a small purine-derived hedgehog agonist, was used to specifically modulate the Shh signaling. Consistent with the in vivo results, exposure to NP reduced cell proliferation by inhibiting the Shh signaling in NE-4C cells, and purmorphamine alleviated this reduction in cell proliferation by restoring this signaling. Altogether, our findings support the idea that developmental exposure to NP leads to inhibition of the NPC proliferation and the NPC pool depletion in the SGZ located in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, we also provided the evidence that suppressed activation of Shh signaling may contribute to the effects of developmental exposure to NP on the NPC pool.

AB  - Although the relationship between macroautophagy/autophagy and Alzheimer disease (AD) is widely studied, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, especially the regulatory role of the initiation signaling of autophagy on AD. Here, we find that the ER transmembrane protein CANX (calnexin) is a novel interaction partner of the autophagy-inducing kinase ULK1 and is required for ULK1 recruitment to the ER under basal or starved conditions. Loss of CANX results in the inactivity of ULK1 kinase and inhibits autophagy flux. In the brains of people with AD and APP-PSEN1 mice, the interaction of CANX and ULK1 declines. In mice, the lack of CANX in hippocampal neurons causes the accumulation of autophagy receptors and neuron damage, which affects the cognitive function of C57BL/6 mice. Conversely, overexpression of CANX in hippocampal neurons enhances autophagy flux and partially contributes to improving cognitive function of APP-PSEN1 mice, but not the CANX variant lacking the interaction domain with ULK1.

AB  - Background: Flower senescence is the last stage of flower development and affects the ornamental and economic value of flower plants. There is still less known on flower senescence of the ornamental plant Camellia lutchuensis, a precious species of Camellia with significant commercial application value. Methods: Transcriptome sequencing was used to investigate the flower senescence in five developmental stages of C. lutchuensis. Results: By Illumina HiSeq sequencing, we generated approximately 101.16 Gb clean data and 46649 differentially expressed unigenes. Based on the different expression pattern, differentially expressed unigenes were classified into 10 Sub Class. And Sub Class 9 including 8252 unigenes, was highly expressed in the flower senescent stage, suggesting it had a potential regulatory relationship of flower senescence. First, we found that ethylene biosynthesis genes ACSs, ACOs, receptor ETR genes and signaling genes EINs, ERFs all upregulated during flower senescence, suggesting ethylene might play a key role in the flower senescence of C. lutchuensis. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production related genes peroxidase (POD), lipase (LIP), polyphenoloxidase (PPO), and ROS scavenging related genes glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were induced in senescent stage, suggesting ROS might be involved in the flower senescence. Besides, the expression of monoterpenoid and isoflavonoid biosynthesis genes, transcription factors (WRKY, NAC, MYB and C2H2), senescence-associated gene SAG20 also were increased during flower senescence. Conclusion: In C. lutchuensis, ethylene pathway might be the key to regulate flower senescence, and ROS signal might play a role in the flower senescence.

AB  - Vitamin C (VitC) is maintained at high concentrations in the brain and is an essential micronutrient for brain function. VitC deficiency leads to neuropsychiatric scurvy, which is characterized by depression and cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism by which mild VitC deficiency impairs brain function is currently unknown. In the present study, we conducted RNA sequencing analysis and found that a short-term VitC deficiency altered the brain transcriptome in ODS rats, which cannot synthesize VitC. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that VitC deficiency affected the expression of genes controlled by the glucocorticoid receptor in the brain. We confirmed an increased secretion of glucocorticoids from the adrenal gland during VitC deficiency. We found that non-neuronal cells, including microglia, which are resident immune cells in the brain, changed their transcriptional patterns in response to VitC deficiency. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the quiescent ramified microglia transform into the activated amoeboid microglia during three weeks of VitC deficiency. The morphological activation of microglia was accompanied by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 in the hippocampus. Furthermore, VitC deficiency decreased the number of newly born neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, suggesting that VitC was required for adult neurogenesis that plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Our findings may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of normal brain function by adequate levels of VitC. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In addition to neuroinflammatory functions, chemokine CCL5 shows strong neurotrophic properties. In this study, we found that CCL5 facilitates hippocampal glucoregulatory efficiency. CCL5 promotes aerobic glucose metabolism, mitochondrial ATP generation and purine synthesis, improving synaptic plasticity and enhancing memory and cognition functions.
   Glucoregulatory efficiency and ATP production are key regulators for neuronal plasticity and memory formation. Besides its chemotactic and neuroinflammatory functions, the CC chemokine--CCL5 displays neurotrophic activity. We found impaired learning-memory and cognition in CCL5-knockout mice at 4 months of age correlated with reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation and impaired synapse structure. Re-expressing CCL5 in knockout mouse hippocampus restored synaptic protein expression, neuronal connectivity and cognitive function. Using metabolomics coupled with FDG-PET imaging and seahorse analysis, we found that CCL5 participates in hippocampal fructose and mannose degradation, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis as well as glutamate and purine metabolism. CCL5 additionally supports mitochondrial structural integrity, purine synthesis, ATP generation, and subsequent aerobic glucose metabolism. Overexpressing CCL5 in WT mice also enhanced memory-cognition performance as well as hippocampal neuronal activity and connectivity through promotion of de novo purine and glutamate metabolism. Thus, CCL5 actions on glucose aerobic metabolism are critical for mitochondrial function which contribute to hippocampal spine and synapse formation, improving learning and memory.

AB  - Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a core component of the stigmoid body (STB) and a neuroprotective interactor with the causative agents of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The cholinergic system is often affected by NDs. Our previous studies suggest that cholinergic brainstem/spinal cord motoneurons are more vulnerable to neurodegeneration due to a lack of STB/HAP1 protectivity. The forebrain cholinergic nuclei are also major neurodegenerative/psychotic targets; however, the relationships of HAP1 with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) have yet to be determined there. This study used western blotting and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the comparative distribution of HAP1 with ChAT and their immunohistochemical relationships in the adult mouse forebrain cholinergic nuclei. The results showed that HAP1-immunoreactive (ir) neurons were highly distributed in the basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei, including medial septal nucleus (MS), nucleus of vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB), nucleus of horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB), and substantia innominata basal part (SIB). HAP1-ir neurons were sporadically scattered in the striatum. The significantly highest co-expression ratio of HAP1 with ChAT was observed in MS and VDB. In contrast, the ChAT-ir neurons never contained HAP1 in the caudate putamen of the striatum. These suggest that, due to having putative HAP1 protectivity, the cholinergic neurons in MS and VDB that are mainly projected to the hippocampal/parahippocampal regions might be protected to regulate social memory formation, emotion, and other psychological functions. Consequently, the lack of HAP1 protectivity might make cholinergic neurons in the striatum more prone to neurodegeneration in certain NDs.

AB  - The phosphorylation of the evolutionarily conserved Thr73 residue of Rab10 has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, its impact on neuronal physiological function remains poorly understood. In this study, we generated a novel mouse model constitutively expressing the phosphomimetic Rab10 T73D to investigate its effects. Our findings revealed that homozygous Rab10 T73D mutant mice were postnatally lethal and exhibited brain developmental defects characterized by cortical thinning and shortened neuronal processes. Further investigation demonstrated that cultured hippocampal neurons with homozygous T73D mutation displayed decreased axon development, with reduced accumulation of Rab10 at the tips of neuronal processes and increased Rab10 localization at lysosomes. Mechanistically, the T73D mutation induces a constitutively GTPbound state and while substantially weakening interaction with GDI1, GDI2 and JIP1. These molecular alterations collectively lead to altered T73D Rab10-positive vesicle trafficking dynamics, manifesting as decreased anterograde transport and increased movement velocity. Notably, comparative localization studies in RPE cells confirmed fundamental discrepancies between T73D distribution patterns and authentic phosphorylated Rab10 dynamics, validating limitations of this phosphomimetic approach. Collectively, our study elucidates the potential physiological roles of phosphorylated Rab10 in the regulation of neuronal process outgrowth and underscores its significance in the neural system. Additionally, it highlights the limitations of the T73D mutant in fully mimicking Rab10 phosphorylation.

AB  - Gap junctions (GJ) are suggested to support stem cell differentiation. The Muse cells that are applied in clinical trials are non-tumorigenic pluripotent-like endogenous stem cells, can be collected as stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA-3+) positive cells from multiple tissues, and show triploblastic differentiation and self-renewability at a single cell level. They were reported to up-regulate pluripotency gene expression in suspension. We examined how GJ inhibition affected pluripotency gene expression in adherent cultured-Muse cells. Muse cells, mainly expressing gap junction alpha-1 protein (GJA1), reduced GJ intercellular communication from similar to 85% to 5-8% after 24 h incubation with 120 mu M 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, 400 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and 90 mu M dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, as confirmed by a dye-transfer assay. Following inhibition, NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2 were up-regulated 2-4.5 times more; other pluripotency-related genes, such as KLF4, CBX7, and SPRY2 were elevated; lineage-specific differentiation-related genes were down-regulated in quantitative-PCR and RNA-sequencing. Connexin43-siRNA introduction also confirmed the up-regulation of NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2. YAP, a co-transcriptional factor in the Hippo signaling pathway that regulates pluripotency gene expression, co-localized with GJA1 (also known as Cx43) in the cell membrane and was translocated to the nucleus after GJ inhibition. Adherent culture is usually more suitable for the stable expansion of cells than is a suspension culture. GJ inhibition is suggested to be a simple method to up-regulate pluripotency in an adherent culture that involves a Cx43-YAP axis in pluripotent stem cells, such as Muse cells.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is characterized by an occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel resulting in neuronal cell death due to nutritional and oxygen deficiency. Additionally, post-ischemic cell death is augmented after reperfusion. These events are paralleled by dysregulated miRNA expression profiles in the peri-infarct area. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanism in the peri-infarct region is crucial for developing promising therapeutics. Utilizing a tMCAo (transient Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion) model in rats, we studied the expression levels of the miRNAs (miR) 223-3p, 155-5p, 3473, and 448-5p in the cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus of both the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres. Additionally, the levels in the blood serum, spleen, and liver and the expression of their target genes, namely, Nlrp3, Socs1, Socs3, and Vegfa, were assessed. We observed an increase in all miRNAs on the ipsilateral side of the cerebral cortex in a time-dependent manner and increased miRNAs levels (miR-223-3p, miR-3473, and miR-448-5p) in the contralateral hemisphere after 72 h. Besides the cerebral cortex, the amygdala presented increased expression levels, whereas the thalamus and hippocampus showed no alterations. Different levels of the investigated miRNAs were detected in blood serum, liver, and spleen. The gene targets were altered not only in the peri-infarct area of the cortex but selectively increased in the investigated non-affected brain regions along with the spleen and liver during the reperfusion time up to 72 h. Our results suggest a supra-regional influence of miRNAs following ischemic stroke, which should be studied to further identify whether miRNAs are transported or locally upregulated.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is considered to be a significant mechanism contributing to depression. Several studies have reported that A1 astrocytes were highly prevalent in human neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanism by which A1 astrocytes contribute to depression remains unclear. Clinical studies have suggested a correlation between TNF-alpha, an activator of A1 astrocytes, and the severity of depression. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that TNF-alpha might worsen depression by activating A1 astrocytes. Our previous studies indicated that Rhodomyrtone (Rho) has the potential to improve depression-like behavior in mice. However, the exact mechanism for this effect has not been fully elucidated. Importantly, it was reported that Rho alleviated skin inflammation in a mouse model of psoriasis by inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that rhodomyrtone may exert antidepressant effects by modulating the TNF-alpha pathway. However, further research is required to investigate and validate these hypotheses, shedding light on the relationships between neuroinflammation, A1 astrocytes, TNF-alpha, and depression. By obtaining a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms, these findings could lead to the development of novel antidepressant strategies that target the TNF-alpha pathway in the context of neuroinflammation. In vivo, based on the established chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse depression model, we characterized the mechanism of TNF-alpha and Rho during depression by using several behavioral assays, adeno-associated virus(AAV) transfection, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and other experimental methods. In vitro, we characterized the effect of Rho on inflammation in TNF-alpha-treated primary astrocytes. TNFR1 expression was significantly increased in the hippocampus of depression-like mice, with increased astrocytes activation and neuronal apoptosis. These processes were further enhanced with increasing levels of TNF-alpha in the cerebrospinal fluid of mice. However, this process was attenuated by knockdown of TNFR1 and infliximab (Inf; a TNF-alpha antagonist). Injection of rhodomyrtone decreased the expressions of TNFR1 and TNF-alpha, resulting in significant improvements in mouse depression-like behaviors and reduction of astrocyte activation. TNF-alpha could be involved in the pathophysiological process of depression, through mediating astrocytes activation by binding to TNFR1. By blocking this pathway, Rho may be a novel antidepressant.

AB  - Here, we have unveiled the effects of cycloastragenol against A beta (Amyloid-beta)-induced oxidative stress, neurogenic dysfunction, activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and mitochondrial apoptosis in an A beta-induced mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The A beta-induced mouse model was developed by the stereotaxic injection of amyloid-beta (5 mu g/mouse/intracerebroventricular), and cycloastragenol was given at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day/p.o for 6 weeks daily. For the biochemical analysis, we used immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Our findings showed that the injection of A beta elevated oxidative stress and reduced the expression of neurogenic markers, as shown by the reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the phosphorylation of its specific receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (p-TrKB). In addition, there was a marked reduction in the expression of NeuN (neuronal nuclear protein) in the A beta-injected mice brains (cortex and hippocampus). Interestingly, the expression of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1), p-TrKB, BDNF, and NeuN was markedly enhanced in the A beta + Cycloastragenol co-treated mice brains. We have also evaluated the expressions of MAP kinases such as phospho c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), p-38, and phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) in the experimental groups, which suggested that the expression of p-JNK, p-P-38, and p-Erk were significantly upregulated in the A beta-injected mice brains; interestingly, these markers were downregulated in the A beta + Cycloastragenol co-treated mice brains. We also checked the expression of activated microglia and inflammatory cytokines, which showed that cycloastragenol reduced the activated microglia and inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of cycloastragenol against mitochondrial apoptosis and memory dysfunctions in the experimental groups. The findings showed significant regulatory effects against apoptosis and memory dysfunction as revealed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Collectively, the findings suggested that cycloastragenol regulates oxidative stress, neurotrophic processes, neuroinflammation, apoptotic cell death, and memory impairment in the mouse model of AD.</p>

AB  - Background. Sepsis, which could cause a systemic inflammatory response, is a life-threatening disease with a high morbidity and mortality rate. There is evidence that brain injury may be related to severe systemic infection induced by sepsis. The brain injury caused by sepsis could increase the risk of mortality in septic patients, which seriously affects the septic patient's prognosis of survival. Although there remains a focus on sepsis research, clinical measures to prevent and treat brain injury in sepsis are not yet available, and the high mortality rate is still a big health burden. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the new molecules or regulated pathways that can effectively inhibit the progress of sepsis. Objective. NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) increased in the procession of sepsis and functioned as the key regulator of pyroptosis. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) can protect organs from multiorgan dysfunction syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharides in mice, and NLRP3 could be inhibited by HSF1 in many organs. However, whether HSF1 regulated NLRP3 in sepsis-induced brain injury, as well as the detailed mechanism of HSF1 in brain injury, remains unknown in the sepsis model. In this research, we try to explore the relationship between HSF1 and NLRP3 in a sepsis model and try to reveal the mechanism of HSF1 inhibiting the process of brain injury. Methods. In this study, we used wild-type mice and hsf1(-/-) mice for in vivo research and PC12 cells for in vitro research. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the expression of HSF1, NLRP3, cytokines, and pyrolytic proteins. EthD-III staining was chosen to detect the pyroptosis of the hippocampus and PC12 cells. Results. The results showed that HSF1 is negatively related to pyroptosis. The pyroptosis in cells of brain tissue was significantly increased in the hsf1(-/-) mouse model compared to hsf1(+/+) mice. In PC12 cells, hsf1 siRNA can upregulate pyroptosis while HSF1-transfected plasmid could inhibit the pyroptosis. HSF1 could negatively regulate the NLRP3 pathway in PC12 cells, while hsf1 siRNA enhanced the pyroptosis in PC12 cells, which could be reversed by nlrp3 siRNA. Conclusion. These results imply that HSF1 could alleviate sepsis-induced brain injury by inhibiting pyroptosis through the NLRP3-dependent pathway in brain tissue and PC12 cells, suggesting HSF1 as a potential molecular target for treating brain injury in sepsis clinical studies.

AB  - For Alzheimer's disease (AD), aging is the main risk factor, but whether cognitive impairments due to aging resemble early AD deficits is not yet defined. When working with mouse models of AD, the situation is just as complicated, because only a few studies track the progression of the disease at different ages, and most ignore how the aging process affects control mice. In this work, we addressed this problem by comparing the aging process of PS2APP (AD) and wild-type (WT) mice at the level of spontaneous brain electrical activity under anesthesia. Using local field potential recordings, obtained with a linear probe that traverses the posterior parietal cortex and the entire hippocampus, we analyzed how multiple electrical parameters are modified by aging in AD and WT mice. With this approach, we highlighted AD specific features that appear in young AD mice prior to plaque deposition or that are delayed at 12 and 16 months of age. Furthermore, we identified aging characteristics present in WT mice but also occurring prematurely in young AD mice. In short, we found that reduction in the relative power of slow oscillations (SO) and Low/High power imbalance are linked to an AD phenotype at its onset. The loss of SO connectivity and cortico-hippocampal coupling between SO and higher frequencies as well as the increase in UP-state and burst durations are found in young AD and old WT mice. We show evidence that the aging process is accelerated by the mutant PS2 itself and discuss such changes in relation to amyloidosis and gliosis.

AB  - Background Despite continuous development of antiseizure medications (ASMs), global seizure control rates remain unsatisfactory, highlighting the urgent need for novel ASMs targeting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation represents an emerging strategy to simultaneously attenuate seizures and associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Therefore, this study investigates whether JC124, a novel NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective effects in kainic acid (KA)-induced epileptic mice and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Methods Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) was used to analyze the association between NLRP3 alleles and epilepsy susceptibility. NLRP3 knockout mice were generated, and then epileptic mice induced by intrahippocampal KA injection were administered JC124 (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) once daily for 28 days. The spontaneous recurrent seizures, hippocampal local field potential, depressive-like behavior, cognitive dysfunction, and locomotor ability of mice were evaluated. The brain tissues of the mice were collected for Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence labeling, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, transmission electron microscopy, and morphological staining. The binding capacity of JC124 to the human NLRP3 protein was assessed using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. hiPSC-derived neurons were used to explore the neuroprotective effects of JC124 against inflammatory injury in human neurons. Results In this study, a positive correlation was identified between the expression of the NLRP3 gene and the susceptibility to epilepsy through SMR analysis. JC124 intervention markedly inhibited seizures and improved depressive-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction. It also reduced hippocampal neuronal loss, neuronal pyroptosis, microgliosis, and astrogliosis. Importantly, the neuroprotective effects of JC124 in KA-induced epileptic mice were mediated through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. JC124 inhibited neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in KA-treated NLRP3 wild-type mice, but not in KA-treated NLRP3 knockout mice. Furthermore, JC124 bound directly to the human NLRP3 protein and alleviated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in hiPSC-derived neurons stimulated by LPS and ATP. Conclusions These findings indicate that inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome with JC124 represents a potentially safe and innovative therapeutic strategy to mitigate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in epilepsy and to alleviate seizures and associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities.

AB  - This network-based pharmacology study intends to uncover the underlying mechanisms of cannabis leading to a therapeutic benefit and the pathogenesis for a wide range of diseases claimed to benefit from or be caused by the use of the cannabis plant. Cannabis contains more than 600 chemical components. Among these components, cannabinoids are well-known to have multifarious pharmacological activities. In this work, twelve cannabinoids were selected as active compounds through text mining and drug-like properties screening and used for initial protein-target prediction. The disease-associated biological functions and pathways were enriched through GO and KEGG databases. Various biological networks [i.e., protein-protein interaction, target-pathway, pathway-disease, and target-(pathway)-target interaction] were constructed, and the functional modules and essential protein targets were elucidated through the topological analyses of the networks. Our study revealed that eighteen proteins (CAT, COMT, CYP17A1, GSTA2, GSTM3, GSTP1, HMOX1, AKT1, CASP9, PLCG1, PRKCA, PRKCB, CYCS, TNF, CNR1, CNR2, CREB1, GRIN2B) are essential targets of eight cannabinoids (CBD, CBDA, Delta(9)-THC, CBN, CBC, CBGA, CBG, Delta(8)-THC), which involve in a variety of pathways resulting in beneficial and adverse effects on the human body. The molecular docking simulation confirmed that these eight cannabinoids bind to their corresponding protein targets with high binding affinities. This study generates a verifiable hypothesis of medical benefits and harms of key cannabinoids with a model which consists of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways, which provides an important foundation for further deployment of preclinical and clinical studies of cannabis.

AB  - Background: Intravenous fluid infusions are an important therapy for patients with circulatory shock. However, it is challenging to predict how patients' cardiac stroke volume (SV) will respond, and thus identify how much fluids should be delivered, if any. Model-predicted SV time-profiles of response to fluid infusions could potentially be used to guide fluid therapy.
   Method: A clinically applicable model-based method predicts SV changes in response to fluid-infusions for a pig trial (N = 6). Validation/calibration SV, SVmea, is from an aortic flow probe. Model parameters are identified in 3 ways: fitting to SVmea from the entire infusion, SVflfit, from the first 200 ml, SVfl200, or from the first 100 ml, SV100fl . RMSE compares error of model-based SV time-profiles for each parameter identification method, and polar plot analysis assesses trending ability. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluates ability of model predicted SVs, SVfl200 and SVfl100, to distinguish non-responsive and responsive infusions, using area-under the curve (AUC), and balanced accuracy as a measure of performance.
   Results: RMSE for SVflFit, SVfl200, and SV100fl was 1.8, 3.2, and 6.5 ml, respectively, and polar plot angular limit of agreement from was 11.6, 28.0, and 68.8 degrees, respectively. For predicting responsive and non-responsive interventions SVfl200, and SVfl100 had ROC AUC of 0.64 and 0.69, respectively, and balanced accuracy was 0.75 in both cases.
   Conclusions: The model-predicted SV time-profiles matched measured SV trends well for SVflFit, SVfl200, but not SVfl100. Thus, the model can fit the observed SV dynamics, and can deliver good SV prediction given a sufficient parameter identification period. This trial is limited by small numbers and provides proof-of-method, with further experimental and clinical investigation needed. Potentially, this method could deliver model-predicted SV time-profiles to guide fluid therapy decisions, or as part of a closed-loop fluid control system.

AB  - The oncogenes yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are potent liver oncogenes. Because gene mutations cannot fully explain their nuclear enrichment, we aim to understand which mechanisms cause YAP/TAZ activation in liver cancer cells. The combination of proteomics and functional screening identified numerous apical cell polarity complex proteins interacting with YAP and TAZ. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments confirmed that membrane protein palmitoylated 5 (MPP5; synonym: PALS1) physically interacts with YAP and TAZ. After removing different MPP5 protein domains, Co-IP analyses revealed that the PDZ domain plays a crucial role in YAP binding. The interaction between YAP and MPP5 in the cytoplasm of cancer cells was demonstrated by proximity ligation assays (PLAs). In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, a reduction in apical MPP5 expression was observed, correlating with the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ. Expression data analysis illustrated that MPP5 is inversely associated with YAP/TAZ target gene signatures in human HCCs. Low MPP5 levels define an HCC patient group with a poor clinical outcome. In summary, MPP5 facilitates the nuclear exclusion of YAP and TAZ in liver cancer. This qualifies MPP5 as a potential tumor-suppressor gene and explains how changes in cell polarity can foster tumorigenesis.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation can achieve long-term preservation of sperm. Ice crystal damage, as well as oxidative stress, result in mitochondrial dysfunction and a reduction in sperm motility after thawing. However, limited information exists regarding the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria on the cryopreservation of ram sperm. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between ROS and mitochondria concerning sperm quality during the cryopreservation of ram sperm. This investigation assessed sperm motility, kinematic characteristics, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, expression of mitochondrial respiratory genes (NDUFV2, SDHA, CYC1, and COXIV), ROS levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, phosphatidylserine externalisation rate, sperm ultrastructure, mtDNA copy number, expression of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, Caspase-3, and Caspase-8), Cytochrome C, and Caspase-3 content. The results showed the cryopreservation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased motility, kinetic parameters, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, MMP, ATP, mRNA expression levels of mitochondrial respiratory-related genes, and significantly (p < 0.05) increased ROS levels, MDA content, phosphatidylserine externalisation rate, damage of sperm ultrastructure, mtDNA copy number, mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes, Cytochrome C and Caspase-3 content compared to the fresh semen group. In conclusion, the cryopreservation causes damage to mitochondria, leading to increased ROS and subsequent oxidative stress. This process also initiates mitochondrial dysfunction and interferes with the electron transport chain, ultimately resulting in decreased MMP and ATP production. Furthermore, the liberation of Cytochrome C prompted the increase in Caspase-3 expression and subsequent sperm apoptosis occurred, ultimately leading to a deterioration in sperm quality after thawing.

AB  - The exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during development results in behavioural impairment in adulthood in humans and animal models. Indeed, serotonergic overexpression in early life leads to structural and functional changes in brain circuits that control cognition and emotion. However, the effects of developmental exposure to these substances on the behaviour of adolescent rats are conflicting and remain poorly characterised. We performed a behavioural screening to investigate the effects of postnatal exposure to fluoxetine on memory and behaviours related to anxiety, anhedonia, and depression, as well we evaluate the parvalbumin expression in hippocampus of juvenile (similar to PND45) female and male rats. Fluoxetine (daily 20 mg/kg s.c. injections from PND7-PND21)- or vehicle-treated adolescent rats went through several behavioural tasks (from PND 38 to PND52) and were subject to transcardial perfusion and brain removal for immunohistochemical analysis (PND53). We found that postnatal exposure to fluoxetine increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in the open field and sucrose preference and forced swimming tests, respectively. In addition, this treatment induced working memory and short-term (but not long-term) recognition memory impairments, and reduced parvalbumin-positive inter-neurons in the hippocampus. In addition, the results revealed developmental sex-dependent effects of fluoxetine postnatal treatment on adolescent rats' behaviour. These outcomes indicate that affective disorders and mnemonic alterations caused by SSRIs perinatal exposure can be present at adolescence.

AB  - An analysis of cognitive and brain structural data from over 900 Japanese participants reveals a relationship between increased hair mercury levels and reduced cognitive performance and reductions in gray and white matter volume.
   The detrimental effects of high-level mercury exposure on the central nervous system as well as effects of low-level exposure during early development have been established. However, no previous studies have investigated the effects of mercury level on brain morphometry using advance imaging techniques in young adults. Here, utilizing hair analysis which has been advocated as a method for biological monitoring, data of regional gray matter volume (rGMV), regional white matter volume (rWMV), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), cognitive functions, and depression among 920 healthy young adults in Japan, we showed that greater hair mercury levels were weakly but significantly associated with diminished cognitive performance, particularly on tasks requiring rapid processing (speed measures), lower depressive tendency, lower rGMV in areas of the thalamus and hippocampus, lower rWMV in widespread areas, greater FA in bilaterally distributed white matter areas overlapping with areas of significant rWMV reductions and lower MD of the widely distributed gray and white matter areas particularly in the bilateral frontal lobe and the right basal ganglia. These results suggest that even normal mercury exposure levels in Japan are weakly associated with differences of brain structures and lower neurobehavioral performance and altered mood among young adults.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stability and surface properties of cold-pressed vegetable oils using the Langmuir monolayer technique. Six oils-milk thistle, evening primrose, flaxseed, camelina sativa, black cumin, and pumpkin seed-were analyzed to investigate their molecular organization and behavior at the air/water interface, particularly after undergoing oxidation. The results showed that oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as flaxseed and evening primrose oils, formed monolayers with larger molecular areas and lower stability, which led to faster oxidative degradation, especially under thermal conditions. In contrast, pumpkin seed oil, with a higher content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), formed more condensed and stable monolayers, enhancing its resistance to oxidation. Black cumin oil, with a balanced profile of SFAs and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), demonstrated similar stability. The Langmuir technique facilitated a detailed analysis of monolayer phase transitions: PUFA-rich oils transitioned more readily to less stable phases, while SFA-rich oils maintained durable, condensed structures. These findings underscore the utility of this method for assessing the oxidative stability of vegetable oils and highlight key parameters-such as surface pressure, molecular area, and elasticity modulus-that can support the optimization of oil storage and quality in the food industry and related sectors.

AB  - Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread and rapidly progressive feature that impacts prognosis. Although TREM2 has been implicated in neuroprotection across various neurodegenerative diseases, its specific role in PD remains to be clarified. In this study, we first detected the hippocampus of human PD specimens and of the mutant A53T alpha-Synuclein transgenic mice (A53T mice), and found a significant increase in the number of TREM2+ microglia. To evaluate the effects of TREM2 deficiency, TREM2-deficient A53T mice (TREM2-/-/A53T mice) were generated. In these mice, exacerbated cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, disruption of synaptic plasticity, and accumulation of pathological alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) in the hippocampus were observed, without any detected motor dysfunction. Despite increased infiltration of activated microglia surrounding alpha-Syn aggregates, lysosomal dysfunction in microglia was aggravated in the TREM2-/-/A53T mice. In addition, transcriptional analyses and in vitro experiments further found that TREM2 knockdown inhibited the nuclear distribution of TFEB via the ERK1/2 pathway, exacerbating alpha-Syn-induced lysosomal dysfunction and causing more pathological alpha-Syn accumulation. Finally, HT22 cells were cocultured with TREM2 knockdown of BV-2 cells pretreated with recombinant human A53T alpha-Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs). The coculture experiments showed that TREM2 knockdown in BV-2 cells pretreated with PFFs enhanced the phosphorylation of alpha-Syn and promoted apoptosis in HT22 cells via inhibiting alpha-Syn degradation. In conclusion, TREM2 deficiency exacerbates cognitive impairment in PD by exacerbating alpha-Syn-induced microglial lysosomal dysfunction, identifying TREM2 as a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - In this study, we present a small, integrated jumping-crawling robot capable of intermittent jumping and self-resetting. Compared to robots with a single mode of locomotion, this multi-modal robot exhibits enhanced obstacle-surmounting capabilities. To achieve this, the robot employs a novel combination of a jumping module and a crawling module. The jumping module features improved energy storage capacity and an active clutch. Within the constraints of structural robustness, the jumping module maximizes the explosive power of the linear spring by utilizing the mechanical advantage of a closed-loop mechanism and controls the energy flow of the jumping module through an active clutch mechanism. Furthermore, inspired by the limb movements of tortoises during crawling and self-righting, a single-degree-of-freedom spatial four-bar crawling mechanism was designed to enable crawling, steering, and resetting functions. To demonstrate its practicality, the integrated jumping-crawling robot was tested in a laboratory environment for functions such as jumping, crawling, self-resetting, and steering. Experimental results confirmed the feasibility of the proposed integrated jumping-crawling robot.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia, and rodent models of the disease, both exhibit suppressed neurogenesis, with antipsychotics possibly enhancing neurogenesis in pre-clinical models. Nestin, a cytoskeletal protein, is implicated in neuronal differentiation and adult neurogenesis. We hypothesized that schizophrenia pathogenesis involves nestin downregulation; however, few studies have related nestin to schizophrenia. We assessed nestin protein concentration, prepulse inhibition (PPI), and social interaction in the MK-801 model of schizophrenia, with or without antipsychotic (clozapine) treatment. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally administered saline or MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) to produce a schizophrenia-like phenotype, with concomitant subcutaneous injections of vehicle or clozapine (5 mg/kg). PPI was assessed on days 1, 8, and 15, and social interaction was assessed on day 4. Hippocampus tissue samples were dissected for Western blotting of nestin concentration. MK-801 alone did not alter nestin concentration, while clozapine alone enhanced hippocampal nestin concentration; this effect was not apparent in animals with MK-801 and clozapine co-administration. MK-801 also produced schizophrenia-like PPI disruptions, some of which were reversed by clozapine. Social interaction deficits were not detected in this model. This is the first report of clozapine-induced enhancements of hippocampal nestin concentration that might be mediated by NMDA receptors. Future studies will explore the impact of neurodevelopmental nestin concentration on symptom onset and antipsychotic treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major life-threatening diseases for the elderly because neither pathogenesis nor effective treatment is available. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) has been shown to reduce the cell-damaging aldehydes in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, whether it plays a role in AD remains elusive. In the present study, we found that ALDH2 overexpression significantly improved the cognitive function of the AD mouse. Behavioral analyses of ALDH2-overexpressing APP/PS1 AD mice showed that the learning and cognitive abilities were significantly higher in these mice than in the control group APP/PS1 mice. Further open-field behavior experiments showed the same results. At the cellular level, ALDH2 protects nerve cells. HT22 cells were challenged with A beta to establish an AD cell model, in the presence or absence of the ALDH2 activator Alda-1 and ALDH2 inhibitor Daidzin. Incubation with 50 mu M A beta for 24h significantly reduced HT22 cell survival and cell viability, the effects of which were attenuated by the ALDH2 activator Alda-1 (50 mu M). A beta challenge promoted apoptosis and upregulated caspase3 level but suppressed Bcl-2 level, and the upregulated caspase3 level was reversed by the ALDH-2 agonist Alda-1. A beta-induced clonal ball abnormal was reversed by Alda-1. A beta altered the mitochondria geometry evidenced by vacuolar degeneration and membrane rupture, whereas Alda-1 changed the A beta-induced mitochondria geometry anomalies. Moreover, superoxide anion and toxic 4-hydroxy-nonanal (4-HNE) and ROS increased by A beta challenge were reversed by Alda-1. Meanwhile, A beta-induced ATP reduction was reversed by Alda-1. Taken together, ALDH2 overexpression significantly improves the cognitive function of the AD mice. Furthermore, our results suggested that ALDH2 protects against A beta hippocampal neuronal toxicity possibly through alleviating toxic aldehydes and ROS, as well as increasing ATP production to preserve mitochondrial integrity and reduce neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - Many plant proteins with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domains play an important role in plant immunity. However, the role of one class of eLRR plant proteins-the simple eLRR proteins-in plant defenses against herbivores remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a simple eLRR protein OsI-BAK1 in rice localizes to the plasma membrane. Its expression was induced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of gravid females of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens or white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera and treatment with methyl jasmonate or abscisic acid. Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene. Bioassays revealed that the hatching rate was significantly lower in BPH eggs laid on ir-ibak1 plants than wild-type (WT) plants; moreover, gravid BPH females preferred to oviposit on WT plants over ir-ibak1 plants. The exogenous application of ethephon on ir-ibak1 plants eliminated the BPH oviposition preference between WT and ir-ibak1 plants but had no effect on the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 acts as a negative modulator of defense responses in rice to BPH and that BPH might exploit this modulator for its own benefit.

AB  - The ever-present risk of brain ischemic events in humans and its full prevention make the detailed studies of an organism's response to ischemia at different levels essential to understanding the mechanism of the injury as well as protection. We used the four-vessel occlusion as an animal model of forebrain ischemia to investigate its impact on the metabolic alterations in both the hippocampus and the blood plasma to see changes on the sys-temic level. By inducing sublethal ischemic stimuli, we focused on the endogenous phenomena known as ischemic tolerance. NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze relative metabolite levels in tissue extracts from rats' hippocampus and blood plasma in three various ischemic/reperfusion times: 3 h, 24 h, and 72 h. Hippocampal tissues were characterized by postischemically decreased glutamate and GABA (4-aminobutyrate) tissue content balanced with increased glutamine level, with most pronounced changes at 3 h reperfusion time. Glutamate (as well as glutamine) levels recovered towards the control levels on the third day, as if the glutamate re-synthesis would be firstly preferred before GABA. These results are indicating the higher feasibility of re-establishing of glutamatergic transmission three days after an ischemic event, in contrast to GABA-ergic. Tissue levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), as well as choline, were decreased without the tendency to recover three days after the ischemic event. Metabolomic analysis of blood plasma revealed that ischemically preconditioned rats, contrary to the non-preconditioned animals, did not show hyperglycemic conditions. Ischemically induced semi-ketotic state, manifested in increased plasma ketone bodies 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, seems to be pro-grammed to support the brain tissue revitalization after the ischemic event. These and other metabolites changes found in blood plasma as well as in the hippocampus were observed to a lower extent or recovered faster in preconditioned animals. Some metabolomic changes in hippocampal tissue extract were so strong that even single metabolites were able to differentiate between ischemic, ischemically preconditioned, and control brain tissues.

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proved to play a vital role in pancreatic cancer (PC). However, the role of lncRNA FAM83A-AS1 in PC remains unclear. In this study, we explored the biological function and underlying mechanism of FAM83A-AS1 in PC cells.Methods: The FAM83A-AS1 expression was assessed via public databases and validated by qRT-PCR. The biofunction and immune cell infiltration of FAM83A-AS1 were analyzed through GO, KEGG, GESA and ssGSEA. The migration, invasion and proliferation abilities of PC cells were examined by Transwell, wound healing, CCK8 and colony formation. The EMT and Hippo pathway markers were evaluated by western blot.Results: FAM83A-AS1 expression was higher in PC tissues and cells than normal. Additionally, FAM83A-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis of PC and involved in cadherin binding and immune infiltration. Subsequently, we proved FAM83A-AS1 overexpression enhanced the migration, invasion and proliferation abilities of PC cells, whereas FAM83A-AS1 downregulation inhibited those. Moreover, western blot results showed that FAM83A-AS1 knockdown increased the E-cadherin expression and decreased the expression of N-cadherin, beta-catenin, Vimentin, Snail and Slug. On the contrary, FAM83A-AS1 upregulation results in the opposite effects. Besides, FAM83A-AS1 overexpression inhibited the expression of p-YAP, p-MOB1, p-Lats1, SAV1, MST1 and MST2 as well as the results of FAM83A-AS1 knockdown were opposite.Conclusion: FAM83A-AS1 promoted EMT of PC cells via Hippo signaling inactivation and may be a potential diagnosis and prognosis target.

AB  - Antipsychotics increase the risk of death in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, there is an immediate need for novel therapies to treat comorbid psychosis in AD. Psychosis has been attributed to a dysregulation of the dopamine system and is associated with aberrant regulation by the hippocampus. Given that the hippocampus is a key site of pathology in AD, we posit that aberrant regulation of the dopamine system may contribute to comorbid psychosis in AD. A ferrous amyloid buthionine (FAB) rodent model was used to model a sporadic form of AD. FAB rats displayed functional hippocampal alterations, which were accompanied by decreases in spontaneous, low-frequency oscillations and increases in the firing rates of putative pyramidal neurons. Additionally, FAB rats exhibited increases in dopamine neuron population activity and augmented responses to the locomotor-inducing effects of MK-801, as is consistent with rodent models of psychosis-like symptomatology. Further, working memory deficits in the Y-maze, consistent with an AD-like phenotype, were observed in FAB rats. These data suggest that the aberrant hippocampal activity observed in AD may contribute to dopamine-dependent psychosis, and that the FAB model may be useful for the investigation of comorbid psychosis related to AD. Understanding the pathophysiology that leads to comorbid psychosis in AD will ultimately lead to the discovery of novel targets for the treatment of this disease.

AB  - With the development of industrialization in recent years, infrasound has become an important component of public noise. To date, diverse studies have revealed the negative effects of infrasound on the central nervous system (CNS), especially the learning and memory ability. It is widely reported that environmental enrichment (EE) ameliorates the learning and memory deficits in different models of brain injury. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the possible benefits of pre-exposure to EE in preventing functional deficits following infrasound exposure and their related mechanism. Adult male rats were given enriched or standard housing for 30 days. Following enrichment, the rats were exposed to 16 Hz, 130 dB infrasound for 14 days, and then their learning and memory ability was assessed. Changes to neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in the hippocampus were also detected. Our results showed that the infrasound-induced deficit in learning and memory was attenuated significantly in EE pre-exposed rats. Pre-exposure to EE could induce a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant properties in the hippocampus. Moreover, pre-exposure to EE also exerted antiapoptosis functions by upregulating the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) level and downregulating the P53 level in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that EE is neuroprotective when applied before infrasound exposure, resulting in an improved learning and memory ability by enhancing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptosis capacities.

AB  - Accumulation of misfolded proteins, known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, is known to participate in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is also correlated with impaired central insulin signaling. However, few studies have probed the relationship between memory, central ER stress, inflammation, hippocampal mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and insulin resistance. The present study aimed to investigate the causative role and underlying mechanisms of brain ER stress in memory impairment and develop a reliable animal model for ER-mediated memory loss. Thapsigargin (TG), a known ER stress activator, was centrally administered. The cognitive function of animals was evaluated by the Morris Water Maze (MWM). To verify the induction of central ER stress, we investigated the mRNA expression of UPR markers in the hippocampus. In addition, the activation of ER stress markers, including Bip, CHOP, and some related apoptosis and pro-inflammatory proteins, such as caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, TNF-alpha, MAPK, and insulin signaling markers, were assessed by Western-blots. The results demonstrated that TG impairs spatial cognition and hippocampal insulin signaling. Meanwhile, molecular results showed a concurrent increment of hippocampal UPR markers, apoptosis, P38 activity, and TNF-alpha. This study introduced TG-induced ER stress as a pharmacological model for memory impairment in rats and revealed some underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Maternal autoantibody-related autism (MARA) is a subtype of autism characterized by the maternal production of specific patterns of autoantibodies during pregnancy, which significantly increases the likelihood of an autism diagnosis in their children. Multiple patterns of MARA autoantibodies (MARA-ABS) have been identified, and differences in the severity of the autism phenotype associated with each autoantibody pattern have been described. In this study, we utilized preclinical rat models to further elucidate the differential effects of MARA-AB exposure based on the known clinical patterns, including the originally reported pattern of lactate dehydrogenase A and B (LDHA/B) + collapsin response mediator protein 1 (CRMP1) + stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), as well as the more recently described patterns of CRMP1+CRMP2, CRMP1 + guanine deaminase (GDA), and STIP1+ neuron-specific enolase (NSE). We induced endogenous MARA-AB production in rat dams before pregnancy to expose offspring to the ABs throughout gestation. We found that in postnatal day 2 offspring exposed to MARA-ABS, the levels of brain and serum cytokines/chemokines/growth factors were altered based on the pattern of MARA-AB exposure. Further, bulk transcriptomic profiles of coronal sections containing hippocampal formation and the adjacent cortical and subcortical structures suggested changes in cellular proliferation and differentiation following MARA exposure. These combined observations demonstrate that gestational exposure to MARA-ABS alters early gene expression and immune signaling molecules, both of which may contribute to the altered neurodevelopment and behaviors associated with MARA.

AB  - Camelina seeds are rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), but also contain small amounts of erucic acid, which is considered toxic to laboratory rats. This experiment compares the dietary inclusion of camelina oil to that of flaxseed oil, a well-known source of ALA, and evaluates their effects on the nutritional and metabolic status of growing rats. The oils were chemically analyzed and incorporated into a semi-purified diet for 4 weeks. The experiment was divided into 3 groups: PO (control-fed palm oil with a trace of ALA), FO (comparative-fed flaxseed oil), and CO (experimental-fed camelina seed oil). Both CO and FO showed a higher percentage of lean body mass, greater lean mass gain, and a lower fat percentage compared to PO. Similar to the body composition, the blood lipid profile also improved in CO and FO, with higher HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels, which was associated with upregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene. However, in FO and CO, higher plasma liver enzyme activity and malondialdehyde concentrations were observed in the heart and liver. The results suggest that camelina oil has a similarly beneficial impact on the metabolic processes of the growing body as flaxseed oil, while also indicating a potential for increased organ-specific lipid peroxidation and hepatic burden when consumed in excess.

AB  - Disc herniation is a kind of disease caused by degenerative discs, which is common in the elderly, bringing substantial financial burden to families and society. Mechanical tension has a vital effect on the maintenance of cartilage function, however, the molecular mechanism by which mechanical tension causes degenerative discs to remain unclear. This study was the first to reveal Yes-associated protein 1(YAP1) is a key regulator in mechanical tension-mediated degenerative discs. Activation of YAP1 may be a valuable strategy to delays the degeneration of human cartilage chondrocytes. We found that YAP1 expression was significantly decreased in degenerative human endplate cartilage and tissue with the strength and time of mechanical stimulation, but the cell cycle distribution was significantly changed under the 10% cyclic mechanical tension(CMT). Besides, the degeneration of endplate cartilage can be delayed by activating the expression level of YAP1 in vitro and it has also been verified in the cartilage endplate tissue in vitro. Furthermore, We found that YAP1 and TEAD1 overexpression increased the activity of the ACAN or COL2A1 promoter to enhance the transcriptional activity of human chondrocyte collagen. The CMT activates the classic Hippo signaling pathway of YAP1, and piezo1 may regulate YAP1 expression through the Hippo signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results suggest the novel mechanism of YAP contributes to delaying the degeneration of endplate cartilage and targeting YAP in combination with Piezo1 is a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of endplate cartilage degeneration.

AB  - In clinic, perioperative neurocognitive disorder is becoming a common complication of surgery in old patients. Neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption are important contributors for cognitive impairment. Atorvastatin, as a strong HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been widely used in clinic. However, it remains unclear whether atorvastatin could prevent anesthesia and surgery-induced BBB disruption and cognitive injury by its anti-inflammatory property. In this study, aged C57BL/6J mice were used to address this question. Initially, the mice were subject to atorvastatin treatment for 7 days (10 mg/kg). After a simple laparotomy under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia, Morris water maze was performed to assess spatial learning and memory. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to examine the inflammatory response, BBB integrity, and cell apoptosis. Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling assay was used to assess cell apoptosis. The fluorescein sodium and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect the permeability and structure of BBB. The results showed that anesthesia and surgery significantly injured hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, which was ameliorated by atorvastatin. Atorvastatin could also reverse the surgery-induced increase of systemic and hippocampal cytokines, including IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, accompanied by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) pathway and Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain, or Leucine Rich Repeat and Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, as well as hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. In addition, surgery triggered an increase of BBB permeability, paralleled by a decrease of the ZO-1, occludin, and Claudin 5 proteins in the hippocampus. However, atorvastatin treatment could protect the BBB integrity from the impact of surgery, by up-regulating the expressions of ZO-1, occludin, and Claudin 5. These findings suggest that atorvastatin exhibits neuroprotective effects on cognition in aged mice undergoing surgery.

AB  - Macrophages have been recognized as pivotal players in the progression of MASLD/MASH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their multifaceted functions in the disease remain to be further clarified. In the current study, we developed a new mouse model with YAP activation in macrophages to delineate the effect and mechanism of YAP signaling in the pathogenesis of MASLD/MASH. Genetically modified mice, featuring specific depletion of both Mst1 and Mst2 in macrophages/monocytes, were generated and exposed to a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce MASLD. Following this period, livers were collected for histopathological examination, and liver non-parenchymal cells were isolated and subjected to various analyses, including single-cell RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting and qRT-PCR to investigate the impact of YAP signaling on the progression of MASLD. Our data revealed that Mst1/2 depletion in liver macrophages enhanced liver inflammation and fibrosis in MASLD. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we showed that YAP activation via Mst1/2 depletion upregulated the expressions of both pro-inflammatory genes and genes associated with resolution/tissue repair. We observed that YAP activation increases Kupffer cell populations (i.e., Kupffer-2 and Kupffer-3) which are importantly implicated in the pathogenesis of MASLD/MASH. Our data indicate that YAP activation via Mst1/2 deletion enhances both the pro-inflammatory and tissue repairing functions of Kupffer-1 and -2 cells at least in part through C1q. These YAP-regulatory mechanisms control the plasticity of liver macrophages in the context of MASLD/MASH. Our findings provide important evidence supporting the critical regulatory role of YAP signaling in liver macrophage plasticity and the progression of MASLD. Therefore, targeting the Hippo-YAP pathway may present a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MASH.
   High-fat diet (HFD)-induced lipids accumulation triggers hepatocyte lipotoxic injury leading to liver tissue damage, macrophage activation/recruitment, lobular inflammation and fibrogenesis, which are hallmarks of MASLD/MASH. The current study shows that YAP activation in liver macrophages increases the expressions of both pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic/reparative genes in liver macrophages and causes increased hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis in a mouse model of HFD-induced MASLD/MASH. The YAP-mediated regulatory mechanisms importantly control the plasticity and function of liver macrophages and impact the progression of MASLD/MASH.image

AB  - Monocrotophos (MCP) is systemic organophosphate insecticide used against crop pests. It is reported to cause mammalian toxicity through both acute and chronic exposure. In the present study, we have shown the protective role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against MCP-induced oxidative stress in frontal cortex, corpus striatum and hippocampus brain regions of rats. Male Albino Wistar rats were divided into control, NAC-treated, MCP and NAC + MCP-treated groups. An oral dose of MCP (0.9 mg/kg b.wt) and NAC (200 mg/kg b.wt) was administered for 28 days. Results showed an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein oxidation followed by decreased antioxidant enzymes after 28 days of MCP exposure. Histopathological analysis showed that monocrotophos exposure caused neurodegenerative changes as evident by neurons with dystrophic changes in the form of shrunken hyperchromatic nuclei in all the regions of the rat brain. N-acetylcysteine supplementation to MCP-treated rats showed a reduction in oxidative stress and ameliorated cellular alterations in all of the three regions. The results of the study indicate that N-acetylcysteine offers neuroprotection by improving antioxidant response and decreasing oxidative stress in different regions of the rat brain.

AB  - NG2 (nerve/glial antigen 2) glia are uniformly distributed in the gray and white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). They are the major proliferating cells in the brain and can differentiate into oligodendrocytes. NG2 glia do not only receive synaptic input from excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but also secrete growth factors and cytokines, modulating CNS homeostasis. They express several receptors and ion channels that play a role in rapidly responding upon synaptic signals and generating fast feedback, potentially regulating their own properties. Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) induces an intracellular Ca2+ rise initiating a series of cellular activities. We confirmed that NG2 glia express L-type VGCCs in the white and gray matter during CNS development, particularly in the early postnatal stage. However, the function of L-type VGCCs in NG2 glia remains elusive. Therefore, we deleted L-type VGCC subtypes Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 genes conditionally in NG2 glia by crossbreeding NG2-CreERT2 knock-in mice to floxed Cav1.2 and flexed Cav1.3 transgenic mice. Our results showed that ablation of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 strongly inhibited the proliferation of cortical NG2 glia, while differentiation in white and gray matter was not affected. As a consequence, no difference on myelination could be detected in various brain regions. In addition, we observed morphological alterations of the nodes of Ranvier induced by VGCC-deficient NG2 glia, i.e., shortened paired paranodes in the corpus callosum. Furthermore, deletion of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 largely eliminated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and potentiation in the hippocampus while the synaptic input to NG2 glia from axons remained unaltered. We conclude that L-type VGCCs of NG2 glia are essential for cell proliferation and proper structural organization of nodes of Ranvier, but not for differentiation and myelin compaction. In addition, L-type VGCCs of NG2 glia contribute to the regulation of long-term neuronal plasticity.</p>

AB  - Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces (SLIPS) have received much attention in anti-icing, anti-fouling, etc. However, the strong interaction between droplets and lubricants causes lubricant loss, limiting their practical applications. Here, inspired by the structure and function of hippopotamus skin, we constructed a novel SLIPS (CPSC) capable of retaining low-viscosity silicone oil on the surface. CPSC was fabricated by creating inorganic particle oil storage units composed of rigid microshells and nanoparticles, which were subsequently filled with silicone oil and crosslinked within a silicone polyurethane matrix. CPSC surfaces exhibit excellent lubricating properties, with water droplets readily sliding off at angles as low as 4.6 degrees, and maintain stable durability even after 1000 wiping cycles. This "solid-like" surface lubrication mode gives CPSC low ice shear strength (22 kPa) and de-icing cycle durability, and shows many advantages over conventional SLIPS in extreme environments such as centrifugal and water impact; while CPSC surface can be switched to an enhanced liquid lubrication mode when the ambient temperature rises, in order to cope with the vigorous biological activities and fouling adhesion on the surface in summer, avoiding the problem of idle functionality of traditional anti-icing coatings during non-icing periods, and bringing new hope for the sustainable use of SLIPS.

AB  - Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA/Actilyse) stands as the prevailing pharmacological solution for treating ischemic stroke patients, of whom because their endogenous circulating tPA alone is not sufficient to rescue reperfusion and to promote favorable outcome. Beyond the tPA contributed by circulating endothelial cells and hepatocytes, neurons also express tPA, sparking debates regarding its impact on neuronal fate ranging from pro-survival to neurotoxic properties. In order to investigate the role of neuronal tPA during brain injuries, we developed models leading to its conditional deletion in neurons, employing AAV9-pPlat-GFP and AAV9-pPlat-Cre-GFP along with tPA floxed mice. These models were subjected to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity or thromboembolic ischemic stroke in mice. Initially, we established that our AAV9 constructs selectively transduce neurons, bypassing other brain cell types. Subsequently, we demonstrated that tPA-expressing neurons exhibit greater resistance against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity compared to tPA negative neurons. The targeted removal of tPA in neurons heightened the susceptibility of these neurons to cell death and prevented a paracrine neurotoxic effect on tPA non-expressing neurons. Under ischemic conditions, the self-neuroprotective influence of tPA encompassed both excitatory (GFP+/Tbr1+) and inhibitory (GFP+/GABA+) neurons. Our data indicate that endogenous neuronal tPA is a protective or deleterious factor against neuronal death in an excitotoxic/ischemic context, depending on whether it acts as an autocrine or a paracrine mediator.

AB  - l-Theanine, an active ingredient in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) associated with calming, is widely used as a functional ingredient and dietary supplement. In this study, a heat stress mouse model was used to evaluate the anti-heat stress effect of l-theanine and its possible mechanism of action. Mice subjected to heat stress (40 degrees C) that were administered l-theanine at various doses (100, 200, and 400 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) had reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory factors when l-theanine was administered both long-term and as a preventative treatment. Our l-theanine intervention countered the reduction in growth and feed intake of mice under heat stress and reversed liver and jejunum tissue damage. Moreover, l-theanine countered the increase in inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta and antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT; it also counteracted GSH-Px inactivation, the upregulation of AST and ALT enzyme activity, and MDA production. The mechanism of action may involve mediation of the P38 signaling pathway, inhibition of MK2 overexpression, and downregulation of p-P65/P65 caused by the overexpression of downstream HSP27. This would inhibit the heat stress-induced imbalance in oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.

AB  - The formation and consolidation of memory play a vital role for survival in an ever-changing environment. In the brain, the change and stabilization of potentiated and depressed synapses are the neural basis of memory formation and maintenance. These changes can be induced by rather short stimuli (only a few seconds or even less) but should then be stable for months or years. Recently, the neural mechanism of conversion from rapid change during the early phase of synaptic plasticity into a stable memory trace in the late phase of synaptic plasticity is more and more clear at the protein and molecular levels, among which synaptic tagging and capture (STC) theory is one of the most popular theories. According to the STC theory, the change and stabilization of synaptic efficiency mainly depend on three processes related to calcium concentration, including synaptic tagging, synthesis of plasticity-related product (PRP), and the capture of PRP by tagged synapse. Based on the STC theory, several computational models are proposed. However, these models hardly take simplicity and biological interpretability into account simultaneously. Here, we propose a simplified STC (SM-STC) model to address this issue. In the SM-STC model, the concentration of calcium ion in each neuronal compartment and synapse is first calculated, and then the tag state of synapse and PRP are updated, and the coupling effect of tagged synapse and PRP is further considered to determine the plasticity state of the synapse, either potentiation or depression. We simulated the Schaffer collaterals pathway of the hippocampus targeting a multicompartment CA1 neuron for several hours of biological time. The results show that the SM-STC model can produce a broad range of experimental phenomena known in the physiological experiments, including long-term potentiation induced by high-frequency stimuli, long-term depression induced by low-frequency stimuli, and cross-capture with two stimuli separated by a delay. Thus, the SM-STC model proposed in this study provides an effective learning rule for brain-like computation on the premise of ensuring biological plausibility and computational efficiency.

AB  - Mouse knockouts of Cntnap2 show altered neurodevelopmental behavior, deficits in striatal GABAergic signaling, and a genome-wide disruption of an environmentally sensitive DNA methylation modification (5-hydroxymethylcytosine [5hmC]) in the orthologs of a significant number of genes implicated in human neurodevelopmental disorders. We tested adult Cntnap2 heterozygous mice (Cntnap2(+/-); lacking behavioral or neuropathological abnormalities) subjected to a prenatal stress and found that prenatally stressed Cntnap2(+/-) female mice show repetitive behaviors and altered sociability, similar to the homozygote phenotype. Genomic profiling revealed disruptions in hippocampal and striatal 5hmC levels that are correlated to altered transcript levels of genes linked to these phenotypes (e.g., Reln, Dst, Trio, and Epha5). Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing and hippocampal nuclear lysate pull-down data indicated that 5hmC abundance alters the binding of the transcription factor CLOCK near the promoters of these genes (e.g., Palld, Gigyf1, and Fry), providing a mechanistic role for 5hmC in gene regulation. Together, these data support gene-by-environment hypotheses for the origins of mental illness and provide a means to identify the elusive factors contributing to complex human diseases.

AB  - The present study aims to determine the neuroprotective effect of Bergenin against spatial memory deficit associated with neurodegeneration. Preliminarily, the protective effect of Bergenin was observed against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HT-22 and PC-12 cells. Further studies were performed in 5xFAD Tg mouse model by administering Bergenin (1, 30 and 60 mg/kg; orally), whereas Bergenin (60 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the memory deficit observed in the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy displayed restoration of lipids, proteins and their derivatives compared to the 5xFAD Tg mice group. The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) suggested an absence of amyloid beta (A beta) aggregation in Bergenin-treated mice. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis suggested the neuroprotective effect of Bergenin by increasing Reelin signaling (Reelin/Dab-1) and attenuated A beta (1-42) aggregation in hippocampal regions of mouse brains. Furthermore, IHC and western blot results suggested antioxidant (Keap-1/Nrf-2/HO-1), anti-inflammatory (TLR-4/NF-kB) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase-3) effect of Bergenin. Moreover, a decrease in Annexin V/PI-stained hippocampal cells suggested its effect against neurodegeneration. The histopathological changes were reversed significantly by Bergenin. In addition, a remarkable increase in antioxidant level with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and nitric oxide production were observed in specific regions of the mouse brains.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative process, also considered a metabolic condition due to alterations in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathways in the brain, which share similarities with diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of benfotiamine (BFT), a vitamin B1 analog, in the early stages of the neurodegenerative process in a sporadic model of Alzheimer's-like disease induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Supplementation with 150 mg/kg of BFT for 7 days reversed the cognitive impairment in short- and long-term memories caused by STZ in rodents. We attribute these effects to BFT's ability to modulate glucose transporters type 1 and 3 (GLUT1 and GLUT3) in the hippocampus, inhibit GSK3 activity in the hippocampus, and modulate the insulin signaling in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, as well as reduce the activation of apoptotic pathways (BAX) in the hippocampus. Therefore, BFT emerges as a promising and accessible intervention in the initial treatment of conditions similar to AD.

AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of different doses of recombinant human Chemerin (rhChemerin) on brain damage, spatial memory, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and cellular and molecular mechanisms in a mouse stroke model. The mouse stroke model was developed by blocking the middle cerebral artery for 1 h and performing reperfusion for 23 h. Immediately, one and three hours after the stroke, 200, 400 and 800 ng/mouse of intranasal rhChemerin was administered. Neuronal and BBB damage, spatial memory and neurological performance were examined 24 h after the stroke. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were utilized to determine the effects of rhChemerin on the expressions of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Administering 400 and 800 ng/mouse of rhChemerin in the mice immediately and one hour after ischemia minimized the infarct size, BBB opening, spatial memory and neurological impairment (P < 0.001). Furthermore, 800 ng/mouse of rhChemerin significantly diminished terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive (apoptotic) cells, suppressed the expressions of NF-kB, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta and upregulated IL-10 and VEGF in the cortex and hippocampus of the mice. The present findings showed that rhChemerin administered immediately and one hour after stroke alleviates neuronal and BBB injures and improves spatial memory. These effects of rhChemerin may be mediated by inhibiting inflammatory pathways and apoptotic machinery.

AB  - Simple Summary Ultraviolet light from the sun causes DNA damage and is a major exogenous genotoxin, particularly affecting the skin and eyes of humans. UV-induced lesions are repaired by complex DNA repair mechanisms that sometimes fail, leading to burns or cancers. Here, we probe the potential of two ultraviolet damage-specific repair enzymes not found in humans: one from the kangaroo rat and one from an anti-bacterial virus. Both can be produced with relatively low costs. While these two repair enzymes have been studied in the skin and some products are already commercially available, comparatively little research has been conducted for the eyes, and there are no commercially available products. Therefore, we aim to offer new options for the protection of eyes that are particularly sensitive to ultraviolet rays and require more rapid repair than normal. The cornea is frequently exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and absorbs a portion of this radiation. UVB in particular is absorbed by the cornea and will principally damage the topmost layer of the cornea, the epithelium. Epidemiological research shows that the UV damage of DNA is a contributing factor to corneal diseases such as pterygium. There are two main DNA photolesions of UV: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs). Both involve the abnormal linking of adjacent pyrimide bases. In particular, CPD lesions, which account for the vast majority of UV-induced lesions, are inefficiently repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) and are thus mutagenic and linked to cancer development in humans. Here, we apply two exogenous enzymes: CPD photolyase (CPDPL) and T4 endonuclease V (T4N5). The efficacy of these enzymes was assayed by the proteomic and immunofluorescence measurements of UVB-induced CPDs before and after treatment. The results showed that CPDs can be rapidly repaired by T4N5 in cell cultures. The usage of CPDPL and T4N5 in ex vivo eyes revealed that CPD lesions persist in the corneal limbus. The proteomic analysis of the T4N5-treated cells shows increases in the components of the angiogenic and inflammatory systems. We conclude that T4N5 and CPDPL show great promise in the treatment of CPD lesions, but the complete clearance of CPDs from the limbus remains a challenge.

AB  - Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) operate in specialized niches of the adult mammalian brain, where their proliferative and differentiative potential is modulated by a myriad of factors. Emerging evidence sheds light on the interaction between cannabinoids and neurotrophic factors underlying a major regulatory force of NSPC dynamics. Previous data show that cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2Rs) tightly regulate the actions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophic factor highly upregulated during physical exercise. However, further research into the effects of exercise-associated neurotrophic factors in the regulation of NSPCs is still necessary. Therefore, we aimed at exploring the effects of exercise-associated factors in postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis and how CB2Rs regulate this process. By using dentate gyrus-derived neurospheres and treating them with a combination of exercise-associated factors, as an in vitro proxy for exercise, we found that these factors significantly promoted cell proliferation, an action partially reduced when CB2Rs were blocked. Moreover, CB2Rs were shown to be required for the actions of this exercise-mimicking cocktail in early neuronal commitment and differentiation. However, late neuronal differentiation promoted by exercise-associated factors remained unaltered in the presence of CB2R ligands. Together, these data suggest that CB2R actions are preponderant in early stages of hippocampal neurogenesis promoted by exercise. Astroglial late differentiation was also accelerated by a combination of exercise-associated factors, an effect prevented by CB2R blockage. This work provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of cannabinoids and exercise on NSPC regulation, highlighting the role of CB2R in modulating exercise-induced hippocampal neurogenesis.image

AB  - Cannabis effects are predominantly mediated by pharmacological actions on cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. Prior positron emission tomography (PET) studies in individuals who use cannabis included almost exclusively males. PET studies in females are needed because there are sex differences in cannabis effects, progression to cannabis use disorder (CUD), and withdrawal symptom severity. Females with CUD (N = 10) completed two double-blind cannabis smoking sessions (Session 1: placebo; Session 2: active), and acute cannabis effects were assessed. After Session 2, participants underwent 3 days of monitored cannabis abstinence; mood, craving, and withdrawal symptoms were assessed and a PET scan (radiotracer: [C-11]OMAR) followed. [C-11]OMAR Distribution volume (V-T) from these participants was compared with V-T of age/BMI-similar female non-users of cannabis ("healthy controls"; N = 10). V-T was also compared between female and male healthy controls (N = 7). Females with CUD displayed significantly lower V-T than female healthy controls in specific brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate, and insula). Amygdala V-T was negatively correlated with mood changes (anger/hostility) during abstinence, but V-T was not correlated with other withdrawal symptoms or cannabis effects. Among healthy controls, females had significantly higher V-T than males in all brain regions examined. Chronic cannabis use appears to foster downregulation of CB1 receptors in women, as observed previously in men, and there are inherent sex differences in CB1 availability. Future studies should elucidate the time course of CB1 downregulation among females who use cannabis and examine the relation between CB1 availability and cannabis effects among other populations (e.g., infrequent users; medicinal users).

AB  - Fatty acid desaturases add a second bond into a single bond of carbon atoms in fatty acid chains, resulting in an unsaturated bond between the two carbons. They are classified into soluble and membrane-bound desaturases, according to their structure, subcellular location, and function. The orthologous genes in Camelina sativa were identified and analyzed, and a total of 62 desaturase genes were identified. It was revealed that they had the common fatty acid desaturase domain, which has evolved separately, and the proteins of the same family also originated from the same ancestry. A mix of conserved, gained, or lost intron structure was obvious. Besides, conserved histidine motifs were found in each family, and transmembrane domains were exclusively revealed in the membranebound desaturases. The expression profile analysis of C. sativa desaturases revealed an increase in young leaves, seeds, and flowers. C. sativa omega 3-fatty acid desaturases CsaFAD7 and CsaDAF8 were cloned and the subcellular localization analysis showed their location in the chloroplast. They were transferred into Arabidopsis thaliana to obtain transgenic lines. It was revealed that the omega 3-fatty acid desaturase could increase the C18:3 level at the expense of C18:2, but decreases in oil content and seed weight, and wrinkled phenotypes were observed in transgenic CsaFAD7 lines, while no significant change was observed in transgenic CsaFAD8 lines in comparison to the wild-type. These findings gave insights into the characteristics of desaturase genes, which could provide an excellent basis for further investigation for C. sativa improvement, and overexpression of omega 3-fatty acid desaturases in seeds could be useful in genetic engineering strategies, which are aimed at modifying the fatty acid composition of seed oil.

AB  - Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined biochemically as a low or undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal thyroid hormone levels. Low TSHR signaling is considered to associate with cognitive impairment. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which TSHR signaling modulates memory is poorly understood. In this study, we found that Tshr-deficient in the hippocampal neurons impairs the learning and memory abilities of mice, accompanying by a decline in the number of newborn neurons. Notably, Tshr ablation in the hippocampus decreases the expression of Wnt5a, thereby inactivating the beta-catenin signaling pathway to reduce the neurogenesis. Conversely, activating of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by the agonist SKL2001 results in an increase in hippocampal neurogenesis, resulting in the amelioration in the deficits of memory caused by Tshr deletion. Understanding how TSHR signaling in the hippocampus regulates memory provides insights into subclinical hyperthyroidism affecting cognitive function and will suggest ways to rationally design interventions for neurocognitive disorders.

AB  - Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, autophagy, and the aggregation of beta-amyloid (A beta) are key factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. Ghrelin has shown promise in providing neuroprotection for AD. However, the mechanism underlying ghrelin's ability to improve AD by modulating autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome requires further clarification. Primary hippocampus neurons and mice were stimulated with A beta 1-42 to create an in vitro and in vivo AD model, followed by ghrelin administration for intervention. Additionally, we subjected the cells to 3-methyladenine (3-MA) treatment. Neuron morphology, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) expression, apoptosis, cytokine levels, and protein expression were measured using various techniques. The escape latency of mice was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and histopathology of the hippocampus was determined using hematoxylin-eosin staining. At 1-100 nM, ghrelin increased neuron/synapse numbers and MAP-2 expression dose-dependently while blocking apoptosis in A beta 1-42-treated cells. Moreover, ghrelin reduced the expression of A beta 1-42, p-Tau/Tau, p62, NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved Caspase-1, while increasing the expression of LC3II/LC3I and Beclin1 in AD cells. Furthermore, ghrelin treatment also decreased the levels of A beta 1-42, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 in the cells. The effects of ghrelin were reversed by 3-MA. Our in vivo experiments provided further confirmation of the above effect of ghrelin on AD. Additionally, the injection of A beta 1-42 induced increased escape latency in mice and histopathological changes in hippocampal neurons. All of these abnormalities were significantly improved following administration of ghrelin. Ghrelin mitigated A beta 1-42-induced neurotoxicity and relieved neuronal damage by upregulating autophagy to inactivate NLRP3, thus showing promising potential in treating AD.

TI  - BlueRecording: A pipeline for the efficient calculation of extracellular recordings in large-scale neural circuit models
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - As the size and complexity of network simulations accessible to computational neuroscience grows, new avenues open for research into extracellularly recorded electric signals. Biophysically detailed simulations permit the identification of the biological origins of the different components of recorded signals, the evaluation of signal sensitivity to different anatomical, physiological, and geometric factors, and selection of recording parameters to maximize the signal information content. Simultaneously, virtual extracellular signals produced by these networks may become important metrics for neuro-simulation validation. To enable efficient calculation of extracellular signals from large neural network simulations, we have developed BlueRecording, a pipeline consisting of standalone Python code, along with extensions to the Neurodamus simulation control application, the CoreNEURON computation engine, and the SONATA data format, to permit online calculation of such signals. In particular, we implement a general form of the reciprocity theorem, which is capable of handling non-dipolar current sources, such as may be found in long axons and recordings close to the current source, as well as complex tissue anatomy, dielectric heterogeneity, and electrode geometries. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this generalized (i.e., non-dipolar) reciprocity-based approach to simulate EEG recordings. We use these tools to calculate extracellular signals from an in silico model of the rat somatosensory cortex and hippocampus and to study signal contribution differences between regions and cell types.

AB  - Delayed wound healing is an urgent clinical issue. Cellular communication involving exosome-borne cargo such as miRNA is a critical mechanism involved in wound healing. This study isolated and identified human adipose tissue-derived exosomes (Exo-ATs). The specific effects of Exo-ATs on keratinocytes and fibroblasts were examined. Enriched miRNAs in Exo-ATs were analyzed, and miR-92a-3p was selected. The transfer of Exo-ATs-derived miR-92a-3p to keratinocytes and fibroblasts was verified. miR-92a-3p binding to LATS2 was examined and the dynamic effects of the miR-92a-3p/LATS2 axis were investigated. In a dorsal skin wound model, the in vivo effects of Exo-ATs on wound healing were examined. Exo-AT incubation increased keratinocytes and fibroblast proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. miR-92a-3p, enriched in Exo-ATs, could be transferred to keratinocytes and fibroblasts, resulting in enhanced proliferation, migration, and ECM accumulation. Large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) was a direct target of miR-92a-3p. miR-92a-3p inhibitor effects on keratinocytes and fibroblasts could be partially reversed by LATS2 knockdown. In a dorsal skin wound model, Exo-ATs accelerated wound healing through enhanced cell proliferation, collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, and YAP/TAZ activation. In conclusion, Exo-ATs improve skin wound healing by promoting keratinocyte and fibroblast migration and proliferation and collagen production by fibroblast, which could be partially eliminated by miR-92a inhibition through its downstream target LATS2 and the YAP/TAZ signaling.

AB  - Astronauts on exploratory missions will be exposed to particle radiation of high energy and charge (HZE particles), which have been shown to produce neurochemical and performance deficits in animal models. Exposure to HZE particles can produce both targeted effects, resulting from direct ionization of atoms along the particle track, and non-targeted effects (NTEs) in cells that are distant from the track, extending the range of potential damage beyond the site of irradiation. While recent work suggests that NTEs are primarily responsible for changes in cognitive function after HZE exposures, the relative contributions of targeted and non-targeted effects to neurochemical changes after HZE exposures are unclear. The present experiment was designed to further explore the role of targeted and non-targeted effects on HZE-induced neurochemical changes (inflammation and oxidative stress) by evaluating the effects of exposure location and particle energy/linear energy transfer (LET). Forty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats received headonly or body-only exposures to Fe-56 particles [600 MeV/n (75 cGy) or 1,000 MeV/n (100 cGy)] or Ti-48 particles [500 MeV/n (50 cGy) or 1,100 MeV/n (75 cGy)] or no irradiation (0 cGy). Twenty-four h after irradiation, rats were euthanized, and the brain was dissected for analysis of HZE-particle-induced neurochemical changes in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Results showed that exposure to Fe-56 and Ti-48 ions produced changes in measurements of brain inflammation [glial fibrillary astrocyte protein ( GFAP)], oxidative stress [NADPH-oxidoreductase-2 (NOX2)] and antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)]. However, radiation effects varied depending upon the specific measurement, brain region, and exposure location. Although overall exposures of the head produced more detrimental changes in neuroinflammation and oxidative stress than exposures of the body, body-only exposures also produced changes relative to no irradiation, and the effect of particle energy/LET on neurochemical changes was minimal. Results indicate that both targeted and non-targeted effects are important contributors to neurochemical changes after head-only exposure. However, because there were no consistent neurochemical changes as a function of changes in track structure after head-only exposures, the role of direct effects on neuronal function is uncertain. Therefore, these findings, although in an animal model, suggest that NTEs should be considered in the estimation of risk to the central nervous system (CNS) and development of countermeasures.

AB  - BackgroundThe contribution of the central nervous system to sepsis pathobiology is incompletely understood. In previous studies, administration of endotoxin to mice decreased activity of the vagus anti-inflammatory reflex. Treatment with the centrally-acting M1 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (M1AChR) attenuated this endotoxin-mediated change. We hypothesize that decreased M1AChR-mediated activity contributes to inflammation following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a mouse model of sepsis.MethodsIn male C57Bl/6 mice, we quantified basal forebrain cholinergic activity (immunostaining), hippocampal neuronal activity, serum cytokine/chemokine levels (ELISA) and splenic cell subtypes (flow cytometry) at baseline, following CLP and following CLP in mice also treated with the M1AChR agonist xanomeline.ResultsAt 48 h. post-CLP, activity in basal forebrain cells expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was half of that observed at baseline. Lower activity was also noted in the hippocampus, which contains projections from ChAT-expressing basal forebrain neurons. Serum levels of TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, MIP-1 alpha, IL-6, KC and G-CSF were higher post-CLP than at baseline. Post-CLP numbers of splenic macrophages and inflammatory monocytes, TNF alpha+ and IL beta+ neutrophils and IL beta+ monocytes were higher than baseline while numbers of central Dendritic Cells (cDCs), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were lower. When, following CLP, mice were treated with xanomeline activity in basal forebrain ChAT-expressing neurons and in the hippocampus was significantly higher than in untreated animals. Post-CLP serum concentrations of TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and MIP-1 alpha, but not of IL-6, KC and G-CSF, were significantly lower in xanomeline-treated mice than in untreated mice. Post-CLP numbers of splenic neutrophils, macrophages, inflammatory monocytes and TNF alpha+ neutrophils also were lower in xanomeline-treated mice than in untreated animals. Percentages of IL-1 beta+ neutrophils, IL-1 beta+ monocytes, cDCs, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were similar in xanomeline-treated and untreated post-CLP mice.ConclusionOur findings indicate that M1AChR-mediated responses modulate CLP-induced alterations in serum levels of some, but not all, cytokines/chemokines and affected splenic immune response phenotypes.

AB  - BET inhibitors have the potential to treat malignant tumors via the epigenetic modification mechanism. Although BET inhibitors show promise as anticancer agents for uveal melanoma (UM), the emergence of acquired resistance significantly limits their clinical efficacy. We developed isogenic OTX015-resistant UM cell models (OMM2.3R and OMM2.5R) via exposure to escalating OTX015 concentrations (0.04-0.5 mu M over 6 months). These resistant cells demonstrated reduced sensitivity to OTX015-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, the migratory ability of resistant cells was less affected by OTX015 compared to parental cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed an upregulation of YAP-activated genes in resistant cells. Notably, OTX015-resistant cells retained sensitivity to YAP inhibition via shRNA or pharmacological inhibitors. This study establishes YAP activation as a novel compensatory mechanism driving BET inhibitor resistance in UM. These findings position YAP inhibition as a potential therapeutic target to overcome BET inhibitor resistance, with clinical translational potential for resistant UM patients.

AB  - Hippocampal neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation is known to decline with age, which is closely linked to learning and memory impairments. In the current study, we found that the expression level of miR-181a-5p was decreased in the hippocampal NSCs of aged mice and that exogenous overexpression of miR-181a-5p promoted NSC proliferation without affecting NSC differentiation into neurons and astrocytes. The mechanistic study revealed that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the AKT signaling pathway, was the target of miR-181a-5p and knockdown of PTEN could rescue the impairment of NSC proliferation caused by low miR-181a-5p levels. Moreover, overexpression of miR-181a-5p in the dentate gyrus enhanced the proliferation of NSCs and ameliorated learning and memory impairments in aged mice. Taken together, our findings indicated that miR-181a-5p played a functional role in NSC proliferation and aging-related, hippocampus-dependent learning and memory impairments.

AB  - Multiple studies have demonstrated that acute ethanol consumption alters brain function and cognition. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission is crucial for hippocampal plasticity, and recently, the opening of hemichannels has been found to play a relevant role in this process. Hemichannels are plasma membrane channels composed of six connexins or seven pannexins, respectively, that oligomerize around a central pore. They serve as ionic and molecular exchange conduits between the cytoplasm and extracellular milieu, allowing the release of various paracrine substances, such as ATP, D-serine, and glutamate, and the entry of ions and other substances, such as Ca2+ and glucose. The persistent and exacerbated opening of hemichannels has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several brain diseases for at least three mechanisms. The uncontrolled activity of these channels could favor the collapse of ionic gradients and osmotic balance, the release of toxic levels of ATP or glutamate, cell swelling and plasma membrane breakdown and intracellular Ca2+ overload. Here, we evaluated whether acute ethanol exposure affects the activity of astrocyte hemichannels and the possible repercussions of this phenomenon on cytoplasmatic Ca2+ signaling and gliotransmitter release. Acute ethanol exposure triggered the rapid activation of connexin43 and pannexin1 hemichannels in astrocytes, as measured by time-lapse recordings of ethidium uptake. This heightened activity derived from a rapid rise in [Ca2+](i) linked to extracellular Ca2+ influx and IP3-evoked Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Relevantly, the acute ethanol-induced activation of hemichannels contributed to a persistent secondary increase in [Ca2+](i). The [Ca2+](i)-dependent activation of hemichannels elicited by ethanol caused the increased release of ATP and glutamate in astroglial cultures and brain slices. Our findings offer fresh perspectives on the potential mechanisms behind acute alcohol-induced brain abnormalities and propose targeting connexin43 and pannexin1 hemichannels in astrocytes as a promising avenue to prevent deleterious consequences of alcohol consumption.

AB  - The purpose of our study is to investigate the beneficial effects of mitophagy enhancers against mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (A beta) induced mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research spanning over two decades highlights the critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage in the pathogenesis of both early-onset and late-onset AD. Emerging evidence suggests impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria is an early pathological event in AD, positioning mitophagy enhancers as potential therapeutic candidates. This study determined the optimal doses of four mitophagy enhancers-Urolithin A (UA), actinonin, tomatidine, and nicotinamide riboside (NR)-using immortalized mouse hippocampal (HT22) neurons. HT22 cells were transfected with mutant APP (mAPP) cDNA and treated with the enhancers. The effects were assessed by evaluating mRNA and protein expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, mitophagy, and synaptic function, alongside cell survival and mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial morphology was also examined in treated and untreated mAPP-HT22 cells. Results showed that mAPP-HT22 cells exhibited increased mitochondrial fission, reduced fusion, downregulated synaptic and mitophagy-related genes, diminished cell survival, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and excessively fragmented, shortened mitochondria. Treatment with mitophagy enhancers reversed these deficits, restoring mitochondrial and synaptic health. Enhanced cell survival, upregulation of mitochondrial fusion, synaptic, and mitophagy genes, improved mitochondrial structure, and reduced fragmentation were observed. Notably, UA demonstrated the most robust mitigating effects. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of mitophagy enhancers, particularly UA, as promising candidates to treat mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions in AD.

AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric mood diseases worldwide, whose therapy is in urgent need of development. Although the neuroprotective effects of Rehmannioside A (Rea) have been demonstrated, its anti -depressive effect remains unclear. Here, a depression model was induced with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats. The behavioral trails, including sucrose preference test, forced swim test and open field test were used to determine the success of the CUMS-induced model. The effect of Rea on the neuronal protection, apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) was evaluated by HE, NISSL, IF and TUNEL staining, and western blot assays. Mechanically, the MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins expressions were examined by western blot. The results showed that CUMS stimulation evoked a prominent reduction of rat body weight, sucrose preference, and numbers of crossing, rearing and grooming with the enhanced immobility times. Besides, CUMS exposure induced the nuclear shrinkage and damage, as well as the decreased ISSL+ numbers. Moreover, CUMS stimulation increased the relative protein expressions of Bax and Cleaved caspase-3 and the percent of TUNEL positive cells, and decreased the relative protein expressions of Bcl-2. Furthermore, CUMS exposure also increased the relative protein expression of GRP-78, XBP-1, ATF-6, ATF-4 and CHOP. However, the CUMS-induced changes of all these indicators were reversed with Rea introduction in a dose-dependent fashion. Mechanically, Rea supply observably antagonized the CUMS-induced the relative protein levels of p-p38/p-38, p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 and p-JNK/JNK. Therefore, Rea attenuated depression through suppressing ERS and apoptosis in hippocampus of CUMS-induced rats involved in MAPK signaling.

AB  - Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an anticonvulsant drug that usually is used for the treatment of seizures. The anti-epileptic and the anti-epileptogenic effect of exercise has been reported, as well. This study was aimed to evaluate the synergic effect of combined therapy of exercise and CBZ in epileptic rats, as well as the alternation of the GABA pathway as a possible involved mechanism. The seizure was induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) injection. Animals were divided into sham, seizure, exercise (EX), CBZ (25, 50 and 75), EX + CBZ (25, 50 and 75). Treadmill forced running for 30 min has been considered as the exercise 5 days per week for four weeks. CBZ was injected in doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg, half an hour before seizure induction and 5 h after doing exercise in the animals forced to exercise. Seizure severity reduced and latency increased in the EX + CBZ (25) and EX + CBZ (50) groups compared to the seizure group. The distribution of GAD65 in both hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas increased in the EX + CBZ (75) group. GABA(A) receptor alpha(1) was up-regulated in the CA3 area of the EX + CBZ (75) group. The distribution of GAD65 in the cortical area increased in EX, EX + CBZ (50), CBZ (75) and EX + CBZ (75) groups. GABA(A) receptor alpha(1) was up-regulated in the neocortex of EX + CBZ (50), CBZ (75) and EX + CBZ (75) groups. Our findings suggested that exercise has improved the efficacy of CBZ and reduced the anti-epileptic dose. The enhancement of GABA signaling might be involved in the synergistic effect of exercise and CBZ.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that is prevalent around the world. Both Apelin-13 and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma)/PPAR gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) are regarded as candidate targets for treating AD. The investigation examined whether Apelin-13 exerts neuroprotective effects via PGC-1 alpha/PPAR gamma signaling. In this study, Apelin-13 improved cognitive deficits in AD mice, while SR-18,292 (a PGC-1 alpha inhibitor) interfered with the therapeutic effects of Apelin-13. Mechanistically, Apelin-13, PGC-1 alpha and PPAR gamma were decreased in AD mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal cells. Apelin-13 bound to PGC-1 alpha and negatively regulated the expression of PGC-1 alpha and PPAR gamma. In turn, PGC-1 alpha accelerated the accumulation of Apelin-13 and PPAR gamma. Additionally, neuronal apoptosis was inhibited, and the abundance of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase 3) was induced. The content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) fluctuated. The level of inflammatory factors (interleukin-6, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha) was regulated. In short, Apelin-13 exerted anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidant stress and anti-inflammatory effects. Interestingly, PGC-1 alpha silencing promoted neuronal apoptosis, oxidant stress and inflammation, and overexpression of PGC-1 alpha exhibited the opposite. More importantly, inhibition of PGC-1 alpha attenuated Apelin-13-enhanced cognitive impairment and neuronal damage. Therefore, our findings suggested that Apelin-13 exerted neuroprotective effects in part via the PGC-1 alpha/PPAR gamma pathway.

KW  - MEMORY
AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer-CA1 region of the hippocampus is closely related to learning and memory. Magnetic stimulation, as an effective physical means of regulating synaptic plasticity, has received widespread attention. However, research on the mechanism of the effect of different frequencies of magnetic fields (MFs) on LTP is relatively scarce. This article focuses on Ca2+, Na+, K+, NMDA receptors, and AMPA receptors that play important roles in the process of MF regulation of LTP. A combined electrophysiological and pharmacological approach was used to identify Ca2+ as a key factor in the modulation of LTP by MFs of different frequencies. Subsequently, further experiments revealed that low levels of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) intensified the inhibition of low-frequency MFs on LTP, while high levels of [Ca2+](i) enhanced the promotion effect of high-frequency MFs on LTP, indicating a positive correlation between [Ca2+](i) levels and MF regulation of LTP levels. The research results of this article may help explore the deeper relationship between different frequencies of MFs and synaptic plasticity, and they also have a certain reference value for magnetic stimulation therapy in the treatment of neurological diseases related to LTP injury or learning and memory deficits.

AB  - The mechanism underlying the antiepileptic actions of norepinephrine (NE) is unclear with conflicting results. Our objectives are to conclusively delineate the specific adrenergic receptor (AR) involved in attenuating hippocampal CA3 epileptiform activity and assess compounds for lead drug development. We utilized the picrotoxin model of seizure generation in rat brain slices using electrophysiological recordings. Epinephrine (EPI) reduced epileptiform burst frequency in a concentration-dependent manner. To identify the specific receptor involved in this response, the equilibrium dissociation constants were determined for a panel of ligands and compared with established binding values for alpha(1), alpha(2), and other receptor subtypes. Correlation and slope of unity were found for the alpha(2A)-AR, but not other receptors. Effects of different chemical classes of alpha-AR agonists at inhibiting epileptiform activity by potency (pEC(50)) and relative efficacy (RE) were determined. Compared with NE (pEC(50), 6.20; RE, 100%), dexmedetomidine, an imidazoline (pEC(50), 8.59; RE, 67.1%), and guanabenz, a guanidine (pEC(50), 7.94; RE, 37.9%), exhibited the highest potency (pEC(50)). In contrast, the catecholamines, EPI (pEC(50), 6.95; RE, 120%) and alpha-methyl-NE (pEC(50), 6.38; RE, 116%) were the most efficacious. These findings confirm that CA3 epileptiform activity is mediated solely by alpha(2A)-ARs without activation of other receptor systems. These findings suggest a pharmacotherapeutic target for treating epilepsy and highlight the need for selective and efficacious alpha(2A)-AR agonists that can cross the blood-brain barrier.

AB  - The limited capability of regeneration in the human central nervous system leads to severe and permanent disabilities following spinal cord injury (SCI) while patients suffer from no viable treatment option. Adult human neural stem cells (ahNSCs) are unique cells derived from the adult human brain, which have the essential characteristics of NSCs. The objective of this study was to characterize the therapeutic effects of ahNSCs isolated from the temporal lobes of focal cortical dysplasia type IIIa for SCI and to elucidate their treatment mechanisms. Results showed that the recovery of motor functions was significantly improved in groups transplanted with ahNSCs, where, in damaged regions of spinal cords, the numbers of both spread and regenerated nerve fibers were observed to be higher than the vehicle group. In addition, the distance between neuronal nuclei in damaged spinal cord tissue was significantly closer in treatment groups than the vehicle group. Based on an immunohistochemistry analysis, those neuroprotective effects of ahNSCs in SCI were found to be mediated by inhibiting apoptosis of spinal cord neurons. Moreover, the analysis of the conditioned medium (CM) of ahNSCs revealed that such neuroprotective effects were mediated by paracrine effects with various types of cytokines released from ahNSCs, where monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also known as CCL2) was identified as a key paracrine mediator. These results of ahNSCs could be utilized further in the preclinical and clinical development of effective and safe cell therapeutics for SCI, with no available therapeutic options at present.

AB  - This study investigated the potential effects on the hippocampus of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) disseminated by mobile phones and the roles of baobab (Adansonia digitata) (AD) and black seed (Nigella sativa) (BS) in mitigating these. Fifty-six male, 12-week-old Wistar albino rats were divided into eight groups of seven animals each. No EMF exposure was applied to the control, AD or BS groups, while the rats in the Sham group were placed in an EMF system with no exposure. A 900-MHz EMF was applied to the EMF+AD, EMF+BS, EMF+AD+BS and EMF groups for 1 hour a day for 28 days. Pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus were subsequently counted using the optical fractionator technique, one of the unbiased stereological methods. Tissue sections were also evaluated histopathologically under light and electron microscopy. The activities of the enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also determined in blood serum samples. Analysis of the stereological data revealed no statistically significant differences between the EMF and control or sham groups in terms of pyramidal neuron numbers (p >0.05). However, stereological examination revealed a crucial difference in the entire hippocampus between the control group and the AD (p <0.01) and BS (p <0.05) groups. Moreover, exposure to 900 -MHz EMF produced adverse changes in the structures of neurons at histopathological analysis. Qualitative examinations suggest that a combination of herbal products such as AD and BS exerts a protective effect against such EMF side-effects.

AB  - Sorafenib, a multiple kinase inhibitor, is widely used in cancer patients. Recently, clinical studies highlighted the relationship between cognitive deficits and sorafenib exposure. Zinc abundant in the body has been reported to exert neuroprotective activities. However, the effects of zinc supplementation on sorafenib-induced cognitive impairment are still unknown. In the current study, we verified that mice challenged with sorafenib displayed characteristic features of cognitive impairment. However, zinc treatment effectively improved these changes. Histopathological staining also showed that zinc significantly alleviated hippocampal microstructural and ultrastructural damages induced by sorafenib. Meanwhile, zinc significantly reduced sorafenib-induced ROS production and neuronal cells apoptosis in vivo and vitro. Additionally, we also investigated whether zinc protected against sorafenib-induced neuronal cells apoptosis via ROS/JNK pathway through treating SH-SY5Y cells with the NAC or the specific JNK activator anisomycin. The results indicated that NAC performed the same protective effects as zinc in sorafenib-challenged SH-SY5Y cells and activation of JNK by anisomycin partly abolished the protective effects of zinc. Collectively, the present study suggested that inhibition of oxidative stress and the JNK pathway might contribute to the protective effects of zinc against sorafenib-caused cognitive impairment in vivo and vitro.

AB  - Background: Neuronal injury in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is the main pathogenic factor of vascular dementia (VD). Clinically, there isn't a drug specifically for VD; instead, the majority of medications used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) are also used to treat VD. Based on the proven anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Probucol, we hypothesized that it may have therapeutic effects on VD, but more research is required to determine its exact mechanism of action. Methods: In vivo experiment: We used SD rats and most commonly used bilateral carotid artery occlusion (2VO) in VD for modeling. After successful modeling, SD rats were given Probucol 3.5 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks to evaluate the therapeutic effect. In vitro experiment: BV -2 microglia of rats were cultured and divided into Control group and Probucol group. Each group was treated with hypoxia-hypoglycemia, hypoxia-hypoglycemia hydrogen peroxide and hypoxia-hypoglycemia hydrogen peroxide Syk inhibitor respectively. Results: The results of immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that Probucol could significantly improve the cognitive impairment induced by CCH, and the neuronal damage was also attenuated. On the one hand, the underlying mechanism of Probucol was to reduce oxidative stress and cell apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the expression of phosphorylated spleen tyrosine kinase (P-Syk); On the other hand, it exerted a protective effect by reducing NLRP3-dependent cell pyroptosis and inhibiting neuroinflammation induced by microglia activation. Conclusion: Probucol could reduce oxidative stress and cell apoptosis by inhibiting the Syk/ROS signaling pathway, thereby improving CCH-induced cognitive impairment in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Dopamine (DA), the most abundant human brain catecholaminergic neurotransmitter, modulates key behavioral and neurological processes in young and senescent brains, including motricity, sleep, attention, emotion, learning and memory, and social and reward-seeking behaviors. The DA transporter (DAT) regulates transsynaptic DA levels, influencing all these processes. Compounds targeting DAT (e.g., cocaine and amphetamines) were historically used to shape mood and cognition, but these substances typically lead to severe negative side effects (tolerance, abuse, addiction, and dependence). DA/DAT signaling dysfunctions are associated with neuropsychiatric and progressive brain disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer diseases, drug addiction and dementia, resulting in devastating personal and familial concerns and high socioeconomic costs worldwide. The development of low-side-effect, new/selective medicaments with reduced abuse-liability and which ameliorate DA/DAT-related dysfunctions is therefore crucial in the fields of medicine and healthcare. Using the rat as experimental animal model, the present work describes the synthesis and pharmacological profile of (S)-MK-26, a new modafinil analogue with markedly improved potency and selectivity for DAT over parent drug. Ex vivo electrophysiology revealed significantly augmented hippocampal long-term synaptic potentiation upon acute, intraperitoneally delivered (S)-MK-26 treatment, whereas in vivo experiments in the hole-board test showed only lesser effects on reference memory performance in aged rats. However, in effort-related FR5/chow and PROG/chow feeding choice experiments, (S)-MK-26 treatment reversed the depression-like behavior induced by the dopamine-depleting drug tetrabenazine (TBZ) and increased the selection of high-effort alternatives. Moreover, in in vivo microdialysis experiments, (S)-MK-26 significantly increased extracellular DA levels in the prefrontal cortex and in nucleus accumbens core and shell. These studies highlight (S)-MK-26 as a potent enhancer of transsynaptic DA and promoter of synaptic plasticity, with predominant beneficial effects on effort-related behaviors, thus proposing therapeutic potentials for (S)-MK-26 in the treatment of low-effort exertion and motivational dysfunctions characteristic of depression and aging-related disorders.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), an escalating global health issue, lacks effective treatments due to its complex pathogenesis. YangXue QingNao Wan (YXQNW) is a China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)approved TCM formula that has been repurposed in clinical Phase II for the treatment of AD. Identifying YXQNW's active ingredients and their mechanisms is crucial for developing effective AD treatments. Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the anti-AD effects of YXQNW and to explore its potential therapeutic mechanisms employing an endophenotype network strategy. Methods: Herein we present an endophenotype network strategy that combines active ingredient identification in rat serum, network proximity prediction, metabolomics, and in vivo experimental validation in two animal models. Specially, utilizing UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, active ingredients are identified in YXQNW to build a drugtarget network. We applied network proximity to identify potential AD pathological mechanisms of YXQNW via integration of drug-target network, AD endophenotype gene sets, and human protein interactome, and validated related mechanisms in two animal models. In a d-galactose-induced senescent rat model, YXQNW was administered at varying doses for cognitive and neuronal assessments through behavioral tests, Nissl staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Metabolomic analysis with LC-MS revealed YXQNW's influence on brain metabolites, suggesting therapeutic pathways. Levels of key proteins and biochemicals were measured by WB and ELISA, providing insights into YXQNW's neuroprotective mechanisms. In addition, 5xFAD model mice were used and administered YXQNW by gavage for 14 days at two doses. Amyloid-beta levels, transporter expression, and cerebral blood flow have been detected by MRI and biochemical assays. Results: The network proximity analysis showed that the effect of YXQNW on AD was highly correlated with amyloid beta, synaptic function, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. The results of metabolomics combined with in vivo experimental validation suggest that YXQNW has the potential to ameliorate glucose transport abnormalities in the brain by upregulating the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3, while further enhancing glucose metabolism through increased O-GlcNAcylation and mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction via the AMPK/Sirt1 pathway, thereby improving d-galactose-induced cognitive deficits in rats. Additionally, YXQNW treatment significantly decreased A beta 1-42 levels and enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. while mechanistic findings indicated that YXQNW treatment increased the expression of ABCB1, an A beta transporter, in 5xFAD model mice to promote the clearance of A beta from the brain and alleviate ADlike symptoms. Conclusions: This study reveals that YXQNW may mitigate AD by inhibiting A beta deposition and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction and glucose metabolism, thus offering a promising therapeutic approach for AD.

AB  - Natural antioxidants as safe and efficient agents play great effects on neurodegenerative diseases. However, their potential has been limited due to weak bioavailability and a low brain-blood ratio. Herein, protein construction strategy and nanotechnology are united to design dual-delivering lycopene (LYC) nanoparticles with the bloodbrain barrier crossing and intra-neuronal mitochondria targeting capabilities, supported by brain transcytosis Hferritin nanocage with LYC loaded into its cavity and lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) coupled on it. The neuroprotection of TPP-rHuHF-LYC nanoparticles was significantly observed: (i) regulating the mitochondrial function in nerve cells via improving energy production, maintaining DNA copy number, avoiding excessive opening of permeability transition pores and keeping the intact morphology of mitochondria; (ii) rescuing the memory decline of aging mice via the protection of synaptic mitochondria; (iii) enhancing synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons of mice via activating PKA/CREB/BNDF long-term potentiation pathway. This study provides a novel design strategy for intracerebral delivery and intra-neuronal mitochondrial-targeted therapy of natural antioxidant nanomedicine to treat neuronal dysfunction and memory loss.

In this study, we aimed to determine the neuroprotective mechanism of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and propofol in POCD. Methods: The cognitive dysfunction models in C57BL/6J mice were induced and treated, then cognitive function of mice were tested using morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Primary neurons were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic neuroinflammation during POCD. Meanwhile, cells were treated with propofol. 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was administrated to inhibit autophagy in neurons. SIRT3 overexpression vector was constructed to upregulate SIRT3. Biomarker changes in inflammation, oxidative stress and autophagy were determined in vivo and in vitro. Results: Propofol enhanced the spatial cognitive ability and novel objective recognition of POCD mice. Inflammation and oxidative stress were observed in the hippocampus, which were inhibited by propofol treatment. During POCD, SIRT3 expression and autophagy in the hippocampus was decreased; propofol activated autophagy and upregulated SIRT3. In LPS-stimulated neurons, SIRT3 upregulation enhanced the anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress roles of propofol; SIRT3 elevated propofol-activated autophagy in neurons undergoing LPS administration. Moreover, 3-MA reversed propofol-induced biomarker changes in inflammation, oxidative stress and autophagy in LPS-stimulated neurons. In POCD mice, SIRT3 upregulation enhanced the cognitive function during propofol treatment; SIRT3 overexpression elevated the inhibitory role of propofol in inflammation, oxidative stress and autophagy. AMPK/mTOR pathway was activated in response to propofol treatment and SIRT3 enhanced the signaling activation. Conclusions: SIRT3 enhances the protective effect of propofol on POCD by triggering autophagy that eliminates oxidative stress and inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Polysaccharide CSTPs extracted from Camellia sinensis tea-leaves possessed unique against oxidative damage by scavenging ROS. Herein, acid tea polysaccharide CSTPs-2 with tightly packed molecular structure was isolated, purified and characterized in this research. Furthermore, the effects of CSTPs-2 on ROS-involved inflammatory responses and its underlying mechanisms were investigated. The results suggest that CSTPs-2 dramatically reduced the inflammatory cytokines overexpression and LPS-stimulated cell damage. CSTPs-2 could trigger the dephosphorylation of downstream AKT/MAPK/NF-xB signaling proteins and inhibit nuclear transfer of p-NF-xB to regulate the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated cells by ROS scavenging. Importantly, the impact of CSTPs-2 in downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitigating ROS overproduction is associated with clathrin- or caveolae-mediated endocytosis uptake mechanisms, rather than TLR-4 receptor-mediated endocytosis. This study presents a novel perspective for investigating the cellular uptake mechanism of polysaccharides in the context of anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

AB  - Simple Summary Sedation in standing procedures is commonly performed in elephants. To successfully and safely initiate standing in elephants, chemical restraint drugs should provide sufficient sedation with minimal complications (i.e., recumbency, significant physiologic alterations, and prolonged recovery). This study investigated the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine in Asian elephants. Results suggest dexmedetomidine 1-2 mu g/kg provides effective sedation. However, we suggest a single intramuscular dexmedetomidine injection of 2 mu g/kg for approximately 70 min of sedation. This is the first study to demonstrate dexmedetomidine use in Asian elephants. This study investigated the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine in Asian elephants. We hypothesized that 2 mu g/kg dexmedetomidine would provide sufficient standing sedation. A crossover design study was performed in three Asian elephants. Each elephant was assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups-1 (D1), 1.5 (D1.5) or 2 (D2) mu g/kg dexmedetomidine (intramuscular injection, IM) with a two-week 'washout period' between doses. Elephants were monitored for 120 min. At 120 min (Ta), atipamezole was administered IM. Sedation and responsiveness scores were evaluated. Physiological parameters (pulse rate, respiratory rate, and %SpO(2)) and clinical observations were monitored during the study and for 3 days post drug administration. D2 provided the longest sedation (approximately 70 min), compared to D1 and D1.5. After Ta, each elephant's sedative stage lessened within 10-15 min without complications. No significant abnormal clinical observations were noted throughout and during the 3-days post study period. These data suggest that a single 2 mu g/kg IM dexmedetomidine injection provides sufficient standing sedation for approximately 70 min in Asian elephants.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid plaques and cognitive decline, the latter of which is thought to be driven by soluble oligomeric amyloid-beta (oA beta). The dysregulation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK; also known as Kir3) channels has been implicated in rodent models of AD. Here, seeking mechanistic insights, we uncovered a sex-dependent facet of GIRK-dependent signaling in AD-related amyloid pathophysiology. Synthetic oA beta(1-42) suppressed GIRK-dependent signaling in hippocampal neurons from male mice, but not from female mice. This effect required cellular prion protein, the receptor mGluR5, and production of arachidonic acid by the phospholipase PLA(2). Although oA beta suppressed GIRK channel activity only in male hippocampal neurons, intrahippocampal infusion of oA beta or genetic suppression of GIRK channel activity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons impaired performance on a memory test in both male and female mice. Moreover, genetic enhancement of GIRK channel activity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons blocked oA beta-induced cognitive impairment in both male and female mice. In APP/PS1 AD model mice, GIRK-dependent signaling was diminished in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from only male mice before cognitive deficit was detected. However, enhancing GIRK channel activity rescued cognitive deficits in older APP/PS1 mice of both sexes. Thus, whereas diminished GIRK channel activity contributes to cognitive deficits in male mice with increased oA beta burden, enhancing its activity may have therapeutic potential for both sexes.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition in which inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the pathogenesis. Recently, several studies have suggested that Royal Jelly (RJ) has antioxidant effects. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of its effectiveness against epilepsy. Here, we evaluated its neuroprotective effects at different doses (100 and 200 mg/kg) against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, PTZ, RJ100 + PTZ, RJ200 + PTZ and RJ100. In order to establish epilepsy model, 45 mg/kg of PTZ was injected intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days. Seizure pa-rameters were graded based on Racine's 7-point classification. Elevated-plus maze, Y maze and shuttle box tests were carried out to assess anxiety-like behavior, short-term memory, and passive avoidance memory, respec-tively. We used ELISA technique to measure the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress factors. Also, neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 region was determined using Nissl staining. Our findings showed that PTZ-treated rats had more seizure intensity, anxiety-like behavior, memory dysfunction, higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and oxidative markers. RJ could allay seizure severity and duration. It also improved memory function as well as anxiety level. In terms of biochemical assessment, RJ gave rise to a sig-nificant decrease in the level of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and MDA and it restored the activities of GPX and SOD enzymes. Hence, our study shows that RJ contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects which contribute to less neuronal damage in the PTZ-induced epilepsy model.

AB  - The crucial role of high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) proteins in nuclear processes such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and chromatin remodeling is undeniable. Elevated levels of HMGA1 have been associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and adverse differentiation status across various cancer types. HMGA1 regulates a diverse array of biological pathways, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha/nuclear factorkappa B (TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Hippo, Rat sarcoma/extracellular signalregulated kinase (Ras/ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), wingless-related integration site/beta-catenin (Wnt/betacatenin), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3-K/Akt). While researchers have extensively investigated tumors in the reproductive, digestive, urinary, and hematopoietic systems, mounting evidence suggests that HMGA1 plays a critical role as a tumorigenic factor in tumors across all functional systems. Given its broad interaction network, HMGA1 is an attractive target for viral manipulation. Some viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1, human herpesvirus 8, human papillomavirus, JC virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2, and influenza viruses, utilize HMGA1 influence for infection. This interaction, particularly in oncogenesis, is crucial. Apart from the direct oncogenic effect of some of the mentioned viruses, the hit-and-run theory postulates that viruses can instigate cancer even before being completely eradicated from the host cell, implying a potentially greater impact of viruses on cancer development than previously assumed. This review explores the interplay between HMGA1, viruses, and host cellular machinery, aiming to contribute to a deeper understanding of viral-induced oncogenesis, paving the way for innovative strategies in cancer research and treatment.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du decoction (HLJDD) is a traditional Chinese formula that is efficacious in treating diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetic encephalopathy; the underlying mechanisms of HLJDD in diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction remain unclear.Aim of the study: This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of HLJDD on cognitive function, and the possible underlying mechanisms in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rat model of cognitive impairment. Materials and methods: Twelve active ingredients in HLJDD were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. An animal model of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM was induced via a high-sugar and high fat diet combined with a low dose of streptozotocin. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, T2DM, metformin (0.34 g/kg/day), and HLJDD groups (3, 1.5, and 0.75 g/kg/day). All treatments were intragastrically administrated for nine continuous weeks after the development of T2DM. Body weight, food and water intake, fasting blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, and blood lipid levels were measured. Spatial learning and memory of the rats were assessed using the Morris water maze test. Hematoxylin and eosin and Nissl staining were performed to evaluate neuronal morphology and vitality. Glutathione, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase levels were measured to determine the level of oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe the synaptic morphology and structure of hippocampal neurons. IL-113 levels in the hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid were determined. The protein expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, mature IL-113, ATG7, P62, LC3, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was determined using western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis.Results: HLJDD attenuated cognitive dysfunction in rats with T2DM as shown by the decreased escape latency, increased times crossing the platform and time spent in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze test (P < 0.05), improvement in hippocampal histopathological changes, and an elevated level of cell vitality. HLJDD treatment also reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, ameliorated oxidative stress, and downregulated IL-113 expression in the hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid (P < 0.05). Moreover, HLJDD enhanced BDNF, ATG7, and LC3 protein expression and significantly inhibited the expression of P62, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and mature IL-113 in the hippocampal CA1 region (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence results further confirmed that the fluorescence intensity of NLRP3 and P62 in the hippocampus decreased after HLJDD intervention (P < 0.05).Conclusions: HLJDD ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in T2DM rats. The neuroprotective effect is exerted via the modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, upregulation of autophagy, and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of senile dementia. The key risk factor for a more common (>95% of cases) sporadic form of AD is age. So far, there are no effective methods for AD prevention or treatment. A growing body of evidence indicates that the development of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases is associated with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and JNK signaling pathway is considered as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of AD. However, the information on alterations in its activity in ontogenesis, which are evaluated by changes in the phosphorylation of its components, is extremely limited. The aim of this study was to compare age-related changes in the activity of JNK signaling pathway in the hippocampus of Wistar rats and senescence-accelerated OXYS rats (which spontaneously develop the key symptoms of AD-like pathology) and to evaluate the effect of the selective JNK3 inhibitor IQ-1S (11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one oxime sodium salt). The ability of IQ-1S to suppress accelerated brain aging in OXYS rat has been proven previously, but the effect of this inhibitor on the JNK activity has not been studied. Here, we showed that with age, the activity of the JNK signaling pathway increased in the hippocampus of rats of both strains. At the same time, the manifestation and active progression of AD-like pathology in OXYS rats was accompanied by the increase in the phosphorylation level of the key kinase of this signaling pathway, JNK3, and its target proteins compared to Wistar rats, which allowed us to suggest JNK3 as a potential target for interventions aimed at preventing neurodegenerative processes. This suggestion was supported by the fact that the neuroprotective effect of the selective JNK3 inhibitor IQ-1S and its ability to suppress the development of neurodegenerative processes in OXYS rats were associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation levels of JNK3, c-Jun, APP, and Tau in the hippocampus.

AB  - Background and Objective: Stroke, a leading cause of mortality and disability, characterized by neuronal death, can be induced by a reduction or interruption of blood flow. In this study, the role of Alamandine, a new peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, was evaluated in in-vitro and in-vivo brain ischemia models. Methods: In the in-vitro model, hippocampal slices from male C57/Bl6 mice were placed in a glucose-free aCSF solution and bubbled with 95% N-2 and 5% CO2 to mimic brain ischemia. An Alamandine concentration-response curve was generated to evaluate cell damage, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, and cell death. In the in-vivo model, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was induced by bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries (BCCAo-untreated) in SD rats. An intracerebroventricular injection of Alamandine was given 20-30 min before BCCAo. Animals were subjected to neurological tests 24 h and 72 h after BCCAo. Cytokine levels, oxidative stress markers, and immunofluorescence were assessed in the brain 72 h after BCCAo. Results: Alamandine was able to protect brain slices from cellular damage, excitotoxicity and cell death. When the Alamandine receptor was blocked, protective effects were lost. ICV injection of Alamandine attenuated neurological deficits of animals subjected to BCCAo and reduced the number of apoptotic neurons/cells. Furthermore, Alamandine induced anti-inflammatory effects in BCCAo animals as shown by reductions in TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and antioxidant effects through attenuation of the decreased SOD, catalase, and GSH activities in the brain. Conclusion: This study showed, for the first time, a neuroprotective role for Alamandine in different ischemic stroke models.

AB  - Simple Summary Rabbit breeding is an important branch of agricultural animal breeding; their fur color and weight are desirable traits for artificial breeding. Polymorphism can provide potential molecular markers for studying rabbit traits and improve rabbit breeds with such markers in the future. In this study, single-nucleotide polymorphism markers in genotyping-by-sequencing data were used to analyze rabbit traits. In total, three genes were identified to be associated with fur color and four with weight. The results of this study provide a data base for the research and improvement of rabbit breeding program. The domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus f. domesticus) is a very important variety in biomedical research and agricultural animal breeding. Due to the different geographical areas in which rabbit breeds originated, and the long history of domestication/artificial breeding, rabbits have experienced strong selection pressure, which has shaped many traits of most rabbit varieties, such as color and weight. An efficient genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection strategy is genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), which has been widely used in many organisms. This study attempted to explore bi-allelic SNPs associated with fur color and weight-related traits using GBS in five rabbit breeds. The data consisted of a total 831,035 SNPs in 150 individuals from Californian rabbits (CF), German Zika rabbits (ZK), Qixing rabbits (QX), Sichuan grey rabbits (SG), and Sichuan white rabbits (SW). In addition, these five breeds of rabbits were obviously independent populations, with high genetic differentiation among breeds and low genetic diversity within breeds. A total of 32,144 SNP sites were identified by selective sweep among the different varieties. The genes that carried SNP loci in these selected regions were related to important traits (fur color and weight) and signal pathways, such as the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and the Hippo signaling pathway. In addition, genes related to fur color and weight were identified, such as ASIPs, MITFs and KITs, ADCY3s, YAPs, FASs, and ACSL5s, and they had more SNP sites. The research offers the foundation for further exploration of molecular genetic markers of SNPs that are related to traits.

AB  - The current study aimed to examine the effects of echinacoside on cognitive impairment in mice after exposure to sevoflurane. To examine the role of FOXO1, si-FOXO1 and si-con were injected into the hippocampus through the left lateral cerebral ventricles. Sevoflurane-induced mice had serious cognitive dysfunction. However, pretreatment with echinacoside alleviated the cognitive dysfunction, as measured by a shortened escape latency time, and increased platform crossing times, the percentage of distance in the target quadrant and Y-maze spontaneous alternations. In addition, we found that echinacoside elevated FOXO1 expression in the hippocampus; increased the expression of autophagy-related proteins including Beclin 1, ATG5, ATG7, and LC3; and reduced P62 expression. Silencing of FOXO1 aggravated the cognitive deficits and reduced expression of the autophagy-related markers, whereas the effects of si-FOXO1 on memory were abrogated by echinacoside. Echinacoside attenuated the cognitive impairment in sevoflurane-induced mice through FOXO1-mediated autophagy.

AB  - Patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically experience substantial social isolation, which may cause secondary adverse effects on their brain development. miR-124 is the most abundant miRNA in the human brain, acting as a pivotal molecule regulating neuronal fate determination. Alterations of miR-124 maturation or expression are observed in various neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we analyzed a panel of brain-enriched microRNAs in serums from 2 to 6 year old boys diagnosed with ASD. The hsa-miR-124 level was found significantly elevated in ASD boys than in age and sex-matched healthy controls. In an isolation-reared weanling mouse model, we evidenced elevated mmu-miR-124 level in the serum and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These mice displayed significant sociability deficits, as well as myelin abnormality in the mPFC, which was partially rescued by expressing the miR-124 sponge in the bilateral mPFC, ubiquitously or specifically in oligodendroglia. In cultured mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells, introducing a synthetic mmu-miR-124 inhibited the differentiation process through suppressing expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (Nr4a1). Overexpressing Nr4a1 in the bilateral mPFC also corrected the social behavioral deficits and myelin impairments in the isolation-reared mice. This study revealed an unanticipated role of the miR-124/Nr4a1 signaling in regulating early social experience-dependent mPFC myelination, which may serve as a potential therapy target for social neglect or social isolation-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease with limited therapeutic options that is characterized by pathological fibroblast activation and aberrant lung remodeling with scar formation. YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a transcriptional coactivator that mediates mechanical and biochemical signals controlling fibroblast activation. We previously identified HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins) as YAP inhibitors based on a high-throughput small-molecule screen in primary human lung fibroblasts. Here we report that several Aurora kinase inhibitors were also identified from the top hits of this screen. MK-5108, a highly selective inhibitor for AURKA (Aurora kinase A), induced YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention and significantly reduced profibrotic gene expression in human lung fibroblasts. The inhibitory effect on YAP nuclear translocation and profibrotic gene expression is specific to inhibition of AURKA, but not Aurora kinase B or C, and is independent of the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1 and LATS2 (Large Tumor Suppressor 1 and 2). Further characterization of the effects of MK-5108 demonstrate that it inhibits YAP nuclear localization indirectly via effects on actin polymerization and TGF beta (Transforming Growth Factor beta) signaling. In addition, MK-5108 treatment reduced lung collagen deposition in the bleomycin mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. Our results reveal a novel role for AURKA in YAP-mediated profibrotic activity in fibroblasts and highlight the potential of small-molecule screens for YAP inhibitors for identification of novel agents with antifibrotic activity.

AB  - We propose a mechanism enabling the appearance of border cells-neurons firing at the boundaries of the navigated enclosures. The approach is based on the recent discovery of discrete complex analysis on a triangular lattice, which allows constructing discrete epitomes of complex-analytic functions and making use of their inherent ability to attain maximal values at the boundaries of generic lattice domains. As it turns out, certain elements of the discrete-complex framework readily appear in the oscillatory models of grid cells. We demonstrate that these models can extend further, producing cells that increase their activity toward the frontiers of the navigated environments. We also construct a network model of neurons with border-bound firing that conforms with the oscillatory models.

AB  - G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) interacts with G beta gamma and G alpha q, subunits of G-protein alpha, to regulate cell signalling. The second messenger inositol trisphosphate, produced by activated G alpha q, promotes calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and regulates maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity. This study aimed to investigate the role of GRK2 in MPF activity during the meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes. A specific inhibitor of GRK2 (beta i) was used in this study. The present study showed that GRK2 inhibition increased the percentage of oocyte arrest at the metaphase I (MI) stage (control: 13.84 +/- 0.95%; beta i: 31.30 +/- 4.18%), which resulted in the reduction of the maturation rate (control: 80.36 +/- 1.94%; beta i: 65.40 +/- 1.14%). The level of phospho-GRK2 decreased in the treated group, suggesting that GRK2 activity was reduced upon GRK2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of beta i decreased Ca2+ release from the ER. The protein levels of cyclin B and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 were higher in the treatment group than those in the control group, indicating that GRK2 inhibition prevented a decrease in MPF activity. Collectively, GRK2 inhibition induced meiotic arrest at the MI stage in porcine oocytes by preventing a decrease in MPF activity, suggesting that GRK2 is essential for oocyte meiotic maturation in pigs.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder featuring enhanced brain oxidative stress and deficient reelin protein. GFAP.HMOX10-12m mice that overexpress heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in astrocytes manifest a schizophrenia-like neurochemical, neuropathological and behavioral phenotype including brain oxidative stress and reelin downregulation. We used RT-PCR, targeted bisulfite next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on hippocampal tissue of GFAP.HMOX10-12m mice to delineate a possible molecular mechanism for the downregulation of reelin and to identify the neuronal and non-neuronal (glial) cell types expressing reelin in our model. We found reduced reelin and increased DNMT1 and TET1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of male GFAP.HMOX10-12m mice and reduced GAD67 mRNA expression in females. These mRNA changes were accompanied by sexually dimorphic alterations in DNA methylation levels of Reln and Gad1 genes. Reelin protein was expressed by oligodendrocytes and GABAergic interneurons, but not by astrocytes or microglia in GFAP.HMOX10-12m and wild-type brains of both sexes. Reelin mRNA was also observed in oligodendrocytes. Moreover, a significant downregulation of reelin-expressing oligodendrocytes was detected in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of male GFAP.HMOX10-12m mice. These results suggest a novel mechanism for brain reelin depletion in schizophrenia. Containment of the astrocytic HO-1 cascade by pharmacological or other means may protect against stress-induced brain reelin depletion in schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Adult cytogenesis, the continuous generation of newly-born neurons (neurogenesis) and glial cells (gliogenesis) throughout life, is highly impaired in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), impacting negatively on cognitive and emotional domains. Despite playing a critical role in brain homeostasis, the importance of gliogenesis has been overlooked, both in healthy and diseased states. To examine the role of newly formed glia, we transplanted Glial Restricted Precursors (GRPs) into the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), or injected their secreted factors (secretome), into a previously validated transgenic GFAP-tk rat line, in which cytogenesis is transiently compromised. We explored the long-term effects of both treatments on physiological and behavioral outcomes. Grafted GRPs reversed anxiety-like deficits and demonstrated an antidepressant-like effect, while the secretome promoted recovery of only anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, GRPs elicited a recovery of neurogenic and gliogenic levels in the ventral DG, highlighting the unique involvement of these cells in the regulation of brain cytogenesis. Both GRPs and their secretome induced significant alterations in the DG proteome, directly influencing proteins and pathways related to cytogenesis, regulation of neural plasticity and neuronal development. With this work, we demonstrate a valuable and specific contribution of glial progenitors to normalizing gliogenic levels, rescuing neurogenesis and, importantly, promoting recovery of emotional deficits characteristic of disorders such as MDD.

AB  - Synthetic cathinones have gained popularity among young drug users and are widely used in the clandestine market. While the cathinone-induced behavioral profile has been extensively investigated, information on their neuroplastic effects is still rather fragmentary. Accordingly, we have exposed male mice to a single injection of MDPV and alpha-PVP and sacrificed the animals at different time points (i.e., 30 min, 2 h, and 24 h) to have a rapid readout of the effect of these psychostimulants on neuroplasticity in the frontal lobe and hippocampus, two reward-related brain regions. We found that a single, low dose of MDPV or alpha-PVP is sufficient to alter the expression of neuroplastic markers in the adult mouse brain. In particular, we found increased expression of the transcription factor Npas4, increased ratio between the vesicular GABA transporter and the vesicular glutamate transporter together with changes in the expression of the neurotrophin Bdnf, confirming the widespread impact of these cathinones on brain plasticity. To sum up, exposure to low dose of cathinones can impair cortical and hippocampal homeostasis, suggesting that abuse of these cathinones at much higher doses, as it occurs in humans, could have an even more profound impact on neuroplasticity.

TI  - Photobiomodulation Therapy Ameliorates Glutamatergic Dysfunction in Mice with Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress-Induced Depression
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
LA  - English
AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that dysfunction of the glutamatergic neurotransmission has been widely involved in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has been demonstrated to regulate neuronal function both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we aim to investigate whether the antidepressant phenotype of PBMT is associated with the improvement of glutamatergic dysfunction and to explore the mechanisms involved. Results showed that PBMT decreased extracellular glutamate levels via upregulation of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and rescued astrocyte loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, which also alleviated dendritic atrophy and upregulated the expression of AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, ultimately exhibiting behaviorally significant antidepressant effects in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Notably, PBMT also obtained similar antidepressant effects in a depressive mouse model subcutaneously injected with corticosterone (CORT). Evidence from in vitro mechanistic experiments demonstrated that PBMT treatment significantly increased both the GLT-1 mRNA and protein levels via the Akt/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. NF-kappa B-regulated transcription was in an Akt-dependent manner, while inhibition of Akt attenuated the DNA-binding efficiency of NF-kappa B to the GLT-1 promoter. Importantly, in vitro, we further found that PKA activation was responsible for phosphorylation and surface levels of AMPA receptors induced by PBMT, which is likely to rescue excitatory synaptic transmission. Taken together, our research suggests that PBMT as a feasible therapeutic approach has great potential value to control the progression of depression.

AB  - Inflammasomes are a group of intracellular multiprotein platforms that play important roles in immune systems. Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is a constituent of cruciferous plants and has been confirmed to exhibit various biological activities. The modulatory effects of BITC on inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)-1 beta expression and its regulatory mechanisms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) LPS/ATP-stimulated THP-1 cells was investigated. Monocytic THP-1 cells were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to induce differentiation into macrophages. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to measure the levels of IL-1 beta produced in P. aeruginosa LPS/ATP-exposed THP-1 cells. Western blotting was performed to examine the BITC modulatory mechanisms in inflammasome-mediated signaling pathways. BITC inhibited IL-1 beta production in P. aeruginosa LPS/ATP-induced THP-1 cells. BITC also inhibited activation of leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) and caspase-1 in P. aeruginosa LPS/ATP-induced THP-1 cells. Furthermore, we show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation in P. aeruginosa LPS was attenuated by BITC. These BITC-mediated modulatory effects on IL-1 beta production may have therapeutic potential for inflammasome-mediated disorders such as a nasal polyp.

AB  - The neuropeptide galanin (GAL), which is expressed in limbic brain structures, has a strong impact on the regulation of mood and behavior. GAL exerts its effects via three G protein-coupled receptors (GAL(1-3)-R). Little is known about the effects of aging and loss of GAL-Rs on hippocampal-mediated processes connected to neurogenesis, such as learning, memory recall and anxiety, and cell proliferation and survival in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) in mice. Our results demonstrate that loss of GAL(3)-R, but not GAL(2)-R, slowed learning and induced anxiety in older (12-14-month-old) mice. Lack of GAL(2)-R increased cell survival (BrdU incorporation) in the dDG of young mice. However, normal neurogenesis was observed in vitro using neural stem and precursor cells obtained from GAL(2)-R and GAL(3)-R knockouts upon GAL treatment. Interestingly, we found sub-strain differences between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice, the latter showing faster learning, less anxiety and lower cell survival in the dDG. We conclude that GAL-R signaling is involved in cognitive functions and can modulate the survival of cells in the neurogenic niche, which might lead to new therapeutic applications. Furthermore, we observed that the mouse sub-strain had a profound impact on the behavioral parameters analyzed and should therefore be carefully considered in future studies.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognition. BDNF is a neurotrophin that binds to tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a specific receptor on target cell surfaces; it acts on neuronal formation, development, growth, and repair via transcription factors, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and it is involved in learning and memory. BDNF expression is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exercise and the intake of several different foods or ingredients can increase BDNF expression, as confirmed with lutein, xanthophylls (polar carotenoids), and ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn), which are present at high levels in the brain. This study examined the effects of combining lutein and PlsEtn using lutein-rich Chlorella and ascidian extracts containing high levels of PlsEtn bearing docosahexaenoic acid, which is abundant in the human brain, on the activation of the BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. Although activation of the BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus was not observed in Chlorella or ascidian PlsEtn monotherapy, activation was observed with combination therapy at an equal dose. The results of this study suggest that the combination of Chlorella and ascidian PlsEtn may have a preventive effect against dementia, including AD.

AB  - Chronic stress causes cognitive deficits, such as impairments in episodic-like hippocampus-dependent memory. Stress regulates an opioid-related neuropeptide named Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), the ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor NOP. Since this peptide has deleterious effects on memory, we hypothesized that the N/OFQ system could be a mediator of the negative effects of stress on memory. Chronic stress was mimicked by chronic exposure to corticosterone (CORT). The NOP receptor was either acutely blocked using selective antagonists, or knocked-down specifically in the hippocampus using genetic tools. Long-term memory was assessed in the object recognition (OR) and object location (OL) paradigms. Acute injection of NOP antagonists before learning had a negative impact on memory in naive mice whereas it restored memory performances in the chronic stress model. This rescue was associated with a normalization of neuronal cell activity in the CA3 part of the hippocampus. Chronic CORT induced an upregulation of the N/OFQ precursor in the hippocampus. Knock-down of the NOP receptor in the CA3/Dentate Gyrus region prevented memory deficits in the CORT model. These data demonstrate that blocking the N/OFQ system can be beneficial for long-term memory in a neuroendocrine model of chronic stress. We therefore suggest that NOP antagonists could be useful for the treatment of memory deficits in stress-related disorders.

KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - The peripheral immune system has a strong effect on the central nervous system (CNS). Systemic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) administration triggers robust microglial activation and induces significant inflammatory responses in the hippocampus. This study investigates the role of Transforming Growth Factor-(3-Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1) in mediating LPS-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Our findings reveal that LPS induces activation of microglial TAK1, which in turn activates downstream effector NF-kB/p65 to release pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activated microglia also promote astrocytes to polarize into a neurotoxic phenotype (A1-like phenotype) and cause the loss of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, TAK1 reduction inhibits microglial responses, limits neurotoxic astrocytes, rescues newborn neurons, and subsequently improves LPS-induced cognitive deficits, suggesting that targeting TAK1 may be an effective strategy for alleviating neuroinflammation. The interaction between TAK1 activation, microglial responses, and the transition of neurotoxic astrocytes enhances our understanding of the cellular dynamics driving LPSinduced neuroinflammation, suggesting that TAK1 may be a therapeutic target for treating cognitive impairment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to disentangle the effects of various genetic factors on hippocampal subfield volumes using three different approaches: a biologically driven candidate gene approach, a hypothesis-free GWAS approach, and a polygenic approach, where AD risk alleles are combined with a polygenic risk score (PRS). The impact of these genetic factors was investigated in a large dementia-free general population cohort from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP, n = 1806). Analyses were performed using linear regression models adjusted for biological and environmental risk factors. Hippocampus subfield volume alterations were found for APOE epsilon 4, BDNF Val, and 5-HTTLPR L allele carriers. In addition, we were able to replicate GWAS findings, especially for rs17178139 (MSRB3), rs1861979 (DPP4), rs7873551 (ASTN2), and rs572246240 (MAST4). Interaction analyses between the significant SNPs as well as the PRS for AD revealed no significant results. Our results confirm that hippocampal volume reductions are influenced by genetic variation, and that different variants reveal different association patterns that can be linked to biological processes in neurodegeneration. Thus, this study underlines the importance of specific genetic analyses in the quest for acquiring deeper insights into the biology of hippocampal volume loss, memory impairment, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Proton-gated channels of the ASIC family are widely distributed in central neurons, suggesting their role in common neurophysiological functions. They are involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity; however, the exact function of these channels remains unclear. One problem is that acidification of the synaptic cleft due to the acidic content of synaptic vesicles has opposite effects on ionotropic glutamate receptors and ASICs. Thus, the pH values required to activate ASICs strongly inhibit AMPA receptors and almost completely inhibit NMDA receptors. This, in turn, suggests that ASICs can provide compensation for post-synaptic responses in the case of significant acidifications. We tested this hypothesis by patch-clamp recordings of rat brain neuron responses to acidifications and glutamate receptor agonists at different pH values. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons have much lower ASICs than glutamate receptor responses, whereas striatal interneurons show the opposite ratio. Cortical pyramidal neurons and hippocampal interneurons show similar amplitudes in their responses to acidification and glutamate. Consequently, the total response to glutamate agonists at different pH levels remains rather stable up to pH 6.2. Besides these pH effects, the relationship between the responses mediated by glutamate receptors and ASICs depends on the presence of Mg2+ and the membrane voltage. Together, these factors create a complex picture that provides a framework for understanding the role of ASICs in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), one of the main active substances in Glycyrrhiza, has anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and neuroprotective effects. GA can significantly reduce cerebral infarction size in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats and suppress inflammatory responses. However, the underlying mechanism by which GA protects the neuronal system remains poorly understood. Cell proliferation and viability were tested using CCK-8 and Edu assays. The effects of GA on apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry and Tunel assays. Western blotting was performed to assess protein expression. Behavioral experiments were conducted using the Morris water maze and rotation tests. Infarct size was observed using TTC staining. We report that GA protects neurons by inhibiting apoptosis, mainly through the PI3K/AKT pathway in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and MCAO rat models. GA increases the viability and proliferation of oxygen- and glucose-deprived hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal neuron apoptosis decreased after GA treatment in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we determined that GA treatment increased the active state of PI3K and its downstream protein p-AKT, whereas when using a specific inhibitor of PI3K, Y294002, the levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT decreased. Finally, we showed that GA treatment improved spatial memory and motor coordination in MCAO rats, while TTC staining showed that GA decreased cerebral infarct size in MCAO rats. We reveal that GA protects hippocampal neurons by inhibiting their apoptosis, mainly through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

AB  - As one of the most environmental concerns, inhaled particulate matter (PM10) causes numerous health problems. However, the associations between anxiety behavior and toxicity caused by PM10 have rarely been reported so far. To investigate the changes of behavior after PM10 exposure and to identify the potential mechanisms of toxicity, PM10 samples (with doses of 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) were intratracheally instilled into rats to simulate inhalation of polluted air by the lungs. After instillation for eight weeks, anxiety-like behavior was evaluated, levels of oxidative stress and morphological changes of hippocampus were measured. The behavioral results indicated that PM10 exposure induced obvious anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Both PM10 concentrations tested could increase whole blood viscosity and trigger hippocampal neuronal damage and oxidative stress by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde levels, and decreasing the expressions of antioxidant-related proteins (e.g., nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), SOD1 and heme oxygenase 1). Furthermore, through collecting and analyzing questionnaires, the data showed that the participants experienced obvious anxiety-related emotions and negative somatic responses under heavily polluted environments, especially PM10 being the main pollutant. These results show that PM10 exposure induces anxiety-like behavior, which may be related to suppressing the Nrf2/Keap1-SOD1 pathway.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a condition in which the ER protein-folding machinery is impaired, leading to the accumulation of improperly folded proteins and triggering an unfolded-protein response. Excessive ER stress causes cell death and contributes to the development of chronic diseases. Interestingly, there is a bidirectional relationship between ER stress and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) pathway. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound found in Curcumae radix, exerts its neuroprotective effects by regulating ER stress and inflammation. Therefore, investigating the potential protective and regulatory effects of curcumin on ER stress, inflammation, and neurodegeneration under chronic neuroinflammatory conditions is of great interest. Mice were pretreated with Curcumae radix extract (CRE) for 19 days and then treated with CRE plus lipopolysaccharide for 1 week. We monitored pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum and ER stress-, inflammation-, and neurodegeneration-related markers in the mouse cerebrum and hippocampus using Western blotting and qRT-PCR. CRE reduced Interleukin-1 beta levels in the blood and brain of mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced chronic inflammation. CRE also suppressed the expression of markers related to the ER stress and NF-?B signaling pathways. The expression of neurodegeneration-related markers was reduced in the mouse cerebrum and hippocampus. CRE exerts neuroprotective effects under chronic inflammatory conditions via multifaceted anti-inflammatory and ER stress-pathway regulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. This study aims to elucidate the antidepressant effect of baicalein, an anti-inflammatory component of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine (Scutellaria baicalensis), on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior in mice, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. In vitro, baicalein exhibited antioxidant activity and protected macrophages from LPS-induced damage. The results of the tail suspension test and forced swimming test (tests for despair potential in mice) showed the antidepressant effect of baicalein on LPS-treated mice. It also substantially decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and eotaxin, elicited by LPS in the plasma. Baicalein downregulated NF-kappa B-p65 and iNOS protein levels in the hippocampus, demonstrated its ability to mitigate neuroinflammation. Additionally, baicalein increased the levels of the mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice, and elevated the ratio of mBDNF/proBDNF, which regulates neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Baicalein also promoted the expression of CREB, which plays a role in a variety of signaling pathways. In summary, the findings of this study demonstrate that the administration of baicalein can attenuate LPS-induced depression-like behavior by suppressing neuroinflammation and inflammation induced by the peripheral immune response.

AB  - In this work we studied the mutual influence of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSC) isolated from Wharton's jelly of human umbilical cord and primary culture of hippocampal cells obtained from transgenic mice 5XFAD, used as an animal model of inherited form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental protocols included both direct and indirect co-cultivation of MMSCs with hippocampal cells from transgenic animals. It was shown that in the conditions of indirect co-culture, the aggressive environment of cultured transgenic cells significantly decreases the survival rate and adhesiveness of MMSCs. However, preliminary priming of MMSCs with proteins YB-1 and HSP70 improved the survival and adhesive properties of MMSCs. It was also found that the interactions of MMSCs with cultured hippocampal cells depend on cell culture age. Old cultures of transgenic cells induced differentiation of MMSC into astrocytes, both during direct and indirect co-cultivation. In contrast, in young cultures of transgenic cells, during contact co-cultivation, MMSCs played the role of specific strands that promoted clustering of hippocampal cells in the culture and the formation of neurospheres. The interaction between MMSCs and neural cells occurred through gap junctions and nanotubes. Our findings expand the understanding of interactions between MMSCs and recipient cells, which allows us to revise the conditions of cellular transplantation therapy for pathological processes in the brain of AD patients.

AB  - The hippocampal formation is critical for episodic memory, with area Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3) a necessary substrate for auto-associative pattern completion. Recent theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that the formation and retrieval of cell assemblies enable these functions. Yet, how cell assemblies are formed and retrieved in a full-scale spiking neural network (SNN) of CA3 that incorporates the observed diversity of neurons and connections within this circuit is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that a data-driven SNN model quantitatively reflecting the neuron type-specific population sizes, intrinsic electrophysiology, connectivity statistics, synaptic signaling, and long-term plasticity of the mouse CA3 is capable of robust auto-association and pattern completion via cell assemblies. Our results show that a broad range of assembly sizes could successfully and systematically retrieve patterns from heavily incomplete or corrupted cues after a limited number of presentations. Furthermore, performance was robust with respect to partial overlap of assemblies through shared cells, substantially enhancing memory capacity. These novel findings provide computational evidence that the specific biological properties of the CA3 circuit produce an effective neural substrate for associative learning in the mammalian brain.

AB  - Alternate-day fasting (ADF) regimen has been reported to alleviate obesity and insulin resistance. However, the effects of ADF on preventing diet -induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and related cognitive deficits are still elusive. In the present study, a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mouse model was established. Mice were treated with a 4-week long ADF regimen and/or switching the diet to a standard diet. ADF reduced lipid accumulation, activated AMPK/ULK1 signaling, and suppressed the phosphorylation of mTOR. Also, ADF inhibited lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in the white adipose tissue and down-regulated expressions of PPAR-gamma and cytokines. Moreover, ADF improved the working memory and synaptic structure in the DIO mice and upregulated PSD-95 and BDNF in the hippocampus. ADF reduced oxidative stress and microglial over-activation in the CNS. These results suggest that ADF attenuates NAFLD development in the liver of DIO mice, which is related to the mediating effects of ADF on autophagy and energy metabolism. ADF also enhanced cognitive function, which could be partly explained by the down-regulated peripheral inflammatory responses. This study indicates that ADF could be a promising intervention for alleviating NAFLD development and cognitive decline. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is associated with various symptoms, such as depression, pain, and fatigue. To date, the pathological mechanisms and therapeutics remain uncertain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of myelophil (MYP), composed of Astragali Radix and Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix, on depression, pain, and fatigue behaviors and its underlying mechanisms. Reserpine (2 mg/kg for 10 days, intraperitoneally) induced depression, pain, and fatigue behaviors in mice. MYP treatment (100 mg/kg for 10 days, intragastrically) significantly improved depression behaviors, mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, and fatigue behavior. MYP treatment regulated the expression of c-Fos, 5-HT1A/B receptors, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in the brain, especially in the motor cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. MYP treatment decreased ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in the hippocampus and increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the striatum. MYP treatment altered inflammatory and anti-oxidative-related mRNA expression in the spleen and liver. In conclusion, MYP was effective in recovering major symptoms of ME/CFS and was associated with the regulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways and TGF-beta expression in the brain, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mechanisms in internal organs.

AB  - Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive tumour of the pleura (MPM) or peritoneum with a clinical presentation at an advanced stage of the disease. Current therapies only marginally improve survival and there is an urgent need to identify new treatments. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main component of a vast stroma within MPM and play an important role in the tumour microenvironment. The influence of CAFs on cancer progression, aggressiveness and metastasis is well understood; however, the role of CAF-derived extracellular vesicles (CAF-EVs) in the promotion of tumour development and invasiveness is underexplored. We purified CAF-EVs from MPM-associated cells and healthy dermal human fibroblasts and examined their effect on cell proliferation and motility. The data show that exposure of healthy mesothelial cells to EVs derived from CAFs, but not from normal dermal human fibroblasts (NDHF) resulted in activating pro-oncogenic signalling pathways and increased proliferation and motility. Consistent with its role in suppressing Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) activation (which in MPM is a result of Hippo pathway inactivation), treatment with Simvastatin ameliorated the pro-oncogenic effects instigated by CAF-EVs by mechanisms involving both a reduction in EV number and changes in EV cargo. Collectively, these data determine the significance of CAF-derived EVs in mesothelioma development and progression and suggest new targets in cancer therapy.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis enhances brain plasticity and contributes to the cognitive reserve during aging. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired in neurological disorders, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating the maturation and synaptic integration of new neurons have not been fully elucidated. GABA is a master regulator of adult and developmental neurogenesis. Here we engineered a novel retrovirus encoding the fusion protein Gephyrin:GFP to longitudinally study the formation and maturation of inhibitory synapses during adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo. Our data reveal the early assembly of inhibitory postsynaptic densities at 1 week of cell age. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 Beta (GSK-3 ss) emerges as a key regulator of inhibitory synapse formation and maturation during adult hippocampal neurogenesis. GSK-3 ss-overexpressing newborn neurons show an increased number and altered size of Gephyrin+ postsynaptic clusters, enhanced miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, shorter and distanced axon initial segments, reduced synaptic output at the CA3 and CA2 hippocampal regions, and impaired pattern separation. Moreover, GSK-3 ss overexpression triggers a depletion of Parvalbumin+ interneuron perineuronal nets. These alterations might be relevant in the context of neurological diseases in which the activity of GSK-3 ss is dysregulated.

AB  - Increasing evidence demonstrates that inflammatory cytokines-such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-are produced at low levels in the brain under physiological conditions and may be crucial for synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, learning and memory. Here, we examined the effects of developmental TNF deletion on spatial learning and memory using 11-13-month-old TNF knockout (KO) and C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice. The animals were tested in the Barnes maze (BM) arena under baseline conditions and 48 h following an injection of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Vehicle-treated KO mice were impaired compared to WT mice during the acquisition and memory-probing phases of the BM test. No behavioral differences were observed between WT and TNF-KO mice after LPS treatment. Moreover, there were no differences in the hippocampal content of glutamate and noradrenaline between groups. The effects of TNF deletion on spatial learning and memory were observed in male, but not female mice, which were not different compared to WT mice under baseline conditions. These results indicate that TNF is required for spatial learning and memory in male mice under physiological, non-inflammatory conditions, however not following the administration of LPS. Inflammatory signalling can thereby modulate spatial cognition in male subjects, highlighting the importance of sex- and probably age-stratified analysis when examining the role of TNF in the brain.

AB  - Phenylketonuria (PKU) was the first genetic disease to have an effective therapy, which consists of phenylalanine intake restriction. However, there are patients who do not adhere to treatment and/or are not submitted to neonatal screening. PKU patients present L-carnitine (L-car) deficiency, compound that has demonstrated an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory role in metabolic diseases. This study evaluated the effect caused by exposure time to high Phe levels in PKU patients at early and late diagnosis, through pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the L-car effect in patients under treatment. It was observed that there was a decrease in phenylalanine levels in treated patients compared to patients at diagnosis, and an increase in L-car levels in the patients under treatment. Inverse correlation between Phe versus L-car and nitrate plus nitrite versus L-car in PKU patients was also showed. We found increased proinflammatory cytokines levels: interleukin (IL)-1 beta, interferons (IFN)-gamma, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 in the patients at late diagnosis compared to controls, and IL-8 in the patients at early diagnosis and treatment compared to controls. Increased IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels in the patients at late diagnosis compared to early diagnosis were shown, and reduced IL-6 levels in the treated patients compared to patients at late diagnosis. Moreover, it verified a negative correlation between IFN-gamma and L-car in treated patients. Otherwise, it was observed that there were increased IL-4 levels in the patients at late diagnosis compared to early diagnosis, and reduction in treated patients compared to late diagnosed patients. In urine, there was an increase in 8-isoprostane levels in the patients at diagnosis compared to controls and a decrease in oxidized guanine species in the treated patients compared to the diagnosed patients. Our results demonstrate for the first time in literature that time exposure to high Phe concentrations generates a proinflammatory status, especially in PKU patients with late diagnosis. A pro-oxidant status was verified in not treated PKU patients. Our results demonstrate the importance of early diagnosis and prompt start of treatment, in addition to the importance of L-car supplementation, which can improve cellular defense against inflammation and oxidative damage in PKU patients.

AB  - Population aging is a global reality driven by increased life expectancy. This demographic phenomenon is intrinsically linked to the epidemic of cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, posing challenges for elderly and their families. In this context, the search for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize cognitive impairments becomes urgent, as these deficits are primarily associated with oxidative damage and increased neuroinflammation. Ferulic acid (FA), a natural and potent antioxidant compound, is proposed to be nanoencapsulated to target the central nervous system effectively with lower doses and an extended duration of action. Here, we evaluated the effects of the nanoencapsulated FA on d-galactose (d-Gal)- induced memory impairments. Male Wistar adult rats were treated with ferulic acid-loaded nanocapsules (FA-Nc) or non-encapsulated ferulic acid (D-FA) for 8 weeks concurrently with d-Gal (150 mg/kg s.c.) injection. As expected, our findings showed that d-Gal injection impaired memory processes and increased anxiety behavior, whereas FA-Nc treatment ameliorated these behavioral impairments associated with the aging process induced by d-Gal. At the molecular level, nanoencapsulated ferulic acid (FA-Nc) ameliorated the decrease in ACh and glutamate induced by d-galactose (d-Gal), and also increased GABA levels in the dorsal hippocampus, indicating its therapeutic superiority. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying our current promising outcomes. Nanoscience applied to pharmacology can reduce drug dosage, thereby minimizing adverse effects while enhancing therapeutic response, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. Therefore, the strategy of brain-targeted drug delivery through nanoencapsulation can be effective in mitigating aging-related factors that may lead to cognitive deficits.

AB  - Extensive studies have shown that oxidative stress is a crucial pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master cytoprotective regulator against oxidative stress, and thus represents an attractive therapeutic target in AD. The goal of our study is to investigate the contribution of Nrf2 in Rhynchophylline (Rhy)-induced neuroprotection in AD. The data showed that intraperitoneal administration of Rhy (10 or 20 mg/kg) could ameliorate A beta(1-42)-induced cognitive impairment, evidenced by performance improvement in memory tests. The result of Antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase activity assay indicated that Rhy treatment improved ARE promoter activity. The results of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) assessment in the frontal cortex and hippocampus showed that Rhy treatment could attenuate A beta(1-42)-induced oxidative stress to some extent, evidenced by reversion of these cytokines compared to A beta(1-42) + Veh group. Rhy treatment also restored expression of Nrf2 and its downstream protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NOQ1), and recombinant glutamate cysteine ligase, modifier subunit (GCLM) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of A beta(1-42)-treated mice. In addition, to investigate whether activation of Nrf2-mediated pathway is responsible for the neuroprotection of Rhy, Nrf2 siRNA was used in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Interestingly, the results showed that the protective effects of Rhy, including anti-oxidative, anti-apoptosis and elevation of Nrf2 and its downstream proteins, were abolished in Nrf2 siRNA-transfected cells. These findings indicate that Rhynchophylline is protective against A beta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity via Nrf2-ARE activation, and suggest that Rhy may serve as a potential candidate and promising Nrf2 activator for management of AD.

AB  - Zinc is highly concentrated in synaptic vesicles throughout the mammalian telencephalon and, in particular, the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A role for zinc in modulating synaptic plasticity has been inferred, but whether zinc has a particular role in experience-dependent plasticity has yet to be determined. The aim of the current study was to determine whether vesicular zinc is important for modulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an experience-dependent manner and, consequently, hippocampal-dependent behaviour. We assessed the role of vesicular zinc in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis and behaviour by comparing ZnT3 knockout (KO) mice, which lack vesicular zinc, to wild-type (WT) littermates exposed to either standard housing conditions (SH) or an enriched environment (EE). We found that vesicular zinc is necessary for a cascade of changes in hippocampal plasticity following EE, such as increases in hippocampal neurogenesis and elevations in mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF), but was otherwise dispensable under SH conditions. Using the Spatial Object Recognition task and the Morris Water task we show that, unlike WT mice, ZnT3 KO mice showed no improvements in spatial memory following EE. These experiments demonstrate that vesicular zinc is essential for the enhancement of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and behaviour following enrichment, supporting a role for zincergic neurons in contributing to experience-dependent plasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - Y Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complicated pathogenesis. F-box and WD-40 domain protein 11 (FBXW11), as a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, regulates multiple different signaling pathways. However, the effects of FBXW11 on AD progression and the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. In this study, we found that FBXW11 expression was markedly increased in microglial cells stimulated by amyloid-beta (A beta). Immunofluorescence staining showed that FBXW11 was co-localized with Iba-1 in microglial cells, suggesting its potential in regulating neuroinflammation. Meanwhile, significantly elevated expression of FBXW11 was detected in hippocampus of AD mouse models. Then, our in vitro studies showed that FBXW11 deletion considerably ameliorated inflammatory response in Ab-incubated microglial cells through suppressing nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling. We further found that FBXW11 physically interacted with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and promoted its ubiquitination, which led to the aberrant activation of NF-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Importantly, promoting ASK1 significantly abolished the effects of FBXW11 knockdown to repress inflammation and MAPKs/NF-kappa B activation in Ab-treated microglial cells. Subsequently, our in vivo experiments demonstrated that hippocampus-specific knockout of FBXW11 dramatically alleviated Ab plaque load, neuronal death, and microglial activation in AD mice. Furthermore, hippocampal deficiency of FBXW11 markedly mitigated neuroinflammation in AD mice through restraining ASK1/MAPKs/NF-kappa B signaling, along with alleviated cognitive deficits. Together, our findings demonstrated that FBXW11 may be a functionally important mediator of ASK1 activation, which could be a novel molecular target for AD treatment.

AB  - Hepatocytes exhibit a multi-polarized state under the in vivo physiological environment, however, human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hEHs) rarely exhibit polarity features in a two-dimensional (2D) condition. Thus, we hypothesized whether the polarized differentiation might enhance the maturity and liver function of hEHs. In this study, we obtained the polarized hEHs (phEHs) by using 2D differentiation in conjunct with employing transwell-based polarized culture. Our results showed that phEHs directionally secreted albumin, urea and bile acids, and afterward, the apical membrane and blood-bile barrier (BBIB) were identified to form in phEHs. Moreover, phEHs exhibited a higher maturity and capacitity of cellular secretory and drug metabolism than those of non-phEHs. Through transcriptome analysis, it was found that the polarized differentiation induced obvious changes in gene expression profiles of cellular adhesion and membrane transport in hEHs. Our further investigation revealed that the activation of Hippo and AMPK signaling pathways made contributions to the regulation of function and cellular polarity in phEHs, further verifying that the liver function of hEHs was closely related with their polarization state. These results not only demonstrated that the polarized differentiation enhanced the maturity and liver function of hEHs, but also identified the molecular targets that regulated the polarization state of hEHs.

AB  - Amyloid-beta peptides (A beta) accumulate in the brain since early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dysregulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity, the neurophysiological basis of memory. Although the relationship between long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory processes is well established, there is also evidence that long-term depression (LTD) may be crucial for learning and memory. Alterations in synaptic plasticity, namely in LTP, can be due to communication failures between astrocytes and neurons; however, little is known about astrocytes' ability to control hippocampal LTD, particularly in AD-like conditions. We now aimed to test the involvement of astrocytes in changes of hippocampal LTP and LTD triggered by A beta(1-42), taking advantage of L-alpha-aminoadipate (L-AA), a gliotoxin that blunts astrocytic function. The effects of A beta(1-42) exposure were tested in two different experimental paradigms: ex vivo (hippocampal slices superfusion) and in vivo (intracerebroventricular injection), which were previously validated to impair memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, two features of early AD. Blunting astrocytic function with L-AA reduced LTP and LTD amplitude in hippocampal slices from control mice, but the effect on LTD was less evident, suggesting that astrocytes have a greater influence on LTP than on LTD under non-pathological conditions. However, under AD conditions, blunting astrocytes did not consistently alter the reduction of LTP magnitude, but reverted the LTD-to-LTP shift caused by both ex vivo and in vivo A beta(1-42) exposure. This shows that astrocytes were responsible for the hippocampal LTD-to-LTP shift observed in early AD conditions, reinforcing the interest of strategies targeting astrocytes to restore memory and synaptic plasticity deficits present in early AD.

AB  - Infants born with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have up to a five-fold higher risk of learning and memory impairment than those with normal growth. Using a mouse model of hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (HDP) to replicate uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI), we have previously shown that UPI causes premature embryonic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis in IUGR offspring. The DG is a brain region that receives the first cortical information for memory formation. In the current study, we examined the postnatal DG neuron morphology one month after delivery (P28) using recombinant adeno-associated viral labeling of neurons. We also examined DG microglia's morphology using immunofluorescent histochemistry and defined the hippocampal cytokine/chemokine milieu using Luminex xMAP technology. We found that IUGR preserved the principal dendrite lengths but decreased the dendritic branching and volume of DG neurons. IUGR augmented DG microglial number and cell size. Lastly, IUGR altered the hippocampal cytokine/chemokine profile in a sex-specific manner. We conclude that the prematurely-generated neuronal progenitors develop abnormal morphologies postnatally in a cell-autonomous manner. Microglia appear to modulate neuronal morphology by interacting with dendrites amidst a complex cytokine/chemokine environment that could ultimately lead to adult learning and memory deficits in our mouse model.

AB  - The neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6a (GPM6A) belongs to the family of myelin proteolipid protein and plays a role in neuronal remodeling and plasticity. Decreased expression of GPM6A mRNA is observed in the hippocampal tissue of suicide victims who suffered from depression and after chronic stress exposure in animals. The regulatory mechanisms that impact expression of GPM6A under chronic stress or in pathological conditions are not well understood. Previously, miRNAs miR-133b, miR-124-3p, and miR-9-5p have been shown to regulate the expression of Gpm6a mRNA under normal conditions. Here, we employed the paradigm of chronic-restraint stress in rats and using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed down-regulation of expression of Gpm6a and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) genes at mRNA level as well as miR-133b, and miR-124-3p, but not miR-9-5p in the hippocampus of chronically stressed rats. Furthermore, we observed alterations in the expression of histone deacetylase (Hdac5) and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (Mef2c) mRNAs. Our data suggest that chronic stress influences Gpm6a expression by miR-124-mediated impact on the expression of Hdac5 and Mef2c. Upon miR-124 over-expression in hippocampal neurons cultured in vitro, we observed enhanced neuronal arborization as evaluated by Sholl analysis, increased Gpm6a and Mef2c expression, and decreased Hdac5 expression. Moreover, treatment of hippocampal neurons cultured in vitro with BDNF resulted in an elevation in the miR-124-3p expression, a decrease in the miR-9-5p expression but did not affect miR-133b. This was accompanied by augmented expression of Gpm6a and Mef2c mRNAs and significantly lower levels of Hdac5 mRNA. Altogether, these results indicate that the regulatory mechanism that influence expression of Gpm6a under chronic stress involves miR-124-mediated impact on the expression of Hdac5 and Mef2c and a role of BDNF in the activation of Gpm6a expression.

AB  - The atmospheric-thermosonication extraction (ATSE) of bioactive compounds from freeze-dried aqueous extract of green tea (FDGT) and green coffee (FDGC) herbal plants was performed to improve the separation of phenolic compounds. The extraction process was optimized by considering the operating conditions of temperature (25-85 degrees C), extraction time (15-35 min) and the amplitude of ultrasonic waves (0-100%) to achieve freeze-dried herbal extracts (FDHEs). According to Pearson correlation statistics approach, strong and negative correlation was observed between two main quantitative indicators of (EC50 and TPC) for FDGT (r = -0.9717 & R2 = 0.944) and FDGC (r = -1.00 & R2 = 1.00), respectively. While the extraction productivity ratio (TPC/EC50) of FDGT and FDGC under conventional extraction (maceration extraction technique) was significantly increased to -24.61 and -76.60 respectively, the noted parameter increased at rates of -34.19 and -88.64 after applying ATSE treatment at the similar conditions. Additionally, the caffeine content of FDGT was -50% more than FDGC. Overall, ultrasound-assisted extraction of phenolic antioxidants from herbal plants used much less energy than those extracted with conventional method and obtained extracts had a higher quality and inhibiting components against pathogenic microorganism than those extracted with commercial method due to extraction at lower temperatures.

AB  - Background Neuroinflammation is widely acknowledged as a characteristic feature of almost all neurological disorders and specifically in depression- and anxiety-like disorders. In recent years, there has been significant attention on natural compounds with potent anti-inflammatory effects due to their potential in mitigating neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity.Methods In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of oleacein (OC), a rare secoiridoid derivative found in extra virgin olive oil. Our goal was to explore the BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic activity of OC and subsequently assess its potential for modulating neuroinflammatory response using human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells) and an in vivo model of depression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation.Results In SH-SY5Y cells, OC exhibited a significant dose-dependent increase in BDNF expression. This enhancement was absent when cells were co-treated with inhibitors of BDNF's receptor TrkB, as well as downstream molecules PI3K and MEK. Whole-transcriptomics analysis revealed that OC upregulated cell cycle-related genes under normal conditions, while downregulating inflammation-associated genes in LPS-induced conditions. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays demonstrated that OC exhibited a stronger and more stable binding affinity to TrkB compared to the positive control, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone. Importantly, bioluminescence imaging revealed that a single oral dose of OC significantly increased BDNF expression in the brains of Bdnf-IRES-AkaLuc mice. Furthermore, oral administration of OC at a dosage of 10 mg/kg body weight for 10 days significantly reduced immobility time in the tail suspension test compared to the LPS-treated group. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that OC significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines Tnf alpha, Il6, and Il1 beta, while simultaneously enhancing Bdnf expression, as well as both pro and mature BDNF protein levels in mice hippocampus. These changes were comparable to those induced by the positive control antidepressant drug fluoxetine. Additionally, microarray analysis of mouse brains confirmed that OC could counteract LPS-induced inflammatory biological events.Results In SH-SY5Y cells, OC exhibited a significant dose-dependent increase in BDNF expression.

This finding underscores the potential of OC as a natural therapeutic agent for depression- and anxiety-related disorders.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder. Neuronal loss in the brain is one of the important characteristic features of AD, which is along with memory and cognitive dysfunction. Activation of programmed cell deaths, especially apoptosis and necroptosis, and autophagy failure play critical roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Ghrelin, an appetite-related hormone, exerts neuroprotective effects via the stimulation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a in the central nervous system. In this study, rats' cognitive impairments were induced by intra-hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 3 administration of amyloid-beta 1-42 (A beta 1-42). Then, animals were treated with ghrelin 80 mu g/kg via intraperitoneal injection for 10 consecutive days. The Morris water maze and passive avoidance learning test were used to evaluate the effect of ghrelin on learning and memory performance. After that, a histopathological study on rat's hippocampi was done, and the expressions of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, necroptotic proteins RIP1K and RIP3K and autophagic marker Beclin-1 were assessed, using western blotting method. Our findings show that ghrelin improves memory impairment in A beta 1-42-induced rats and reduces Bax, RIP1K, and RIP3K expressions and also Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as well as Beclin-1 expressions. In conclusion, our study suggests that ghrelin can provide neuroprotection via inhibition of apoptosis and necroptosis and autophagy promotion in A beta 1-42-induced model of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Background Mammal evolution has generated diverse craniofacial morphologies, including remarkable movable rostral appendages. However, the muscular and skeletal architecture providing the mobility of these appendages remains largely unexplored. Here, we focus on chiropteran noseleaves and compare the three-dimensional internal morphology of late-stage embryos between the greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, which possesses a noseleaf, and the Asian bent-winged bat Miniopterus fuliginosus and Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus, which do not. We also assess earlier stage cell proliferation within the rostrum to elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying noseleaf-associated morphological modifications. Results The musculus maxillolabialis inserted into proximal vibrissae follicles in M fuliginosus and R aegyptiacus embryos but instead inserted into the horseshoe plate in R ferrumequinum. This modification suggests that the M maxillolabialis has adapted to controlling the noseleaf rather than vibrissae in rhinolophid bats. Our cellular analysis showed higher cell proliferation within the maxillary and frontonasal processes of St. 14 embryos in R ferrumequinum compared to M fuliginosus and R aegyptiacus, suggesting that the spatial alteration of noseleaf-associated muscle is derived from changes in facial morphogenesis that occur by St. 14. Conclusion This is the first study clarifying the morphological and cellular bases underlying the development of mammalian rostral appendages.

AB  - In recent years, the use of multi-target compounds has become an increasingly pursued strategy to treat complex pathologies, including cerebral ischemia. Adenosine and its receptors (A(1)AR, A(2A)AR, A(2B)AR, A(3)AR) are known to play a crucial role in synaptic transmission either in normoxic or ischemic-like conditions. Previous data demonstrate that the selective antagonism of A(2A)AR or A(2B)AR delays anoxic depolarization (AD) appearance, an unequivocal sign of neuronal injury induced by a severe oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) insult in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the stimulation of A(2A)ARs or A(2B)ARs by respective selective agonists, CGS21680 and BAY60-6583, increases pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release, as shown by the decrease in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. In the present research, we investigated the effect/s of the newly synthesized dual A(2A)AR/A(2B)AR antagonist, P626, in preventing A(2A)AR- and/or A(2B)AR-mediated effects by extracellular recordings of synaptic potentials in the CA1 rat hippocampal slices. We demonstrated that P626 prevented PPF reduction induced by CGS21680 or BAY60-6583 and delayed, in a concentration-dependent manner, AD appearance during a severe OGD. In conclusion, P626 may represent a putative neuroprotective compound for stroke treatment with the possible translational advantage of reducing side effects and bypassing differences in pharmacokinetics due to combined treatment.

AB  - Purpose. To study the effects of a six-week endurance training protocol and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibition on the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and protein kinase B (PKB) or AKT expression in the hippocampal tissue of male Wistar rats. Main Methods. Building on a controlled experimental design with a posttest, 28 healthy Wistar male rats were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 7 per group), including control, control+CGRP inhibition, endurance training, and endurance training+CGRP inhibition groups. The training groups were trained for six weeks. Rats in the CGRP inhibition group received CGRP receptor antagonist daily (0.25 mg/kg) via intravenous (IV) injection. The Nrf2 and AKT (PKB) expression was measured using the real-time PCR technique. Results. In the endurance training group, Nrf2 expression in the hippocampal tissue was increased significantly more than in other groups (P < 0.05). There was also a significant increase in the AKT expression in the endurance training group compared to the control group (P = 0.048) and in the endurance training +CGRP inhibition compared to the control group (P = 0.012). In addition, there was no significant relationship between AKT (PKB) and Nrf2 (r = -0.27, n = 28, P = 0.16). Conclusion. Endurance training alone has been able to increase Nrf2 and AKT (PKB) mRNA levels in the hippocampal tissue, considering that endurance training had no significant effect on AKT and Nrf2 expression after adding to CGRP inhibition.

AB  - Lampreys are jawless fish that evolved about 550 million years ago at the base of the vertebrate line. Modern lampreys contain a corticoid receptor (CR), the common ancestor of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which first appear in cartilaginous fish, such as sharks. Until recently, 344 amino acids at the amino terminus of adult lamprey CR were not present in the lamprey CR sequence in GenBank. A search of the recently sequenced lamprey germline genome identified two CR sequences, CR1 and CR2, containing the 344 previously un-identified amino acids. CR1 also contains a novel four amino acid insertion in the DNA-binding domain (DBD). We studied corticosteroid and progesterone activation of CR1 and CR2 and found their strongest response was to 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, the two circulating corticosteroids in lamprey. Based on steroid specificity, both CRs are close to elephant shark MR and distant from elephant shark GR. HEK293 cells that were transfected with full-length CR1 or CR2 and the MMTV promoter have about 3-fold higher steroid-mediated activation compared to HEK293 cells transfected with these CRs and the TAT3 promoter. Deletion of the amino-terminal domain (NTD) of lamprey CR1 and CR2 to form truncated CRs decreased transcriptional activation by about 70% in HEK293 cells that were transfected with MMTV, but increased transcription by about 6-fold in cells transfected with TAT3. This indicated that the promoter has an important effect on NTD regulation of transcriptional activation of the CR by steroids. Our results also indicate that the entire lamprey CR sequence is needed for an accurate determination of steroid-mediated transcription.

AB  - Tea is the first most popular beverage worldwide and is available in several selections such as black (fully oxidized), Oolong (partially oxidized) and green (non-oxidized), in addition to purple tea, an emerging variety derived from the same tea plant (Camellia sinensis). This study investigated purple tea leaves (non-oxidized) and flakes (water extractable) to thoroughly identify their composition of anthocyanins and catechins and to study the effect of a water extraction process on their compositional properties in comparison with green tea. Anthocyanin and catechin compounds were separated and quantified using UPLC, and their identity was confirmed using LC-MS/MS in positive and negative ionization modes. Delphinidin was the principal anthocyaninidin in purple tea, while cyanidin came in second. The major anthocyanin pigments in purple tea were delphinidin-coumaroyl-hexoside followed by delphinidin-3-galactoside and cyanidin-coumaroyl-hexoside. The water extraction process resulted in substantial reductions in anthocyanins in purple tea flakes. There were no anthocyanin compounds detected in green tea samples. Both purple and green tea types were rich in catechins, with green tea containing higher concentrations than purple tea. The main catechin in purple or green tea was epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) followed by either epicatechin gallate (ECG) or epigallocatechin (EGC), subject to tea type. The extraction process increased the concentration of catechins in both purple and green tea flakes. The results suggest that purple tea holds promise in making healthy brews, natural colorants and antioxidants and/or functional ingredients for beverages, cosmetics and healthcare industries due to its high content of anthocyanins and catechins.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the pathogenesis of depression is still unknown, environmental risk factors and genetics are implicated. Copper (Cu), a cofactor of multiple enzymes, is involved in regulating depression-related processes. Depressed patients carrying the apolipoprotein e4 allele display more severe depressive symptoms, indicating that ApoE4 is closely associated with an increased risk of depression. The study explored the effect of low-dose Cu exposure and ApoE4 on depression-like behavior of mice and further investigates the possible mechanisms. The ApoE4 mice and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with 0.13 ppm CuCl2 for 4 months. After the treatment, ApoE4 mice displayed obvious depression-like behavior compared with the WT mice, and Cu exposure further exacerbated the depression-like behavior of ApoE4 mice. There was no significant difference in anxiety behavior and memory behavior. Proteomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins between Cu-exposed and nonexposed ApoE4 mice were mainly involved in the Ras signaling pathway, protein export, axon guidance, serotonergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, and dopaminergic synapse. Among these differentially expressed proteins, immune response and synaptic function are highly correlated. Representative protein expression changes are quantified by western blot, showing consistent results as determined by proteomic analysis. Hippocampal astrocytes and microglia were increased in Cu-exposed ApoE4 mice, suggesting that neuroglial cells played an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Taken together, our study demonstrated that Cu exposure exacerbates depression-like behavior of ApoE4 mice and the mechanisms may involve the dysregulation of synaptic function and immune response and overactivation of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Environmental factors, including pesticide exposure, have been identified as substantial contributors to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Previously, we demonstrated that repeated exposure to deltamethrin induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, reduces hippocampal neurogenesis, and impairs cognition in adult mice. Here, we investigated the potential relationship between ER stress and hippocampal neurogenesis following exposure to deltamethrin, utilizing both pharmacological and genetic approaches. To investigate whether ER stress is associated with inhibition of neurogenesis, mice were given two intraperitoneal injections of eIf2 alpha inhibitor salubrinal (1 mg/kg) at 24 h and 30 min prior to the oral administration of deltamethrin (3 mg/kg). Salubrinal prevented hippocampal ER stress, as indicated by decreased levels of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and attenuated deltamethrin-induced reductions in BrdU-, Ki-67-, and DCX-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. To further explore the relationship between ER stress and adult neurogenesis, we used caspase-12 knockout (KO) mice. The caspase-12 KO mice exhibited significant protection against deltamethrin-induced reduction of BrdU-, Ki-67-, and DCX-positive cells in the hippocampus. In addition, deltamethrin exposure led to a notable upregulation of CHOP and caspase-12 expression in a significant portion of BrdU- and Ki-67-positive cells in WT mice. Conversely, both salubrinal-treated mice and caspase-12 KO mice exhibited a considerably lower number of CHOP-positive cells in the hippocampus. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to the insecticide deltamethrin triggers ER stress-mediated suppression of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which may subsequently contribute to learning and memory deficits in mice.

AB  - Background Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is a common and severe complication during radiotherapy for head and neck tumor. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel and non-invasive method of brain stimulation, which has been applied in various neurological diseases. rTMS has been proved to be effective for treatment of RIBI, while its mechanisms have not been well understood.Methods RIBI mouse model was established by cranial irradiation, K252a was daily injected intraperitoneally to block BDNF pathway. Immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry and western blotting were performed to examine the microglial pyroptosis and hippocampal neurogenesis. Behavioral tests were used to assess the cognitive function and emotionality of mice. Golgi staining was applied to observe the structure of dendritic spine in hippocampus.Results rTMS significantly promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and mitigated neuroinflammation, with ameliorating pyroptosis in microglia, as well as downregulation of the protein expression level of NLRP3 inflammasome and key pyroptosis factor Gasdermin D (GSDMD). BDNF signaling pathway might be involved in it. After blocking BDNF pathway by K252a, a specific BDNF pathway inhibitor, the neuroprotective effect of rTMS was markedly reversed. Evaluated by behavioral tests, the cognitive dysfunction and anxiety-like behavior were found aggravated with the comparison of mice in rTMS intervention group. Moreover, the level of hippocampal neurogenesis was found to be attenuated, the pyroptosis of microglia as well as the levels of GSDMD, NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1 beta were upregulated.Conclusion Our study indicated that rTMS notably ameliorated RIBI-induced cognitive disorders, by mitigating pyroptosis in microglia and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis via mediating BDNF pathway.

AB  - Background Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is one of the most prevalent brain injuries in humans which has poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Due to several medical or surgical treatment methods, a gold standard method doesn't exist for SAH treatment. Piceatannol (PCN), a natural analog of resveratrol, was reported to reduce inflammation and apoptosis promising a wide range of therapeutic alternatives. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of PCN in an experimental SAH model. The alleviating effects of PCN in the hippocampus in an experimental SAH model were investigated for the first time. Methods and results In this study, 27 Wistar Albino male rats (200-300 g; 7-8 week) were used. Animals were divided into three groups; SHAM, SAH, and SAH + PCN. SAH model was created with 120 mu l of autologous arterial tail blood to prechiasmatic cisterna. 30 mg/kg PCN was administered intraperitoneally at 1st h after SAH. Neurological evaluation was performed with Garcia's score. RT-PCR was performed for gene expression levels in the hippocampus. Pyknosis, edema, and apoptosis were evaluated by H&E and TUNEL staining. Our results indicated that PCN administration reduced apoptosis (P < 0.01), cellular edema, and pyknosis (P < 0.05) in the hippocampus after SAH. Moreover, PCN treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of TNF-alpha (P < 0.01), IL-6 (P < 0.05), NF-kappa B (P < 0.05), and Bax (P < 0.05) in the hippocampus. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that PCN might be a potential therapeutic adjuvant agent for the treatment of early brain injury (EBI) following SAH. Further studies are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms and treatment options of SAH.

AB  - Previous studies have revealed that different intensities of exercise training have an impact on cognition. However, the cognitive effects of different intensities of exercise and its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of different intensities of treadmill exercise on cognition in rats from the perspective of metabolomic analysis. In this study, ninety-six male rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (CON group, n = 24), low-intensity running group (LIR group, n = 24), medium-intensity running group (MIR group, n = 24), and high-intensity running group (HIR group, n = 24). After 4 weeks of treadmill running, rats in the LIR group located the platform significantly faster than those in the CON(p = 0.027) and HIR(p = 0.011) groups. After 8 weeks of treadmill running, rats in the LIR and MIR groups also found the platform more quickly than those in CON group (p = 0.003 and p = 0.015, respectively). Additionally, rats in the MIR group showed significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase (CAT) in the hippocampus compared with those exposed to HIR(p = 0.03), LIR(p = 0.0008), and CON(p = 0.0004). Metabolomic analysis revealed that, after 8 weeks of running, 14 metabolites with similar characteristics differed between the MIR and HIR groups compared to the CON group. The LIR group showed significant alterations in 12 key metabolites compared to the CON group. The LIR, MIR, and HIR groups also demonstrated significant changes in 3, 4, and 3 metabolic pathways respectively, when compared to the CON group. In conclusion, the above results indicate that LIR can effectively decrease fumarate accumulation, thereby enhancing the TCA cycle and brain energy metabolism which in turn improved cognitive function, while MIR can modify glutathione metabolism to alleviate oxidative stress (OS), supporting cognitive function.

AB  - Abundant investigations have shown that hypobaric hypoxia (HH) causes cognitive impairment, mostly attributed to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. HPN (4 '-hydroxyl-2-subsitiuted phenylnitronyl nitroxide) is an excellent free radical scavenger with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. Our previous study has found that HPN exhibited neuroprotective effect on HH induced brain injury. In the present study, we examined the protective effect and potential mechanism of HPN on HH-induced cognitive impairment. Male mice were exposed to HH at 8000 m for 3 days with and without HPN treatment. Cognitive performance was assessed by the eight-arm radical maze. The histological changes were assayed by Nissle staining. The hippocampus cell apoptosis was detected by Tunnel staining. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers were detected. The expression of oxidative stress, inflammation-related and apoptosis-related proteins was determined by western blot. HPN administration significantly and mitigated HH induced histological damages and spatial memory loss with the evidence of decreased working memory error (WME), reference memory error (RME), total errors (TE) and total time (TT). In addition, HPN treatment significantly decreased the content of H2O2 and MDA, increased the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and GSH, and inhibited the synthesis of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6. Moreover, HPN administration could down-regulate the expression of NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 and up-regulate the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and Bcl-2. The number of apoptotic cells was also significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice in the HPN group. There results indicate that HPN improve HH-induced cognitive impairment by alleviating oxidative stress damage, suppressing inflammatory response and apoptosis and may be a powerful candidate compound for alleviating memory loss induced by HH.

AB  - Melatonin (Mel), an important mediator of photoperiodic annual rhythm regulation and seasonal reproduction in animals, directly modulates the expression of specific genes in the epididymis and protects sperm from oxidative damage. Bactrian camel is a dominant species in desert and semi-desert areas, exhibiting the unique reproductive regulation patterns. However, the underlying regulation mechanism of Mel on Bactrian camel is still unclear. This study isolated the epididymal caput epithelial cells of Bactrian camels and investigated the expression of specific genes involving sperm protection after Mel treatment and overexpression/knockdown of Mel receptor MT1/MT2 using real-time quantitative PCR assay (qPCR), ELISA, and western blotting assay. The results showed that MT1, MT2, clock genes cryptochrome 1/2 (Cry1/Cry2) were all positively expressed in the epididymal lumen epithelial cells, peritubular myoid cells, and luminal spermatozoa. Intriguingly, Mel treatment activated receptor MT1 in epididymal caput epithelial cells, indicating that Mel treatment regulated genes expression mainly via MT1-dependent manner. Mel treatment or overexpression of MT1 both increased secretion of glutathione peroxidase 5 (GPX5) and prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS), and MT1 silencing induced downregulation of GPX5 and PTGDS expression, indicating that the expression of GPX5 and PTGDS were regulated by Mel-MT1. Overexpression of MT1 or MT2 promoted Cry2 expression, and overexpression of Cry2 also activated the MT1/MT2 expression by feedback regulation. Finally, the double luciferase reports assay showed that the activation of MT1 by Cry2 occurred during transcription. These results help to understand the regulatory effect of Mel on the epididymis in Bactrian camels.

AB  - ATM depletion is associated with the multisystemic neurodegenerative syndrome ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). The exact linkage between neurodegeneration and ATM deficiency has not been established yet, and no treatment is currently available. In this study, we aimed to identify synthetic viable genes in ATM deficiency to highlight potential targets for the treatment of neurodegeneration in A-T. We inhibited ATM kinase activity using the background of a genome-wide haploid pluripotent CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function library and examined which mutations confer a growth advantage on ATM-deficient cells specifically. Pathway enrichment analysis of the results revealed the Hippo signaling pathway as a major negative regulator of cellular growth upon ATM inhibition. Indeed, genetic perturbation of the Hippo pathway genes SAV1 and NF2, as well as chemical inhibition of this pathway, specifically promoted the growth of ATM-knockout cells. This effect was demonstrated in both human embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells. Therefore, we suggest the Hippo pathway as a candidate target for the treatment of the devastating cerebellar atrophy associated with A-T. In addition to the Hippo pathway, our work points out additional genes, such as the apoptotic regulator BAG6, as synthetic viable with ATM-deficiency. These genes may help to develop drugs for the treatment of A-T patients as well as to define biomarkers for resistance to ATM inhibition-based chemotherapies and to gain new insights into the ATM genetic network.

AB  - Y Adropin (ADR) plays a role in metabolism regulation and its alterations in obesity and diabetes have been found. Treatment with ADR was beneficial in metabolic diseases, and physical exercise increased ADR concentrations in obese patients. However, data on the distribution of ADR in the brain are sparse. The role of metabolic status and physical exercise on its expression in the brain is undiscovered.
   We hypothesized that diabetes type 2 (DM2) and/or exercise will alter number of ADR-immunoractive (-ir) cells in the rat brain.
   Animals were divided into groups: diabetes type 2 (receiving high-fat diet and injections of streptozotocin) and control (fed laboratory chow diet; C). Rats were further divided into: running group (2 weeks of forced exercise on a treadmill) and non-running group. Body mass, metabolic and hormonal profiles were assessed. Immunohistochemistry was run to study ADR-ir cells in the brain.
   We found that: 1) in DM2 animals, running decreased insulin and increased glucose concentrations; 2) in C rats, running decreased insulin concentrations and had no effect on glucose concentration in blood; 3) running increased corticosterone (CORT) concentrations in DM2 and C rats; 4) ADR-ir cells were detected in the hippocampus and ADR-ir fibers in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is a novel location; 5) metabolic status and running, however, did not change number of these cells.
   We concluded that 2 weeks of forced moderate intensity locomotor training induced stress response present as increased concentration of CORT and did not influence number of ADR-ir cells in the brain.

AB  - Chronic stress is a universal condition commonly associated with many psychiatric diseases. An extensive body of evidence discussed hippocampal affection upon chronic stress exposure, however, the underlying molecular pathways still need to be identified. We investigated the impact of chronic stress on miR200/BMP/Olig-2 signaling and hippocampal myelination. We also compared the effects of chronic administration of amitriptyline and cholecalciferol on chronically stressed hippocampi. Both amitriptyline and cholecalciferol significantly decreased serum cortisol levels, reduced immobility time in the forced swim test, increased the number of crossed squares in open field test, decreased the hippocampal expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and its messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, reduced miR200 expression as compared to untreated chronically stressed rats. Also, both drugs amended the hippocampal neuronal damage, enhanced the surviving cell count, and increased the pyramidal layer thickness of Cornu Ammonis subregion 1 (CA1) and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Cholecalciferol was more effective in increasing the area percentage of myelin basic protein (MBP) and Olig-2 positive cells count in hippocampi of chronic stress-exposed rats than amitriptyline, thus enhancing myelination. We also found a negative correlation between the expression of BMP4, its mRNA, miR200, and the immunoexpression of MBP and Olig-2 proteins. This work underscores the amelioration of the stress-induced behavioral changes, inhibition of miR200/BMP4 signaling, and enhancement of hippocampal myelination following chronic administration of either amitriptyline or cholecalciferol, though cholecalciferol seemed more effective in brain remyelination.

AB  - Rats possess exceptional navigational abilities, allowing them to adaptively adjust their navigation paths based on the environmental structure. This remarkable ability is attributed to the interactions and regulatory mechanisms among various spatial cells within the rat's brain. Based on these, this paper proposes a navigation path search and optimization method for mobile robots based on the rat brain's cognitive mechanism. The aim is to enhance the navigation efficiency of mobile robots. The mechanism of this method is based on developing a navigation habit. Firstly, the robot explores the environment to search for the navigation goal. Then, with the assistance of boundary vector cells, the greedy strategy is used to guide the robot in generating a locally optimal path. Once the navigation path is generated, a dynamic self-organizing model based on the hippocampal CA1 place cells is constructed to further optimize the navigation path. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this paper designs several 2D simulation experiments and 3D robot simulation experiments, and compares the proposed method with various algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only surpasses other algorithms in terms of path planning efficiency but also yields the shortest navigation path. Moreover, the method exhibits good adaptability to dynamic navigation tasks.

AB  - The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a short-day desert breeder in which female ovulation is induced by mating. Current data indicate that male-induced ovulation is triggered by its seminal plasma nerve growth factor beta (beta-NGF), but the exact mechanisms involved in the induction of ovulation are still unknown. In this study, we report that an intramuscular injection of beta-NGF in sexually active short-day-adapted female camels induces an ovulation attested by a surge of circulating LH (2-6 h after treatment) followed by an oocyte release with its cumulus oophorus (confirmed by ultrasonography 72 h after treatment) and a large and progressive increase in circulating progesterone (significant from the 2nd to the 10th days after beta-NGF injection). In addition, this beta-NGF treatment induces a broad nuclear c-FOS activation in cells located in various hypothalamic areas, notably the preoptic area, the arcuate nucleus, the dorso- and ventromedial hypothalamus, the paraventricular nucleus, and the supraoptic nucleus. A double immunostaining with neuropeptides known to be involved in the central control of reproduction indicates that -28% kisspeptin neurons and 43% GnRH neurons in the proptic area, and -10% RF RP-3 neurons in the dorso- and ventromedial hypothalamus are activated following beta-NGF injection. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that systemic beta-NGF induces ovulation in the female dromedary camel and indicates that this effect involves the central activation of hypothalamic neurons, notably the kisspeptin neurons.

AB  - The behavioral observation of animals in zoos is indispensable for their health management and the improvement of their breeding environment. However, the day-to-day recording of animal behaviors is time-consuming for zookeepers. Hence, we aim to automatically generate animal behavioral observation reports, called "ethograms", in cooperation with the Sapporo Maruyama Zoo. While studies using contact sensors [e.g., accelerometers, global positioning system (GPS) , and radio frequency identification (RFID)] have had some success in zoos, noncontact sensors (e.g., cameras and microphones) tend to be avoided because of frequent occlusion and the need for nighttime detection. However, noncontact sensors are preferable to contact sensors owing to animal welfare concerns. Here, we propose a method for automatic elephant behavior recognition based on elephant tracking information using video from surveillance cameras. In particular, we focus only on "eating", which is difficult to detect accurately because it requires relatively long-term observation. Therefore, we solve the problem by using a method based on temporal action localization (TAL), which is a task of predicting when and where a target action is performed over a relatively lengthy period. The TAL method has been applied mainly to humans and less to animals. In our experiments, the average precision of eating behavior detection using TAL was 0.853. The results show that TAL is also effective in animal behavior recognition.

AB  - Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.

AB  - Oxidative stress is usually associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of cold-pressed oil (CPO) from black pepper (Piper nigrum) fruits was performed and its neuroprotective effects were evaluated for the first time. The analysis of CPO revealed the presence of the lignan sesamin (39.78%), the alkaloid piperine (33.79%), the monoterpene hydrocarbons 3-carene (9.53%) and limonene (6.23%), and the sesquiterpene beta-caryophyllene (10.67%). Black pepper hydrodistilled oil (HDO) was also comparatively analyzed by GC-MS to show the impact of oil isolation by two different methodologies on their components and class of compounds identified. HDO analysis revealed 35 compounds (99.64% of the total peak areas) mainly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons (77.28%), such as limonene (26.50%), sabinene (21.36%), and beta-pinene (15.53%), and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (20.59%) represented mainly by beta-caryophyllene (19.12%). Due to the low yield obtained for HDO (0.01% v/w), only CPO was chosen for the evaluation of its neuroprotective potential. Alzheimer-type dementia was induced in rats by scopolamine intraperitoneal injection (1.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days. CPO was administered orally (100 mg/kg) for a week before scopolamine administration and then concomitantly for another week. Donepezil (1 mg/kg, orally) was used as a reference drug. CPO administration significantly improved the rat behaviors as evaluated by the Morris water maze test, evident from prolongation in time spent in the platform quadrant (262.9%, compared to scopolamine) and increasing in the crossing time by 18.18% compared to the control group. The rat behavior tested by passive avoidance, showed prolongation in the step-through latency compared to control. Moreover, CPO significantly (p < 0.05) ameliorated the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents by 22.48%, 45.41%, and 86.61%, respectively, compared to scopolamine. Furthermore, CPO administration decreased scopolamine-induced elevated acetylcholinesterase levels in rats' hippocampi by 51.30%. These results were supported by histopathological and in silico molecular docking studies. Black pepper oil may be a potential antioxidant and neuroprotective supplement.

AB  - BackgroundSynaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) exerts protective effects against postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) by promoting PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and repressing caspase-3/gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of SNAP25 protein remain unclear.MethodsWe employed recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-hSyn to knockdown tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) or SNAP25 and investigate the role of TNFAIP1 in POCD. Cognitive performance, hippocampal injury, mitophagy, and pyroptosis were assessed. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and ubiquitination assays were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms by which TNFAIP1 stabilizes SNAP25.ResultsOur results demonstrated that the ubiquitin ligase TNFAIP1 was upregulated in the hippocampus of mice following isoflurane (Iso) anesthesia and laparotomy. The N-terminal region (residues 1-96) of TNFAIP1 formed a conjugate with SNAP25, leading to lysine (K) 48-linked polyubiquitination of SNAP25 at K69. Silencing TNFAIP1 enhanced SH-SY5Y cell viability and conferred antioxidant, pro-mitophagy, and anti-pyroptosis properties in response to Iso and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges. Conversely, TNFAIP1 overexpression reduced HT22 cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, impaired PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and induced caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis by suppressing SNAP25 expression. Neuron-specific knockdown of TNFAIP1 ameliorated POCD, restored mitophagy, and reduced pyroptosis, which was reversed by SNAP25 depletion.ConclusionsIn summary, our findings demonstrated that inhibiting TNFAIP1-mediated degradation of SNAP25 might be a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating postoperative cognitive decline.2d6TEYTUuUajqwtaSq8xEZVideo AbstractConclusionsIn summary, our findings demonstrated that inhibiting TNFAIP1-mediated degradation of SNAP25 might be a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating postoperative cognitive decline.2d6TEYTUuUajqwtaSq8xEZVideo Abstract

AB  - Extreme drought weather has occurred frequently in recent years, resulting in serious yield loss in tea plantations. The study of drought in tea plantations is becoming more and more intensive, but there are fewer studies on drought-resistant measures applied in actual production. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous tea polyphenols on the drought resistance of tea plant by pouring 100 mg<middle dot>L-1 of exogenous tea polyphenols into the root under drought. The exogenous tea polyphenols were able to promote the closure of stomata and reduce water loss from leaves under drought stress. Drought-induced malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in tea leaves and roots was also significantly reduced by exogenous tea polyphenols. Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that exogenous tea polyphenols regulated the abnormal responses of photosynthetic and energy metabolism in leaves under drought conditions and alleviated sphingolipid metabolism, arginine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism in the root system, which enhanced the drought resistance of tea seedlings. Exogenous tea polyphenols induced jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-ILE) accumulation in the root system, and the jasmonic acid-isoleucine synthetase gene (TEA028623), jasmonic acid ZIM structural domain proteins (JAMs) synthesis genes (novel.22237, TEA001821), and the transcription factor MYC2 (TEA014288, TEA005840) were significantly up-regulated. Meanwhile, the flavonoid metabolic flow was significantly altered in the root; for example, the content of EGCG, ECG, and EGC was significantly increased. Thus, exogenous tea polyphenols enhance the drought resistance of tea plants through multiple pathways.

AB  - Hippocampal dysfunction contributes to multiple traumatic brain injury sequala. Female rodents' outcome is superior to male which has been ascribed the neuroprotective sex hormones 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone. Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is an oxidative enzyme influencing the neuroinflammatory response by creating inflammatory mediators and metabolizing neuroprotective 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone. In this study, we aimed to describe hippocampal CYP1B1 mRNA expression, protein presence of CYP1B1 and its key redox partner Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) in both sexes, as well as the effect of penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI). A total 64 adult Sprague Dawley rats divided by sex received pTBI or sham-surgery and were assigned survival times of 1-, 3-, 5- or 7 days. CYP1B1 mRNA was quantified using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry performed to verify protein colocalization. CYP1B1 mRNA expression was present in all subregions but greatest in CA2 irrespective of sex, survival time or intervention. At 3-, 5- and 7 days post-injury, expression in CA2 was reduced in male rats subjected to pTBI compared to sham-surgery. Females subjected to pTBI instead exhibited increased expression in all CA subregions 3 days post-injury, the only time point expression in CA2 was greater in females than in males. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed neuronal CYP1B1 protein in all hippocampal subregions, while CPR was limited to CA1 and CA2. CYP1B1 mRNA is constitutively expressed in both sexes. In response to pTBI, females displayed a more urgent but brief regulatory response than males. This indicates there may be sex-dependent differences in CYP1B1 activity, possibly influencing inflammation and neuroprotection in pTBI.

AB  - Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem and an essential cause of morbidity and mortality during childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the apoptotic effects of MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on hippocampal damage in 10-day-old rat pups exposed to contusion injury.Methods Forty-two Wistar Albino rats were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 14 per group): control, trauma and MK-801 treatment. In the treatment group, MK-801 was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg/kg immediately after induction of TBI. Apoptotic damage in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions was assessed using immunoreactivity for BAX, cytochrome c and caspase-3.Results The control group showed low levels of BAX and cytochrome c immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, whereas the TBI group exhibited markedly increased reactions. Cytochrome c immunoreactivity appeared in a granular pattern within neurons of the DG region. In the MK-801 treatment group, both BAX and cytochrome c immunoreactivities were reduced compared to the TBI group. While only weak caspase-3 immunoreactivity was observed in the control group, intense immunoreactivity was detected in both the DG and CA1 regions of the hippocampus in the TBI group. In contrast, caspase-3 immunoreactivity was notably reduced in the MK-801 group compared to the TBI group.Conclusion This study demonstrated that treatment with MK-801 significantly reduces apoptosis in the hippocampus by downregulating key pro-apoptotic markers, including BAX, cytochrome c and caspase-3. These findings suggest that MK-801 exerts a neuroprotective effect by interfering with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway following TBI.

AB  - Background: Plants' raw materials can accumulate chemical elements, including radioisotopes, to some extent and reflect the region they grow in. Due to their high environmental content and toxicity, natural radionuclides - polonium 210 Po and lead 210 Pb are the most dangerous radioisotopes for human health. Methods: 70 raw medicinal herbal materials from 54 popular wild -growing medicinal plant species, most of them included in the European Pharmacopoeia, were collected across three regions. In 210 samples, the activity concentrations of 210 Po and 210 Pb were determined, and their radiotoxicity and cancer risk were calculated. Results: The results of 210 Po and 210 Pb activities measured in herbal raw material were from 0.12 mBq g -1 dry weight in the fruits of the common chestnut ( Aesculus hippocastanum ) to 19.7 mBq g -1 dw in herb of ground elder ( Aegopodium podagraria ) for 210 Po, while for 210 Pb ranged from 0.16 mBq g -1 dw to 34.3 mBq g -1 dw in the same plants. There were statistically significant differences between 210 Po and 210 Pb content in leaves, herbs, flowers, and fruit. The studies indicated that the estimated annual effective radiation dose from Polish medicinal herbs consumption was low, ranging 0.03-105 mu Sv from 210 Po and 0.02-98.2 mu Sv from 210 Pb, while the risk of cancer morbidity and mortality ranged from 10 -5 to 10 -9 . Conclusions: Consumption of the tested medicinal herbs is safe from the radiological point of view and, based on the predictions related to the calculated risk of cancer, should not increase the probability of its occurrence.

AB  - Background/Objectives: A concussive head injury increases the likelihood of temporal lobe epilepsy through mechanisms that are not entirely understood. This study aimed to investigate how two key histopathological features shared by both TLE (temporal lobe epilepsy) and head injury-mossy fiber sprouting and hilar excitatory cell loss-contribute to the modulation of dentate gyrus excitability. Methods: A computational approach was used to explore the impact of specific levels of mossy fiber sprouting and mossy cell loss, while avoiding the confounding effects of concurrent changes. The dentate gyrus model consists of 500 granule cells, 15 mossy cells, 6 basket cells and 6 hilar perforant path-associated cells. Results: My simulations demonstrate a correlation between the degree of mossy fiber sprouting and the number of spikes in dentate gyrus granule cells (correlations coefficient R = 0.95, p < 0.0001) and other cells (correlations coefficient R = 0.99, p < 0.0001). The mean values (standard deviation, SD) and 95% CI for granule cell activity in the control group and percentage 10-50% of mossy fiber sprouting groups are 376.4 (16.7) (95% CI, 374.9-377.8) vs. 463.5 (24.3) (95% CI, 461.4-465.6) vs. 514.8 (32.5) (95% CI, 511.9-517.6) vs. 555.0 (40.4) (95% CI, 551.5-558.6) vs. 633.4 (51.8) (95% CI, 628.8-637.9) vs. 701.7 (66.2) (95% CI, 695.9-707.5). The increase in mossy fiber sprouting was significantly statistically associated with an increase in granule cell activity (p < 0.01). The removal of mossy cells led to a reduction in excitability within the model network (for granule cells, correlations coefficient R = -0.40, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: These results are generally consistent with experimental observations, which indicate a high degree of mossy fiber sprouting in animals with a higher frequency of seizures. Whereas unlike the strong hyperexcitability effects induced by mossy fiber sprouting, the removal of mossy cells led to reduced granule cell responses to perforant path activation.

AB  - Caffeine is a psychostimulant substance that is mostly used to prevent fatigue, increase alertness, and ameliorate sleep loss situations. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of chronic caffeine consumption on learning and memory functions and related genes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-deprived rats. During the neonatal period (postnatal day [PND] 28) Wistar albino male rats (n = 32) were randomly assigned into four groups: Control (C), caffeine application (Cf), acute REM sleep-deprivation (RD), and caffeine application + acute RD (Cf + RD). The 48 h of RD was executed when caffeine administration was completed. The learning and memory performance was evaluated by the Morris water maze test (MWMT). Following this, the rats were decapitated to isolate hippocampus tissues. In MWMT, time spent in the targeted quadrant decreased significantly in the RD group compared with the C and Cf + RD group. NR2A expression level increased in the RD group compared with C, Cf, and Cf + RD groups (p < 0.05). NR2B expression level increased in RD and Cf + RD groups compared with C and Cf groups (p < 0.05). BDNF and c-Fos expression levels did not differ significantly between the groups. RD impaired hippocampal spatial memory performance in the MWMT test. Our results indicated that chronic caffeine consumption has a therapeutic effect on spatial memory deterioration impairment caused by RD. Furthermore, it seems that the effect of caffeine RD on the hippocampus may be mediated by NR2A.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of hypergravity (HG) on a neurodegenerative model in vitro, looking at how HG influences Tau protein aggregation in Mouse Hippocampal Neuronal Cells (HT22) induced by neurofibrillary tangle seeds. Overall, 50x g significantly, synergistically, reduced the Tau aggregate Area when combined with ERK-inhibitor PD-0325901, correlating with decreased phosphorylation at critical residues pS262 and pS396. These findings suggest HG treatments may help mitigate cytoskeletal damage linked to Tau aggregation.

AB  - Melanoma is a highly metastatic disease with an increasing rate of incidence worldwide. It is treatment refractory and has poor clinical prognosis; therefore, the development of new therapeutic agents for metastatic melanoma are urgently required. In this study, we created a lung-seeking A375LM5(IF4g/Luc) BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cell clone and investigated the bioefficacy of a plant sesquiterpene lactone deoxyelephantopin (DET) and its novel semi-synthetic derivative, DETD-35, in suppressing metastatic A375LM5(IF4g/Luc) melanoma growth in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. DET and DETD-35 treatment inhibited A375LM5(IF4g/Luc) cell proliferation, and induced G(2)/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, A375LM5(IF4g/Luc) exhibited clonogenic, metastatic and invasive abilities, and several A375LM5(IF4g/Luc) metastasis markers, N-cadherin, MMP2, vimentin and integrin alpha 4 were significantly suppressed by treatment with either compound. Interestingly, DET- and DETD-35-induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion were found to be upstream events important for the in vitro activities, because exogenous GSH supplementation blunted DET and DETD-35 effects on A375LM5(IF4g/Luc) cells. DET and DETD-35 also induced mitochondrial DNA mutation, superoxide production, mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction, and mitochondrial protein deregulation. Most importantly, DET and DETD-35 inhibited lung metastasis of A375LM5(IF4g/Luc) in NOD/SCID mice through inhibiting pulmonary vascular permeability and melanoma cell (Mel-A+) proliferation, angiogenesis (VEGF+, CD31+) and EMT (N-cadherin) in the tumor microenvironment in the lungs. These findings indicate that DET and DETD-35 may be useful in the intervention of lung metastatic BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma.

AB  - Camel milk (CM) has acquired substantial consideration in contemporary years owing to its potential prospective pharmaceutical benefits besides nutritional properties. As, CM retain inimitable composition and attain sophisticated concentration of bioactive compounds, thus helps in regulation of blood glucose level, and improves insulin sensitivity. Contemporary study intends to explore anti-diabetic inflictions of CM, besides body weight, blood profile, antioxidant defense and organ integrity in diabetic rabbits. To achieve this, a total of 36 rabbits was randomly alienated into six equal groups (N = 6), such as control, control + camel milk, diabetic control, insulin treated, camel milk treated, and CM + insulin. Diabetes was induced by injecting STZ (50-mg/kg). The diabetic rabbits were treated either with CM (100 ml/rabbit/day), or insulin (6 unit/kg/day) and their combination (CM-30 ml + insulin 3-unit/day) for 42 days. Body weight, blood glucose level and hematological indices were measured weekly. Reduced body weight, elevated blood glucose level and altered hematological indices were noticed in diabetes induced rabbits. On the contrary, improved weight gain, glycemic level, anti-oxidant defense and blood chemistry were noticed in groups treated with camel milk individually and insulin; conversely, non-significant changes were seen in CM + insulin treated group. Diabetic control group revealed gross-pathological changes in liver, kidney, intestine and pancreas. CM and insulin augmented organ integrity and stability. Convincingly, these outcomes strongly indicate therapeutic potential of CM that regulated hyperglycemic condition and mitigated the negative impact of diabetes in organ histomorphology.

AB  - Alcohol consumption is spread worldwide and can lead to an abuse profile associated with severe health problems. Adolescents are more susceptible to addiction and usually consume ethanol in a binge drinking pattern. This form of consumption can lead to cognitive and emotional disorders, however scarce studies have focused on long-term hazardous effects following withdrawal periods after binge drinking in adolescents. Thus, the present study aims at investigating whether behavioral and cognitive changes persist until mid and late adulthood. Female Wistar rats (9-10 animals/group) received intragastric administration of four cycles of ethanol binge-like pattern (3.0 g/kg/day, 20% w/v; 3 days-on/4 days-off) from 35(th) to 58(th) days old, followed withdrawal checkpoints 1 day, 30 days, and 60 days. At each checkpoint period, behavioral tests of open field, object recognition test, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming test were performed, and blood and hippocampus were collected for oxidative biochemistry and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels analysis, respectively. The results demonstrated that adolescent rats exposed to binge drinking displayed anxiogenic- and depressive-like phenotype in early and midadulthood, however, anxiety-like profile persisted until late adulthood. Similarly, short-term memory was impaired in all withdrawal periods analysed, including late adult life. These behavioral data were associated with oxidative damage in midadulthood but not BDNF alterations. Taken together, the present work highlights the long-lasting emotional and cognitive alterations induced by ethanol binge drinking during adolescence, even after a long period of abstinence, which might impact adult life.

AB  - Non-thermal plasma, a partially ionized gas, holds significant potential for clinical applications, including wound-healing support, oral therapies, and anti-tumour treatments. While its applications showed promising outcomes, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We thus apply non-thermal plasma to mouse auricular skin and conducted non-coding RNA sequencing, as well as single-cell blood sequencing. In a time-series analysis (five timepoints spanning 2 hours), we compare the expression of microRNAs in the plasma-treated left ears to the unexposed right ears of the same mice as well as to the ears of unexposed control mice. Our findings indicate specific effects in the treated ears for a set of five miRNAs: mmu-miR-144-5p, mmu-miR-144-3p, mmu-miR-142a-5p, mmu-miR-223-3p, and mmu-miR-451a. Interestingly, mmu-miR-223-3p also exhibits an increase over time in the right non-treated ear of the exposed mice, suggesting systemic effects. Notably, this miRNA, along with mmu-miR-142a-5p and mmu-miR-144-3p, regulates genes and pathways associated with wound healing and tissue regeneration (namely ErbB, FoxO, Hippo, and PI3K-Akt signalling). This co-regulation is particularly remarkable considering the significant seed dissimilarities among the miRNAs. Finally, single-cell sequencing of PBMCs reveals the downregulation of 12 from 15 target genes in B-cells, Cd4+ and Cd8+ T-cells. Collectively, our data provide evidence for a systemic effect of non-thermal plasma.

AB  - Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is involved in the pathogenesis of acne by inducing inflammation and biofilm formation, along with other virulence factors. A Camellia sinensis (C. sinensis) callus lysate is proposed to reduce these effects. The aim of the present work is to study the anti-inflammatory properties of a callus extract from C. sinensis on C. acnes-stimulated human keratinocytes and the quorum-quenching activities. Keratinocytes were stimulated with thermo-inactivated pathogenic C. acnes and were treated with the herbal lysate (0.25% w/w) to evaluate its anti-inflammatory effect. C. acnes biofilm was developed in vitro and treated with 2.5 and 5% w/w of the lysate to evaluate quorum sensing and the lipase activity. The results showed that the lysate was able to reduce the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), and decrease the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B). The lysate did not show bactericidal activity but showed diminished biofilm formation, the lipase activity, and the production of autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a member of a family of signaling molecules used in quorum sensing. Therefore, the proposed callus lysate could have the potential to reduce acne-related symptoms without the eradication of C. acnes, which is part of the natural skin microbiome.

AB  - According to experimental and clinical studies, status epilepticus (SE) causes neurodegenerative morphological changes not only in the hippocampus and other limbic structures, it also affects the thalamus and the neocortex. In addition, several studies reported atrophy, metabolic changes, and neuronal degeneration in the dorsal striatum. The literature lacks studies investigating potential neuronal damage in the ventral component of the striatopallidal complex (ventral striatum [VS] and ventral pallidum) in SE experimentations. To better understand the development of neuronal damage in the striatopallidal complex associated with SE, the detected neuronal degeneration in the compartments of the VS, namely, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the olfactory tubercle (OT), was analyzed. The experiments were performed on Wistar rats at age of 25-day-old pups and 3-month-old adult animals. Lithium-pilocarpine model of SE was used. Lithium chloride (3 mmol/kg, ip) was injected 24 h before administering pilocarpine (40 mg/kg, ip). This presented study demonstrates the variability of post SE neuronal damage in 25-day-old pups in comparison with 3-month-old adult rats. The NAc exhibited small to moderate number of Fluoro-Jade B (FJB)-positive neurons detected 4 and 8 h post SE intervals. The number of degenerated neurons in the shell subdivision of the NAc significantly increased at survival interval of 12 h after the SE. FJB-positive neurons were evidently more prominent occupying the whole anteroposterior and mediolateral extent of the nucleus at longer survival intervals of 24 and 48 h after the SE. This was also the case in the bordering vicinity between the shell and the core compartments but with clusters of degenerating cells. The severity of damage of the shell subdivision of the NAc reached its peak at an interval of 24 h post SE. Isolated FJB-positive neurons were detected in the ventral peripheral part of the core compartment. Degenerated neurons persisted in the shell subdivision of the NAc 1 week after SE. However, the quantity of cell damage had significantly reduced in comparison with the aforementioned shorter intervals. The third layer of the OT exhibited more degenerated neurons than the second layer. The FJB-positive cells in the young animals were higher than in the adult animals. The morphology of those cells was identical in the two age groups except in the OT.
   The ventral striatum is compromised in lithium pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in immature Wistar rat's brain. Sixty experimental animals (30 pups-25 days old, 30 adults-3 months old) were provoked with status epilepticus and grouped into six survival intervals of 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h and 1 week. The severity of the neuronal damage within the affected compartments increased with increased survival intervals and was age dependent. This was assessed by quantifying Fluoro-Jade B positive neurons and by measuring their long-axis diameter with comparison between age and survival interval groups. image

AB  - During nasal polyp (NP) development, activated T cells differentiate into T helper (Th) 1, Th2, and Th17 cells. Additionally, regulatory T cells (Tregs) that have an immune suppressive function are involved in the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with NP (CRSwNP). Tregs can act as effector cells that produce inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17A. We sought to identify the cellular expression of IL-17A and Treg markers in sinonasal tissue from CRSwNP patients and to investigate whether Tregs are involved in IL-17A secretion. The uncinate process (UP) and NP tissues were harvested from patients with CRSwNP, CRS without NP (CRSsNP), and normal controls. Expression of IL-17A and Foxp3 in each group was observed with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Expression of IL-17A in Treg was evaluated by flow cytometry of single cells isolated from sinonasal tissues. UP tissue from controls (n = 17), UP from CRSsNP (n = 24), and UP (n = 19) and NP (n = 29) from CRSwNP were obtained. The percentage of Foxp3+ cells was higher in CRS tissues compared with normal controls. IL-17A+ cells were most increased in NP tissues from CRSwNP patients. Expression of IL-17A in some Foxp3+ cells was observed in double immunofluorescence. Foxp3+ cells, IL-17A+ cells, and Foxp3+IL-17A+ cells were increased in the UP and NP tissues from CRSwNP patients. CD45RA-Foxp3+ cells were increased in CRSwNP, and IL-17A+ cells were observed most frequently in CD4+CD45RA-Foxp3+ cells from NP tissues. These findings show that CD4+CD45RA-Foxp3+ Tregs are involved in NP pathogenesis by producing IL-17A.

AB  - Selecting an optimal antigen is a crucial step in vaccine development, significantly influencing both the vaccine's effectiveness and the breadth of protection it provides. High antigen sequence variability, as seen in pathogens like rhinovirus, HIV, influenza virus, complicates the design of a single cross-protective antigen. Consequently, vaccination with a single antigen molecule often confers protection against only a single variant. In this study, machine learning methods were applied to the design of factor H binding protein (fHbp), an antigen from the bacterial pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. The vast number of potential antigen mutants presents a significant challenge for improving fHbp antigenicity. Moreover, limited data on antigen-antibody binding in public databases constrains the training of machine learning models. To address these challenges, we used computational models to predict fHbp properties and machine learning was applied to select both the most promising and informative mutants using a Gaussian process (GP) model. These mutants were experimentally evaluated to both confirm promising leads and refine the machine learning model for future iterations. In our current model, mutants were designed that enabled the transfer of fHbp v1.1 specific conformational epitopes onto fHbp v3.28, while maintaining binding to overlapping cross-reactive epitopes. The top mutant identified underwent biophysical and x-ray crystallographic characterization to confirm that the overall structure of fHbp was maintained throughout this epitope engineering experiment. The integrated strategy presented here could form the basis of a next-generation, iterative antigen design platform, potentially accelerating the development of new broadly protective vaccines.

AB  - The fresh leaves were processed into beauty tea from the Camellia sinensis "Jinxuan" cultivar, which were punctured by tea green leafhoppers to different extents. Low-puncturing dry tea (LPDT) exhibited a superior quality. Altogether, 101 and 129 differential metabolites, including tea polyphenols, lipids, and saccharides, were identified from the fresh leaves and dry beauty tea, respectively. Most metabolite levels increased in the fresh leaves punctured by leafhoppers, but the opposite was observed for the dry beauty tea. According to relative odor activity values (rOAVs) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), four characteristic volatiles, including linalool, geraniol, benzeneacetaldehyde, and dihydrolinalool, were selected. Mechanical injury to leaves caused by leafhoppers, watery saliva secreted by the leafhopper, and different water contents of the fresh leaves in different puncturing degrees are the possible reasons for the difference in the quality of the beauty tea with different levels of puncturing.

AB  - Cytochrome c is a critical protein in energy metabolism, and its structural adaptations to different temperatures play a key role in enabling species like the wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus) and the Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) to thrive in their respective cold and hot environments. This study investigates the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties of cytochrome c at different temperatures. Thermal Titration Molecular Dynamics (TTMD) simulations, which involve analyzing protein behaviour across a range of temperatures, were carried out using GROMACS, with each simulation running for 100 nanoseconds, at 245 K, 280 K, 303 K, 308 K, and 320 K, to evaluate stability and flexibility. Structural alterations were indicated by an increase in root mean square deviations (RMSDs) to 0.4 nm at 320 K, as opposed to lower RMSD values (0.1-0.2 nm) at 245 K and 280 K. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analyses revealed modest flexibility at 245 K and 280 K (0.1-0.2 nm) but considerable flexibility (0.3-0.4 nm) at 303 K and 320 K. Principal component analysis (PCA) found that the formational space was constrained at lower temperatures but expanded at higher temperatures. Entropy peaked at 280 K (13,816 J/mol) and then fell substantially at 320 K (451.765 J/mol), indicating diminished stability. These findings highlight cytochrome c adaptations for cold stability in Camelus ferus and thermal resilience in Camelus dromedarius, showing evolutionary strategies for harsh conditions.

AB  - Chronic heavy alcohol consumption is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and often leads to premature aging; however, the mechanisms of alcohol-associated cellular aging are not well understood. In this study, we used DNA methylation derived telomere length (DNAmTL) as a novel approach to investigate the role of alcohol use on the aging process. DNAmTL was estimated by 140 cytosine phosphate guanines (CpG) sites in 372 individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and 243 healthy controls (HC) and assessed using various endophenotypes and clinical biomarkers. Validation in an independent sample of DNAmTL on alcohol consumption was performed (N = 4219). Exploratory genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on DNAmTL were also performed to identify genetic variants contributing to DNAmTL shortening. Top GWAS findings were analyzed using in-silico expression quantitative trait loci analyses and related to structural MRI hippocampus volumes of individuals with AUD. DNAmTL was 0.11-kilobases shorter per year in AUD compared to HC after adjustment for age, sex, race, and blood cell composition (p = 4.0 x 10(-12)). This association was partially attenuated but remained significant after additionally adjusting for BMI, and smoking status (0.06 kilobases shorter per year, p = 0.002). DNAmTL shortening was strongly associated with chronic heavy alcohol use (ps < 0.001), elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (ps < 0.004). Comparison of DNAmTL with PCR-based methods of assessing TL revealed positive correlations (R = 0.3, p = 2.2 x 10(-5)), highlighting the accuracy of DNAmTL as a biomarker. The GWAS meta-analysis identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4374022 and 18 imputed ones in Thymocyte Expressed, Positive Selection Associated 1(TESPA1), at the genome-wide level (p = 3.75 x 10(-8)). The allele C of rs4374022 was associated with DNAmTL shortening, lower hippocampus volume (p < 0.01), and decreased mRNA expression in hippocampus tissue (p = 0.04). Our study demonstrates DNAmTL-related aging acceleration in AUD and suggests a functional role for TESPA1 in regulating DNAmTL length, possibly via the immune system with subsequent biological effects on brain regions negatively affected by alcohol and implicated in aging.

AB  - Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter that plays a major role in many aspects of neuroscience. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry measures fast in vivo serotonin dynamics using carbon fiber microelectrodes. More recently, fast-scan controlled-adsorption voltammetry (FSCAV) has been developed to measure slower, minute-to-minute changes in ambient extracellular serotonin. We have previously demonstrated that FSCAV measurements of basal serotonin levels give critical information regarding brain physiology and disease. In this work, we revealed the presence of low-periodicity fluctuations in serotonin levels in mouse hippocampi, measured in vivo with FSCAV. Using correlation analyses, we found robust evidence of oscillations in the basal serotonin levels, which had a period of 10 min and were not present in vitro. Under control conditions, the oscillations did not differ between male and female mice, nor do they differ between mice that underwent a chronic stress paradigm and those in the control group. After the acute administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, we observed a shift in the frequency of the oscillations, leading us to hypothesize that the newly observed fluctuations were transporter regulated. Finally, we optimized the experimental parameters of the FSCAV to measure at a higher temporal resolution and found more pronounced shifts in the oscillation frequency, along with a decreased oscillation amplitude. We postulate that this work may serve as a potential bridge for studying serotonin/endocrine interactions that occur on the same time scale.

AB  - At present, surgery is one of the main treatments for bone tumor. However, the risk of recurrence and the large area of bone defects after surgery pose a great challenge. Therefore, a Janus-inspired core-shell structure bone scaffold was designed to achieve the self-programmed release of melatonin at different concentrations, clearing the residual tumor cells at early stage after resection and promoting bone repair later. The layered differential load designs inspired by Janus laid the foundation for the differential release of melatonin, where sufficient melatonin inhibited tumor growth as low dose promoted osteogenesis. Then, the automatically programmed delivery of melatonin is achieved by the gradient degradation of the core-shell structure. In the material characterization, scanning electron microscopy revealed the core-shell structure. The drug release experiment and in vivo degradation experiment reflected the programmed differential release of melatonin. In the biological experiment part, in vivo and in vitro experiments not only confirmed the significant inhibitory effect of the core-shell hydrogel scaffold on tumor but also confirmed its positive effect on osteogenesis. Our Janus-inspired core-shell hydrogel scaffold provides a safe and efficient means to inhibit tumor recurrence and bone repair after bone tumor, and it also develops a new and efficient tool for differential and programmed release of other drugs.

AB  - Hippocampal seizures mimicking mesial temporal lobe epilepsy cause a profound disruption of the adult neurogenic niche in mice. Seizures provoke neural stem cells to switch to a reactive phenotype (reactive neural stem cells, React-NSCs) characterized by multibranched hypertrophic morphology, massive activation to enter mitosis, symmetric division, and final differentiation into reactive astrocytes. As a result, neurogenesis is chronically impaired. Here, using a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, we show that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is key for the induction of React-NSCs and that its inhibition exerts a beneficial effect on the neurogenic niche. We show that during the initial days after the induction of seizures by a single intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid, a strong release of zinc and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, both activators of the EGFR signaling pathway in neural stem cells, is produced. Administration of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, a chemotherapeutic in clinical phase IV, prevents the induction of React-NSCs and preserves neurogenesis.

AB  - Gintonin is a kind of ginseng-derived glycolipoprotein that acts as an exogenous LPA receptor ligand. Gintonin has in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective effects; however, little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection. In the present study, we aimed to clarify how gintonin attenuates iodoacetic acid (IAA)-induced oxidative stress. The mouse hippocampal cell line HT22 was used. Gintonin treatment significantly attenuated IAA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, ATP depletion, and cell death. However, treatment with Ki16425, an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist, suppressed the neuroprotective effects of gintonin. Gintonin elicited [Ca-2](i) transients in HT22 cells. Gintonin-mediated [Ca-2](i) transients through the LPA1 receptor-PLC-IP3 signaling pathway were coupled to increase both the expression and release of BDNF. The released BDNF activated the TrkB receptor. Induction of TrkB phosphorylation was further linked to Akt activation. Phosphorylated Akt reduced IAA-induced oxidative stress and increased cell survival. Our results indicate that gintonin attenuated IAA-induced oxidative stress in neuronal cells by activating the LPA1 receptor-BDNF-TrkB-Akt signaling pathway. One of the gintonin-mediated neuroprotective effects may be achieved via anti-oxidative stress in nervous systems.

AB  - Animals can learn to repeat behaviors to earn desired rewards, a process commonly known as reinforcement learning. While previous work has implicated the ascending dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning, little is known about the role of the hippocampus. Here, we report that a specific population of hippocampal neurons and their dopaminergic innervation contribute to operant self-stimulation. These neurons are located in the dentate gyrus, receive dopaminergic projections from the locus coeruleus, and express D1 dopamine receptors. Activation of D1 + dentate neurons is sufficient for self-stimulation: mice will press a lever to earn optogenetic activation of these neurons. A similar effect is also observed with selective activation of the locus coeruleus projections to the dentate gyrus, and blocked by D1 receptor antagonism. Calcium imaging of D1 + dentate neurons revealed significant activity at the time of action selection, but not during passive reward delivery. These results reveal the role of dopaminergic innervation of the dentate gyrus in supporting operant reinforcement.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), one common type of medically refractory epilepsy, is accompanied with altered adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs). However, the causal role of abDGCs in recurrent seizures of TLE is not fully understood. Here, taking advantage of optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to selectively manipulate abDGCs in a reversible manner, combined with Ca2+ fiber photometry, trans-synaptic viral tracing, in vivo/vitro electrophysiology approaches, we aimed to test the role of abDGCs born at different period of epileptogenic insult in later recurrent seizures in mouse TLE models. We found that abDGCs were functionally inhibited during recurrent seizures. Optogenetic activation of abDGCs significantly extended, while inhibition curtailed, the seizure duration. This seizure-modulating effect was attributed to specific abDGCs born at a critical early phase after kindled status, which experienced specific type of circuit re-organization. Further, abDGCs extended seizure duration via local excitatory circuit with early-born granule cells (ebDGCs). Repeated modulation of "abDGC-ebDGC" circuit may easily induce a change of synaptic plasticity, and achieve long-term anti-seizure effects in both kindling and kainic acid-induced TLE models. Together, we demonstrate that abDGCs born at a critical period of epileptogenic insult maintain seizure duration via local aberrant excitatory circuits, and inactivation of these aberrant circuits can long-termly alleviate severity of seizures. This provides a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the potential pathological changes of abDGCs circuit and may be helpful for the precise treatment in TLE.

AB  - Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP) affects the quality of life of patients suffering from it. The search for a suitable biomarker has been conducted over the last decades. Interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5R & alpha;) involves the activation, maintenance, and survival of eosinophils, which are highly tied to chronic inflammatory processes of the airways, like asthma or CRSwNP. In this study, we evaluate the utility of IL5RA as a genetic biomarker in CRSwNP. IL5RA mRNA expression level was analyzed in different groups of patients by performing qPCR assays. A significant increase in IL5RA expression was observed in CRSwNP patients, especially those with asthma and atopy. We found differences in expression levels when comparing groups with or without polyposis or asthma, as well as some atypical cases related to eosinophil levels. That opens a path to future studies to further characterize groups of patients with common features in the context of pharmacogenetics and in an era towards developing a more precise personalized treatment with IL-5R & alpha; as a therapeutic target for CRSwNP.

AB  - Neuronal hyperexcitation affects memory and neural processing across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive continuum. Levetiracetam, an antiepileptic, shows promise in improving cognitive impairment by restoring the neural excitation/inhibition balance in AD patients. We previously identified a hyper-excitable phenotype in cognitively unimpaired female APOE-epsilon 4 carriers relative to male counterparts cross-sectionally. This sex difference lacks longitudinal validation; however, clarifying the vulnerability of female epsilon 4-carriers could better inform antiepileptic treatment efficacy. Here, we investigated this sex-by-epsilon 4 interaction using a longitudinal design. We used resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging collected longitudinally from 106 participants who were cognitively unimpaired for at least one scan event but may have been assessed to have clinical dementia ratings corresponding to early mild cognitive impairment over time. By including scan events where participants transitioned to mild cognitive impairment, we modeled the trajectory of the whole-brain excitation-inhibition ratio throughout the preclinical cognitively healthy continuum and extended to early impairment. A linear mixed model revealed a significant three-way interaction among sex, epsilon 4-status, and time, with female epsilon 4-carriers showing a significant hyper-excitable trajectory. These findings suggest a possible pathway for preventative therapy targeting preclinical hyperexcitation in female epsilon 4-carriers.

AB  - Thalidomide (TAL) has shown potential therapeutic effects in neurological diseases like epilepsy. Both clinical and preclinical studies show that TAL may act as an antiepileptic drug and as a possible treatment against disease development. However, the evidence for these effects is limited. Therefore, the antiepileptogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of TAL were evaluated herein. Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly allocated to one of five groups (n = 18 per group): control (C); status epilepticus (SE); SE-TAL (25 mg/kg); SE-TAL (50 mg/kg); and SE-topiramate (TOP; 60mg/kg). The lithium-pilocarpine model was used, and one day after SE induction the rats received pharmacological treatment for one week. The brain was obtained, and the hippocampus was micro-dissected 8, 18, and 28 days after SE. TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta concentrations were quantified. TOP and TAL (50 mg/kg) increased the latency to the first of many spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and decreased SRS frequency, as well as decreasing TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta concentrations in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the results showed that both TAL (50 mg/kg) and TOP have anti-ictogenic and antiepileptogenic effects, possibly by decreasing neuroinflammation.

AB  - It is now well established that aging is associated with emotional and cognitive changes. Although the basis of such changes is not fully understood, ultrastructural alterations in key brain areas are likely contributing factors. Recently, we reported that aging-related anxiety in male Wistar rats is associated with ultrastructural changes in the central nucleus of amygdala, an area that plays important role in emotional regulation. In this study, we evaluated the cognitive performance of adolescent, adult, and aged male Wistar rats in multi-branch maze (MBM) as well as in Morris water maze (MWM). We also performed ultrastructural analysis of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, an area intimately involved in cognitive function. The behavioral data indicate significant impairments in few indices of cognitive functions in both tests in aged rats compared to the other two age groups. Concomitantly, a total number of presynaptic vesicles as well as vesicles in the resting pool were significantly lower, whereas postsynaptic mitochondrial area was significantly higher in aged rats compared to the other age groups. No significant differences in presynaptic terminal area or postsynaptic mitochondrial number were detected between the three age groups. These results indicate that selective ultrastructural changes in specific hippocampal region may accompany cognitive decline in aging rats.

AB  - Ischemic stroke caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain may produce a sequence of cascade reactions, leading to oxidative stress and ultimately inducing nerve cell damage. Therefore, hybrid molecules with multiple therapeutic effects have irreplaceable advantages for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Based on the previous works, two types of Scutellarein and Tertramethylpyrazine hybrid molecules were designed and synthesized according to the PepT 1-based design. After systematic research, all synthesized hybrid molecules exhibited more excellent neuroprotective effect and antiplatelet activity compared to the original drugs. Among them, the selected compound 1e with superior neuroprotective and antiplatelet effects could significantly enhance the permeability on the Caco-2 monolayer membrane and inhibit the Gly-Sar uptake on Caco-2 cells. Meanwhile, the result of intestinal perfusion has also confirmed that the absorption of the selected compound 1e is indeed increased. Further, the selected compound 1e significantly reduce the cerebral infarction volume of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion rats. Especially, the cerebral infarction volume of the high-dose 1e group reduced to one fourth of the model group. Meanwhile, results of hematoxylin-eosin staining also indicated that the damage in the hippocampus CA1 region was significantly alleviated after treatment with the compound 1e. Accordingly, molecular hybridization strategy is one of the simple and feasible ways to improve the therapeutic effect of single targeted drug.

AB  - The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed in several brain locations encompassing the hypothalamus and the brainstem, where the receptor controls several body functions, including metabolism. In a well-defined pathway to decrease appetite, hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons localized in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) project to MC4R neurons in the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) to release the natural MC4R agonist alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). Arc neurons also project excitatory glutamatergic fibers to the MC4R neurons in the PVN for a fast synaptic transmission to regulate a satiety pathway potentiated by alpha-MSH. By using super-resolution microscopy, we found that in hypothalamic neurons in a primary culture, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) colocalizes with GluN1, a subunit of the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Thus, hypothalamic neurons form excitatory postsynaptic specializations. To study the MC4R distribution at these sites, tagged HA-MC4R under the synapsin promoter was expressed in neurons by adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transduction. HA-MC4R immunofluorescence peaked at the center and in proximity to the PSD95- and NMDAR-expressing sites. These data provide morphological evidence that MC4R localizes together with glutamate receptors at postsynaptic and peri-postsynaptic sites.

AB  - The proteasome plays key roles in synaptic plasticity and memory by regulating protein turnover, quality control, and elimination of oxidized/misfolded proteins. Here, we investigate proteasome function and localization at synapses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) post-mortem brain tissue and in experimental models. We found a marked increase in ubiquitinylated proteins in post-mortem AD hippocampi compared to controls. Using several experimental models, we show that amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta Os) inhibit synaptic proteasome activity and trigger a reduction in synaptic proteasome content. We further show proteasome inhibition specifically in hippocampal synaptic fractions derived from APPswePS1 Delta E9 mice. Reduced synaptic proteasome activity instigated by A beta Os is corrected by treatment with rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, in mice. Results further show that dynein inhibition blocks A beta O-induced reduction in dendritic proteasome content in hippocampal neurons. Finally, proteasome inhibition induces AD-like pathological features, including reactive oxygen species and dendritic spine loss in hippocampal neurons, inhibition of hippocampal mRNA translation, and memory impairment in mice. Results suggest that proteasome inhibition may contribute to synaptic and memory deficits in AD.
   A study involving several research models suggests that the function and synaptic localization of proteasomes, intracellular machineries involved in protein degradation, are impaired in the brains affected by Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Neuroprotection from oxidative stress is critical during neuronal development and maintenance but also plays a major role in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of various neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence in the murine system suggests neuroprotective effects of blood plasma on the aged or diseased brain. However, little is known about plasma-mediated effects on human neurons. In the present study, we demonstrate the neuroprotective effect mediated by human plasma and the most abundant plasma-protein human serum albumin against oxidative stress in glutamatergic neurons differentiated from human neural crest-derived inferior turbinate stem cells. We observed a strong neuroprotective effect of human plasma and human serum albumin against oxidative stress-induced neuronal death on the single cell level, similar to the one mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Moreover, we detected neuroprotection of plasma and human serum albumin against kainic acid-induced excitatory stress in ex vivo cultured mouse hippocampal tissue slices. The present study provides deeper insights into plasma-mediated neuroprotection ultimately resulting in the development of novel therapies for a variety of neurological and, in particular, neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background The poor prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is often attributed to neuroinflammation. The cGAS-STING axis, a cytoplasmic pathway responsible for detecting dsDNA, plays a significant role in mediating neuroinflammation in neurological diseases. However, the effects of inhibiting cGAS with the selective small molecule inhibitor RU.521 on brain injury and the underlying mechanisms after SAH are still unclear.Methods The expression and microglial localization of cGAS following SAH were investigated with western blot analysis and immunofluorescent double-staining, respectively. RU.521 was administered after SAH. 2'3'-cGAMP, a second messenger converted by activated cGAS, was used to activate cGAS-STING. The assessments were carried out by adopting various techniques including neurological function scores, brain water content, blood-brain barrier permeability, western blot analysis, TUNEL staining, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, morphological analysis, Morris water maze test, Golgi staining, CCK8, flow cytometry in the in vivo and in vitro settings.Results Following SAH, there was an observed increase in the expression levels of cGAS in rat brain tissue, with peak levels observed at 24 h post-SAH. RU.521 resulted in a reduction of brain water content and blood-brain barrier permeability, leading to an improvement in neurological deficits after SAH. RU.521 had beneficial effects on neuronal apoptosis and microglia activation, as well as improvements in microglial morphology. Additionally, RU.521 prompted a shift in microglial phenotype from M1 to M2. We also noted a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, and an increase in the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Finally, RU.521 treatment was associated with improvements in cognitive function and an increase in the number of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. The therapeutic effects were mediated by the cGAS/STING/NF-kappa B pathway and were found to be abolished by 2'3'-cGAMP. In vitro, RU.521 significantly reduced apoptosis and neuroinflammation.Conclusion The study showed that SAH leads to neuroinflammation caused by microglial activation, which contributes to early brain injury. RU.521 improved neurological outcomes and reduced neuroinflammation by regulating microglial polarization through the cGAS/STING/NF-kappa B pathway in early brain injury after SAH.RU.521 may be a prom-ising candidate for the treatment of neuroinflammatory pathology after SAH.

AB  - Based on the spectrum distribution of electromagnetic pulses (EMPs), we constructed a dispersive electromagnetic model of rats with a fine division of tissues and organs and calculated the internal electric field distribution in the rat brain exposed to EMPs. The results showed that EMP radiation was capable of generating electric field distribution with good uniformity in the rat brain and that the peak field intensity in the rat brain was about 1/250 of that in the spatial domain. The electric field in the cerebral cortex was slightly higher than that in the deep hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus, and it was probably the lowest in the hypothalamus. In the cortex, the electric field was low in the prefrontal cortex, while it was relatively high in the parietal and temporal lobes near the middle and at the back of the brain. The data provide a theoretical quantitative basis for establishment of the dose-effect relationship between the electric field in the rat brain and biological effects of the pulse. In addition, it serves as a reference for simulation calculation of the effect of EMPs in living organisms. (c) 2023 Author(s).

AB  - Zyxin is a zinc-binding phosphoprotein known to regulate cell migration, adhesion, and cell survival. Zyxin also plays a role in signal transduction between focal adhesions and the nuclear compartment. However, the mechanism of Zyxin shuttling to nucleus is still unclear. Here, we identify that the GlcNAc transferase (O-linked GlcNAc [O-GlcNAc] transferase) can O-GlcNAcylate Zyxin and regulate its nuclear localization. We show that O-GlcNAc transferase O-GlcNAcylates Zyxin at two residues, serine 169 (Ser-169) and Ser-246. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation of Ser-169, but not Ser-246, enhances its interaction with 14-3-3 gamma, which is a phosphoserine/threoninebinding protein and is reported to bind with phosphorylated Zyxin. Furthermore, we found that 14-3-3 gamma could promote the nuclear localization of Zyxin after Ser-169 O-GlcNAcylation by affecting the function of the N-terminal nuclear export signal sequence; functionally, UV treatment increases the O-GlcNAcylation of Zyxin, which may enhance the nuclear location of Zyxin. Finally, Zyxin in the nucleus maintains homeodomaininteracting protein kinase 2 stability and promotes UV-induced cell death. In conclusion, we uncover that the nuclear localization of Zyxin can be regulated by its O-GlcNAcylation, and that this protein may regulate UV-induced cell death.

AB  - The cellular mechanisms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are poorly understood. Cumulative evidence suggests that abnormal synapse function underlies many features of this disease. Astrocytes regulate several key neuronal processes, including the formation of synapses and the modulation of synaptic plasticity. Astrocyte abnormalities have also been identified in the postmortem brain tissue of ASD individuals. However, it remains unclear whether astrocyte pathology plays a mechanistic role in ASD, as opposed to a compensatory response. To address this, we combined stem cell culturing with transplantation techniques to determine disease-specific properties inherent to ASD astrocytes. We demonstrate that ASD astrocytes induce repetitive behavior as well as impair memory and long-term potentiation when transplanted into the healthy mouse brain. These in vivo phenotypes were accompanied by reduced neuronal network activity and spine density caused by ASD astrocytes in hippocampal neurons in vitro. Transplanted ASD astrocytes also exhibit exaggerated Ca2+ fluctuations in chimeric brains. Genetic modulation of evoked Ca2+ responses in ASD astrocytes modulates behavior and neuronal activity deficits. Thus, this study determines that astrocytes derived from ASD iPSCs are sufficient to induce repetitive behavior as well as cognitive deficit, suggesting a previously unrecognized primary role for astrocytes in ASD.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent and intricate mental disorder. The involvement of small RNA molecules, such as microRNAs in the pathogenesis and neuronal mechanisms underlying the depression have been documented. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of microRNA-143-3p (miR-143-3p) in the process of fear memory and pathogenesis of ischemia; however, the relationship between miR-143-3p and depression remains poorly understood. Here we utilized two kinds of mouse models to investigate the role of miR-143-3p in the pathogenesis of depression. Our findings reveal that the expression of miR-143-3p is upregulated in the ventral hippocampus (VH) of mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS) or acute Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Inhibiting the expression of miR-143-3p in the VH effectively alleviates depressive-like behaviors in CRS and LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, we identify Lasp1 as one of the downstream target genes regulated by miR-143-3p. The miR-143-3p/Lasp1 axis primarily affects the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors in mice by modulating synapse numbers in the VH. Finally, miR-143-3p/Lasp1-induced F-actin change is responsible for the synaptic number variations in the VH. In conclusion, this study enhances our understanding of microRNA-mediated depression pathogenesis and provides novel prospects for developing therapeutic approaches for this intractable mood disorder.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of medicinal methanolic plant extracts against multidrug-resistant bacteria to determine the cytotoxicity of these extracts on eukaryotic cells, and to confirm their efficacy against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in experimental animals. The effects of the methanol extract of sixty folk plants were investigated on; MRSA, Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase E. coli and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa by disc diffusion and MIC assay. Cytotoxicity was determined using MTT and hemolysis of human erythrocytes. Three plant extracts with the highest antimicrobial activities were tested using a challenge experiment on mice. Systemic infection was performed by intraperitoneal inoculation of (5 x 10(6) CFU/mL) of MRSA isolate. Then mice received 300 mg/kg body weight of the plant extracts daily for seven days. The efficacy of plant extracts was evaluated by general health, mortality rate, gross lesion, and histopathology study of inoculated mice. Only ten plants showed activities against different MDR bacteria with inhibitory zones ranging from (8 to 22 mm) in diameter. Of the ten medicinal plant extracts, Camellia sinensis and Aloysia citrodora showed the highest activities against MRSA and MSSA isolates, with MIC value ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, followed by Hibiscus sabdariffa, Thymus vulgaris, and Glycyrrhiza glabra. Furthermore, the extract of the effective plants showed low toxicity against Vero and fibroblasts cell lines, along with inhibitory activities to erythrocytes membrane disruption. The in vivo study demonstrated that Camellia sinensis showed significant activity against MRSA infections in mice. The results validate that these plants are effective and safe antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistance bacteria, and have the potential to be utilized as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) represents diverse cerebral dysfunctions in response to pathogen-induced systemic inflammation. Peripheral exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, has been extensively used to model systemic inflammation. Our previous studies suggested that LPS led to hippocampal neuron death and synaptic destruction in vivo. However, the underlying roles of activated microglia in these neuronal changes remained unclear. Here, LPS from two different bacterial strains (Salmonella enterica or E. coli) were compared and injected in 14- to 16-month-old mice and evaluated for neuroinflammation and neuronal integrity in the hippocampus at 7 or 63 days post-injection (dpi). LPS injection resulted in persistent neuroinflammation lasting for seven days and a subsequent normalisation by 63 dpi. Of note, increases in proinflammatory cytokines, microglial morphology and microglial mean lysosome volume were more pronounced after E. coli LPS injection than Salmonella LPS at 7 dpi. While inhibitory synaptic puncta density remained normal, excitatory synaptic puncta were locally reduced in the CA3 region of the hippocampus at 63 dpi. Finally, we provide evidence that excitatory synapses coated with complement factor 3 (C3) decreased between 7 dpi and 63 dpi. Although we did not find an increase of synaptic pruning by microglia, it is plausible that microglia recognised and eliminated these C3-tagged synapses between the two time points of investigation. Since a region-specific decline of CA3 synapses has previously been reported during normal ageing, we postulate that systemic inflammation may have accelerated or worsened the CA3 synaptic changes in the ageing brain.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent and debilitating neurodegenerative condition that profoundly affects a patient's daily functioning with progressive cognitive decline, which can be partly attributed to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. Neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is likely to persist throughout life but declines with aging, especially in Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidence indicated that RNA-binding protein 8A (Rbm8a) promotes the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, with lower expression levels observed in Alzheimer's disease patients compared with healthy people. This study investigated the hypothesis that Rbm8a overexpression may enhance neurogenesis by promoting the proliferation of neural progenitor cells to improve memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, Rbm8a overexpression was induced in the dentate gyrus of 5xFAD mice to validate this hypothesis. Elevated Rbm8a levels in the dentate gyrus triggered neurogenesis and abated pathological phenotypes (such as plaque formation, gliosis reaction, and dystrophic neurites), leading to ameliorated memory performance in 5xFAD mice. RNA sequencing data further substantiated these findings, showing the enrichment of differentially expressed genes involved in biological processes including neurogenesis, cell proliferation, and amyloid protein formation. In conclusion, overexpressing Rbm8a in the dentate gyrus of 5xFAD mouse brains improved cognitive function by ameliorating amyloid-beta-associated pathological phenotypes and enhancing neurogenesis.

AB  - Ketamine is a clinical anesthetic and antidepressant. Although ketamine is a known NMDA receptor antagonist, the mechanisms contributing to antidepression are unclear. This present study examined the loci and duration of ketamine's actions, and the involvement of NMDA receptors. Local field potentials were recorded from the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices. Ketamine was tested at antidepressant and anesthetic concentrations. Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists APV and MK-801, GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline, and a potassium channel blocker TEA were also studied. Ketamine decreased population spike amplitudes during application, but a long-lasting increase in amplitudes was seen during washout. Bicuculline reversed the acute effects of ketamine, but the washout increase was not altered. This long-term increase was statistically significant, sustained for >2 h, and involved postsynaptic mechanisms. A similar effect was produced by MK-801, but was only partially evident with APV, demonstrating the importance of the NMDA receptor ion channel block. TEA also produced a lasting excitability increase, indicating a possible involvement of potassium channel block. This is this first report of a long-lasting increase in excitability following ketamine exposure. These results support a growing literature that increased GABA inhibition contributes to ketamine anesthesia, while increased excitatory transmission contributes to its antidepressant effects.

AB  - Saxitoxin (STX), as a type of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), is gaining widespread attention due to its long existence in edible shellfish. However, the mechanism underlying STX chronic exposure-induced effect is not well understood. Here, we evaluated the neurotoxicity effects of long-term low-dose STX exposure on C57/BL mice by behavioral tests, pathology analysis, and hippocampal proteomics analysis. Several behavioral tests showed that mice were in a cognitive deficiency after treated with 0, 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 mu g STX equivalents/kg body weight in the drinking water for 3 months. Compared with control mice, STX-exposed mice exhibited brain neuronal damage characterized by decreasing neuronal cells and thinner pyramidal cell layers in the hippocampal CA1 region. A total of 29 proteins were significantly altered in different STX dose groups. Bioinformatics analysis showed that protein phosphatase 1 (Ppp1c) and arylsulfatase A (Arsa) were involved in the hippo signaling pathway and sphingolipid metabolism pathway. The decreased expression of Arsa indicates that long-term low doses of STX exposure can cause neuronal inhibition, which is a process related to spatial memory impairment. Taken together, our study provides a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms of STX neurotoxicity.

AB  - Numerous neurological disorders, including prion, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are identified as being caused by alterations in protein conformation, aggregation, and metal ion dyshomeostasis. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the exploration and study of natural products (NPs) from plant and microbial sources for their therapeutic potential against several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we have examined the effect of two NPs, cycloastragenol (CAG) and punicalagin (PCG), on the metal-induced oligomerization and aggregation of A beta 25-35 and PrP106-126 peptides. The peptide aggregation and inhibitory properties of both NPs were examined by the thioflavin-T (ThT) assay, MALDI-TOF, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Among the two NPs, PCG significantly binds to the peptides, chelates metal ions (Cu2+ and Zn2+), inhibits peptide aggregation, substantially reduces oxidative stress, and controls the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both NPs exhibited low cytotoxicity and prominently mitigated peptide-mediated cell cytotoxicity in hippocampal neuronal HT-22 cells by covalent bonding and hydrophobic interactions.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and is accompanied by memory deficits, personality changes, anxiety, depression, and social difficulties. For treatment of AD, many researchers have attempted to find medicinal resources with high effectiveness and without side effects. Oligonol is a low molecular weight polypeptide derived from lychee fruit extract. We investigated the effects of oligonol in 5 x FAD transgenic AD mice, which developed severe amyloid pathology, through behavioral tests (Barnes maze, marble burying, and nestle shredding) and molecular experiments. Oligonol treatment attenuated blood glucose levels and increased the antioxidant response in the livers of 5 x FAD mice. Moreover, the behavioral score data showed improvements in anxiety, depressive behavior, and cognitive impairment following a 2-month course of orally administered oligonol. Oligonol treatment not only altered the circulating levels of cytokines and adipokines in 5 x FAD mice, but also significantly enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes and synaptic plasticity in the brain cortex and hippocampus. Therefore, we highlight the therapeutic potential of oligonol to attenuate neuropsychiatric problems and improve memory deficits in the early stage of AD.

AB  - Cinnamic alcohol (CA) is a phenylpropanoid found in the essential oil of the bark of the genus Cinnamomum spp. Schaeff. (Lauraceae Juss.), known as cinnamon. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CA and its possible mechanism of action on mice submitted to the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced epileptic seizures model. Behavioral, neurochemical, histomorphometric and immunohistochemistry analysis were carried out. The administration of CA (50-200 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min prior to PTZ and 0.7-25 mg/kg, i.p., 60 min prior to PTZ) increased the latency to seizure onset and the latency to death. The effects observed with CA treatment at 60 min were partially reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil. Furthermore, neurochemical assays indicated that CA reduced the concentration of malondialdehyde and nitrite, while increasing the concentration of reduced glutathione. Finally, histomorphometric and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a reduction in inflammation and an increase in neuronal preservation in the hippocampi of CA pre-treated mice. Taken together, the results suggest that CA seems to modulate the GABAA receptor, decrease oxidative stress, mitigate neuroinflammation, and reduce cell death processes.

AB  - Eucalyptol (1.8-cineole), an active component in traditional Chinese medicine Artemisia argyi for moxibustion. Previous studies have shown that eucalyptol has anti-tumor effects on leukemia and colon cancer. Nonetheless, the effect and mechanism of eucalyptol on neuroblastoma remains unclear. In the present study, we intended to reveal the effect and mechanism of eucalyptol treatment on the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y through transcriptome analysis. In the group treated with eucalyptol, 566 brain genes were up-regulated, while 757 genes were down-regulated. GO function analysis showed that positive regulation of cell cycle was down-regulated in biological processes. Meanwhile, cancer-related pathways were identified in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis, including pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, and additional pathways. Furthermore, we found a key gene, such as MYC, by constructing a network of cancer related pathways with differentially expressed genes and transcription factor analysis. In conclusion, our research indicates that MYC might play a central role in the anit-tumor mechanisms of eucalyptol.

AB  - Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is active throughout the brain and its genetic ablation impacts brain function. Its activity in the brain was proposed to regulate bioactive lipid availability, namely eicosanoids that are inflammatory mediators and regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF). We aimed at testing whether HSL deletion increases susceptibility to neuroinflammation and impaired brain perfusion upon diet-induced obesity. HSL-/-, HSL+/-, and HSL+/+ mice of either sex were fed high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet for 8 weeks, and then assessed in behavior tests (object recognition, open field, and elevated plus maze), metabolic tests (insulin and glucose tolerance tests and indirect calorimetry in metabolic cages), and CBF determination by arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine coverage of blood vessels, and morphology of astrocytes and microglia in brain slices. HSL deletion reduced CBF, most prominently in cortex and hippocampus, while HFD feeding only lowered CBF in the hippocampus of wild-type mice. CBF was positively correlated with lectin-stained vessel density. HSL deletion did not exacerbate HFD-induced microgliosis in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. HSL-/- mice showed preserved memory performance when compared to wild-type mice, and HSL deletion did not significantly aggravate HFD-induced memory impairment in object recognition tests. In contrast, HSL deletion conferred protection against HFD-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Altogether, this study points to distinct roles of HSL in periphery and brain during diet-induced obesity. While HSL-/- mice were protected against metabolic syndrome development, HSL deletion reduced brain perfusion without leading to aggravated HFD-induced neuroinflammation and memory dysfunction.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Vascular disease (VD) is a kind of common disease harmful to the health of the middle-aged and elderly, which has the characteristics of long treatment cycle and high recurrence rate, and without effective method to treat so far. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the characteristics of multi -components and multi-targets to treat diseases. Kai-Xin-San is a TCM formula applied for treating psychiatric diseases such as depression in China for thousands of years, and it has been used in clinical treatment of VD. But up to now, its active composition and mechanism are not clear. Aim of the study: To explore the effective components of Kai-Xin-San, investigate the effect of Kai-Xin-San on angiogenesis, screen and verify the related targets and possible mechanisms of Kai-Xin-San against VD. Materials and methods: UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS was performed to identify the chemical components of Kai-Xin-San. The mechanism of multi-components, multi-targets, and multi-pathways of Kai-Xin-San in the treatment of VD were explored by network pharmacology. And then, quail chick chorioallantoic membrane (qCAM) assays were used to evaluate the vascular protective activity of Kai-Xin-San. Evaluation of angiogenesis by calculating the relative vessels area. The levels of VEGFA and Akt1 in qCAM were measured by RT-PCR. Twenty-five male SD rats were randomly divided into the sham group, model group, Donepezil (0.45 mg/kg) group, Kai-Xin-San low dose group (0.1575 g/kg), Kai-Xin-San high dose group (0.63 g/kg). Two-vessel occlusion (2-VO) rat model is established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Kai-Xin-San pretreatment. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining is conducted to detect the morphological changes of neurons in the hippocampus. Results: Data showed that 62 compounds were identified in Kai-Xin-San. The network pharmacology results showed 73 compounds in Kai-Xin-San play a role in the treatment of VD, such as Ginsenoside Rh4, kaempferol, and Poricoic acid C. A total of 7 main targets are predicted, including Akt1, TNF and so on. Kai-Xin-San could increase VEGFA and Akt1 expression, promote angiogenesis and regulate the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The results depict that Kai-Xin-San has dose-dependently improved the cognitive function in 2-VO model rats. It has also been showed that Kai-Xin-San can rescue neuron damage in the hippocampus. Conclusion: The complex chemical components of Kai-Xin-San play a synergistic role in the treatment of VD, and involve multiple pathways and targets. To protect blood vessels by promoting angiogenesis is one of the potential mechanisms of Kai-Xin-San in the treatment of VD. This study reveals that Kai-Xin-San protects the 2-VO model rats from ischemic injury by alleviating neuron damage in the hippocampus.

AB  - Although the antidepressant-like effect of magnolol has been revealed in previous reports, the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the antidepressant-like effect of magnolol on corticosterone-induced (CORT-induced) mice was investigated in vivo. After 21 days of CORT induction, the mice showed marked depressive-like behaviors, with a decrease in sucrose preference score and an increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Pretreatment with either magnolol (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist nor-BNI (10 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented CORT-induced depression-like behavior and reduced CORT-induced dynorphin (DYN A) elevation in the hippocampal ventral DG. However, no depression-like behavior was observed in mice with KOR downregulation in the ventral DG. We further found that upregulation of DYN A in the DG caused depression-like behavior, which was blocked by intraperitoneal injection of nor-BNI and modulated by magnolol. The present study demonstrated that magnolol could ameliorate CORT-induced depression-like behaviors, by modulating the DYN A/KOR system in the ventral DG of the hippocampus.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated neurodegeneration is triggered by different fragments of amyloid beta (A beta). Among them, A beta (25-35) fragment plays a critical role in the development of neurodegeneration-it reduces synaptic integrity by disruption of excitatory/inhibitory ratio across networks and alters the growth factors synthesis. Thus, in this study, we aimed to identify the involvement of neurotrophic factors-the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and nerve growth factor (NGF)-of AD-like neurodegeneration induced by A beta (25-35). Taking into account our previous findings on the neuroprotective effects of the mix of proteoglycans of embryonic genesis (PEG), it was suggested to test its regulatory effect on IGF-1 and NGF levels. To evaluate the progress of neurodegeneration, in vivo electrophysiological investigation of synaptic activity disruption of the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus circuit at AD was performed and the potential recovery effects of PEG with relative structural changes were provided. To reveal the direct effects of PEG on brain functional activity, the electrophysiological pattern of the single cells from nucleus supraopticus, sensomotor cortex and hippocampus after acute injection of PEG was examined. Our results demonstrated that after i.c.v. injection of A beta (25-35), the level of NGF decreased in cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, and, in contrast, increased in hippocampus, prompting its multidirectional role in case of brain damage. The concentration of IGF-1 significantly increased in all investigated brain structures. The administration of PEG balanced the growth factor levels accompanied by substantial restoration of neural tissue architecture and synaptic activity. Acute injection of PEG activated the hypothalamic nucleus supraopticus and hippocampal neurons. IGF-1 and NGF levels were found to be elevated in animals receiving PEG in an absence of amyloid exposure. We suggest that IGF-1 and NGF play a critical role in the development of AD. At the same time, it becomes clear that the neuroprotective effects of PEG are likely mediated via the regulation of neurotrophins.

Chronic unpredictable mild stress results in reduced expression of synaptic proteins and depression-like behaviors in rodent models. However, the upstream molecule that senses the demand for synaptic proteins and initiates their synthesis under chronic stress remains unknown. In this study, chronic unpredictable mild stress reduced the expression of PPP4R3A in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in mice. Selective knockout of Ppp4r3a in the cortex and hippocampus mimicked the depression-and anxiety-like behavioral effects of chronic stress in mice. Notably, Ppp4r3a deficiency led to downregulated mTORC1 signaling, which resulted in reduced synthesis of synaptic proteins and impaired synaptic functions. By contrast, overexpression of Ppp4r3a in the cortex and hippocampus protected against behavioral and synaptic deficits induced by chronic stress in a PPP4R3A???mTORC1-dependent manner. Rapamycin treatment of Ppp4r3a-overexpressing neurons blocked the regulatory effect of Ppp4r3a on the synthesis of synaptic proteins by directly inhibiting mTORC1. Overall, our results reveal a regulatory role of Ppp4r3a in driving synaptic protein synthesis in chronic stress.

AB  - Context Propofol can induce neuroapoptosis. It has been reported that dexmedetomidine (DEX) has a protective effect on propofol-induced neuroapoptosis, but the specific mechanism needs to be further explored to provide a theoretical basis for their combined use.Objective We aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect of DEX on primary cortical neurons treated by propofol and to elucidate the underlying mechanistic pathways.MethodsCortical neurons were isolated from fetal rats and treated with propofol. MTT assays were performed to detect cell viability, alpha-tubulin immunofluorescent assays were conducted to observe cell abnormalities, and c-caspase3 immunofluorescent assays and flow cytometry were performed to examine cell apoptosis. Further, neurons were cotreated with propofol and DEX to study DEX's neuroprotective effects on propofol-caused neuronal injuries. Finally, the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor was knocked out and/or the Akt activator (SC-79) was added to cells co-treated with propofol and DEX. The expression levels of Akt-IKK-NF-kappa B pathway-related proteins were detected by western blot.Results Propofol decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, triggered apoptosis, caused morphological abnormalities and down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of Akt, IKK, NF-kappa B and I kappa B in cortical neurons. DEX ameliorated the decrease of cell viability, alleviated neuronal apoptosis and promoted the downregulated expression levels of p-Akt, IKK, NF-kappa B, and I kappa B proteins which had been induced by propofol treatment. Western blot findings following the transfection of alpha 2A-siRNA and the addition of SC-79 suggested that DEX's neuroprotective functions arose from the stimulation of alpha 2A-adrenoceptors to activate the Akt-IKK-NF-kappa B signal pathway.Conclusion DEX protected neurons against propofol-induced apoptosis via activation of the Akt-IKK-NF-kappa B signal pathway through alpha 2A-adrenoceptors.

AB  - Cancer is a global leading cause of death, with nearly 10 million people dying from cancer in 2020. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising cancer treatment modality; however, the potential molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Herein, we designed a near-infrared (NIR) light-activated nanoplatform (TPBCPEG) to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of PDT by using a model of intratibial primary and pulmonary metastasis osteosarcoma. Under laser irradiation, TPBC-PEG photosensitizer dose-dependently inhibited proliferative and metastatic capabilities while promoting apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells in vitro, and also effectively suppressed carcinogenesis and pulmonary metastasis in osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model. Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis after high-throughput mRNA-seq indicated that the HIPPO signaling pathway was one of the 20 most significantly related signaling pathways. And a series of experiments for determining the HIPPO signaling activity were conducted to reconfirm the specificity. Collectively, PDT of TPBC-PEG micelles against carcinogenesis and pulmonary metastasis of deep-seated intratibial osteosarcoma was achieved by activating HIPPO signaling pathway. Our study identified a hitherto uncharacterized molecular mechanism of PDT, which may provide new insights to understand and design promising nanoplatforms for future cancer therapies.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Musk is a representative drug of aroma-relieving traditional Chinese medicine, and it is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Muscone is the core medicinal component of musk.Aim of the study: We sought to identify the target of muscone in the treatment of ischemic stroke using network pharmacology, an animal model of ischemic stroke, and differential proteomics.Materials and methods: The drug targets of muscone in the treatment of ischemic stroke were predicted and analyzed using information derived from sources such as the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database and Swiss Target Prediction tool. The animal model of focal cerebral ischemia was established by suture-based occlusion of the middle cerebral artery of rats. The rats were divided into six groups: shamoperated control, model, musk, muscone1, muscone2, and muscone3. Neurological deficit scores were calculated after intragastric administration of musk or muscone. The microcirculation blood flow of the pia mater was detected using a laser speckle blood flow meter. The cerebral infarction rate was detected by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The necrosis rate of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampal neurons was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Blood-brain barrier damage was detected by the Evans blue method. Quantitative proteomics analysis in the sham-operated control, model, and muscone groups was performed using tandem-mass-tags. Considering fold changes exceeding 1.2 as differential protein expression, the quantitative values were compared among groups by analysis of variance. Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis.Results: Network pharmacology identified 339 targets for the intersection of 17 components of musk and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The GO and KEGG enrichment items mainly identified regulation of neuronal synaptic structure and transfer function, synaptic neurotransmitters, and receptor activity. Zoopery showed that the model group had a higher behavioral score, cerebral infarction rate, cortical and hippocampal neuron death rate, Evans blue exudation in the brain, and bilateral pia mater microcirculation blood flow differences than the sham-operated control group (P <0.01). Compared with the model group, the behavioral score, infarction rate, hippocampal neuronal mortality, and Evans blue content decreased significantly in the musk, muscone2, and muscone3 groups (P <0.05). Proteomic analysis showed that 160 genes were differentially expressed among the sham-operated control, model, and muscone groups. GO items with high enrichment included neuronal synapses, postsynaptic signal transduction, etc. KEGG items with high enrichment included cholinergic synapses, calcium signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapses, etc. Protein interaction analysis revealed that the top three protein pairs were Ndufa10/Ndufa6, Kcna2/Kcnab2, and Gsk3b/Traf6.Conclusions: Muscone can reduce neuronal necrosis, protect the blood-brain barrier, and improve the neurological damage caused by cerebral ischemia via molecular mechanisms mainly involving the regulation ofneuronal synaptic connections. Muscone is an important active component responsible for the "consciousness -restoring resuscitation" effect of musk on ischemic stroke.

AB  - Multiple instance learning (MIL) models have achieved remarkable success in analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) for disease classification problems. However, with regard to giga-pixel WSI classification problems, current MIL models are often incapable of differentiating a WSI with extremely small tumor lesions. This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the attention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor tumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance inference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification. We introduce a novel representation learning for histopathology images to identify representative normal keys. These keys facilitate the selection of salient instances within WSIs, forming bags with high tumor-to-normal ratios. Finally, an attention mechanism is employed for slide-level classification based on formed bags. Our results show that salient instance inference can improve the tumor-to-normal area ratio in the tumor WSIs. As a result, SiiMIL achieves 0.9225 AUC and 0.7551 recall on the Camelyon16 dataset, which outperforms the existing MIL models. In addition, SiiMIL can generate tumor-sensitive attention heatmaps that is more interpretable to pathologists than the widely used attentionbased MIL method. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances, which could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to normal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times.

AB  - Podoconiosis is a disease that causes swelling and disfiguration of the lower legs found in several developing countries where shoes are not regularly worn. The current model for the etiology of the disease proposes that mineralogical agents enter the lymph system through the skin leading to inflammation that causes swelling of the feet and legs. We collected 125 soil samples from 21 towns associated with podoconiosis, 8 towns unassociated with Podoconiosis as controls, and 3 towns of unknown status. Data collected for each soil sample included color, particle size, mineralogy, and geochemistry to distinguish unique components within the podoconiosis-associated soils. Our results indicate podoconiosis-associated soils are more highly weathered than non-podoconiosis associated soils. The enrichment of kaolinite and gibbsite suggests that these minerals, their surface chemistry, and trace elements associated with them should be prioritized in future podoconiosis research. In addition, we found that color may be a valuable tool to identify soils at greater risk for inducing podoconiosis.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to determine changes in cognitive function resulting from chronic hypobaric hypoxia through proteomic analysis of hippocampal tissue. We screened cognition-related proteins to provide ideas and directions that could help prevent and treat hypoxia-associated cognitive impairment.Methods: We analyzed hippocampal tissues from mice exposed to high altitudes and control mice using 4 D label-free quantitative proteomics. The data were analyzed by protein quantitative analysis, functional annotation, differential protein screening, clustering analyses, and functional classification and enrichment. Differential protein expression was investigated using targeted quantitative omics based on parallel response monitoring.Results: We identified and quantified 20 target proteins in 12 samples, of which 18 were significant validated proteins that were or might be related to cognitive functions. Signaling pathways that were significantly enriched in differentially expressed proteins were pyrimidine metabolism, 5 '-Adenosine Triphosphate-activated protein kinase signaling, phospholipase D signaling, purine metabolism, inflammatory mediator regulation of transient receptor potential channels, hedgehog signaling pathways, dilated cardiomyopathy, platelet activation, insulin resistance, mRNA surveillance pathways, drug metabolism-other enzymes, and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450.Conclusion: Chronic hypoxia alters protein expression in murine hippocampal tissues. Eighteen differentially expressed cognition-related proteins might be related to cognitive impairment in mice exposed to chronic high-altitude hypoxia.

AB  - Network-based GWAS (NetWAS) has advanced brain imaging research by identifying genetic modules associated with brain alterations. However, how imaging risk genes exert functions in brain diseases, particularly their mediation through imaging quantitative traits (iQTs), remains underexplored. We propose a module-level polygenic risk score (MPRS)-based NetWAS framework to uncover genetic modules associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the mediation of an iQT, using amygdala density as a case study. Our framework integrates genotype data, brain imaging phenotypes, clinical diagnosis of AD, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify AD-relevant modules (ADMs) influenced by iQT-associated genetic variants. Specifically, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of amygdala density (N=1515) to identify variants associated with iQT. These variants were mapped onto a PPI network and network propagation was performed to prompt amygdala modules. The meta-GWAS of AD (N1=63,926; N2=455,267) was used to calculate MPRS to further identify AD-relevant modules (ADMs). Four modules that showed significant differences in MPRS between AD and controls were identified as ADM. Post-hoc analyses revealed that these ADMs demonstrated strong modularity, showed increased sensitivity to early stages of AD, and significantly mediated the link between ADMs and AD progression through the amygdala. Furthermore, these modules exhibited high tissue specificity within the amygdala and were enriched in AD-related biological pathways.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the structure of a polysaccharide (HMP-1) from Hippocampus mohnikei, and to explore its anti-inflammatory effect. HMP-1 was obtained from Hippocampus mohnikei by ethanol sedimentation and secondary column chromatography purification. Its structural characteristics were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and scanning electron micrograph (SEM). Results showed its molecular weight (Mw) was 7296 Da, and it mainly consisted of six residues: 1,3-beta-Glcp, 1,4-alpha-Manp, 1,4-alpha-GalpA, 1,4-beta-GlcpA2S, 1,4-alpha-Galp3S, and 1,4-beta-GlcNAc. HMP-1 could protect RAW246.7 cells from the cytotoxic effect induced by LPS. HMP-1 also could reduce the levels of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species produced by LPS stimulation, suggesting that HMP-1 has anti-inflammatory activities within a certain concentration range.

AB  - Background/Objectives: In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety-like symptoms are often associated with elevated noradrenaline levels and decreased serotonin. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently used to treat anxiety, but elevated serotonin has been observed in some anxiety disorders. This study investigates stress-induced anxiety as an immediate effect of chronic stress exposure using the predator stress paradigm. Methods: We examined serotonin levels, serotonin transporter (SERT), and 5-HT3A receptor gene expression in response to stress. The effects of SSRIs (paroxetine, sertraline) and resveratrol on these parameters were also analyzed, alongside co-treatment with resveratrol and sertraline. Results: Chronic stress exposure led to a significant increase in serotonin levels and upregulation of SERT and 5-HT3A receptor expression. SSRIs failed to prevent anxiety or reduce serotonin levels, partly due to suppressed SERT expression. Resveratrol downregulated SERT and 5-HT3A expression less than SSRIs but effectively reduced anxiety and restored serotonin, likely by upregulating MAO-A expression. Co-treatment with resveratrol and sertraline produced the strongest anxiolytic effect. Conclusions: Elevated serotonin and increased expression of SERT and 5-HT3A receptor genes are key factors in stress-related anxiety. Resveratrol and SSRIs target these mechanisms, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for anxiety disorders. Future research will focus on further elucidating the serotonergic mechanisms involved and identifying new anxiolytic drug targets.

AB  - Exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) during pregnancy have been linked to alterations in the offspring's central nervous system. Cherries are a source of anthocyanins, which possess neuroprotective properties. The study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of cherry juice (CJ) on memory and hippocampal cell counts in offspring exposed to LPS during gestation and the gestation-lactation periods. At postnatal day 90, rat pups were divided into five groups: Control (saline solution), LPS-G (LPS during gestation), LPS-G+CJ (LPS during gestation+CJ), LPS-GL (LPS during gestation-lactation), and LPS-GL+CJ (LPS during gestation-lactation+CJ). A battery of behavioral tests was conducted to assess short- and long-term memory and anxiety-like behavior. Histological analysis was performed on hippocampal regions. Leukocyte levels were measured as markers of systemic inflammation. Results showed that pups in the LPS-G and LPS-GL groups exhibited impaired memory, increased anxiety-like behavior, elevated leukocyte levels, and reduced cell counts in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions, as well as in CA2 (LPS-G) and CA3 (LPS-GL). Cherry juice administration in the LPS-G+CJ and LPS-GL+CJ groups improved memory performance, normalized leukocyte levels, and restored hippocampal cell counts. These findings suggest that cherry juice exerts neuroprotective effects against LPS-induced neuroinflammation during gestation and the gestation-lactation periods.

AB  - Intra-follicular oocyte transfer (IFOT) is a promising and innovative technique for in vivo embryo production previously described for equines and bovines. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of IFOT in the ovine species. Two preliminary in vivo and in vitro trials were performed to test the optimal procedures and timing for IFOT. In the in vivo trial, follicular growth was monitored with transrectal ultrasonography in ten adult ewes to preliminarily determine the ovulation and ideal timing for IFOT. The in vitro trial assessed i) the optimal inner diameter of the injection needle and ii) the recovery rate and integrity of injected cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) after follicle aspiration. For IFOT and embryo collection, five ewes were synchronized by CIDR insertion. Forty hours after CIDR removal, in ewes under sedation and general anesthesia, the ovaries were exposed by laparotomy, and the preovulatory follicle was injected with COCs previously collected from ovaries obtained from an abattoir. At 4 h after surgery, fully recovered ewes were housed in a paddock with a ram of proven fertility. Crayon marking on ram's chest was used to detect mating. Ovulation was assessed 40 h after the transfer of oocytes by transrectal ultrasonography. On day 6 after IFOT, embryo collection was performed by uterine flushing. In the in vitro testing, injection of >5 mm follicles with a 28 G needle loaded with 30 COCs in a 5 mu L volume resulted in higher recovery rates and better preservation of COCs integrity. In the in vivo trial, ultrasound scanning revealed that ovulation occurred between 60 and 72 h after CIDR removal in all animals. In one ewe subjected to IFOT, 22/24 oocytes were effectively injected into the preovulatory follicle, but no embryos were collected after flushing. In the remaining four animals, 85/102 oocytes were injected, and six cleaved embryos, 12 morulae and 1 blastocyst were collected, including native embryos. This preliminary investigation indicated that IFOT in ovine species resulted in ovulation, fimbrial capture, tubal transport of heterologous oocytes and in vivo embryo production. Further studies are needed to optimize the embryo recovery rate and develop less invasive techniques for oocyte injection and uterine flushing, such as through a laparoscopic or transcervical approach.

AB  - Herein we report the assessment of the effects of shockwave (SW) impacts on adult rat hippocampal progenitor cell (AHPC) neurospheres (NSs), which are used as in vitro brain models, for enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The assessment has been achieved by using culture dishes and a new microchip. The microchip allows the chemicals released from the brain models cultured inside the cell culture chamber under SW impacts to diffuse to the nanosensors in adjacent sensor chambers through built-in diffusion barriers, which are used to prevent the cells from entering the sensor chambers, thereby mitigating the biofouling issues of the sensor surface. Experiments showed the negative impact of the SW on the viability, proliferation, and differentiation of the cells within the NSs. A qPCR gene expression analysis was performed and appeared to confirm some of the immunocytochemistry (ICC) results. Finally, we demonstrated that the microchip can be used to monitor lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from the AHPC-NSs subjected to SW impacts. As expected, LDH levels changed when AHPC-NSs were injured by SW impacts, verifying this chip can be used for assessing the degrees of injuries to AHPC-NSs by monitoring LDH levels. Taken together, these results suggest the feasibility of using the chip to better understand the interactions between SW impacts and in vitro brain models, paving the way for potentially establishing in vitro TBI models on a chip.

AB  - Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors promote differentiation through post-translational modifications of histones. BML-281, an HDAC6 inhibitor, has been known to prevent tumors, acute dextran sodium sulfate-associated colitis, and lung injury. However, the neurogenic differentiation effect of BML-281 is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of BML-281 on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell differentiation into mature neurons by immunocytochemistry (ICC), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and western blotting analysis. We found that the cells treated with BML-281 showed neurite outgrowth and morphological changes into mature neurons under a microscope. It was confirmed that the gene expression of neuronal markers (NEFL, MAP2, Tuj1, NEFH, and NEFM) was increased with certain concentrations of BML-281. Similarly, the protein expression of neuronal markers (NeuN, Synaptophysin, Tuj1, and NFH) was upregulated with BML-281 compared to untreated cells. Following treatment with BML-281, the expression of Wnt5 alpha increased, and downstream pathways were activated. Interestingly, both Wnt/Ca2+ and Wnt/PCP pathways activated and regulated PKC, Cdc42, RhoA, Rac1/2/3, and p-JNK. Therefore, BML-281 induces the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into mature neurons by activating the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. From these results, we concluded that BML-281 might be a novel drug to differentiation into neuronal cells through the regulation of Wnt signaling pathway to reduce the neuronal cell death.

AB  - Cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) play a key role in various physiological processes, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, immune modulation, cell apoptosis, metabolism regulation, cardiovascular and reproductive systems activity. Since activation of CBRs suppresses hyperexcitation and protect cells from death, their modulation may have therapeutic prospects in the treatment of such pathologies of the nervous system as mental disorders, epilepsy, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord and brain injuries. This paper presents experimental data on the effects of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 on the induced oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) in two in vitro models of epileptiform activity. To study the neuroprotective properties of WIN 55,212-2, hyperexcitation was induced by the application of a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, or depolarizing doses of ammonium chloride. As experiments have shown, WIN 55,212-2 at a concentration of 100 nM and above significantly suppresses the [Ca2+](i) oscillation frequency and reduces the basal [Ca2+](i) level. At the same time, the amplitude of calcium oscillations also decreased in the presence of the agonist. WIN 55,212-2 at a concentration of 5 mu M suppressed NH4Cl-induced [Ca2+](i) oscillations in all neurons but caused a transient biphasic increase in the basal [Ca2+](i) level in 20% of astrocytes. Thus, in this work, using various models of hyperexcitation of neuronal networks, we have demonstrated the potential antiepileptic effect of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2.

AB  - Surgical resection is the main treatment approach for gastric cancer (GC), but surgical anesthetics may have an impact on postoperative cognitive function. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of liensinine on neuronal apoptosis and cognitive function in mice with GC induced by dexmedetomidine anesthesia. Firstly, a GC mouse model was established and divided into the following groups; blank control group, GC model group, low-dose (4 Omol/L) and high-dose (8 Omol/L) groups of liensinine ( n = 6), to detect apoptosis of neurons. In addition, the GC model group, Synuclein (SYN) mimic group, SYN inhibitor group, high-dose neusinine group, and high-dose liensinine+SYN inhibitor group were set up with 6 rats in each group. The cognitive function of mice after treatment was observed by Morris water maze experiment, and neuronal cell apoptosis and expressions of SYN, brain-derived neurotrophic facto (BDNF) and Caspase-3 were explored. Liensinine significantly improved the cognitive function of GC mice after dexmedetomidine anesthesia, and this process is related to decreased SYN expression. Liensinine can inhibit increased SYN expression, so apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampus of mice was controlled after the use of SYN inhibitors, especially in the high-dose liensinine+SYN inhibitor group. Liensinine down-regulated the expression of SYN and inhibited the Caspase-3 to reduce neuronal cell apoptosis, promoting recovery of BDNF level, and then playing role in improving the cognitive function of GC mice after dexmedetomidine anesthesia.

AB  - Chemotherapy is a common treatment method for cancer that is often associated with strong side effects. To reduce these, research on extracts from medicinal plants and their active ingredients has been conducted. Although sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is a well-established medicinal plant, little is known about the chemical components responsible for its putative anticancer activity. This study focuses on both chemical and medical analyses of methanolic sea buckthorn root extracts. Cell viability measurements were performed on head and neck cancer cell lines, as well as non-tumorigenic control cells. Microwave and classical extractions under reflux were used to prepare the methanolic extracts. LC/MS and NMR were used to determine the structures of the molecules contained within these extracts. The aqueous phase of one sea buckthorn root extract reduced the viability of cancer cells, whereas the viability of non-tumorigenic control cells remained unaltered. The cell cycle phases of cancer cells treated with the extract shifted in comparison to control treatment. After 24 h, the number of cells in proliferative phases had increased. Two fractions of the extract that evoked alterations were identified. After a 48 h treatment, one of the fractions showed a higher number of apoptotic cells than the control. LC/MS and NMR analyses were conducted to attempt to identify the active compounds. We propose that the bioactivity of this extract is caused by a mixture of 2 '-hydroxyflavone isomers.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is caused by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Mutations in the human FMR1 gene, encoding the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP), cause the most common monogenic form of ASD, the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This study explored the interaction between the FMR1 gene and a viral-like infection as an environmental insult, focusing on the impact on core autistic-like behaviors and the mGluR1/5-mTOR pathway. Pregnant heterozygous Fmr1 mouse females were exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), by injecting the immunostimulant Poly (I:C) at the embryonic stage 12.5, simulating viral infections. Subsequently, ASD-like behaviors were analyzed in the adult offspring, at 8-10 weeks of age. MIA exposure in wild-type mice led to ASD-like behaviors in the adult offspring. These effects were specifically confined to the intrauterine infection, as immune activation at later stages, namely puberty (Pubertal Immune Activation, PIA) at post-natal day 35 or adulthood (Adult Immune Activation, AIA) at post-natal day 56, did not alter adult behavior. Importantly, combining the Fmr1 mutation with MIA exposure did not intensify core autistic-like behaviors, suggesting an occlusion effect. Mechanistically, MIA provided a strong activation of the mGluR1/5-mTOR pathway, leading to increased LTP and downregulation of FMRP specifically in the hippocampus. Finally, FMRP modulates mTOR activity via TSC2. These findings further strengthen the key role of the mGluR1/5-mTOR pathway in causing ASD-like core symptoms.

AB  - Excessive glutamate neurotransmitters result in oxidative neurotoxicity, similar to neurodegeneration. An indigenous berry of Thailand, Cleistocalyx nervosum var. paniala (CNP), has been recognized for its robust antioxidants. We investigated the effects and mechanisms of CNP fruit extracts on antioxidant-related survival pathways against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. The extract showed strong antioxidant capability and had high total phenolic and flavonoid contents, particularly resveratrol. Next, the protective effects of the CNP extract or resveratrol on the glutamateinduced neurotoxicity were examined in HT22 hippocampal cells. Our investigation showed that the pretreatment of cells with the CNP extract or resveratrol attenuated glutamate-induced neuronal death via suppression of apoptosis cascade by inhibiting the levels of cleaved- and pro-caspase-3 proteins. The CNP extract and resveratrol suppressed the intracellular ROS by increasing the mRNA expression level of antioxidant enzymes (SODs, GPx1, and CAT). We found that this extract and resveratrol significantly increased SIRT1 expression as a survival-related protein. Moreover, they also promoted the activity of the Nrf2 protein translocation into the nucleus and could bind to the promoter containing the antioxidant response element, inducing the expression of the downstream GPx1-antioxidant protein. Our data illustrate that the CNP extract and resveratrol inhibit apoptotic neuronal death via glutamate-induced oxidative neurotoxicity in HT22 cells through the activation of the SIRT1/Nrf2 survival mechanism.

AB  - -Cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) play a key role in various physiological processes, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, immune modulation, cell apoptosis, metabolism regulation, cardiovascular and reproductive systems activity. Since activation of CBRs suppresses hyperexcitation and protects cells from death, their modulation may have therapeutic prospects in the treatment of such pathologies of the nervous system as mental disorders, epilepsy, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord and brain injuries. This paper presents experimental data on the effects of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 on the induced oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) in two in vitro models of epileptiform activity. To study the neuroprotective properties of WIN 55,212-2, hyperexcitation was induced by the application of a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, or depolarizing doses of ammonium chloride. As experiments have shown, WIN 55,212-2 at a concentration of 100 nM and above significantly suppresses the [Ca2+](i) oscillations frequency and reduces the basal [Ca2+](i) level. At the same time, the amplitude of calcium oscillations also decreased in the presence of the agonist. WIN 55,212-2 at a concentration of 2 & mu;M suppressed NH4Cl-induced [Ca2+](i) oscillations in all neurons but caused a transient biphasic increase in the basal [Ca2+](i) level in 20% of astrocytes. Thus, in this work, using various models of hyperexcitation of neuronal networks, we have demonstrated a potential antiepileptic effect of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the expression changes of H2S, IGF-1, and GH in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and to detect their neuroprotective functions after TBI. In this study, we first collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from TBI patients at different times after injury and evaluated the concentrations of H2S, IGF-1, and GH. In vitro studies were using the scratch-induced injury model and cell-cell interaction model (HT22 hippocampal neurons co-cultured with LPS-induced BV2 microglia cells). In vivo studies were using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in mice. Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay. Pro-inflammatory cytokines expression was determined by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and nitric oxide production. Western blot was performed to assess the expression of CBS, CSE, IGF-1, and GHRH. Moreover, the recovery of TBI mice was evaluated for behavioral function by applying the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), the Rotarod test, and the Morris water maze. We discovered that serum H2S, CSF H2S, and serum IGF-1 concentrations were all adversely associated with the severity of the TBI, while the concentrations of IGF-1 and GH in CSF and GH in the serum were all positively related to TBI severity. Experiments in vitro and in vivo indicated that treatment with NaHS (H2S donor), IGF-1, and MR-409 (GHRH agonist) showed protective effects after TBI. This study gives novel information on the functions of H2S, IGF-1, and GH in TBI.

AB  - In the pathogenesis of depression, heredity is believed to be a major factor. However, the mechanism by which heredity contributes to the onset of depression is not fully understood. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats have been used as an animal model for depression because of their increased depression-like behavior compared to Wistar (WIS) rats. In the present study, pups crossbred from WKY x WIS rats were used to evaluate locomotor activity in an open field test (OFT) and depression-like behavior in a forced swimming test (FST), with a focus on amino acid metabolism. Pups in the WKY male x WKY female group showed lower locomotor activity in the OFT and higher depression-like behavior in the FST than those in the WIS male x WIS female group. In addition, multiple regression analysis showed that the paternal strain had a greater effect than the maternal strain on locomotor activity and depression-like behavior in OFT and FST, respectively. Several amino acids in the brainstem, hippocampus, and striatum were significantly decreased through the influence of the WKY paternal strain, but not the WKY maternal strain. Based on these data from comparing WKY and WIS rats, we hypothesize that the hereditary effects of the WKY paternal strain on behavioral tests are partially caused by dysregulation of the amino acid metabolism in the brain.

AB  - Neuroinflammation has emerged as an important factor in the molecular underpinnings of major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology and in the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Among the inflammatory mediators dysregulated in depressed patients, interleukin (IL)-6 has recently been proposed to play a crucial role. IL-6 activates a signaling pathway comprising the JAK/STAT proteins and characterized by a specific negative feedback loop exerted by the cytoplasmic protein suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 (SOCS3). On these bases, here, we explored the potential involvement of IL-6 signaling in the ability of the antidepressant drug agomelatine to normalize the anhedonic-like phenotype induced in the rat by chronic stress exposure. To this aim, adult male Wistar rats were subjected to the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm and chronically treated with vehicle or agomelatine. The behavioral evaluation was assessed by the sucrose consumption test, whereas molecular analyses were performed in the prefrontal cortex. We found that CMS was able to stimulate IL-6 production and signaling, including SOCS3 gene and protein expression, but the SOCS3-mediated feedback-loop inhibition failed to suppress the IL-6 cascade in stressed animals. Conversely, agomelatine treatment normalized the stress-induced decrease in sucrose consumption and restored the negative modulation of the IL-6 signaling via SOCS3 expression and activity. Our results provide additional information about the pleiotropic mechanisms that contribute to agomelatine's therapeutic effects.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted the significant involvement of tryptophan metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a comprehensive investigation of the precise role of tryptophan metabolism in the context of AD is still lacking. This study employed a bioinformatics approach to identify and validate potential tryptophan metabolism-related genes (TrpMgs) associated with AD. The discovery of TrpMgs was facilitated through the intersection of the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) test and 17 known tryptophan metabolism pathways. Subsequently, the putative biological functions and pathways of the TrpMgs were elucidated using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). Furthermore, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method was applied to identify hub genes and evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the 5 TrpMgs in distinguishing AD. The relationship between hub TrpMgs and clinical characteristics was also investigated. Finally, in vivo verification of the five TrpMgs was performed using APP/PS1 mice. We identified 5 TrpMgs associated with AD, including propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit beta (PCCB), TEA Domain Transcription Factor 1 (TEAD1), Phenylalanyl-TRNA Synthetase Subunit Beta (FARSB), Neurofascin (NFASC), and Ezrin (EZR). Among these genes, PCCB, FARSB, NFASC, and TEAD1 showed correlations with age. In the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, we observed down-regulation of FARSB, PCCB, and NFASC mRNA expressions. Furthermore, PCCB and NFASC protein expressions were also down-regulated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Our study paves the way for future research aimed at unraveling the intricate mechanisms underlying tryptophan metabolism dysregulation in AD and its therapeutic implications.

AB  - A photogenerated cathodic protection system powered by solar energy has been proposed to reduce metal corrosion in the ocean. By establishing heterojunctions between semiconductors, the absorption of visible light is improved, effectively separating photogenerated carriers and enhancing the protective effect. In this study, we designed a flower shaped MnCo2O4 modified TiO2 with a Z-scheme heterojunction to enhance its redox ability for photogenerated cathodic protection. Electrochemical tests have shown that the coupling of MnCo2O4/TiO2 with 304 stainless steel (304SS) can effectively improve the photocatalytic cathodic protection effect under light irradiation. Based on the results of UV photoelectron spectroscopy testing, the Z-scheme interface charge transfer path can be determined, which improves the redox performance of the composite material.

AB  - Exposure to the neurotoxin trimethyltin (TMT) selectively induces hippocampal neuronal injury and astrocyte activation accompanied with resultant neuroinflammation, which causes severe behavioral, cognitive, and memory impairment. A large body of evidence suggests that flaxseed oil (FSO), as one of the richest sources of essential omega-3 fatty acids, i.e., alpha-linolenic acids (ALA), displays neuroprotective properties. Here, we report the preventive effects of dietary FSO treatment in a rat model of TMT intoxication. The administration of FSO (1 mL/kg, orally) before and over the course of TMT intoxication (a single dose, 8 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced hippocampal cell death, prevented the activation of astrocytes, and inhibited their polarization toward a pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic phenotype. The underlying protective mechanism was delineated through the selective upregulation of BDNF and PI3K/Akt and the suppression of ERK activation in the hippocampus. Pretreatment with FSO reduced cell death and efficiently suppressed the expression of inflammatory molecules. These beneficial effects were accompanied by an increased intrahippocampal content of n-3 fatty acids. In vitro, ALA pretreatment prevented the TMT-induced polarization of cultured astrocytes towards the pro-inflammatory spectrum. Together, these findings support the beneficial neuroprotective properties of FSO/ALA against TMT-induced neurodegeneration and accompanied inflammation and hint at a promising preventive use of FSO in hippocampal degeneration and dysfunction.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), memory and cognitive abilities deteriorate, affecting the capacity to do basic activities. Aberrant amyloid and tau protein accumulation in and around brain cells is believed to cause it. Amyloid deposits create plaques surrounding brain cells, whereas tau deposits form tangles inside brain cells. The plagues and tangles harm healthy brain cells, causing shrinkage. This damage seems to occur in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory formation. There are presently no methods that provide the most accurate outcomes. The current techniques do not identify AD early. The proposed AD-EHS method achieves the best segmentation using a hybrid fuzzy deformable model (HFLD). The MRI datasets have collected and removed noise using the spatial domain filtering method. Adaptive histogram equalization is used to enhance the MRI images. The segmentation has been done with the hybrid fuzzy logic deformable model. Segmentation has been shown to have a significant influence on characterization. Feature selection has been demonstrated for two performance metrics: reducing processing complexity and increasing the classifier's theoretical capacity. According to the experimental study, the severity of AD in participants was determined using hybrid image segmentation. The proposed model archives the segmentation accuracy of 83.47%.

AB  - We studied the effect of changing extracellular potassium concentration ([K+](o)) on spontaneous and evoked burst activity of glutamatergic neurons in the mouse hippocampus using whole-cell patch clamp. We show that increasing [K+](o) from 3 to 8.5 mM (potassium load) induced spontaneous tonic (1) and pacemaker burst (2) activity of CA1 pyramidal cells (20% and 10% of the total number of cells, respectively). In contrast to CA1, potassium loading did not lead to the appearance of pacemaker granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG). Similarly, potassium load increased the evoked burst activity of CA1 pyramidal cells and, paradoxically, suppressed the burst activity of DG granule cells over the entire range of current steps from 10 to 200 pA. Potassium load shifted the current-voltage characteristics to the right and substantially increased inward currents in CA1 and DG cells. Inward and outward currents of DG neurons were 4-4.5 times as high as those of CA1 cells. The possible involvement of potassium-activated potassium-conducting channels is discussed in the bimodal effect of potassium load on the excitability of CA1 and DG glutamatergic neurons. Our results suggest that CA1 pyramidal cells may be more sensitive to potassium load than DG granule cells, which may play a role in hyperexcitation of neural networks during epileptogenesis.

AB  - We recently nominated cytokine signaling through the Janus-kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway as a potential AD drug target. As hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has recently been shown to inactivate STAT3, we hypothesized that it may impact AD pathogenesis and risk. Among 109,124 rheumatoid arthritis patients from routine clinical care, HCQ initiation was associated with a lower risk of incident AD compared to methotrexate initiation across 4 alternative analyses schemes addressing specific types of biases including informative censoring, reverse causality, and outcome misclassification (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of 0.92 [0.83-1.00], 0.87 [0.81-0.93], 0.84 [0.76-0.93], and 0.87 [0.75-1.01]). We additionally show that HCQ exerts dose-dependent effects on late long-term potentiation (LTP) and rescues impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity prior to significant accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, HCQ treatment enhances microglial clearance of A beta(1-42,) lowers neuroinflammation, and reduces tau phosphorylation in cell culture-based phenotypic assays. Finally, we show that HCQ inactivates STAT3 in microglia, neurons, and astrocytes suggesting a plausible mechanism associated with its observed effects on AD pathogenesis. HCQ, a relatively safe and inexpensive drug in current use may be a promising disease-modifying AD treatment. This hypothesis merits testing through adequately powered clinical trials in at-risk individuals during preclinical stages of disease progression.

AB  - (1) Background: Calcium-binding protein S100B is involved in neuroregeneration but has also been associated with neurodegeneration. These contrasting effects may result from concentration or duration of exposure. We investigated the effect of long-term increased S100B levels on amyloid-beta processing in one-year-old transgenic (tg) mice with 12 copies of the murine S100B gene with specific consideration of sex and specific brain regions. (2) Methods: S100B and amyloid-beta 42 (A beta 42) were quantified in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), adipose tissue, and different brain regions by ELISA in wild-type (wt) and S100Btg mice (each n = 7 per group). Thioflavin T (ThT) and A beta immunostaining were performed for visualization of A beta deposition. (3) Results: S100B in serum, CSF, and brain was significantly increased in S100Btg mice of both sexes. A beta 42 was significantly increased in the hippocampus of male S100Btg mice (p = 0.0075), and the frontal cortex of female S100Btg mice (p = 0.0262). ThT and A beta immunostaining demonstrated A beta deposition in different brain regions in S100Btg mice of both sexes and female wt. (4) Conclusion: Our data validate this experimental model for studying the role of S100B in neurodegeneration and indicate that A beta processing is sex-dependent and brain region-specific, which deserves further investigation of signaling pathways and behavioral responses.

AB  - The maintenance of homeostasis is essential for mitigating stress and delaying degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is generally defined as the abnormal production of beta-amyloid (A beta) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The effects of l-theanine on A beta and AGE generation were investigated in this study. Decreased AGEs and A beta(1-42) levels were reflected by increased acetylcholine (ACh) concentration and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity inhibition compared to model rats. l-Theanine also inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (p65) protein expression by activating sirtuin1 (SIRT1), reducing inflammatory factor expression, and downregulating the mRNA and protein expression of AGE receptors (RAGE). Superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase protein expressions were markedly upregulated by l-theanine, whereas oxidative stress-related injury was alleviated. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) was also found to be increased. H&E staining showed that the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons was mitigated by decreased Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression and the increase of Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, l-theanine increased the gene and protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These findings suggest that the potential preventive effects of l-theanine against AD may be attributed to its regulation of SIRT1 and BDNF proteins and its mitigation of AGEs/RAGE signaling pathways in the brain tissue of AD model rats.

AB  - Accurate cerebral neuron segmentation is required before neuron counting and neuron morphological analysis. Numerous algorithms for neuron segmentation have been published, but they are mainly evaluated using limited subsets from a specific anatomical region, targeting neurons of clear contrast and/or neurons with similar staining intensity. It is thus unclear how these algorithms perform on cerebral neurons in diverse anatomical regions. In this article, we introduce and reliably evaluate existing machine learning algorithms using a data set of microscopy images of macaque brain. This data set highlights various anatomical regions (e.g., cortex, caudate, thalamus, claustrum, putamen, hippocampus, subiculum, lateral geniculate, globus pallidus, etc.), poor contrast, and staining intensity differences of neurons. The evaluation was performed using 10 architectures of six classic machine learning algorithms in terms of typical Recall, Precision, F-score, aggregated Jaccard index (AJI), as well as a performance ranking of algorithms. F-score of most of the algorithms is superior to 0.7. Deep learning algorithms facilitate generally higher F-scores. U-net with suitable layer depth has been evaluated to be excellent classifiers with F-score of 0.846 and 0.837 when performing cross validation. The evaluation and analysis indicate the performance gap among algorithms in various anatomical regions and the strengths and limitations of each algorithm. The comparative result highlights at the same time the importance and difficulty of neuron segmentation and provides clues for future improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive study for neuron segmentation in such large-scale anatomical regions.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have key roles in a variety of neurological diseases, including epilepsy. This objective of this study was to perform the functional exploration and mechanism investigation of circRNA Ubiquilin1 (circUBQLN1) in epilepsy. Epilepsy cell model was established by the treatment of Mg2+-free in human neurons-hippocampal (HN-h) cells. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for the expression analysis of circUBQLN1, linear-UBQLN1, microRNA-155 (miR-155), and sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7). Proliferation detection was completed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Apoptosis analysis was conducted by flow cytometry and caspase-3 assay. Oxidative stress was assessed through determining the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Target analysis was performed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. SOX7 protein level was examined by Western blot. CircUBQLN1 was downregulated in epilepsy samples and Mg2+-free-induced cell model. Functional analysis in vitro suggested that circUBQLN1 overexpression facilitated proliferation but reduced apoptosis and oxidative stress in Mg2+-free-treated HN-h cells. Target analysis showed that circUBQLN1 acted as a miR-155 sponge and miR-155-targeted SOX7. Moreover, circUBQLN1 could combine with miR-155 to regulate the SOX7 expression. Reverted assays indicated that circUBQLN1 overexpression alleviated the Mg2+-free-induced nerve injury by sponging miR-155, and knockdown of SOX7 abrogated the protective function of in-miR-155 or circUBQLN1 in the Mg2+-free-treated HN-h cells. Our data revealed that circUBQLN1 prevented nerve injury in Mg2+-free-treated HN-h cells by regulating the miR-155/SOX7 axis, showing that circUBQLN1 might be used as a biomolecular target for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening mental illness. Recently, the role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) management has been examined. The present study explored and clarified whether microRNA (miR)-135b-5p could play a role in depression by regulating the expression of SIRT1. SIRT1 was identified as the target gene of miR-135b-5p using TargetScan and the dual luciferase reporter assay. In addition, the expression levels of SIRT1 were significantly reduced in mouse peripheral blood and hippocampal tissue samples, while the expression of miR-135b-5p exhibited the opposite effects. Subsequently, the effects of miR-135b-5p inhibition were investigated in mice with depression. The results indicated that the miR-135b-5p inhibitor significantly increased the weight loss induced by CUMS compared with the model group, while reducing the expression levels of miR-135b-5p and further alleviating the depression-like behavior induced by CUMS. Concomitantly, the results indicated that the miR-135b-5p inhibitor inhibited CUMS-induced hippocampal cell apoptosis and significantly reduced the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 and the ratio of cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3. Moreover, the miR-135b-5p inhibitor significantly reduced the CUMS-induced increase of the inflammatory factors IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the hippocampal mouse samples, while significantly increasing the expression levels of SIRT1. Finally, the results demonstrated that all the effects of the miR-135b-5p inhibitor on CUMS-induced mice were significantly reversed by SIRT1 silencing. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the miR-135b-5p/SIRT1 pathway was a key mediator of antidepressant effects induced in depressed mice. Therefore, it could be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CUMS-induced depression.

AB  - YAP is a transcription cofactor in the Hippo pathway that interacts with the TEAD family of transcription factors in the nucleus to promote CTGF expression and stimulate cell growth. YAP hyperactivation is frequently observed in fibrotic diseases. The main kinases in the Hippo pathway, MST1/2, a member of the STE20 family, promote Lats phosphorylation, leading to YAP phosphorylation, which prevents its nuclear entry and thus inhibits cell growth. High cell density induces Lats phosphorylation, causing YAP phosphorylation and its exclusion from the nucleus. Additionally, energy stress, such as glucose deprivation, induces AMPK phosphorylation, which also prevents YAP from entering the nucleus. MST3, another member of the STE20 family, has been shown to regulate cell apoptosis, migration, polarization, and ion homeostasis in previous studies. We hypothesized that MST3 is involved in Hippo pathway-mediated fibrosis. To test this, we overexpressed HA-tagged MST3 (HA-MST3) and a kinase-dead mutant (HA-MST3-KD) in MDCK cells. When cells reached a high density, HA-MST3 was activated to phosphorylate YAP, promoting its nuclear exit and inhibiting cell growth. In contrast, HA-MST3-KD cells showed reduced phosphorylated YAP, resulting in YAP retention in the nucleus, continuous cell growth, and NIH/3T3 cell fibrosis. Interestingly, YAP did not exit the nucleus in HA-MST3KD cells treated with the YAP inhibitor verteporfin, but it did exit under metformin treatment due to energy stress, accompanied by increased AMPK and YAP phosphorylation, which inhibited MST3-KD-mediated fibrosis. These findings suggest that metformininduced AMPK activation could provide a therapeutic approach for MST3-KD-mediated fibrosis.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability. The activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the resulting production of nitric oxide (NO) via NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx play an exacerbating role in cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. The NO rapidly reacts with superoxide (O2- ) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a toxic molecule may modify proteins through tyrosine residue nitration, ultimately worsening neuronal damage. SIRT6 has been proven to be crucial in regulating cell proliferation, death, and aging in various pathological settings. We have previous reported that human SIRT6 tyrosine nitration decreased its intrinsic catalytic activity in vitro. However, the exact role of SIRT6 function in the process of cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury is not yet fully elucidated. Herein, we demonstrated that an increase in the nitration of SIRT6 led to reduce its enzymatic activity and aggravated hippocampal neuronal damage in a rat model of four-artery cerebral ischemia reperfusion. In addition, reducing SIRT6 nitration resulted in increase the activity of SIRT6, alleviating hippocampal neuronal damage. Moreover, SIRT6 nitration affected its downstream molecule activity such as PARP1 and GCN5, promoting the process of neuronal ischemic injury in rat hippocampus. Additionally, treatment with NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, or nNOS inhibitor 7-NI, and resveratrol (an antioxidant) diminished SIRT6 nitration and the catalytic activity of downstream molecules like PARP1 and GCN5, thereby reducing neuronal damage. Finally, in the biochemical regulation of SIRT6 activity, tyrosine 257 was essential for its activity and susceptibility to nitration. Replacing tyrosine 257 with phenylalanine in rat SIRT6 attenuated the death of SH-SY5Y neurocytes under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. These results may offer further understanding of SIRT6 function in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic diseases.

AB  - Background: The management of aggressive and progressive metastatic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is very difficult. An inverse relationship between radioiodine and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (``flip-flop'' phenomenon) is described for invasive PTC during dedifferentiation. However, no satisfactory biologic explanation for this phenomenon. Hypoxia is an important microenvironmental factor that promotes cancer progression and glycolysis. The Hippo-YAP is a highly conserved tumor suppressor pathway and contributes to cancer metabolic reprogramming. Thus, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of glucose/iodine metabolic reprogramming in PTC, focusing on the tumor hypoxia microenvironment and Hippo-YAP signaling. Methods: Immunohistochemistry staining was conducted to evaluate the expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), yes-associated protein (YAP), glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1) and sodium iodine symporter (NIS) in matched PTC and the adjacent noncancerous tissues. PTC cell lines were cultured under normoxic (20% O-2) and hypoxic (1% O-2) conditions and the glycolysis level and NIS expression were measured. Further, we characterized the molecular mechanism of glucose/iodine metabolic reprogramming in PTC cell. Finally, we validated the results in vivo by establishing subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Results: The expression levels of HIF1-alpha, YAP and GLUT1 were upregulated in PTC tissues and YAP expression was positively associated with HIF-1 alpha, GLUT1 and TNM stages. Meanwhile, the expression of NIS was negatively correlated with YAP. Further, in vitro studies indicated that hypoxia-induced YAP activation was critical for accelerating glycolysis and reducing NIS expression in PTC cells. Inhibition of YAP had the opposite effects in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Hypoxia inhibited the Hippo signaling pathway resulting in the inactivation of YAP phosphorylation, further promoting the nuclear localization of YAP in PTC cells. The mechanism is that hypoxic stress promoted YAP binding to HIF-1 alpha in the nucleus and maintained HIF-1 alpha protein stability. The YAP/HIF-1 alpha complex bound and directly activated the GLUT1 transcription to accelerate glycolysis. Meanwhile, HIF-1 alpha/YAP signaling might indirectly reduce the expression of NIS by promoting the output of MAPK signaling. In vivo studies confirmed the YAP-mediated reprogramming of glucose/iodine metabolism promoted PTC progression. Conclusions: Collectively, our data revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of the glucose/iodine metabolic program rewritten by HIF-1 alpha/YAP signaling in PTC. Inhibition of HIF-1 alpha/YAP signaling alone or in combination with other potential markers may effectively combat aggressive PTC.

AB  - Lifelong hippocampal neurogenesis is maintained by a pool of multipotent adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) residing in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG). The mechanisms guiding transition of NSCs from the developmental to the adult state remain unclear. We show here, by using nestin-based reporter mice deficient for cyclin D2, that the aNSC pool is established through cyclin D2-dependent proliferation during the first two weeks of life. The absence of cyclin D2 does not affect normal development of the dentate gyrus until birth but prevents postnatal formation of radial glia-like aNSCs. Furthermore, retroviral fate mapping reveals that aNSCs are born on-site from precursors located in the dentate gyrus shortly after birth. Taken together, our data identify the critical time window and the spatial location of the precursor divisions that generate the persistent population of aNSCs and demonstrate the central role of cyclin D2 in this process.
   A pool of adult neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus supports lifelong neurogenesis, but its origins are unclear. This pool is shown here to be established in mice through cyclin D2-dependent proliferation of on-site precursors in the early postnatal period.Cyclin D2 labels highly proliferating precursors in the mouse postnatal hippocampus. Cyclin D2 absence causes loss of radial glia-like neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus and failure of adult neurogenesis. Adult neural stem cells are generated in the dentate gyrus from on-site precursors. Adult neural stem cells are generated by cyclin D2-dependent mitosis during the first two weeks of life.
   This study identifies the temporal and spatial origins of adult neural stem cells that maintain lifelong neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus.

AB  - Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the commonest cause of age-related neurodegeneration but there are no available treatments with demonstrated disease-modifying actions. It is therefore relevant to study hitherto-unknown aspects of brain structure and function to seek new disease-related mecha-nisms that might be targeted by novel disease-modifying interventions. During hypothesis-generating proteomic investigations in a case-control study of sAD, we observed widespread elevations of hapto-globin and haemopexin in all six brain-regions studied, which together represent much of the brain. Measured perturbations were significant, with the posterior probability of upregulation generally >95% and haptoglobin doubling in expression levels on average across deep brain structures (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and cingulate gyrus) as well as sensory and motor cortices, and cerebellum. Hapto-globin and haemopexin are often regarded as circulating proteins whose main functions are to bind, respectively, the strongly pro-inflammatory extracellular haemoglobin and haeme molecules that form following haemolysis, thereby promoting their clearance and suppressing damage they might otherwise cause, for example, acute kidney injury. To our knowledge, elevations in neither cerebral haptoglobin nor haemopexin have previously been linked to the pathogenesis of sAD. Post-mortem examination of these cases showed no signs of macroscopic cerebral haemorrhage. These findings demonstrate pervasive cerebral elevation of haptoglobin and haemopexin, consistent with low-level intracerebral leakage of haemoglobin and consequent haeme formation throughout sAD brain. They point to a widespread un-derlying microvasculopathy that facilitates erythrocyte leakage, thereby triggering elevated tissue-free haemoglobin and driving the measured elevations in haptoglobin and haemopexin.

AB  - Sevoflurane (Sev) is a wildly used volatile anesthetic agent that induces neurotoxicity. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in Sev-induced neuronal injury. Here, we investigated the role of NF-kappaB-interacting lncRNA (NKILA) in Sev-treated human cortical neurons (HCN). From RT-qPCR, Sev dose-dependently increased HCN NKILA transcript expression. Neurotoxicity of Sev was detected using MTT, flow cytometry, Western blot-ting, and inflammatory mediator assays. Consequently, Sev reduced HCN viability and levels of Bcl-2, SOD, and GSH in HCN, and promoted HCN apoptosis rate and levels of cleaved-caspase-3, Bax, MDA, TNF-& alpha;, IL-6, and IL-1 & beta;. Silencing NKILA suppressed Sev-induced above effects. DIANA and starbase databases predicted the potential target relationship between miR-205-5p and NKILA or embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like 1 (ELAVL1); dual-luciferase and RIP confirmed these interactions. NKILA could increase ELAVL1 expression by regulating miR-205-5p. miR-205-5p overexpression and ELAVL1 knockdown could mimic effects of NKILA silencing in Sev-induced HCN. Deleting miR-205-5p and restoring ELAVL1 respectively abolished the neuroprotective ef-fect of NKILA knockdown and miR-205-5p upregulation under Sev anesthesia. In conclusion, Sev induced neuronal cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress through NKILA/miR-205-5p/ELAVL1 axis and caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 pathway. Inhibiting NKILA might be a potential therapeutic strategy for Sev neurotoxicity.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) in mice using CIR and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell models. The study evaluated brain tissue weight, pathological injury, and changes in the expression levels of TIMP2, p-ERK1/2 and NLRP3-mediated pyroptosisrelated proteins in brain tissues and hippocampal neurons of CIR mice using established methods such as dry/wet weight measurement, HE staining, qPCR, TUNEL assay, and Western blotting. The results demonstrated a significant increase in brain water content and neuronal apoptosis rate in the experimental groups compared with those in the control group. In particular, the I/R+TIMP2 group showed the highest increase. Additionally, the control group exhibited a clear brain tissue structure, neatly and densely arranged cells with normal morphology, and evenly stained and clear hippocampal tissues. However, the I/R group showed hippocampal structure disorders, interstitial edema, deep nuclear staining, karyopyknosis, and karyorrhexis in brain tissues. The study results further revealed that TIMP2 could aggravate the pathological damage of brain tissues in the I/R+TIMP2 group compared with the I/R group and significantly reduced it in the TIMP2-KD group. Furthermore, the Western blotting results demonstrated that the protein expression levels of TIMP2, p-ERK1/2, t-ERK1/2, NLRP3, IL-1 beta, IL-18, GSDMD, Caspase-1, and ASC in brain tissues and hippocampal neurons were significantly higher in the experimental groups than those in the control group. The I/R+TIMP2 group displaying the highest increase and the TIMP2-KD group showing a significant decrease. In conclusion, TIMP2 can contribute to the occurrence and progression of CIRI by activating NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.

AB  - Most SARS-CoV-2 proteins are translated from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). While the majority of these sgRNAs are monocistronic, some viral mRNAs encode more than one protein. One example is the ORF3a sgRNA that also encodes ORF3c, an enigmatic 41-amino-acid peptide. Here, we show that ORF3c is expressed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and suppresses RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated IFN-beta induction. ORF3c interacts with the signaling adaptor MAVS, induces its C-terminal cleavage, and inhibits the interaction of RIG-I with MAVS. The immunosuppressive activity of ORF3c is conserved among members of the subgenus sarbecovirus, including SARS-CoV and coronaviruses isolated from bats. Notably, however, the SARS-CoV-2 delta and kappa variants harbor premature stop codons in ORF3c, demonstrating that this reading frame is not essential for efficient viral replication in vivo and is likely compensated by other viral proteins. In agreement with this, disruption of ORF3c does not significantly affect SARS-CoV-2 replication in CaCo-2, CaLu-3, or Rhinolophus alcyone cells. In summary, we here identify ORF3c as an immune evasion factor of SARS-CoV-2 that suppresses innate sensing in infected cells.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia with cognitive impairment. Various plant-derived phenolics are known to alleviate cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease by radical scavenging and strengthening synaptic plasticity activities. Here, we examined the cognition-improving effect of Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. bark extract (PBE). We identified and quantified phenolics in the PBE using a UHPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. To evaluate the cognition-enhancing effects of PBE, scopolamine-induced amnesic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (5 weeks old) and ion channel antagonist-induced organotypic hippocampal slices of SD rats (7 days old) were used. Twenty-three phenolics were tentatively identified in PBE, 10 of which were quantified. Oral administration of PBE to the scopolamine-induced SD rats improved cognitive impairment in behavioral tests. PBE-fed SD rats showed significantly improved antioxidant indices (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and malondialdehyde content) and reduced acetylcholinesterase activity in hippocampal lysate compared with the scopolamine group. PBE increased the long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and rescued LTP from blockades by the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (scopolamine) and N-methyl-D-aspartate channel antagonist (2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) in the organotypic hippocampal slices. These results suggest that polyphenol-rich PBE is applicable as a cognition-improving agent due to its antioxidant properties and enhancement of LTP induction.

AB  - BackgroundNeural stem cells (NSCs) play a crucial role in the progress of ischemic stroke. Research on zebrafish embryonic demonstrates an association between Strawberry Notch 1 (Sbno1) and central nervous system development. However, the regulation and underlying mechanism of Sbno1 in NSCs have not been studied yet. Here, we investigated the role and the mechanism of Sbno1 in NSCs development and the potential therapeutic value of Sbno1 in ischemic stroke.MethodsAdeno-associated virus (AAV) was used for overexpression or knockdown of Sbno1 in vitro or in vivo. A mouse model of MCAO was established to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of AAV-Sbno1, including balance beam test, rotarod test, and strength evaluation. H&E and immunofluorescence assessed neuronal impairment. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of Sbno1 and its downstream target genes. RNA-seq and western blot were performed to explore further molecular mechanisms by which Sbno1 promoted endogenous repair of NSCs and macrophages M2 polarization. CCK8 was conducted to assess the effects of Sbno1 on NSCs proliferation. The impact of Sbno1 on NSCs apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. NSCs derived from small extracellular vesicles (sEV) were obtained using ultracentrifugation and identified through nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blot analysis.ResultsOur results showed that Sbno1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, which plays a crucial role in regulating the proliferation of NSCs through the PI3k-Akt-GSK3 beta-Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, with overexpression of Sbno1 in the hippocampus, post-stroke behavioral scores were superior to the wild-type mice, and immunofluorescence staining revealed an increased number of newly generated neurons.sEV released by NSCs overexpressing Sbno1 inhibited neuroinflammation, which mechanistically impaired the activation of the microglial NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways.ResultsOur results showed that Sbno1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, which plays a crucial role in regulating the proliferation of NSCs through the PI3k-Akt-GSK3 beta-Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

Additionally, NSCs overexpressing sbno1 improve ischemic stroke recovery and inhibit neuroinflammation after ischemia by sEV through the MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways.

AB  - Melanoma is a malignant tumor derived from melanocytes, which is the most fatal skin cancer. The present study aimed to explore and elucidate the candidate genes in melanoma and its underlying molecular mechanism. A total of 1,156 differentially expressed genes were obtained from the GSE46517 dataset of Gene Expression Omnibus database using the package "limma" in R. Based on two algorithms (LASSO and SVM-RFE), we obtained three candidate DEGs (LTBP4, CDHR1, and MARCKSL1). Among them, LTBP4 was identified as a diagnostic marker of melanoma (AUC = 0.985). Down-regulation of LTBP4 expression was identified in melanoma tissues and cells, which predicted poor prognosis of patients with melanoma. Cox analysis results discovered that LTBP4 with low expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with melanoma. LTBP4 inhibition reduced cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation and metastasis. These changes were correlated with the expression levels of caspase-3, Ki67 and E-cadherin. Further, as indicated by tumor formation study of nude mice, LTBP4 silencing improved the tumorigenic ability of melanoma cells. Knockdown of LTBP4 increased the percentage of active TGF beta 1 secreted by melanoma cells. CTGF, Gyr61, and Birc5 expression levels were reduced, YAP1 phosphorylation was inhibited, and YAP1 was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in melanoma cells treated with TGF-beta 1. These effects were reversed by LTBP4 overexpression. As evidenced by immunofluorescent staining, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay, LTBP4 overexpression activated the Hippo signaling pathway, which was characterized by the increased nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of YAP1 and the enhanced phosphorylation of YAP1, MST1, and MOB1. In addition, the effects of LTBP4 overexpression on inhibiting CTGF, Cyr61 and Birc5 expression, promoting the apoptosis, and inhibiting the metastasis and proliferation of melanoma cells were reversed by the overexpression of YAP1 or MST1. In conclusion, the LTBP4-TGF beta 1-Hippo-YAP1 axis is a critical pathway for the progression of skin melanoma.

AB  - With the progression of an aging society, cognitive aging has emerged as a pressing concern necessitating attention. The senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) model has proven instrumental in investigating the early stages of cognitive aging. Through an extensive examination of molecular changes in the brain cortex, utilizing integrated whole-genome transcriptomics, our principal aim was to uncover potential molecular targets with therapeutic applications and relevance to drug screening. Our investigation encompassed four distinct conditions, comparing the same strain at different time points (1 year vs. 16 weeks) and the same time point across different strains (SAMP8 vs. SAMR1), namely: physiological aging, accelerated aging, early events in accelerated aging, and late events in accelerated aging. Focusing on key functional alterations associated with aging in the brain, including neurogenesis, synapse dynamics, neurometabolism, and neuroinflammation, we identified candidate genes linked to these processes. Furthermore, employing protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, we identified pivotal hub genes involved in interactions within these functional domains. Additionally, gene-set perturbation analysis allowed us to uncover potential upstream genes or transcription factors that exhibited activation or inhibition across the four conditions. In summary, our comprehensive analysis of the SAMP8 mouse brain through whole-genome transcriptomics not only deepens our understanding of age-related changes but also lays the groundwork for a predictive model to facilitate drug screening for cognitive aging.

AB  - Aucubin, an iridoid glycoside, possesses beneficial bioactivities in many diseases, but little is known about its neuroprotective effects and mechanisms in brain ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. This study evaluated whether aucubin exhibited neuroprotective effects against IR injury in the hippocampal CA1 region through anti-inflammatory activity in gerbils. Aucubin (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally once a day for one week prior to IR. Neuroprotective effects of aucubin were assessed by neuronal nuclei (NeuN) immunofluorescence and Floro-Jade C (FJC) histofluorescence. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were evaluated using immunohistochemistry with anti-ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1 (Iba1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin1 beta (IL1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Changes in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway were assessed by measuring levels of TLR4, inhibitor of NF-kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha), and NF-kappa B p65 using Western blot. Aucubin treatment protected pyramidal neurons from IR injury. IR-induced microgliosis and astrogliosis were suppressed by aucubin treatment. IR-induced increases in IL1 beta and TNF alpha levels were significantly alleviated by the treatment. IR-induced upregulation of TLR4 and downregulation of I kappa B alpha were significantly prevented by aucubin treatment, and IR-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B was reversed by aucubin treatment. Briefly, aucubin exhibited neuroprotective effects against brain IR injury, which might be related to the attenuation of neuroinflammation through inhibiting the TLR-4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. These results suggest that aucubin pretreatment may be a potential approach for the protection of brain IR injury.

AB  - The neuronal excitotoxicity that follows reoxygenation after a hypoxic period may contribute to epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and various disorders that are related to inadequate supplement of oxygen in neurons. Therefore, counteracting the deleterious effects of post-hypoxic stress is an interesting strategy to treat a large spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that the expression of the key telomere protecting protein Trf2 decreases in the brain of mice submitted to a post-hypoxic stress. Moreover, downregulating the expression of Terf2 in hippocampal neural cells of unchallenged mice triggers an excitotoxicity-like phenotype including glutamate overexpression and behavioral alterations while overexpressing Terf2 in hippocampal neural cells of mice subjected to a post-hypoxic treatment prevents brain damages. Moreover, Terf2 overexpression in culture neurons counteracts the oxidative stress triggered by glutamate. Finally, we provide evidence that the effect of Terf2 downregulation on excitotoxicity involves Sirt3 repression leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. We propose that increasing the level of Terf2 expression is a potential strategy to reduce post-hypoxic stress damages.

AB  - Colombian creole breeds Blanco Orejinegro (BON) and Sanmartinero (SM) are widely used as pure breeds and in crossbreeding programs due to their excellent performance in the double ability of milk and meat production. We examined genomic regions and genes that from generation to generation have been selected by positive natural selection in favor of the adaptability and reproductive performance of these two Colombian creole breeds. Natural selection of genomics region and genes is one of the main evolutive changes resulting in phenotypic adaptations. The selected genomic regions can be detected by comparing differences in regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) between cattle populations with potential adaptations for economic traits. In this study, we used 58,868 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from BON and 57482 SNPs from SM, using genotyping data from 1262 BON and 742 SM animals to estimate the variation of genome-wide LD between populations using the VARLD program. The top 0.1 and 0.01th percentiles of standardized VarLD scores were used as a criterion for all comparisons. A total of 10 selection signatures on chromosomes 3, 5, 11, 15, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 29 were identified in all populations. These signatures overlapped with quantitative trait loci for adaptability and reproductive performance in both breeds. Within the signature located between 23,903,882 and 23,955,588 bp on chromosome 18, we identified the SLC6A2 gene involved in the response to high stress. Also, we identified the genes CTDSP2, CES1, CFAP161, CLEC14A, HIPK1, RBM4, SSTR involved in the expressions of economic traits (meat and milk production), KDMID, OLFML3 genes involved in reproductive traits (age at first calving and calving interval), and ATP23, LRRTM1, SLC6A2, DEK, SYT6, KDMID genes involved in cellular stress response and response to important environmental changes such as high temperature. We conclude that these genomic regions seem to point toward a recent selection in BON and SM populations. These regions can be used in selection and conservation programs.

AB  - Collagen type XVIII (COL18) is an abundant heparan sulfate proteoglycan in vascular basement membranes. Here, we asked (i) if the loss of COL18 would result in blood -brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, pathological alterations of small arteries and capillaries and neuroinflammation as found in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and (ii) if such changes may be associated with remodeling of synapses and neural extracellular matrix (ECM). We found that 5 -month -old Col18a1- /- mice had elevated BBB permeability for mouse IgG in the deep gray matter, and intravascular erythrocyte accumulations were observed brain -wide in capillaries and arterioles. BBB permeability increased with age and affected cortical regions and the hippocampus in 12 -month -old Col18a1-/- mice. None of the Col18a1-/- mice displayed hallmarks of advanced CSVD, such as hemorrhages, and did not show perivascular space enlargement. Col18a1 deficiency -induced BBB leakage was accompanied by activation of microglia and astrocytes, a loss of aggrecan in the ECM of perineuronal nets associated with fast -spiking inhibitory interneurons and accumulation of the perisynaptic ECM proteoglycan brevican and the microglial complement protein C1q at excitatory synapses. As the pathway underlying these regulations, we found increased signaling through the TGF-ss1/Smad3/TIMP-3 cascade. We verified the pivotal role of COL18 for small vessel wall structure in CSVD by demonstrating the protein's involvement in vascular remodeling in autopsy brains from patients with cerebral hypertensive arteriopathy. Our study highlights an association between the alterations of perivascular ECM, extracellular proteolysis, and perineuronal/perisynaptic ECM, as a possible substrate of synaptic and cognitive alterations in CSVD.

AB  - In the post-pandemic era, research on respiratory diseases should refocus on pathogens other than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Respiratory pathogens, highly infectious to children, with to different modes of infection, such as single-pathogen infections and co-infections. Understanding the seasonal patterns of these pathogens, alongside identifying single infections and co-infections and their impact on the pediatric immune status, is crucial for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in children. Our study found that from December 2023 to April 2024, the main co-infection combinations in children shifted from Mycoplasma pneumonia and influenza virus A (MP + IVA) to Bordetella pertussis and rhinovirus (BP + RhV). To explore the impact of these infections, two cohorts were established to analyze the effects of single and co- infections of four respiratory pathogens, MP, IVA, BP, and RhV, on the immune status of pediatric patients. Using multi-cytokine analysis, cytokines, such as PDGF-BB, that were differentially expressed between patients with single and co-infections were identified. Additionally, we observed that children with single-pathogen infections generally exhibited more severe conditions, as evidenced by higher overall cytokine expression than those with co-infections. Our findings provide an important theoretical basis for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of single and co-infections of respiratory pathogens and clinically differentiating pediatric patients with various respiratory infections.

AB  - Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), which is a cardiovascular complication, has become the foremost determinant of decreased quality of life and mortality among survivors of malignant tumors, in addition to recurrence and metastasis. The limited ability to accurately predict the occurrence and severity of doxorubicin-induced injury has greatly hindered the prevention of DIC, but reducing the dose to mitigate side effects may compromise the effective treatment of primary malignancies. This has posed a longstanding clinical challenge for oncologists and cardiologists. Ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes has been shown to be a pivotal mechanism underlying cardiac dysfunction in DIC. Ferroptosis is influenced by multiple factors. The innate immune response, as exemplified by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), may play a significant role in the regulation of ferroptosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of NETs in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and elucidate their regulatory role. This study confirmed the presence of NETs in DIC in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that depleting neutrophils effectively reduced the occurrence of doxorubicin-induced ferroptosis and myocardial injury in DIC. Additionally, our findings showed the pivotal role of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a critical molecule implicated in DIC and emphasized its involvement in the modulation of ferroptosis subsequent to NETs inhibition. Mechanistically, we obtained preliminary evidence suggesting that doxorubicin-induced NETs could modulate yes-associated protein (YAP) activity by releasing HMGB1, which subsequently bound to toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the cardiomyocyte membrane, thereby influencing cardiomyocyte ferroptosis in vitro. Our findings suggest that doxorubicin-induced NETs modulate cardiomyocyte ferroptosis via the HMGB1/TLR4/YAP axis, thereby contributing to myocardial injury. This study offers a novel approach for preventing and alleviating DIC by targeting alterations in the immune microenvironment.

AB  - Background Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a prevalent form of cognitive impairment in elderly patients following anesthesia and surgery. The underlying mechanisms of PND are closely related to perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs, which are complexes of extracellular matrix primarily surrounding neurons in the hippocampus, play a critical role in neurocognitive function. Connexin 43 (Cx43) contributes to cognitive function by modulating the components of PNNs. This study was designed to investigate the specific regulatory mechanisms of Cx43 on PNNs and its pivotal role in the development of PND.Methods Eighteen-month-old wild-type and Gja1 fl/fl C57BL/6 mice were subjected to abdominal surgery under 1.4% isoflurane anesthesia. Cognitive functions, particularly learning and memory, were evaluated via the Y-maze test, Barnes maze (BM) and contextual fear conditioning test (CFT). The mRNA and protein expression levels of Cx43 were assessed by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), western blotting and flow cytometry. The quantity of PNNs was measured by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and Aggrecan staining.Results Aged mice subjected to anesthesia and surgery exhibited deficits in hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions, which were accompanied by increased Cx43 mRNA and protein expression. Conditional knockout (cKO) of Cx43 in astrocytes alleviated cognitive deficits and promoted the number of PNNs and dendritic spines in the hippocampus by targeting Dmp1. Knockdown of Dmp1 attenuated the beneficial effects of Cx43 cKO on cognitive deficits induced by anesthesia and surgery.Conclusion Our findings indicate that anesthesia and surgery induce an increase in Cx43 expression, which inhibits the formation of PNNs and dendritic spines in hippocampus by suppressing Dmp1 transcription, leading to cognitive deficits in aged mice. These results offer new mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of PND and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - IntroductionThe Hippo pathway and its transcriptional effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are targets for cancer therapy. It is important to determine if the activation of one factor compensates for the inhibition of the other. Moreover, it is unknown if YAP/TAZ-directed perturbation affects cell-cell communication of non-malignant liver cells.Materials and MethodsTo investigate liver-specific phenotypes caused by YAP and TAZ inactivation, we generated mice with hepatocyte (HC) and biliary epithelial cell (BEC)-specific deletions for both factors (YAPKO, TAZKO and double knock-out (DKO)). Immunohistochemistry, single-cell sequencing, and proteomics were used to analyze liver tissues and serum.ResultsThe loss of BECs, liver fibrosis, and necrosis characterized livers from YAPKO and DKO mice. This phenotype was weakened in DKO tissues compared to specimens from YAPKO animals. After depletion of YAP in HCs and BECs, YAP expression was induced in non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) in a cholestasis-independent manner. YAP positivity was detected in subgroups of Kupffer cells (KCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). The secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CXCL11), fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) was increased in the serum of YAPKO animals. YAP activation in NPCs could contribute to inflammation via TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD)-dependent transcriptional regulation of secreted factors.ConclusionYAP inactivation in HCs and BECs causes liver damage, and concomitant TAZ deletion does not enhance but reduces this phenotype. Additionally, we present a new mechanism by which YAP contributes to cell-cell communication originating from NPCs.

AB  - Long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) is an oncogene found in various human cancers. However, it is unclear what role SNHG5 plays in activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and liver fibrosis. In this study, SNHG5 was found to be upregulated in activated HSCs in vitro and in primary HSCs isolated from fibrotic liver in vivo, and inhibition of SNHG5 suppressed HSC activation. Notably, Neurofibromin 2 (NF2), the main activator for Hippo signalling, was involved in the effects of SNHG5 on HSC activation. The interaction between SNHG5 and NF2 protein was further confirmed, and preventing the combination of the two could effectively block the effects of SNHG5 inhibition on EMT process and Hippo signaling. Additionally, higher SNHG5 was found in chronic hepatitis B patients and associated with the fibrosis stage. Altogether, we demonstrate that SNHG5 could serve as an activated HSCs regulator via regulating NF2 and Hippo pathway.
   LncRNA SNHG5 can regulate the Hippo pathway and EMT process by interacting with NF2 to mediate the activation of hepatic stellate cells.

AB  - Background: Naringin has demonstrated various neuroprotective effects; however, its anti-inflammatory and cognitive properties, particularly through the regulation of HMGB1-TLR4 and Klotho, have not been explored in the context of epilepsy. Method: Kindling was induced in Swiss albino mice by administering pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.). Naringin (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) was administered orally for 6 weeks. The severity of seizures was assessed using the Racine scale. Cognitive function was evaluated by measuring step-down latency and transfer latency. The levels of GABA, glutamate, IL-1 beta, IL-1R1, IL-6, HMGB1, TLR4, TNF-alpha, Klotho, and ADAM-10 were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. Results: Naringin significantly attenuated PTZ-induced seizures at both doses (p < 0.01 for 40 mg/kg; p < 0.0001 for 80 mg/kg) compared to the PTZ group. Additionally, it enhanced retention latency in both step-down latency (p < 0.01 for 40 mg/kg; p < 0.0001 for 80 mg/kg) and transfer latency (p < 0.05 for both doses) compared to the PTZ group. Furthermore, it increased Klotho and ADAM-10 levels in both the hippocampus and cortex (p < 0.01 for 40 mg/kg; p < 0.001 for 80 mg/kg, respectively). Levels of HMGB1, TLR4, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in both the hippocampus and cortex compared to the PTZ group. Conclusion: Naringin exhibited anti-epileptic effects by regulating neurotransmitter levels and preventing PTZ-induced kindling. Additionally, it demonstrated neuroprotective effects on cognition and attenuated neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that naringin may be a potential therapeutic agent for epilepsy-associated cognitive dysfunction, warranting further studies for clinical translation.

AB  - BackgroundIn vitro production of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provides opportunities for fundamental research, disease modeling, and large-scale production of HLA-matched HSPCs for therapeutic applications. However, a comprehensive understanding of the signaling mechanisms that regulate human hematopoiesis is needed to develop a more effective procedure for deriving HSPCs from hiPSCs.MethodsIn this study, we investigate the role of YAP during the hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs to HSPCs and erythrocytes using the isogenic YAP-overexpressing (YAP-S5A) and YAP-depleting (YAP-KD) hiPSCs to eliminate the effects of a genetic background variation.ResultsAlthough YAP is dispensable for maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of these hiPSCs, it affects the early cell-fate determination and hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs. Depleting YAP enhances the derivation efficiency of HSPCs from hiPSCs by inducing the mesodermal lineage commitment, promoting hematopoietic differentiation, and preventing the differentiation toward endothelial lineage. On the contrary, the overexpression of YAP reduced HSPCs yield by inducing the endodermal lineage commitment, suppressing hematopoietic differentiation, and promoting the differentiation toward endothelial lineage.ConclusionsExpression of YAP is crucial for the differentiation of hiPSC-derived HSPCs toward mature erythrocytes. We believe that by manipulating YAP activity using small molecules, the efficiency of the large-scale in vitro production system for generating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells for future therapeutic use could be improved.
   The present study demonstrated that the dynamic expression of YAP is crucial for controlling the hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs. Suppression of YAP activity in hiPSCs enhances their hematopoietic differentiation resulting in more than a 100-fold increase in HSPC yield. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to improve the efficiency of HSPC derivation from hiPSCs for future therapeutic applications.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and/or depletion are implicated in epilepsy and many neurodegenerative diseases. However, systematic investigation into how mtDNA alterations relate to epilepsy and neural degeneration is needed. Here, we established a mouse model in which mtDNA depletion is induced by the Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) protein UL12.5 in the brain led to an epileptic phenotype characterized by abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) patterns and increased neural excitability in hippocampus. We also found that UL12.5 mediated mtDNA depletion in neurons in vitro (rho-) causes epilepsy-like abnormal EEG. Caloric restriction (CR) or glucose restriction (GR) is a strategy proven to reduce epileptic activity, however GR mimetic 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), induced degeneration in mtDNA depleted neurons. Mechanistically, mtDNA depletion increased mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contacts, facilitating GR-induced mitochondrial calcium overload. Rho- neurons did not show changes in mitochondrial motility or membrane potential. Our study revealed an unexpected axis of mtDNA depletion, ER-mitochondrial contacts, and calcium overload in the rho- neuron model. Fasting-induced GR causes early motor dysfunction, accelerates epilepsy progression, and worsens neurodegeneration in UL12.5 mice. Importantly, the IP3R inhibitor 2-APB blocks the neurodegeneration induced by fasting. This is the first description of animal and neuronal models of mitochondrial epilepsy. Our findings with these models suggest that GR may not be a viable clinical intervention in patients with mtDNA depletion.

AB  - Propofol, a commonly used intravenous anesthetic, has been associated with neurodegeneration in the developing brain upon repeated exposure. Dexmedetomidine is an & alpha;2 adrenoceptor agonist that was previously reported to possess neuroprotective properties. Here, we confirmed the impacts of dexmedetomidine on propofol-induced neuroapoptosis and subsequent spatial learning and memory deficits in neonatal rats. We found that dexmedetomidine effectively mitigated propofol-induced spatial learning and memory impairments and improved aversive memory in developing rats. Dexmedetomidine reduced propofol-induced cell apoptosis in the hippocampus and modulated the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. Additionally, dexmedetomidine attenuated the propofol-induced increase of inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-& alpha;. The reduced phosphorylation levels of Akt and CREB levels by propofol were re-activated by dexmedetomidine. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that dexmedetomidine effectively mitigated propofol-induced cognitive and memory impairments in developing rats by modulating apoptosis and reducing inflammation via activating the Akt/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. These findings suggest potential strategies to protect the developing brain from the adverse effects of anesthetics and improve patient care in pediatric anesthesia practice.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (A beta) and hyper-phosphorylated tau are key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an accumulation of both proteins linked to hippocampal synaptic dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that A beta drives mis-localisation of tau from axons to synapses, resulting in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) internalisation and impaired excitatory synaptic function. These tau-driven synaptic impairments are thought to underlie the cognitive deficits in AD. Consequently, limiting the synapto-toxic effects of tau may prevent AD-related cognitive deficits. Increasing evidence links leptin dysfunction with higher AD risk, and numerous studies have identified neuroprotective properties of leptin in AD models of A beta-induced toxicity. However, it is unclear if leptin protects against tau-related synaptic dysfunction. Here we show that A beta(1-42) significantly increases dendritic and synaptic levels of tau and p-tau in hippocampal neurons, and these effects were blocked by leptin. In accordance with GSK-3 beta being involved in tau phosphorylation, the protective effects of leptin involve PI 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and inhibition of GSK-3 beta. A beta 1-42-driven synaptic targeting of tau was associated with the removal of GluA1-containing AMPARs from synapses, which was also inhibited by leptin-driven inhibition of GSK-3 beta. Direct application of oligomeric tau to hippocampal neurons caused internalisation of GluA1-containing AMPARs and this effect was blocked by prior application of leptin. Similarly, leptin prevented the ability of tau to block induction of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses. These findings increase our understanding of the neuroprotective actions of leptin in the early pre-clinical stages of AD and further validate the leptin system as a therapeutic target in AD.image

AB  - Curcumin has been reported to have a therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present research, we aimed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of curcumin on AD. Mouse primary hippocampal neuron cells were treated with various concentrations of beta-amyloid 42 (A beta(42)) and the results found that A beta(42) inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with 50 ng/mL A beta(42), 500 ng/mL A beta(42) could further promote cell apoptosis, reduce the ratio of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))/Nicotinamide adenine diphosphate hydride (NADH) and Adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) level, and inhibit Sirtuins 3 (SIRT3) deacetylation activity and protein expression of Thyroid hormone receptor beta (Thrb) and SIRT3. Hence, 500 ng/mL A beta(42) was used to establish a cell model of AD. Curcumin significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of A beta(42) on cell viability, SIRT3 deacetylation activity, the ratio of NAD(+)/NADH, ATP level and the protein expression of Thrb and SIRT3, and the promotive effect on apoptosis. ChIPBase was used to predict the binding region of Thrb and SIRT3. Dual luciferase reporter gene and Chromatin immune precipitation (ChIP) assays were employed to verify the relationship between Thrb and promoter of SIRT3 mRNA. Overexpression of Thrb recovered A beta(42) induced metabolic dysfunction, while Thrb silence aggravated A beta(42) induced metabolic dysfunction. Moreover, Thrb silence or 3-TYP (a selective inhibitor of SIRT3) treatment abolished the amelioration of curcumin on A beta(42) induced metabolic dysfunction. Additionally, curcumin attenuated memory deficits in Amyloid precursor protein transgenic (APP(TG)) mice. Collectively, curcumin alleviated A beta(42)-induced neuronal metabolic dysfunction through increasing Thrb expression and SIRT3 activity and improved cognition in APP(TG) mice.

AB  - Aims: Total flavones of Rhododendron (TFR) extracted from the flowers of Rhododendron contains bioactive components. We investigated the main components of TFR and explored the role of TFR in microglial polarization in poststroke mice with depression-like behavior.Results: Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we identified the main and potential active compounds in TFR as kaempferol, astragalin, epicatechin, myricetin, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercetin, and quercitrin. In addition, we demonstrated that TFR (60 and 120 mg/kg) efficiently ameliorated depression-like behavior in mice and promoted microglial polarization to the M2 subtype in the mouse hippocampal tissues. We also revealed that TFR (160 mg/L) facilitated microglial polarization to the M2 subtype following oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro. RNA sequencing revealed the upregulation of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) in the mouse brain tissues after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. TFR (120 mg/kg) inhibited NOX2 expression in the hippocampal tissues of cerebral I/R mice. In addition, TFR (160 mg/L) downregulated NOX2 expression in OGD/R-treated microglial cells and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Notably, NOX2 inhibition promoted microglial polarization to the M2 subtype.Conclusion and Innovation: TFR promotes microglial polarization to the M2 subtype by inhibiting the NOX2/ROS pathway.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from high levels of free radicals contributes to the initiation and progression of epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is associated with alteration in the structure and function of the hippocampus and is modeled in mice using kainic acid (KA). In this study, the neuroprotective effect of ellagic acid (EA) on KA-induced epilepsy in mice was evaluated. Sixty male Swiss albino mice were assigned to six groups: I received normal saline (NS; 10 ml/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)); II, received KA (15 mg/kg, i.p.); III, received diazepam (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and KA (15 mg/kg, i.p.); IV-VI, received EA (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, i.p.), and KA (15 mg/kg, i.p.). Treatments were done 30 min before KA injection. Seizure (latency, duration, activity) and mortality were monitored for 2 h post-injection. OS was evaluated by measuring MDA, NO, and GSH levels and CAT, SOD, and GPx activities. Levels of TNF-alpha in the brain tissue were measured. Furthermore, a histological examination of the hippocampus was carried out. Results: showed that EA pretreatment caused a decline in seizure activity score and duration compared to the KAtreated group. EA pretreatment reduced mortality in KA-treated mice. EA suppressed the generation of MDA and NO; whereas it preserved GSH and the activity of GPx, SOD, and CAT. Additionally, EA exerted antiinflammatory effects by reducing TNF-alpha level. Histopathologically, EA reduced KA-induced neuronal damage. EA demonstrated protective effects against KA-related epilepsy and brain damage. Due to its anti-inflammatory and radical scavenging properties, EA may be considered a potential therapeutic option in epilepsy.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia in the world. Increasing evidence has shown that exosomes from hypoxic pretreated adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) could be an effective cognitive function therapeutic in AD-associated pathophysiology. However, their role and regulatory mechanism remain largely unknown. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circRNAs from ADSCs or hypoxia pretreated ADSC exosomes. Luciferase reporter assays and RT-qPCR were used to investigate the relationships between circ-Epc1, miR-770-3p, and TREM2. APP/PS1 double transgenic AD model mice were then used to study therapeutic effects regarding circ-Epc1 in ADSC exosomes. BV2 cells were used to show the regulatory relationships between circ-Epc1, miR-770-3p, and TREM2 and to show how these interactions modulated phenotypic transformations and inflammatory cytokine expressions in microglia. The results showed that exosomes from hypoxia pretreated ADSCs had a good therapeutic effect on improving cognitive functions by decreasing neuronal damage in the hippocampus. High-throughput sequencing showed that circ-Epc1 played an important role in hypoxia-pretreated ADSC exosomes regarding their ability to improve cognitive functions. Luciferase reporter assays showed that TREM2 and miR-770-3p were downstream targets of circ-Epc1. Overexpressing miR-770-3p or downregulating TREM2 reversed the effects of circ-Epc1 on M2 microglia during lipopolysaccharide treatment. In vivo experiments showed that circ-Epc1-containing ADSC exosomes increased the therapeutic effect of exosomes by improving cognitive function, decreasing neuronal damage, and shifting hippocampal microglia from the M1 polarization to the M2 polarization stages. Taken together, the data show that hypoxic pretreatment of ADSC exosomes improved cognition by delivery of circ-Epc1 and by shifting microglial M1/M2 polarization in an AD mouse model.

AB  - Filial imprinting, a crucial ethological paradigm, provides insights into the neurobiology of early learning and its long-term impact on behaviour. To date, invasive techniques like autoradiography or lesions have been used to study it, limiting the exploration of whole brain networks. Recent advances in fMRI for avian brains now open new windows to explore bird's brain functions at the network level. We developed an fMRI technique for awake, newly hatched chicks, capturing BOLD signal changes during imprinting experiments. While early memory acquisition phases are understood, long-term storage and retrieval remain unclear. Our findings identified potential long-term storage of imprinting memories across a neural network, including the hippocampal formation, the medial striatum, the arcopallium, and the prefrontal-like nidopallium caudolaterale. This paradigm opens up new avenues for exploring the broader landscape of learning and memory in neonatal vertebrates, enhancing our understanding of behaviour and brain networks.
   Functional MRI of imprinting in awake chicks offers insights into the neural networks for memory acquisition and storage at birth. This discovery opens new avenues for noninvasive studies of neuro-cognitive processes in neonatal vertebrates.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is the key pathological mechanism of cognitive decline, and homocysteine (Hcy) plays a vital role in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis. However, the regulating mechanism and intervention targets of Hcy-induced mitochondrial damage involved in brain impairment remain unclear. Herein, it is found that elevated Hcy levels lead to the increasement of METTL4 expression and augmentation of N6-methyldeox-yadenosine (6 mA) modification in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) induced by maternal separation (MS) stress. Meanwhile, mtDNA copy number and gene expression level were suppressed in the hippocampus and the binding of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) to the mtDNA promoters can be obstructed, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and learning and memory impairment. Thus, there was a pivotal role of mtDNA 6 mA regulated by METTL4 in Hcy mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive damage in rat exposed to early life stress, and targeted regulation of Hcy to rectify mtDNA 6 mA excess may be a strategy for developing mitochondria-focused cognitive disorders interventions.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social interaction, impaired communication, and repetitive behaviors. ASD presents a 3:1 ratio of diagnosed boys and girls, raising the question regarding sexual dimorphic mechanisms underlying ASD symptoms, and their molecular basis. Here, we performed in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in juvenile male and female Tsc2(+/)(-) mice (an established genetic animal model of ASD). Moreover, behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations during social and repetitive tasks were analyzed. We found significant sexual dimorphisms in the levels of metabolites in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Further, we observed that female mutant animals had a differential social behavior and presented an increase in repetitive behavior. Importantly, while mutant females displayed a more simplified communication during social tasks, mutant males exhibited a similar less complex vocal repertoire but during repetitive tasks. These results hint toward sex-dependent alterations in molecular and metabolic pathways, which can lead to the sexual dimorphic behaviors and communication observed in social and repetitive environments.

AB  - Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a hydrolysis product of indole-3-methylglucosinolate, is toxic to herbivorous insects and pathogens. In mammals, I3C is extensively studied for its properties in cancer prevention and treatment. Produced in Brassicaceae, I3C reversibly inhibits root elongation in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition is partially explained by the antagonistic action of I3C on auxin signaling through TIR1. To further elucidate the mode of action of I3C in plants, we have employed a forward-genetic amiRNA screen that circumvents functional redundancy. We identified and characterized two amiRNA lines with impaired I3C response. The first line, ICT2, targets the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase family (PIP5K), exhibiting tolerance to I3C, while the second line, ICS1, targets the Wall-Associated Kinases (WAK1-3) family, showing susceptibility to I3C. Both lines maintain I3C-induced antagonism of auxin signaling, indicating that their phenotypes are due to auxin-independent mechanisms. Transcript profiling experiments reveal that both lines are transcriptionally primed to respond to I3C treatment. Physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analysis reveal that these kinases mediate numerous developmental processes and are involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses.

AB  - In this study, the incidence, timing and risk factors associated with abortion and perinatal mortality (PM) were described in dromedary camels under intensive management. In addition, overall pregnancy losses were also summarized and weekly risk of pregnancy wastage was determined throughout gestation. Data were collected over 11 breeding seasons from September 2006 through June 2017 at the world's largest camel dairy farm. A total of 229 abortions were observed (5.05%) out of 4533 pregnancies after 60 days (d) of gestation. Most abortions were singleton (n = 199, 86.9%), but twin abortions were also recorded in 30 cases (13.1%). Abortions showed a pronounced seasonal distribution, with a peak in August. The age category (P < 0.01), breed or ecotype of the female (P < 0.05) and bull influenced the occurrence of singleton abortions. Dromedaries with twins tended to abort earlier than those with a singleton fetus (median = 232.5 d vs. 257 d, P = 0.053). Perinatal mortality was observed in 174 cases (3.84%) out of 4533 pregnancies after 60 d of gestation. The condition included the premature birth of non-viable calves after shorter than normal gestation (330-350 d, n = 26, 14.9%), the birth of well-developed but dead calves after normal gestation length (n = 120, 69.0%) and neonates that died within 48 h after delivery (n = 28, 16.1%). The frequency distribution of PM was parallel with that of parturitions. The most important predisposing factor for PM was difficult calving. Thirty-nine percent (68 out of 174) of these losses were associated with dystocia. In addition, age category (P < 0.05) and parity of the female (P < 0.01), month of delivery (P < 0.05) and breeding season (P < 0.05) also affected the incidence of PM. The cause of 60 cases of PM (1.4% of all deliveries) could not be determined and was considered idiopathic. In conclusion, one-third of total pregnancy losses occurred during mid to late gestation. Approximately 10% of pregnancies after Day 60 failed, and 90% resulted in the birth of a live calf that survived beyond 48 h.

AB  - Tackling neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is particularly challenging due to the complexity of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, as well as the limited drug accessibility to the brain. The activation of tropomyosin-related kinase A (TRKA) receptor signaling by the nerve growth factor (NGF) or the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may combat neurodegeneration and regulate microglial function. In the present study, we synthesized a C-17-spiro-cyclopropyl DHEA derivative (ENT-A010), which was capable of activating TRKA. ENT-A010 protected PC12 cells against serum starvation-induced cell death, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons against NGF deprivation-induced apoptosis and hippocampal neurons against A beta-induced apoptosis. In addition, ENT-A010 pretreatment partially restored homeostatic features of microglia in the hippocampus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, enhanced A beta phagocytosis, and increased Ngf expression in microglia in vitro. In conclusion, the small molecule ENT-A010 elicited neuroprotective effects and modulated microglial function, thereby emerging as an interesting compound, which merits further study in the treatment of CNS disorders.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is widely recognized as the most important microbial pesticide controlling various insect pests and diseases due to its insecticidal crystal proteins (ICPs) and antimicrobial metabolites. The current study investigates the biocontrol potential of B. thuringiensis GBAC46 against the fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides and the insect pest Spodoptera frugiperda through multiple mechanisms. Phenotypic experiments revealed that GBAC46 effectively inhibited F. verticillioides growth by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and showed enhanced larvicidal activity against second instar S. frugiperda larvae. Pot experiments showed that feeding by S. frugiperda enhanced F. verticillioides infection in maize. The Bt strain GBAC46 effectively controlled both pests and diseases in greenhouse maize seedlings. Applying the Bt strain GBAC46 reduced feeding damage from S. frugiperda, decreased leaf yellowing and wilting caused by F. verticillioides, and improved growth indicators such as plant height, fresh weight, and dry weight. RT-qPCR results revealed that the Bt strain GBAC46 induced key defense genes in maize involved in activating salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene pathways. The overall study demonstrated and confirmed the GBAC46 strain as a promising microbial agent for disease and pest management.

AB  - Methcathinone (MCAT) is a psychostimulant of abuse that can cause both persistent striatal dopaminergic and serotonergic, as well as hippocampal serotonergic, deficits. Evidence suggests that the rapid effects of stimulants that are structurally and mechanistically similar to MCAT on monoamine transporter function may contribute to the abuse liability and/or persistent monoaminergic deficits caused by these agents. Thus, effects of MCAT on 1) striatal dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT); and 2) striatal and hippocampal serotonin transporter (SERT) function, as determined in tissues from adult male rats, were assessed. As reported previously, a single administration of MCAT rapidly (within 1 hr) decreases striatal [H-3]DA uptake. Similarly, incubation of rat synaptosomes with MCAT at 37celcius (but not 4C) decreased striatal [H-3]DA uptake. Incubation with MCAT likewise decreased [H-3]5HT but not vesicular [H-3]DA uptake. MCAT incubation in vitro was without effect on [H-3]DA uptake in striatal synaptosomes prepared from MCAT-treated rats. The decrease in [H-3]DA uptake caused by MCAT incubation: (a) reflected a decrease in V-max, with minimal change in K-m, and (b) was attenuated by co-incubation with the cell-permeable calcium chelator, N,N'-[1,2-ethanediylbis(oxy-2,1-phenylene)]bis[N-[2-[(acetyloxy)methoxy]-2-oxoethyl]-1,1'-bis[(acetyloxy)methyl] ester-glycine (BAPTA-AM), as well as the non-selective protein kinase-C (PKC) inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide-1 (BIM-1) and 2-[1-3(Aminopropyl)indol-3-yl]-3(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide (or Bisindolylmaleimide VIII; Ro-31-7549). Taken together, these results suggest that in vitro MCAT incubation may model important aspects of MCAT administration in vivo, and that calcium and PKC contribute to the in vitro effects of MCAT on DAT.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine detoxification prescription Chaihu-jia-Longgu-Muli decoction (CLMD) relieves depressive symptoms in patients withdrawing from methamphetamine. In the present study, we assessed the effects of CLMD on methamphetamine withdrawal in rats. A methamphetamine-intoxicated rat model was established. Rats were randomly divided into the control, model, high-dosage, medium-dosage, and low-dosage groups, receiving high, medium, and low doses of CLMD, respectively. Weekly body weight measurements revealed that rats treated with methamphetamine had the lowest body weight. The conditioned place preference (CPP) experiment revealed that methamphetamine-intoxicated rats stayed significantly longer in the drug-paired chamber than the control rats. However, after administering high-dosage CLMD, the amount of time the rats spent in the drug-paired chamber was significantly less than that of the model rats. Our open-field test revealed that the model group had lower crossing and rearing scores than the control group. Additionally, rats that received CLMD treatment exhibited higher crossing and rearing scores than the model rats. Striatal dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and endorphins (beta-EP) and serum interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-2 concentrations were estimated. Rats in the model group had lower striatal DA, 5-HT, and beta-EP and higher serum IL-1 alpha and IL-2 concentrations than those in the control group. High-dosage CLMD administration significantly changed the concentrations of these molecules, such that they approached normal concentrations. In general, CLMD could prevent the development of methamphetamine-induced withdrawal symptoms in rats by increasing the DA, 5-HT, and beta-EP and lowering the IL-1 alpha and IL-2 concentrations.

AB  - Indole is an important biomolecule in plants, essential for amino acid biosynthesis, defense, pollinator attraction and plant-plant communication. Its biosynthesis is reported to be catalyzed by standalone indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyases, which are, however, absent in core eudicots. Here we show that, in core eudicots, indole production for defense and signaling occurs through an alternative pathway. The tryptophan synthase alpha subunit (TSA), which is typically complexed with the beta subunit (TSB) to synthesize tryptophan through indole as an intermediate, can be hijacked by a noncatalytic paralog of TSB (TSB-like) to produce free indole. TSB-like is a pseudoenzyme that evolved from TSB by mutagenesis of two key essential residues, retaining the ability to allosterically activate TSA to allow formation and release of indole. The widespread occurrence and expression pattern of TSB-like genes in plants suggest that this is a general mechanism for the formation of free indole in plant defense and communication.

AB  - Currently, the number of stem-cell based experimental therapies in neurological injuries and neurodegenerative disorders has been massively increasing. Despite the fact that we still have not obtained strong evidence of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells' neurogenic effectiveness in vivo, research may need to focus on more appropriate sources that result in more therapeutically promising cell populations. In this study, we used dedifferentiated fat cells (DFAT) that are proven to demonstrate more pluripotent abilities in comparison with standard adipose stromal cells (ASCs). We used the ceiling culture method to establish DFAT cells and to optimize culture conditions with the use of a physioxic environment (5% O-2). We also performed neural differentiation tests and assessed the neurogenic and neuroprotective capability of both DFAT cells and ASCs. Our results show that DFAT cells may have a better ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neuron-like cells, both in culture supplemented with N21 and in co-culture with oxygen-glucose-deprived (OGD) hippocampal organotypic slice culture (OHC) in comparison with ASCs. Results also show that DFAT cells have a different secretory profile than ASCs after contact with injured tissue. In conclusion, DFAT cells constitute a distinct subpopulation and may be an alternative source in cell therapy for the treatment of nervous system disorders.

AB  - In recent years, the medical field had significantly progressed to a greater extent which was evidenced with increased life expectancy and decreased mortality rate. Due to the growth of medical field, numerous communicable diseases are prevented and eradicated, whereas the non-communicable disease incidence has been increased globally. One such non-communicable disease which threatens the global population is stroke. Stroke tends to be the second leading cause of death and disability in older population. In lower- and middle-income countries, increased incidence rate of stroke was also evidenced in younger population which is alarming. Lifestyle changes, poor physical activity, stress, consumption of alcohol, oral contraception, and smoking tend to be the causative agents of stroke. Since thrombus formation is the major pathology of stroke, drugs were targeted to thrombolysis. Currently thrombolytic, antiplatelet, and anticoagulant therapies were given for the stroke patients. But the recovery rate of stroke patients with available drugs is very slow. Hence, it is a need of today to discover a drug with increased recovery rate and decreased or nil side effects. Phytochemicals are the best options to treat such non-communicable chronic diseases. Visnagin is one such compound which is used to regulate blood pressure, treat kidney stones, tumors of bile duct, renal colic, and whooping cough. It possesses antiinflammatory, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective properties; it was also proven to treat epileptic seizures. In this study, the anti-ischemic effect of a furanochrome visnagin was assessed in in vivo rat model. Middle cerebral ischemic/reperfusion was induced in healthy male Sprague Dawley rats and treated with different concentrations of visnagin. The neuroprotective effect of visnagin against cerebral ischemia-induced rats was assessed by analyzing the neurological score, brain edema, infract volume, and Evans blue leakage. The antiinflammatory property of visnagin was assessed by quantifying proinflammatory cytokines in serum and brain tissues of cerebral ischemia-induced rats. Prostaglandin E-2, COX-2, and NF kappa-beta were estimated to assess the anti-ischemic effect of visnagin. Histopathological analysis with H&E staining was performed to confirm the neuroprotective effect of visnagin against cerebral ischemia. Our results authentically confirm that visnagin has prevented the inflammation in brain region of cerebral ischemia-induced rats. The neurological scoring and the quantification of PGE-2, COX-2, and NF kappa-beta prove the anti-ischemic effect of visnagin. Furthermore, the histopathological analysis of hippocampal region provides evidence to the neuroprotective effect of visnagin against cerebral ischemia. Overall, our study confirms visnagin as a potent alternative drug to treat stroke.

AB  - Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by a predisposition to generate seizures. Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiseizure drug that has demonstrated oxidant-antioxidant effects during the early stages of epilepsy in several animal models. However, the effect of LEV on oxidant-antioxidant activity during long-term epilepsy has not been studied. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of LEV on the concentrations of five antioxidant enzymes and on the levels of four oxidant stress markers in the hippocampus of rats with temporal lobe epilepsy at 5.7 months after status epilepticus (SE). The results revealed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly greater in the epileptic group (EPI) than in the control (CTRL), CTRL + LEV and EPI + LEV groups. No significant differences were found among the groups' oxidant markers. However, the ratios of SOD/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), SOD/glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and SOD/GPx + catalase (CAT) were greater in the EPI group than in the CTRL and EPI + LEV groups. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between SOD activity and GPx activity in the EPI + LEV group. LEV-mediated modulation of the antioxidant system appears to be time dependent; at 5.7 months after SE, the role of LEV may be as a stabilizer of the redox state.

AB  - Extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion is mediated by purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2RX7), an ATP-gated cation channel highly expressed in microglia. We have previously shown that administration of GSK1482160, a P2RX7 selective inhibitor, suppresses EV secretion from murine microglia and prevents tauopathy development, leading to the recovery of the hippocampal function in PS19 mice, expressing P301S tau mutant. It is yet unknown, however, whether the effect of GSK1482160 on EV secretion from glial cells is specifically regulated through P2RX7. Here we tested GSK1482160 on primary microglia and astrocytes isolated from C57BL/6 (WT) and P2rx7-/- mice and evaluated their EV secretion and phagocytotic activity of aggregated human tau (hTau) under ATP stimulation. GSK1482160 treatment and deletion of P2rx7 significantly reduced secretion of small and large EVs in microglia and astrocytes in both ATP stimulated or unstimulated condition as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, CD9 ELISA and immunoblotting of Tsg101 and Flotilin 1 using isolated EVs. GSK1482160 treatment had no effect on EV secretion from P2rx7-/- microglia while we observed significant reduction in the secretion of small EVs from P2rx7-/- astrocytes, suggesting its specific targeting of P2RX7 in EV secretion except small EV secretion from astrocytes. Finally, deletion of P2rx7 suppressed IL-1 beta secretion and phagocytosed misfolded tau from both microglia and astrocytes. Together, these findings show that GSK1482160 suppresses EV secretion from microglia and astrocytes in P2RX7-dependment manner, and P2RX7 critically regulates secretion of IL-1 beta and misfolded hTau, demonstrating as the viable target of suppressing EV-mediated neuroinflammation and tau propagation.

AB  - Background India's oilseed economy falls short of self-sufficiency and is supplemented by huge imports every year. Increasing national productivity of the major oilseeds is confronted with yield losses due to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. The productivity of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea Linnaeus), belonging to the family Brassicaceae, is significantly reduced due to damage caused by mustard aphids (Lipaphis erysimi Kaltenbach, Hemiptera: Aphididae). Rapid colonization by the nymphs makes it difficult to protect the crop through agrochemicals. Aphids release effector molecules to modulate the host-defence responses. Glucosinolates (GSLs) extensively found in Brassicaceae family, are hydrolysed by myrosinase into toxic compounds that deter herbivore insects. Methods Here, we investigated the differential activation of the glucosinolate-myrosinase pathway in mustard manifesting susceptibility and resistance to different aphid species. Mustard plants were challenged by two different aphid species mustard aphid and cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch, Hemiptera: Aphididae) leading to complete host-susceptibility in one case and resistance in the other, respectively. Differential regulation of the GSL biosynthetic pathway and myrosinase activity was assessed by gene expression study and ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC- QToF-ESL-MS). Results Gene expression study identified selective transcriptional attenuation of the key GSL biosynthetic and myrosinase gene in mustard when challenged with mustard aphid. In contrary, the activation of GSL biosynthetic genes in conjunction with myrosinase at the transcriptional level was profound in mustard, when challenged with cowpea aphid. UPLC-MS analysis showed higher turnover in the hydrolysis of glucosinolates by myrosinase which led to concomitant generation of glucose as byproduct in response to cowpea aphid in mustard plants. Conclusion GSL-myrosinase pathway is specifically attenuated by the successful aphid species in mustard and thus plays a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the B. juncea-aphid interaction. The results open up a new genetic modification strategy for developing resistance against aphids.

AB  - Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) E and M are major soybean alleles that confer resistance to leaf-chewing insects, and are particularly effective in combination. Flavonoids and/or isoflavonoids are classes of plant secondary metabolites that previous studies agree are the causative agents of resistance of these QTLs. However, all previous studies have compared soybean genotypes that are of dissimilar genetic backgrounds, leaving it questionable what metabolites are a result of the QTL rather than the genetic background. Here, we conducted a non-targeted mass spectrometry approach without liquid chromatography to identify differences in metabolite levels among QTLs E, M, and both (EM) that were introgressed into the background of the susceptible variety Benning. Our results found that E and M mainly confer low-level, global differences in distinct sets of metabolites. The isoflavonoid daidzein was the only metabolite that demonstrated major increases, specifically in insect-treated M and EM. Interestingly, M confers increased daidzein levels in response to insect, whereas E restores M's depleted daidzein levels in the absence of insect. Since daidzein levels do not parallel levels of resistance, our data suggest a novel mechanism that the QTLs confer resistance to insects by mediating changes in hundreds of metabolites, which would be difficult for the insect to evolve tolerance. Collective global metabolite differences conferred by E and M might explain the increased resistance of EM.</p>

AB  - Herbivory-induced responses in plants are typical examples of phenotypic plasticity, and their evolution is thought to be driven by herbivory. However, direct evidence of the role of induced responses in plant adaptive evolution to herbivores is scarce. Here, we experimentally evolve populations of an aquatic plant (Spirodela polyrhiza, giant duckweed) and its native herbivore (Lymnaea stagnalis, freshwater snail), testing whether herbivory drives rapid adaptive evolution in plant populations using a combination of bioassays, pool-sequencing, metabolite analyses, and amplicon metagenomics. We show that snail herbivory drove rapid phenotypic changes, increased herbivory resistance, and altered genotype frequencies in the plant populations. Additional bioassays suggest that evolutionary changes of induced responses contributed to the rapid increase of plant resistance to herbivory. This study provides direct evidence that herbivory-induced responses in plants can be subjected to selection and have an adaptive role by increasing resistance to herbivores.

AB  - GPR37 is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, a substrate of parkin which is linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) and affective disorders. In this study, we sought to address the effects of early life stress (ELS) by employing the paradigm of limited nesting material on emotional behaviors in adult GPR37 knockout (KO) mice. Our results showed that, while there was an adverse effect of ELS on various domains of emotional behaviors in wild type (WT) mice in a sex specific manner (anxiety in females, depression and context-dependent fear memory in males), GPR37KO mice subjected to ELS exhibited less deteriorated emotional behaviors. GPR37KO female mice under ELS conditions displayed reduced anxiety compared to WT mice. This was paralleled by lower plasma corticosterone in GPR37KO females and a lower increase in P-T286-CaMKII by ELS in the amygdala. GPR37KO male mice, under ELS conditions, showed better retention of hippocampal-dependent emotional processing in the passive avoidance behavioral task. GPR37KO male mice showed increased immobility in the forced swim task and increased P-T286-CaMKII in the ventral hippocampus under baseline conditions. Taken together, our data showed overall long-term effects of ELS-deleterious or beneficial depending on the genotype, sex of the mice and the emotional context.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Gene therapy that augments intrinsic neuroprotective pathways offers a promising strategy to mitigate neurodegeneration and prevent further cognitive loss. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a membrane lipid raft (MLR) scaffolding protein, regulates multiple pro-growth and pro-survival signaling pathways within plasmalemmal microdomains. Previously, we showed that AAV9-Synapsin-promoted Cav-1 (SynCav1) delivered to presymptomatic AD mice preserved cognitive functions and MLR-associated neurotrophic signaling. However, the therapeutic potential of SynCav1 delivered at the symptomatic stage of AD had not been tested. Therefore, the current study investigated the effect of hippocampal SynCav1 delivery at symptomatic age in two distinct preclinical AD models of amyloid pathology: PSAPP and APPKI mice. Our results demonstrated that SynCav1 delivery to PSAPP and APPKI mice at symptomatic age consistently preserved hippocampal-dependent memory. Transcriptome profiling revealed that PSAPP-SynCav1 mice exhibited a similar transcript profile to age-matched wild-type mice. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated downregulation of neurodegeneration-specific pathways and upregulation of synaptic and cognitive-related pathways in PSAPP-SynCav1 mice. In vitro, SynCav1-transfected mouse primary cortical neurons exhibited increased p-CaMKII and p-CREB expression, suggesting that SynCav1 may protect the CNS by enhancing neuronal and synaptic activity. Furthermore, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) was identified as a potential candidate mediating SynCav1's neuroprotective effects on cognition. Subcellular membrane fractionation revealed that SynCav1 preserved MLR-localized pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1R), a well-known regulator of ADNP expression. Together, these findings highlight SynCav1 as a unique and promising gene therapy candidate in the treatment of AD.

AB  - Patients with liver cirrhosis show hyperammonemia and peripheral inflammation and may show hepatic encephalopathy with cognitive impairment, reproduced by rats with chronic hyperammonemia. Peripheral inflammation induces neuroinflammation in hippocampus of hyperammonemic rats, altering neurotransmission and leading to cognitive impairment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may transmit pathological effects from the periphery to the brain. We hypothesized that EVs from peripheral blood would contribute to cognitive alterations in hyperammonemic rats. The aims were to assess whether EVs from plasma of hyperammonemic rats (HA-EVs) induce cognitive impairment and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Injection of HA-EVs impaired learning and memory, induced microglia and astrocytes activation and increased TNF alpha and IL-1 beta. Ex vivo incubation of hippocampal slices from control rats with HA-EVs reproduced these alterations. HA-EVs increased membrane expression of TNFR1, reduced membrane expression of TGF beta R2 and Smad7 and I kappa B alpha levels and increased I kappa B alpha phosphorylation. This led to increased activation of NF-kappa B and IL-1 beta production, altering membrane expression of NR2B, GluA1 and GluA2 subunits, which would be responsible for cognitive impairment. All these effects of HA-EVs were prevented by blocking TNF alpha, indicating that they were mediated by enhanced activation of TNFR1 by TNF alpha. We show that these mechanisms are very different from those leading to motor incoordination, which is due to altered GABAergic neurotransmission in cerebellum. This demonstrates that peripheral EVs play a key role in the transmission of peripheral alterations to the brain in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy, inducing neuroinflammation and altering neurotransmission in hippocampus, which in turn is responsible for the cognitive deficits.

AB  - Simple Summary The Martina Franca (MF) donkey breed primarily inhabits rural areas in the Apulia region of Italy, and, to a lesser extent, small farms in northern and central Italy. This study examined 91 MF donkeys from eight breeding stations in central and southern Italy. We assessed 27 morphological features of the donkey using a tape measure, Hauptner's hippometer, and digital animal scales. The MF Donkey and Murgese Horse Breeders' Association considers only three parameters for including the MF donkey in the studbook, as the height at withers, the thorax circumference, and the shin circumference. Our study found the mean values for these three parameters are highly representative of the population, with minimal dispersion up to a maximum of 10% across observed target measurements in both genders. This indicates the standard of the MF donkey has been maintained, while additional measurements suggest certain traits within the population denote uniformity. Sexual dimorphism was evident with females presenting with a greater distribution in angular measurements than males.Abstract The Martina Franca (MF) donkey breed (Equus asinus) primarily inhabits the rural areas surrounding the homonymous municipality, as well as neighboring municipalities in the provinces of Bari and Brindisi, all located in the Apulia region of Italy. The objective of this study was to assess the current phenotype through the evaluation of 27 morphologic measurements. The study was conducted on 73 female and 18 male breeding animals from eight different herds located in central and southern Italy. Statistical analysis was performed in order to demonstrate statistical differences between males and females, as well as sexual dimorphism and uniformity of all measurements in both genders. The results demonstrated that the mean of three parameters used for the evaluation of an MF donkey (height at withers, circumference of thorax, and shin circumference) are highly representative of the population, with minimal dispersion Cv<^> = 0.05-0.06 up to a maximum of 10%, as evidenced by relatively low standard deviations across observed measurements in both genders. Regarding sexual dimorphism, a statistically significant difference was found between males and females. This dimorphism is linked to reproductive activity and is useful during gestation. Overall, our findings suggest that the MF donkey phenotype has been largely preserved over time with high uniformity in males, slight inhomogeneity in the female population, and less variability in both genders.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of various heating temperatures on the antioxidant activities of camel milk caseins. The samples were processed with three different heat treatments: Pasteurization at low and high temperatures and boiling. Fresh camel milk (unheated) was used as a control. Camel milk caseins were separated by fast ion exchange liquid chromatography (FPLC) and identified by the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyamlamide gel electrophoresis (SDS page). The antioxidant activities of caseins were measured by three different in vitro methods: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power assay (FRAP). The antioxidant activity evaluated by the DPPH assay decreased significantly (p<0.05) with the increase in heat treatment of caseins. However, there was no significant difference in ABTS radical scavenging activity and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power assay (FRAP) of heat-treated camel caseins compared to unheated onesStill, a decrease was observed in those activities by the increase of temperature in the different casein concentrations. Besides, whatever the concentration tested and the methods applied, the antioxidant activity of beta-casein (beta-CN) was more pronounced than the alpha-casein (alpha-CN). Therefore, camel milk casein could be used as a natural source of antioxidants which may have a potential application in the food and nutraceutical industries. Throughout the different heat treatments applied, pasteurization at low temperature could be the most suitable alternative to preserve the antioxidant properties of camel milk.

AB  - Simple Summary In most high-income countries, piglets undergo certain elective surgical procedures such as castration and tail docking to eliminate behaviors that are associated with mortality and the condemnation of animals and meat. It has been well established that both castration and tail docking are both painful, yet there are limited products for addressing short-term and long-term pain. Lidocam (TM) Topical Gel (LTG) (4% lidocaine and 0.3% meloxicam) was developed to address the animal welfare and production requirements of the swine industry. The studies described in this paper show that applications of LTG to the scrotal area and tail base act to control the pain associated with these surgical procedure. The studies also demonstrate that LTG was able to control pain and inflammation at the surgical sites for at least 24 h after application. This was demonstrated by using established physiological and behavioral markers for surgical pain: plasma cortisol and substance P, vocalization during procedure, electrocutaneous stimulation of surgical site, and body weight gain. LTG is potentially an effective product for controlling pain and inflammation for use in castration and tail docking in piglets.Abstract (1) Background: It has been well established that castration and tail docking are both painful during and following the procedure, yet there are limited convenient and effective products to address both short-term and long-term pain. Lidocam Topical Gel (LTG) (4% lidocaine and 0.3% meloxicam) was developed to address industry needs for an effective and safe product to address animal welfare concerns regarding castration and tail docking in piglets. (2) Methods: Study 1: Male piglets aged 4-8 days of age were treated with LTG (n = 30) or a control gel (n = 30). Approximately 30 min after application of the gel, the piglets were surgically castrated and tail docked. The efficacy of pain control during the surgical procedures and post-procedure (24 h) pain and inflammation control were evaluated using both behavioral and physiological measurements. Study 2: Meloxicam residue depletion following LTG treatment was followed for 28 days. Study 3: Clinical and pathological safety were evaluated in five groups of eight piglets receiving LTG with: (1) no treatment, (2) nominal topical dose, (3) two times the nominal topical dose, (4) three times the nominal topical dose, and 5) one times the nominal topical dose and 2 mL of LTG by oral gavage daily for 3 days. (3) Results: LTG-treated piglets had a significant reduction in electrocutaneous stimulation response before the procedures and 4 and 24 h post-procedures. Stress vocalization intensity and duration were less in piglets receiving LTG during the surgical procedures. Plasma cortisol and substance P were significantly lower in LTG-treated piglets 3 h after castration and tail docking. The weight and average daily gain were significantly increased in piglets receiving LTG. LTG did not interfere with wound healing or cause irritation at the application sites. There were no abnormal clinical or pathological findings associated with the use of LTG at three times the nominal dose given daily for three days. As meloxicam persisted in the application site tissue, a slaughter withdrawal time of 24 days was determined. (4) Conclusions: When applied to the skin 30 min before castration and tail docking, LTG is effective in surgical pain control and provides post-surgical pain control for up to 24 h. LTG is safe for use in piglets and provides an acceptable withdrawal time for commercial use.
   LTG is a potentially effective product for commercial use for piglet castration and tail docking.

AB  - Several X-linked genes are involved in neuronal differentiation and may contribute to the generation of sex dimorphisms in the brain. Previous results showed that XX hypothalamic neurons grow faster, have longer axons, and exhibit higher expression of the neuritogenic gene neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) than XY before perinatal masculinization. Here we evaluated the participation of candidate X-linked genes in the development of these sex differences, focusing mainly on Kdm6a, a gene encoding for an H3K27 demethylase with functions controlling gene expression genome-wide. We established hypothalamic neuronal cultures from wild-type or transgenic Four Core Genotypes mice, a model that allows evaluating the effect of sex chromosomes independently of gonadal type. X-linked genes Kdm6a, Eif2s3x and Ddx3x showed higher expression in XX compared to XY neurons, regardless of gonadal sex. Moreover, Kdm6a expression pattern with higher mRNA levels in XX than XY did not change with age at E14, P0, and P60 in hypothalamus or under 17 beta-estradiol treatment in culture. Kdm6a pharmacological blockade by GSK-J4 reduced axonal length only in female neurons and decreased the expression of neuritogenic genes Neurod1, Neurod2 and Cdk5r1 in both sexes equally, while a sex-specific effect was observed in Ngn3. Finally, Kdm6a downregulation using siRNA reduced axonal length and Ngn3 expression only in female neurons, abolishing the sex differences observed in control conditions. Altogether, these results point to Kdm6a as a key mediator of the higher axogenesis and Ngn3 expression observed in XX neurons before the critical period of brain masculinization.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) increases predisposition to depression. We compared the effects of treatment with the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, on ELS-induced depressive-like behavior and the expression of microRNAs (miRs) associated with depression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampal CA1 area, lateral habenula and dorsal raphe in rats. We also examined the mRNA expression of serotonergic (htr1a and slc6a4) and endocannabinoid (cnr1, cnr2 and faah) targets in the mPFC following ELS and pharmacological treatment. Adult males and females exposed to the 'Limited Bedding and Nesting' ELS paradigm demonstrated a depressive-like phenotype and late-adolescence URB597 treatment, but not paroxetine, reversed this phenotype. In the mPFC, ELS downregulated miR-16 in males and miR-135a in females and URB597 treatment restored this effect. In ELS females, the increase in cnr2 and decrease in faah mRNAs in the mPFC were reversed by URB597 treatment. We show for the first time that URB597 reversed ELS-induced mPFC downregulation in specific miRs and stress-related behaviors, suggesting a novel mechanism for the beneficial effects of FAAH inhibition. The differential effects of ELS and URB597 on males and females highlight the importance of developing sex-specific treatment approaches.

AB  - The main objective of our study was to examine the protection of misoprostol (MP) on paclitaxel (PAX) side effects in rat brains. Twenty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were provided to form 4 groups, each containing seven rats: the control group was given 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl intraperitoneally (i.p.) and 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl orally for six days. In treatment groups, each rat was injected with 2 mg/kg PAX i.p. on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 of the study, and 0.2 mg/kg/day MP was given by oral gavage for six days. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) of tissue samples were measured. In immunohistochemical analyzes, it was observed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and cleaved caspase-3 expression in the cerebellum hippocampus and cerebral cortex were increased in the PAX group compared to the other groups. The increase in TNF-alpha and cleaved caspase-3 expression detected in PAX group rats were significantly decreased in the PAX + MP group. The results obtained in this study confirm the hypotheses that PAX can increase apoptosis in brain tissue both directly and through cytokines such as TNF-alpha. It also shows that MP can be used as a protective and therapeutic pharmacological agent against the harmful effects of PAX on brain tissue. In addition, it seems that the use of MP can improve PAX-induced brain damage by preventing oxidative damage.

AB  - Simple Summary In Thailand, the low fertility rate of Asian elephants has been identified. Factors contributing to poor semen quality in the elephants are not fully understood. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is related to male infertility. It plays an essential role in testicular development by stimulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and steroidogenesis. In addition, there is increasing evidence that IGF-1 plays a critical role in spermatogenesis. This may be conducive to finding the causes of poor sperm quality in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). In the present study, we investigated the relationships among serum IGF-1, serum testosterone level, and semen parameters in seven elephant bulls. The findings suggest that serum IGF-1 concentration is likely to predict sperm quality like acrosome integrity. The further mechanism by which IGF-1 affects sperm quality requires further investigation. The objective of this study was to find relationships among serum IGF-1, serum testosterone, seminal plasma IGF-1 concentrations and semen parameters in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). A total of 17 ejaculates (one to three ejaculates/bull) were collected from seven captive elephant bulls by performing rectal massage. Before each ejaculation, blood samples were obtained for serum IGF-1 and testosterone assays. Subsequently, the semen characteristics of each ejaculate were evaluated. Mean serum IGF-1 concentration of elephant bulls was estimated as 326.3 +/- 114.6 ng/mL (median, 286.2 ng/mL; range, 167.4-542.7 ng/mL). An increase in serum IGF-1 concentration was found to correlate with the percentage of spermatozoa with intact acrosomes. In addition, IGF-1 concentration was positively correlated with testosterone level. However, seminal IGF-1 concentrations could not be detected. In conclusion, our findings suggest that serum IGF-1 concentration is likely a biomarker of normal testicular functions, particularly spermatogenesis in elephants. Moreover, this commercial IGF-1 ELISA is eligible for analyzing serum IGF-1 concentration in Asian elephants.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the neurodegenerative disorders, is highly correlated with the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau and aggregation of beta-amyloid (A beta). Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and abnormal autophagy are key drivers of AD and how they contribute to neuropathology remains largely unknown. The flavonoid compound pongamol is reported to possess a variety of pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory. This study investigated the neuroprotective effect and its mechanisms of pongamol in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 cells, d-galactose/sodium nitrite/aluminum chloride (d-gal/NaNO2/AlCl3)-induced AD mice, and Caenorhabditis elegans models. Our research revealed that pongamol reduced the release of inflammatory factors IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, COX-2, and iNOS in LPS-induced BV2 cells. Pongamol also protected neurons and significantly restored memory function, inhibited Tau phosphorylation, downregulated A beta aggregation, and increased oxidoreductase activity in the hippocampus of AD mice. In addition, pongamol reversed the nuclear transfer of NF-kappa B and increased the levels of Beclin 1 and LC3 II/LC3 I. Most importantly, the anti-inflammatory and promoter autophagy effects of pongamol may be related to the regulation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, these results showed that pongamol has a potential neuroprotective effect, which greatly enriched the research on the pharmacological activity of pongamol for improving AD.

AB  - Cannabis vaping, particularly involving cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), rapidly delivers highly concentrated cannabinoids to the brain, potentially affecting the hippocampus. This study examined differential expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs in the hippocampus after acute exposure to vaporized CBD or THC. Male ICR mice were exposed to vaporized CBD or THC (50 mg, n = 5/group), and hippocampal tissues were collected at 1, 3, and 14 days post-exposure. Total RNA sequencing was conducted on day 1 samples, and selected transcripts were validated using qRT-PCR across multiple time points. CBD led to significant up- or downregulation of L3mbtl1, Wnt7a, and Camk2b at day 1. However, Wnt7a showed gradual recovery at days 3 and 14. In the THC group, Grin2a, Gria3, and Golga2 were significantly upregulated, while Drd1, Drd2, Gnal, and Adcy5 were significantly downregulated at day 1. Time-course analysis showed that Drd2 expression returned to baseline by day 14, whereas Adcy5 remained persistently downregulated through days 3 and 14. In the CBD group, NONMMUT069014.2 was upregulated, while NONMMUT033147.2 and NONMMUT072606.2 were downregulated at day 1; notably, NONMMUT072606.2 showed a transient increase at day 3 before returning to baseline. In the THC group, NONMMUT085523.1 and NONMMUT123548.1 were upregulated, whereas NONMMUT019734.2, NONMMUT057101.2, and NONMMUT004928.2 were downregulated, with most showing gradual recovery by day 14. Correlation analysis revealed that THC-responsive lncRNAs-including NONMMUT004928.2, NONMMUT057101.2, and NONMMUT019734.2-were strongly associated with downregulated mRNAs such as Drd2 and Adcy5. These findings highlight cannabinoid-specific hippocampal transcriptomic responses and suggest potential regulatory roles for lncRNA-mRNA interactions in cannabinoid-induced neural changes.

AB  - The impact of overnutrition early in life is not restricted to the onset of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but also affects critical brain functions related to cognition. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between peripheral metabolic and bioenergetic changes induced by a two-hit protocol and their impact on cognitive function in juvenile mice. Three-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet for 7 weeks, as-sociated with two low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) or vehicle. Despite the absence of obesity, HFD + STZ impaired glucose metabolism and induced a trend towards cholesterol increase. The two-hit protocol impaired recognition and spatial memories in juvenile mice, without inducing a depressive-like behavior. HFD + STZ mice presented increased immunoreactivity for GFAP and a trend towards a decrease in NeuN in the hippocampus. The treatment caused a bioen-ergetic impairment in the hippocampus, characterized by a decrease in both O 2 consumption related to ATP production and in the maximum respiratory capacity. The thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue was impaired by the two-hit protocol, here verified through the absence of a decrease in O 2 consumption after uncoupled protein-1 inhibition and an increase in the reserve respiratory capacity. Impaired mitochondrial function was also observed in the liver of HFD + STZ juvenile mice, but not in their heart. These results indicate that exposure to HFD + STZ early in life has a detrimental impact on the bioenergetic and mitochondrial function of tissues with metabolic and thermogenic activities, which is likely related to hippocampal metabolic changes and cognitive impairment.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a coronavirus-caused viral respiratory disease. MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that spreads between animals and humans. The objectives of this research include simulation of MERS-CoV spread using a customized animal disease spread model (i.e., customized stochastic model for the United Arab Emirates (UAE); analyzing the MERS-CoV spread and prevalence based on camel age groups and identifying the control MERS-CoV strategies to aid the decision-maker in the selection of the optimum strategy to control the spread of the disease. The results of this research conclude that movement control is the optimum "best" strategy to control the spread of MERS-CoV.Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a coronavirus-caused viral respiratory infection initially detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In UAE, high seroprevalence (97.1) of MERS-CoV in camels was reported in several Emirate of Abu Dhabi studies, including camels in zoos, public escorts, and slaughterhouses. The objectives of this research include simulation of MERS-CoV spread using a customized animal disease spread model (i.e., customized stochastic model for the UAE; analyzing the MERS-CoV spread and prevalence based on camels age groups and identifying the optimum control MERS-CoV strategy. This study found that controlling animal mobility is the best management technique for minimizing epidemic length and the number of affected farms. This study also found that disease dissemination differs amongst camels of three ages: camel kids under the age of one, young camels aged one to four, and adult camels aged four and up; because of their immunological state, kids, as well as adults, had greater infection rates. To save immunization costs, it is advised that certain age groups be targeted and that intense ad hoc unexpected vaccinations be avoided. According to the study, choosing the best technique must consider both efficacy and cost.

AB  - Introduction: Primary lymphoma of the paranasal sinuses, especially involving the frontal sinus, is exceedingly rare. Extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) located in the head and neck frequently poses diagnostic challenges because its nonspecific symptoms can be mistaken for benign issues such as rhinosinusitis. Aim: This case report seeks to emphasize the challenges in diagnosis, the aggressive characteristics, and the effective treatment of an uncommon manifestation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) primarily affecting the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Case presentation: We present a case of a 62-year-old male who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of acute rhinosinusitis complicated by periorbital cellulitis. Diagnostic workup included physical examination, laboratory investigations, computed tomography (CT) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathological (HP) analysis of biopsy specimens, immunohistochemical staining, and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. The patient presented with right frontal headache, periorbital edema, palpebral ptosis, and posterior rhinorrhea. Initial CT revealed mucosal thickening, lytic changes, and a mass partially invading the right orbit. Following surgical excision, histopathology confirmed DLBCL with positivity for cluster of differentiation (CD)20, CD79a, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-6, and Bcl-2, and a Ki-67 proliferation index of 90%. Subsequent MRI revealed a hypointense mass extending into surrounding structures. Staging CT confirmed stage IVB disease. The patient received six cycles of Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin (Doxorubicin), Oncovin (Vincristine), Prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the frontal sinus. At the 6-month and 12-month follow-up CT scans, there was no evidence of metabolically active disease on PET-CT (Deauville score 1). During the 2-year follow-up, the patient remained in complete remission. Conclusions: This case underscores the importance of considering malignancy in cases of atypical sinusitis and the crucial role of HP examination of biopsy specimens. This case also highlights the importance of considering malignancy in cases of atypical sinusitis.

AB  - As the core, tumorigenic downstream effectors of the Hippo signalling pathway, YAP/TAZ and the TEAD family of transcription factors represent attractive targets for drug discovery efforts within cancer research. This is particularly true in the context of pleural mesothelioma, in which there are many recent preclinical developments and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of TEAD inhibitors. The range of inhibitors has shown great promise, but comparisons of their performances are so far limited. Here, we develop a high-content pipeline that enables a comparative analysis of currently developed YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors. We take advantage of isogenic cellular models that enable us to examine inhibitor specificity. We identify genetic compensation of the Hippo pathway transcriptional module, with implications for therapeutic targeting, and implement Cell Painting to develop a detailed morphological profiling pipeline that enables further characterisation, quantification, and analysis of off-target effects. Our pipeline is scalable and allows us to establish specificity and comparative potency within cancer-relevant assays in a clinically relevant cellular model of pleural mesothelioma.

AB  - The role of processing bodies (P-bodies) in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is not well understood. Here, we showed that the oncogenes YAP/TAZ promote P-body formation in a series of cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, both transcriptional activation of the P-body-related genes SAMD4A, AJUBA, and WTIP and transcriptional suppression of the tumor suppressor gene PNRC1 are involved in enhancing the effects of YAP/TAZ on P-body formation in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. By reexpression of PNRC1 or knockdown of P-body core genes (DDX6, DCP1A, and LSM14A), we determined that disruption of P-bodies attenuates cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor growth induced by overexpression of YAP5SA in CRC. Analysis of a pancancer CRISPR screen database (DepMap) revealed co-dependencies between YAP/TEAD and the P-body core genes and correlations between the mRNA levels of SAMD4A, AJUBA, WTIP, PNRC1, and YAP target genes. Our study suggests that the P-body is a new downstream effector of YAP/TAZ, which implies that reexpression of PNRC1 or disruption of P-bodies is a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors with active YAP.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Increasing evidence supports that PD is not simply a motor disorder but a systemic disease leading to motor and non-motor symptoms, including memory loss and neuropsychiatric conditions, with poor management of the non-motor deficits by the existing dopaminergic medication. Oxidative stress is considered a contributing factor for nigrostriatal degeneration, while antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties of natural phyto-polyphenols have been suggested to have beneficial effects. The present study aimed to determine the contribution of monoaminergic neurotransmission on the anxiety-like phenotype in a rat rotenone PD model and evaluate the possible neuroprotective effects of black Corinthian currant, Vitis vinifera, consisting of antioxidant polyphenols. Rotenone-treated rats showed anxiety-like behavior and exploratory deficits, accompanied by changes in 5-HT, SERT and beta(2)-ARs expression in the prefrontal cortices, hippocampus and basolateral amygdala. Importantly, the motor and non-motor behavior, as well as 5-HT, SERT and beta(2)-ARs expression patterns of the PD-like phenotype were partially recovered by a supplementary diet with currants. Overall, our results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of Corinthian currants in rotenone-induced anxiety-like behavior may be mediated via corticolimbic serotonergic transmission.

AB  - (1) Background: Systemic infection is associated with increased neuroinflammation and accelerated cognitive decline in AD patients. Activated neutrophils produce neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMV), which are internalised by human brain microvascular endothelial cells and increase their permeability in vitro, suggesting that NMV play a role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity during infection. The current study investigated whether microRNA content of NMV from AD patients is significantly different compared to healthy controls and could impact cerebrovascular integrity. (2) Methods: Neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood samples of five AD and five healthy control donors without systemic infection were stimulated to produce NMV. MicroRNAs isolated from NMV were analysed by RNA-Seq, and online bioinformatic tools were used to identify significantly differentially expressed microRNAs in the NMV. Target and pathway analyses were performed to predict the impact of the candidate microRNAs on vascular integrity. (3) Results: There was no significant difference in either the number of neutrophils (p = 0.309) or the number of NMV (p = 0.3434) isolated from AD donors compared to control. However, 158 microRNAs were significantly dysregulated in AD NMV compared to controls, some of which were associated with BBB dysfunction, including miR-210, miR-20b-5p and miR-126-5p. Pathway analysis revealed numerous significantly affected pathways involved in regulating vascular integrity, including the TGF beta and PDGFB pathways, as well as Hippo, IL-2 and DNA damage signalling. (4) Conclusions: NMV from AD patients contain miRNAs that may alter the integrity of the BBB and represent a novel neutrophil-mediated mechanism for BBB dysfunction in AD and the accelerated cognitive decline seen as a result of a systemic infection.

AB  - Ginkgolide B (GB) is one of the main bioactive components of Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts with neuroprotective activity. However, the neuroprotective mechanism link between the anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) efficiency of GB and gut microbiota have remained elusive. Here, we elucidated the effect and possible mechanism of GB against cognitive impairment in mice. Male mice were induced with 6-galactose and aluminum chloride to establish an AD animal model, and then intragastrically treated with GB. Cognitive function was assessed by an object recognition test and an open-field test. Amyloid deposition and neuropathological change were detected. The levels of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Bcl-2, and Bax were detected. Moreover, microbial compositions were measured by 16s rRNA sequencing. Our results showed that GB significantly alleviated cognitive dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and neuropathological changes in AD model mice. Moreover, GB treatment remarkably reduced the levels of RAGE and Bax and increased the level of Bcl-2 in AD model mice. GB treatment reversed the decreased abundance of Lactobacillus and the increased abundance of Bacteroidales, Muribaculaceae, and Alloprevotella, which led to reconstruction of gut microbiota. These findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of GB in AD mice, which were partly mediated by modulating gut dysbiosis, indicating that GB might be a potentially active supplement to alleviate AD.

AB  - Polysaccharide from Polygonatum sibiricum (PSP) possesses antioxidant, antiaging, and neuroprotective activities. However, whether and how the steaming process influences the biological activities of PSP, especially against aging-related memory impairment, is not yet known. In this study, Polygonatum sibiricum rhizome was subjected to a "nine steaming and nine drying" process, then PSPs with different steaming times were abstracted. Thereafter, the physicochemical properties were qualified; the antioxidant activities of PSPs were evaluated in a D-gal-induced HT-22 cell model, and the effects of PSPs (PSP0, PSP5 and PSP9) on memory was evaluated using D-gal-injured mice. Our results showed that while the steamed PSPs had a low pH value and a large negative charge, they shared similar main chains and substituents. Cellular experiments showed that the antioxidant activity of steamed PSPs increased. PSP0, PSP5, and PSP9 could significantly ameliorate the memory impairment of D-gal-injured mice, with PSP5 showing the optimal effect. Meanwhile, PSP5 demonstrated the best effect in terms of preventing cell death and synaptic injury in D-gal-injured mice. Additionally, the steamed PSPs increased anti-oxidative stress-related protein expression and decreased inflammation-related protein expression in D-gal-injured mice. Collectively, the steaming process improves the effects of PSPs against D-gal-induced memory impairment in mice, likely by increasing the antioxidant activity of PSPs.

AB  - Slow-wave sleep (SWS), characterized by slow oscillations (SOs, <1Hz) of alternating active and silent states in the thalamocortical network, is a primary brain state during Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. In the last two decades, the traditional view of SWS as a global and uniform whole-brain state has been challenged by a growing body of evidence indicating that SO can be local and can coexist with wake-like activity. However, the mechanisms by which global and local SOs arise from micro-scale neuronal dynamics and network connectivity remain poorly understood. We developed a multi-scale, biophysically realistic human whole-brain thalamocortical network model capable of transitioning between the awake state and SWS, and we investigated the role of connectivity in the spatio-temporal dynamics of sleep SO. We found that the overall strength and a relative balance between long and short-range synaptic connections determined the network state. Importantly, for a range of synaptic strengths, the model demonstrated complex mixed SO states, where periods of synchronized global slow-wave activity were intermittent with the periods of asynchronous local slow-waves. An increase in the overall synaptic strength led to synchronized global SO, while a decrease in synaptic connectivity produced only local slow-waves that would not propagate beyond local areas. These results were compared to human data to validate probable models of biophysically realistic SO. The model producing mixed states provided the best match to the spatial coherence profile and the functional connectivity estimated from human subjects. These findings shed light on how the spatio-temporal properties of SO emerge from local and global cortical connectivity and provide a framework for further exploring the mechanisms and functions of SWS in health and disease.

AB  - Simple Summary Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease characterized by neuronal hyper electrical activity and the development of unprovoked seizures. Although several antiepileptic drugs are currently available, their application is associated with undesirable adverse effects. In an attempt to find a novel antiepileptic medication with minimum side effects, we have investigated the potential neuroprotective activity of prodigiosin, a red pigment produced by bacterial species that have important pharmaceutical and biological activities biosynthesized with selenium formulation (SeNPs-PDG) against a murine epileptic model mediated by pentylenetetrazole. The main recorded findings revealed that SeNPs-PDG delayed the onset of epileptic seizures and decreased their duration significantly. Additionally, SeNPs-PDG prevented hippocampal cell loss, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, restored the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and notably normalized the monoaminergic and cholinergic transmission. These promising findings indicate that SeNPs-PDG might serve as a naturally derived anticonvulsant agent due to their active antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory properties. Background: Prodigiosin (PDG) is a red pigment synthesized by bacterial species with important pharmaceutical and biological activities. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective and anticonvulsant activities of green biosynthesized selenium formulations with PDG (SeNPs-PDG) versus pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epileptic seizures. Methods: Rats were assigned into six experimental groups: control; PTZ (60 mg/kg, epileptic model); sodium valproate (200 mg/kg) + PTZ; PDG (300 mg/kg) + PTZ; sodium selenite (0.5 mg/kg) + PTZ; and SeNPs-PDG (0.5 mg/kg) + PTZ. The treatment duration is extended to 28 days. Results: SeNPs-PDG pre-treatment delayed seizures onset and reduced duration upon PTZ injection. Additionally, SeNPs-PDG enhanced the antioxidant capacity of hippocampal tissue by activating the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and innate antioxidants (glutathione and glutathione derivatives, in addition to superoxide dismutase and catalase) and decreasing the levels of pro-oxidants (lipoperoxidation products and nitric oxide). SeNPs-PDG administration inhibited inflammatory reactions associated with epileptic seizure development by suppressing the production and activity of glial fibrillary acidic protein and pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nuclear factor kappa B. Moreover, SeNPs-PDG protected against hippocampal cell loss following PTZ injection by decreasing the levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, Bax, and caspase-3 and enhancing the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Interestingly, SeNPs-PDG restored the PTZ-induced imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory amino acids and improved monoaminergic and cholinergic transmission. Conclusions: These promising antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory activities indicate that SeNPs-PDG might serve as a naturally derived anticonvulsant agent.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is age-related progressive neurological dysfunction. Limited clinical benefits for current treatments indicate an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Previous transcriptomic analysis showed that DMP1 expression level was increased in AD model animals whereas it can induce cell-cycle arrest in several cell lines. However, whether the cell-cycle arrest of neural progenitor cell induced by DMP1 affects cognitive function in Alzheimer-like mice still remains unknown. The objective of our study is to explore the issue. We found that DMP1 is correlated with cognitive function based on the clinical genomic analysis of ADNI database. The negative role of DMP1 on neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation was revealed by silencing and overexpressing DMP1 in vitro. Furthermore, silencing DMP1 could increase the number of NPCs and improve cognitive function in Alzheimer-like mice, through decreasing P53 and P21 levels, which suggested that DMP1-induced cell-cycle arrest could influence cognitive function.

AB  - Sperm is the key media between the father's aberrant exposure and the offspring's phenotype. Whether paternal hypertension affects offspring through sperm epigenetics remains to be explored. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we constructed a hypertensive mice model induced by drinking L-NAME and found that spermatocytes and spermatids in the testis were increased significantly after L-NAME treatment. The sequencing of sperm showed that tsRNA profiles changed with 315 tsRNAs (195 up-regulated and 120 down-regulated) altered. Meanwhile, KEGG pathway analysis showed that the target genes of these altered tsRNAs were involved in influencing some important signaling pathways, such as the cAMP signaling path, the mTOR signaling path, the Hippo signaling path, and the Ras signaling path. Bioinformatics of tsRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathway interactions revealed several ceRNA mechanisms, such as tsRNA-00051, the ceRNA of miR-128-1-5p, co-targeting Agap1. This study provides evidence for enriching and further understanding the pathophysiology and paternal epigenetic mechanisms of testicular reproduction, as well as contributing to a rethinking of the transgenerational reprogramming mechanisms of paternal exposure in hypertension.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Between 27 January and 26 February 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients in Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. We identified distinct signatures of microbial dysbiosis among severely ill COVID-19 patients on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Co-detection of other human respiratory viruses (including human alphaherpesvirus 1, rhinovirus B, and human orthopneumovirus) was demonstrated in 30.8% (4/13) of the severely ill patients, but not in any of the mildly affected patients. Notably, the predominant respiratory microbial taxa of severely ill patients were Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Mycoplasma spp. (including M. hominis and M. orale). The presence of the former two bacterial taxa was also confirmed by clinical cultures of respiratory specimens (expectorated sputum or nasal secretions) in 23.1% (3/13) of the severe cases. Finally, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes was demonstrated in one severely ill patient, which might accelerate his disease deterioration and death occurring one month after ICU admission. Our findings point to SARS-CoV-2-related microbial dysbiosis and various antibiotic-resistant respiratory microbes/pathogens in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity. Detection and tracking strategies are needed to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance, improve the treatment regimen and clinical outcomes of hospitalized, severely ill COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Over 10 million people worldwide live with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 4% of affected people are diagnosed before the age of 50. Research on early PD-related pathways is therefore of considerable importance. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a family of calcium-activated enzymes that, through post-translational deimination of arginine to citrulline, contribute to changes in protein function, including in pathological processes. Recent studies have highlighted roles for PADs in a range of neurological disorders including PD, but overall, investigations on PADs in Lewy body disease (LBD), including PD, are still scarce. Hence, the current pilot study aimed at performing an immunohistochemistry screen of post-mortem human brain sections from Braak stages 4-6 from PD patients, as well as patients with incidental LBD (ILBD). We assessed differences in PAD isozyme detection (assessing all five PADs), in total protein deimination/citrullination and histone H3 deimination-which is an indicator of epigenetic changes and extracellular trap formation (ETosis), which can elicit immune responses and has involvement in pathogenic conditions. The findings of our pilot study indicate that PADs and deimination are increased in cingulate cortex and hippocampus, particularly in earlier stages of the disease. PAD2 and PAD3 were the most strongly upregulated PAD isozymes, with some elevation also observed for PAD1, while PAD4 and PAD6 increase was less marked in PD brains. Total protein deimination and histone H3 deimination were furthermore increased in PD brains, with a considerable increase at earlier Braak stages, compared with controls. Our findings point to a significant contribution of PADs, which may further aid early disease biomarker discovery, in PD and other LBDs.

AB  - Alhagi maurorum (camelthorn) is one of the popular medicinal plants. The plant has many pharmaceutical uses in traditional medicine. In this study, nickel nanoparticles were synthesized according to green chemistry rules using the aqueous extract of A. maurorum. The green-synthesized NiNPs were characterized using different techniques such as EDX, FE-SEM, XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR. The FE-SEM results confirm spherical morphology for the nanoparticles with size of 20.56-36.63 nm. In the oncological part of the present study, the treated cells with NiNPs were assessed by MTT assay for 48 h about the cytotoxicity and anti-human ovarian cancer properties on normal (HUVEC) and ovarian cancer cell lines i.e. OVCAR-3, ES-2, TOV-21G, OV-90 and UWB1.289. The viability of malignant ovarian cell lines reduced dose-dependently in the presence of NiNPs. The IC50 of NiNPs was 191, 312, 250, 396 and 241 mu g/mL against OVCAR-3, ES-2, TOV-21G, OV-90 and UWB1.289 cell lines respectively.

AB  - Obesity leads to a number of health problems, including learning and memory deficits that can be passed on to the offspring via a developmental programming process. However, the mechanisms involved in the deleterious effects of obesity on cognition remain largely unknown. This study aimed to assess the impact of obesity on the production of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) in the brain and its relationship with the learning deficits displayed by obese individuals. We also sought to determine whether the effects of obesity on brain sphingolipid synthesis could be passed on to the offspring. Learning abilities and brain concentration of sphingolipids in male and female control and obese founder rats (F0) and their offspring (F1) were evaluated, respectively, by the novel object recognition test and by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, a global lipidome profiling of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was performed. Both male and female F0 rats showed impaired learning and increased concentrations of ceramides and sphingomyelins in the hippocampus and frontal cortex compared to their control counterparts. However, the overall lipidome profile of these brain regions did not change with obesity. Remarkably, the alterations in brain sphingolipid synthesis, as well as the cognitive impairment induced by obesity, were also present in adult F1 male rats born to obese mothers or sired by obese fathers and were associated with enhanced expression of mRNAs coding for enzymes involved in the de novo synthesis of ceramides. These results show that the cognitive deficits and impaired sphingolipid metabolism induced by obesity can be transmitted to the offspring through both the maternal and paternal lineages and suggest that an increase in the brain concentration of sphingolipids could play a causal role in the cognitive deficits associated with obesity.image

AB  - The effect of high concentrations of glutamate (Glu) on primary cultures of neurons from the rat brain led to a strong depolarization of mitochondria, which developed synchronously with a secondary increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration (delayed calcium deregulation, DCD). Simultaneously with measurements of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)), pH was measured in the mitochondrial matrix (pH(m)) and cytosol (pH(c)) of neurons when exposed to a toxic dose of Glu (100 mu M). For this purpose, pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein mtYFP in mitochondria and pH-sensitive red fluorescent protein mKate in cytosol were expressed in primary cultures from the hippocampus of newborn rats. The resulting neuronal culture was loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fura-FF; [Ca2+](i), pH(m) and pH(c) were simultaneously measured in those neurons that expressed both mtYFP and mKate. It was found that during the first phase of the [Ca2+](i) response to Glu, when partial depolarization of mitochondria was observed, there was an increase in the pH gradient between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol (Delta pH), which compensated for the decrease in the electrical component of the mitochondrial potential (Delta Psi(m)), thereby maintaining the constancy of the electrochemical potential of mitochondria. The development of DCD led to an abrupt decrease in Delta Psi(m) and Delta pH in the soma of neurons; however, a complete collapse of Delta pH was not observed. This may mean that DCD was not caused by a nonspecific megapore in the inner mitochondrial membrane (mPTP), as is commonly believed. Alternatively, part of the mitochondria in the soma of neurons could retain the barrier properties of the inner membrane and did not form mPTP even with the development of DCD and reaching a high [Ca2+](i) plateau.

AB  - Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common dementia causing progressive loss of memory and compromised cognitive functions. Although the neurotoxic mechanisms underlying AD have yet to be fully elucidated, hyperglycemia seems to trigger oxidative and inflammatory responses in the brain of afflicted patients. Removal of free radicals reduces the neurotoxic effects of hyperglycemia in AD models. In this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of the antioxidant phytoconstituents oleuropein (OLE), rutin (RUT), luteolin (LUT) and Sallylcysteine (SAC) in an experimental model combining the exposure to high glucose (HG, mimicking chronic hyperglycemia) plus amyloid-? peptide 1?42 (A?1-42, mimicking AD) in primary hippocampal neurons. Cells were pre-treated with OLE, RUT, LUT or SAC (10?1000 nM), and then co-treated with high glucose (GLU, 150 mM) for 24 h plus 500 nM oligomeric A?1-42 for 24 h more. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation were assessed as indices of survival/toxicity and oxidative stress, respectively. Activity/expression of antioxidant enzymes, toxic adducts, inflammatory molecules, mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) and the pattern of amyloid aggregation were also assessed. The GLU + A?1-42 treatment significantly decreased cell viability, increased ROS formation, reduced superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities, augmented Advanced Glycation End Products- and 4-hydroxynonenal-adducts generation, increased 3-nitrotyrosine and inflammatory outcomes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin 1? and Tumor Necrosis Factor ?, decreased MMP and augmented amyloid aggregation. All phytoconstituents reduced in a differential manner all toxic endpoints, with SAC showing the highest efficacy in preventing loss of cell viability and oxidative damage, whereas RUT was most efficacious in mitigating inflammatory endpoints. Combined, the results of this study suggest that protection afforded by these compounds against GLU + A?1-42-induced cell damage in hippocampal neurons is attributable to their properties as redox modulators, which might act through a concerted mechanism oriented to reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

AB  - During the first cell fate decision in mammalian embryos, the inner cell mass cells, which will give rise to the embryo proper and other extraembryonic tissues, segregate from the trophectoderm cells, the precursors of the placenta. Cell fate segregation proceeds in a gradual manner encompassing two rounds of cell division, as well as cell positional and morphological changes. While it is known that the activity of the Hippo signaling pathway and the subcellular localization of its downstream effector YAP dictate lineage specific gene expression, the response of YAP to these dynamic cellular changes remains incompletely understood. Here we address these questions by quantitative live imaging of endogenously tagged YAP while simultaneously monitoring geometric cellular features and cell cycle progression throughout cell fate segregation. We apply a probabilistic model to our dynamic data, providing a quantitative characterization of the mutual effects of YAP and cellular relative exposed area, which has previously been shown to correlate with subcellular YAP localization in fixed samples. Additionally, we study how nuclear YAP levels are influenced by other factors, such as the decreasing pool of maternally provided YAP that is partitioned to daughter cells through cleavage divisions, cell cycle-associated nuclear volume changes, and a delay after divisions in adjusting YAP levels to new cell positions. Interestingly, we find that establishing low nuclear YAP levels required for the inner cell mass fate is largely achieved by passive cell cycle-associated mechanisms. Moreover, contrary to expectations, we find that mechanical perturbations that result in cell and nuclear shape changes do not influence YAP localization in the embryo. Together our work identifies how various inputs are integrated over a dynamic developmental time course to shape the levels of a key molecular determinant of the first cell fate choice.

AB  - Acetylcholine (ACh), released in the hippocampus from fibers originating in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) complex, is crucial for learning and memory. The CA2 region of the hippocampus has received increasing attention in the context of social memory. However, the contribution of ACh to this process remains unclear. Here, we show that in mice, ACh controls social memory. Specifically, MSDB cholinergic neurons inhibition impairs social novelty discrimination, meaning the propensity of a mouse to interact with a novel rather than a familiar conspecific. This effect is mimicked by a selective antagonist of nicotinic AChRs delivered in CA2. Ex vivo recordings from hippocampal slices provide insight into the underlying mechanism, as activation of nAChRs by nicotine increases the excitatory drive to CA2 principal cells via disinhibition. In line with this observation, optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in MSDB increases the firing of CA2 principal cells in vivo. These results point to nAChRs as essential players in social novelty discrimination by controlling inhibition in the CA2 region.

AB  - Arthritides are a highly heterogeneous group of disorders that include two major clinical entities, localized joint disorders such as osteoarthritis (OA) and systemic autoimmune-driven diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Arthritides are characterized by chronic debilitating musculoskeletal conditions and systemic chronic inflammation. Poor mental health is also one of the most common comorbidities of arthritides. Depressive symptoms which are most prevalent, negatively impact patient global assessment diminishing the probability of achieving the target of clinical remission. Here, we investigated new insights into mechanisms that link different joint disorders to poor mental health, and to this issue, we explored the action of the synovial fluid-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on neuronal function. Our data show that the exposure of neurons to different concentrations of EVs derived from both RA and OA synovial fluids (RA-EVs and OA-EVs) leads to increased excitatory synaptic transmission but acts on specific modifications on excitatory or inhibitory synapses, as evidenced by electrophysiological and confocal experiments carried out in hippocampal cultures. The treatment of neurons with EVs membrane is also responsible for generating similar effects to those found with intact EVs suggesting that changes in neuronal ability arise upon EVs membrane molecules ' interactions with neurons. In humans with arthritides, we found that nearly half of patients (37.5%) showed clinically significant psychiatric symptoms (CGIs score >= 3), and at least mild anxiety (HAM-A >= 7) or depression (MADRS and HAM-D >= 7); interestingly, these individuals revealed an increased concentration of synovial EVs. In conclusion, our data showing opposite changes at the excitatory and inhibitory levels in neurons treated with OA- and RA-EVs, lay the scientific basis for personalized medicine in OA and RA patients, and identify EVs as new potential actionable biomarkers in patients with OA/RA with poor mental health.

AB  - General anesthesia could induce amnesia, however the mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that suppression of neuronal ensemble activity in the hippocampus by anesthesia during the post-learning period causes retrograde amnesia. To test this hypothesis, two experiments were conducted with sevoflurane anesthesia (2.5%, 30 min): a hippocampus-dependent memory task, the context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE) procedure to measure memory function and in vivo calcium imaging to observe neural activity in hippocampal CA1 during context exploration and sevoflurane/home cage session. Sevoflurane treatment just after context pre-exposure session impaired the CPFE memory, suggesting sevoflurane induced retrograde amnesia. Calcium imaging showed sevoflurane treatment prevented neuronal activity in CA1. Further analysis of neuronal activity with non-negative matrix factorization, which extracts neural ensemble activity based on synchronous activity, showed that sevoflurane treatment reduced the reactivation of neuronal ensembles between during context exploration just before and one day after sevoflurane inhalation. These results suggest that sevoflurane treatment immediately after learning induces amnesia, resulting from suppression of reactivation of neuronal ensembles.

AB  - The positive impact of melatonin on in vitro embryo production (IVEP) has been reported in many domestic species; however, no studies have been carried out in camelids. We aimed to evaluate the effects of melatonin supplementation in maturation media on in vitro maturation, fertilization, and preimplantation embryo development of dromedary camel oocytes (experiment 1). We also evaluated the concentrations of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the IVM spent medium in relation to melatonin supplementation. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in in vitro maturation media (IVM) supplemented with either 0.0, 25.0, 50.0 or 75.0 mu M of melatonin for 30 h. Matured oocytes were then fertilized in vitro with epididymal camel spermatozoa. Following IVF, the resulting embryos were cultured in vitro for seven days. The percentage of maturation, fertilization, cleavage, and embryo developmental rates (morula and blastocyst) was recorded (experiment 1). TAC and MDA levels in the IVM spent maturation media were also evaluated at 30 h post-IVM (experiment 2). The results showed that supplementation of IVM media with 25 mu M melatonin significantly improved oocyte nuclear maturation, fertilization (18 h post-insemination; pi), cleavage (day 3 pi), morula (day 5 pi) and blastocyst (day 7 pi) rates as compared with the controls and other melatonin-supplemented groups. Furthermore, the TAC in the IVM spent media was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in 25 mu M melatonin supplemented groups than those supplemented with 0.0, 50.0, 75.0 mu M melatonin. However, the concentration of MDA was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in IVM media supplemented with 25.0 mu M of melatonin when compared with the control and other treatment groups. In conclusion, supplementation of IVM medium with 25 mu M of melatonin could enhance the in vitro developmental capacity of dromedary camel oocytes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - With an associated 20% death risk, epilepsy mainly involves seizures of an unpredictable and recurrent nature. This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of insulin on mitochondrial disruption, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis and neurological deficits after epilepsy seizures. Mice were exposed to repetitive injections of pentylenetetrazol at a dose of 37 mg per kg. The influence of insulin was assessed by many biochemical assays, histopathological studies and neurobehavioral experiments. The administration of insulin was proven to increase the latency of seizures while also decreasing their intensity. It also caused a reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction and ameliorated oxidative stress. Additionally, insulin pretreatment upregulated Bcl-2, downregulated Bax, and then played a neuroprotective role against hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Furthermore, when insulin was administered, SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha/SIRT3 signals were activated, possibly due to the fact that insulin's neuroprotective and anti-mitochondrial damage characteristics added to its observed antiepileptic functions. Finally, insulin treatment is thus extremely valuable for effecting improvements in neurological functions, as has been estimated in a series of functional tests. In conclude, the results of this study consequently demonstrate insulin to have significant potential for future application in epilepsy management.

AB  - AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target against various types of cancer. Gilteritinib, a FDA-approved small-molecule inhibitor, is used for the treatment of patients with FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia. However, the antitumor activity of gilteritinib in solid tumors remains poorly elucidated. In this study, we explored the antitumor activity of gilteritinib in AXL-expressing esophageal cancer (EC), ovarian cancer (OC), and gastric cancer (GC), along with the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our data demonstrated that gilteritinib significantly inhibited cell proliferation and spheroid formation by triggering apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in AXL-positive EC, OC, and GC cells. Moreover, we found that gilteritinib treatment repressed EC, OC, and GC cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, RNA-seq analysis revealed that gilteritinib significantly downregulated multiple cancer-related pathways, including those related to apoptosis, the cell cycle, the mTOR pathway, the AMPK pathway, the p53 pathway, the FOXO pathway, the Hippo pathway, and the Wnt pathway. Gilteritinib inhibited a unique set of E2F- and MYC target-associated genes in EC, OC, and GC cells. Intriguingly, interrogation of the EC, OC, and GC cohort demonstrated that these genes were overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Gilteritinib also displayed strong antitumor effects on AXL-positive PDX-derived explants (PDXEs) and PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs) ex vivo and PDXs in vivo. Collectively, these findings reveal that gilteritinib represents a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of AXL-positive solid tumors.Zhang et al. demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy of Gilteritinib, a FDA-approved small-molecule inhibitor, in the AXL-expressing esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer cell lines, PDXOs and PDXs models. This work highlights Gilteritinib as a novel and potent therapeutic approach for the treatment of AXL-positive solid tumors.

AB  - Objective: Although growing evidences have showed that long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) plays a critical role in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there are still many unsolved mysteries remains to be deeply elucidated. This study aimed to find a new underlying mechanism of PVT1 in regulating the tumorigenesis and development of NSCLC.
   Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was used to profile the expression of PVT1 in NSCLC tissues and cells. The effects of PVT1 on cell growth, migration and invasion were detected by colony formation assay, Matrigel-free transwell and Matrigel transwell assays, respectively. Changes of the key protein expression in Hippo and NOTCH signaling pathways, as well as epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, were analyzed using western blot. Interaction of PVT1 with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was verified by RNA pull-down, and their binding to the downstream targets was detected by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.
   Results: These results showed that PVT1 was up-regulated in NSCLC tissue and cell lines, promoting NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Knockdown of PVT1 inhibited the expression of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and NOTCH1 signaling activation. Further, we have confirmed that PVT1 regulated expression of YAP1 through EZH2-mediated miR-497 promoter methylation resulting in the inhibition of miR-497 transcription and its target YAP1 upregulation, and finally NOTCH signaling pathway was activated, which promoted EMT and invasion and metastasis.
   Conclusions: These results suggested that lncRNA PVT1 promotes NSCLC metastasis through EZH2-mediated activation of Hippo/NOTCH1 signaling pathways. This study provides a new opportunity to advance our understanding in the potential mechanism of NSCLC development.

AB  - Recent studies show that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) harbor specific methylation marks in the brain that, if accessible, could be used as epigenetic biomarkers. Liquid biopsy enables the study of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments originated from dead cells, including neurons affected by neurodegenerative processes. Here, we isolated and epigenetically characterized plasma cfDNA from 35 patients with AD and 35 cognitively healthy controls by using the Infinium (R) MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify differential methylation positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs), including APOE epsilon 4 genotype stratified analysis. Plasma pTau181 (Simoa) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers (Fujirebio) were also measured and correlated with differential methylation marks. Validation was performed with bisulfite pyrosequencing and bisulfite cloning sequencing. Epigenome-wide cfDNA analysis identified 102 DMPs associated with AD status. Most DMPs correlated with clinical cognitive and functional tests including 60% for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 80% for Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and with AD blood and CSF biomarkers. In silico functional analysis connected 30 DMPs to neurological processes, identifying key regulators such as SPTBN4 and APOE genes. Several DMRs were annotated to genes previously reported to harbor epigenetic brain changes in AD (HKR1, ZNF154, HOXA5, TRIM40, ATG16L2, ADAMST2) and were linked to APOE epsilon 4 genotypes. Notably, a DMR in the HKR1 gene, previously shown to be hypermethylated in the AD hippocampus, was validated in cfDNA from an orthogonal perspective. These results support the feasibility of studying cfDNA to identify potential epigenetic biomarkers in AD. Thus, liquid biopsy could improve non-invasive AD diagnosis and aid personalized medicine by detecting epigenetic brain markers in blood.

AB  - Individuals with glucose transporter type I deficiency (G1D) habitually experience nutrient-responsive epilepsy associated with decreased brain glucose. However, the mechanistic association between blood glucose concentration and brain excitability in the context of G1D remains to be elucidated. Electroencephalography (EEG) in G1D individuals revealed nutrition time-dependent seizure oscillations often associated with preserved volition despite electrographic generalization and uniform average oscillation duration and periodicity, suggesting increased facilitation of an underlying neural loop circuit. Nonlinear EEG ictal source localization analysis and simultaneous EEG/functional magnetic resonance imaging converged on the thalamus-sensorimotor cortex as one potential circuit, and F-18-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-DG-PET) illustrated decreased glucose accumulation in this circuit. This pattern, reflected in a decreased thalamic to striatal F-18 signal ratio, can aid with the PET imaging diagnosis of the disorder, whereas the absence of noticeable ictal behavioral changes challenges the postulated requirement for normal thalamocortical activity during consciousness. In G1D mice, F-18-DG-PET and mass spectrometry also revealed decreased brain glucose and glycogen, but preserved tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, indicating no overall energy metabolism failure. In brain slices from these animals, synaptic inhibition of cortical pyramidal neurons and thalamic relay neurons was decreased, and neuronal disinhibition was mitigated by metabolic sources of carbon; tonic-clonic seizures were also suppressed by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor inhibition. These results pose G1D as a thalamocortical synaptic disinhibition disease associated with increased glucose-dependent neuronal excitability, possibly in relation to reduced glycogen. Together with findings in other metabolic defects, inhibitory neuron dysfunction is emerging as a modulable mechanism of hyperexcitability.

AB  - A self-cleaving ribozyme that maps to an intron of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (Cpeb3) gene is thought to play a role in human episodic memory, but the underlying mechanisms mediating this effect are not known. We tested the activity of the murine sequence and found that the ribozyme's self-scission half-life matches the time it takes an RNA polymerase to reach the immediate downstream exon, suggesting that the ribozyme-dependent intron cleavage is tuned to co-transcriptional splicing of the Cpeb3 mRNA. Our studies also reveal that the murine ribozyme modulates maturation of its harboring mRNA in both cultured cortical neurons and the hippocampus: inhibition of the ribozyme using an antisense oligonucleotide leads to increased CPEB3 protein expression, which enhances polyadenylation and translation of localized plasticity-related target mRNAs, and subsequently strengthens hippocampal-dependent long-term memory. These findings reveal a previously unknown role for self-cleaving ribozyme activity in regulating experience-induced co-transcriptional and local translational processes required for learning and memory.

AB  - BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the deadliest cancers globally. Yes-Associated Protein (YAP), a Hippo pathway effector, crucially regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Recent research has implicated YAP's role in HCC progression, but the mechanisms are unclear. This study aims to clarify YAP's function in HCC, emphasizing its regulation of key pathways and targets.ResultsGene knockout and overexpression models were established in nude mice and cell lines of HCC cells to investigate YAP's impact on tumorigenesis. Additionally, functional assays and molecular biology techniques were employed to identify YAP's regulatory networks. The study demonstrates that LDHA-regulated lactate production promotes YAP activation and malignant phenotypes in HCC. Overexpression of LDHA in HepG2 and Huh7 cells increased lactate levels and activated the YAP pathway, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Lactate treatment also promoted these malignant phenotypes by inhibiting YAP phosphorylation at Ser127. In a xenograft model, lactate accelerated tumor growth through YAP activation. YAP lactylation at K102 antagonized its Ser127 phosphorylation, further promoting malignant progression.ConclusionsThis study highlights the significance of YAP in HCC pathogenesis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for HCC management.

AB  - Five desi (GL 12,021, GL 29,095, GL 29,078, H11 22 and CSJ 515) and three wild (GLW 22, GLW 58 and GLW 187) chickpea cultivars showed induced defense response against Helicoverpa armigera infestation as a result of enhanced activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, tyrosine ammonia lyase in leaves, pod walls and seeds. Catalase activity increased in leaves of GL 12,021, H11 22, GL 29,095, CSJ 515, GLW 22, and GL 29,078 after infestation compared to resistant check; catalase and peroxidase activities in GL 29,095 and GL 29,078; ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in leaves of GLW 58. The increased activity of superoxide dismutase in pod wall of H1122; catalase in pod wall of 29,078, GL 29,095 and GL 22; ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase in pod wall of GLW 58; phenylalanine ammonia lyase and tyrosine ammonia lyase in pod wall of GLW 187, H11 22, GL 20,978, GLW 22 and GLW 58 after infestation as compared to resistant check might be responsible for mitigating infestation induced oxidative stress. MDA content decreased in leaves, pod wall and seeds of GLW 187 and GL 12,021 after infestation. Lower percent pod damage (9.58-12.44%) in GL 12,021, GLW 187, GL 29,095, H11 22, GL 29,078, GLW 22 and GLW 58 as compared to resistant (16.18%) and susceptible (21.50) checks might be attributed to differential induced defense mechanism in them. The identified desi and wild genotypes might be used in breeding program to develop cultivars with improved resistance to herbivore.

AB  - The importance of glutamate transporters in learning, memory, and emotion remains poorly understood; hence, in the present study, we investigated whether deficiency of pharmacological GLAST in neurodevelopmental processes affects cognitive and/or emotional behaviors in mice. The mice were injected with a glutamate transporter inhibitor, DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA), during the early postnatal period. At 8 weeks of age, they showed impairments in cognitive or emotional behaviors; dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission (increased expressions of GLAST, GLT-1, or GFAP protein, and decreased ability of glutamate release) in the cortex or hippocampus; morphological changes (decreased cell size in the cortex and thickness of the pyramidal neuronal layer of the CA1 area in the hippocampus). Such behavioral and morphological changes were not observed in adult mice injected with DL-TBOA. These results suggest that GLAST plays an important role in the regulation of cognitive and emotional behaviors. Early postnatal glutamatergic facilitation by GLAST dysfunction leads to cognitive and emotional abnormalities due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities such as morphological changes.

AB  - Background Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common neoplasm and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men worldwide. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is highly conserved in mammals and plays an important role in carcinogenesis. YAP is one of major key effectors of the Hippo pathway. However, the mechanism supporting abnormal YAP expression in PC remains to be characterized.Methods Western blot was used to measure the protein expression of ATXN3 and YAP, while the YAP target genes were measured by real-time PCR. CCK8 assay was used to detect cell viability; transwell invasion assay was used to measure the invasion ability of PC. The xeno-graft tumor model was used for in vivo study. Protein stability assay was used to detect YAP protein degradation. Immuno-precipitation assay was used to detect the interaction domain between YAP and ATXN3. The ubiquitin-based Immuno-precipitation assays were used to detect the specific ubiquitination manner happened on YAP.Results In the present study, we identified ATXN3, a DUB enzyme in the ubiquitin-specific proteases family, as a bona fide deubiquitylase of YAP in PC. ATXN3 was shown to interact with, deubiquitylate, and stabilize YAP in a deubiquitylation activity-dependent manner. Depletion of ATXN3 decreased the YAP protein level and the expression of YAP/TEAD target genes in PC, including CTGF, ANKRD1 and CYR61. Further mechanistic study revealed that the Josephin domain of ATXN3 interacted with the WW domain of YAP. ATXN3 stabilized YAP protein via inhibiting K48-specific poly-ubiquitination process on YAP protein. In addition, ATXN3 depletion significantly decreased PC cell proliferation, invasion and stem-like properties. The effects induced by ATXN3 depletion could be rescued by further YAP overexpression.Conclusions In general, our findings establish a previously undocumented catalytic role for ATXN3 as a deubiquitinating enzyme of YAP and provides a possible target for the therapy of PC.

AB  - Background: More than 75% of patients with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy experience cognitive impairments (eg, memory and attention problems), commonly known as chemo-brain. Exercise, especially aerobic high-intensity interval training (HIIT), is associated with better cognitive function in healthy populations. However, clinical trials testing the impact of exercise interventions on chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline in patients with cancer are lacking, and the mechanisms through which exercise could improve cognitive function are unclear. Objective: The objective of the Improving Cognitive Function Through High-Intensity Interval Training in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy trial is to examine the effects of HIIT on cognitive function in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: This 2-arm, single-center, pilot randomized controlled trial will randomize 50 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy to HIIT or attention control. The HIIT group will perform a supervised 16-week, thrice-weekly intervention, with each session including a 5-minute warm-up at 10% maximal power output (POmax), 10 sets of alternating 1-minute high-intensity (90% POmax) and 1-minute recovery (10% POmax) intervals, and a 5-minute cooldown (10% POmax). The attention control group will receive a stretching program with no exercise components and be asked to maintain their exercise levels for 16 weeks. The primary outcomes of the study are executive function and memory measured using the National Institutes of Health toolbox and resting-state connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging microstructure evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. The secondary and tertiary outcomes include cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, physical fitness, and psychosocial health. The study has been approved by the institutional review board of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (20-222). Results: The trial was funded in January 2019, with recruitment started in June 2021. As of May 2022, a total of 4 patients have consented and been randomized (n=2, 50% to exercise; n=1, 25% to control; and n=1, 25% nonrandomized). Trial completion is expected in January 2024. Conclusions: This first-of-its-kind study incorporates a novel exercise intervention (ie, HIIT) and comprehensive cognitive measures. If positive, our findings will establish the pilot efficacy of HIIT on chemotherapy-induced cognitive function in patients with breast cancer, providing the foundation for future larger phase-II and phase-III trials to confirm the findings and potentially establish HIIT as a standard of care for women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.

AB  - Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in various cell types including ciliated airway epithelial cells and macrophages. T2Rs in these two innate immune cell types are activated by bitter products, including those secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to Ca2+-dependent activation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS). NO enhances mucociliary clearance and has direct antibacterial effects in ciliated epithelial cells. NO also increases phagocytosis by macrophages. Using biochemistry and live-cell imaging, we explored the role of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in regulating T2R-dependent NO pathways in primary sinonasal epithelial cells, primary monocyte-derived macrophages, and a human bronchiolar cell line (H441). Immunofluorescence showed that H441 cells express eNOS and T2Rs and that the bitter agonist denatonium benzoate activates NO production in a Ca2+- and HSP90-dependent manner in cells grown either as submerged cultures or at the air-liquid interface. In primary sinonasal epithelial cells, we determined that HSP90 inhibition reduces T2R-stimulated NO production and ciliary beating, which likely limits pathogen clearance. In primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we found that HSP-90 is integral to T2R-stimulated NO production and phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Escherichia coli and pHrodo-Staphylococcus aureus. Our study demonstrates that HSP90 serves as an innate immune modulator by regulating NO production downstream of T2R signaling by augmenting eNOS activation without impairing upstream Ca2+ signaling. These findings suggest that HSP90 plays an important role in airway antibacterial innate immunity and may be an important target in airway diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, or cystic fibrosis.

AB  - Herbivores large and small need to mechanically process plant tissue. Their ability to do so is determined by two forces: the maximum force they can generate, and the minimum force required to fracture the plant tissue. The ratio of these forces determines the relative mechanical effort; how this ratio varies with animal size is challenging to predict. We measured the forces required to cut thin polymer sheets with mandibles from leaf-cutter ant workers which vary by more than one order of magnitude in body mass. Cutting forces were independent of mandible size, but differed by a factor of two between pristine and worn mandibles. Mandibular wear is thus likely a more important determinant of cutting force than mandible size. We rationalize this finding with a biomechanical analysis, which suggests that pristine mandibles are ideally 'sharp'-cutting forces are close to a theoretical minimum, which is independent of tool size and shape, and instead solely depends on the geometric and mechanical properties of the cut tissue. The increase of cutting force due to mandibular wear may be particularly problematic for small ants, which generate lower absolute bite forces, and thus require a larger fraction of their maximum bite force to cut the same plant.This article is part of the theme issue 'Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals'.

AB  - In the ontogenesis of woody plants in general, and magnolia species in particular, the virginal age is quite long, and therefore is critically important from the point of view of selecting optimal conditions for growing plants. The study was conducted on biennial plants of deciduous magnolias: Magnolia kobus Sarg., M. obovata Thunb., M. denudata Desr. The studied plants were at the beginning of the virginile stage of development. The material for the investigation is selected from plants, which were planted by us in the research area of A. V. Fomin Botanical Garden of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. In this study, we used scanning electron and light microscopes to examine the ultrastructure of the surface of leaves of the studied species. The histological characteristics of the leaves of the studied species are similar. They are hypostomatic. Their stomata are of the paracytic type, they are evenly distributed on the abaxial surface of the leaves. The epidermal cells of the studied species of the genus Magnolia have tortuous (cells located on the periphery of the leaf) or straight (cells located on the veins) outlines and rectangular (cells located on the veins) or flattened (cells placed on the periphery of the leaf) projection. The cuticle is relatively thin, located on both the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of the leaves. Epicuticular wax is observed of three types in the studied species: films (M. M. denudata), ), crust (M. M. kobus, , M. obovata) ) and wax granules (M. M. denudata, , M. obovata). ). The amount of wax and pubescence is greater on the abaxial surface in M. obovata; ; very weak pubescence and waxy layer is observed only on the abaxial surface of the leaf inM. M. kobus, , weak pubescence is present on both sides inM. M. denudata. . In all species of the genus Magnolia pubescence is simple, formed by hairs that "accompany" the veins. There are two main types of lamina relief in the studied species: reticular (M. M. obovata, , M. denudata (subtype reticular-collicular)) and pitted (M. M. kobus). ). The species clearly differ in this feature, so we believe that the type of relief of the lamina can be used as an additional diagnostic feature to distinguish species of the genus Magnolia. . Magnolia denudata is characterized by a small number of stomata, while M. obovata and M. kobus are characterized by their average number. The Stomata Index varies from 2.8 in M. denudata to 1.02 in M. kobus. . The lamina is the thickest in M. obovata, , the thinnest is in M. kobus, , but the total thickness of the epidermal tissue as a percentage of the thickness of the leaf is, in descending order: M. denudata (29%), M. kobus (24%), M. obovata (18%). The mesophyll varies from homogeneous-spongy (in M. kobus) ) to layered (in M. obovata,M. , M. denudata) ) type. The number of layers of cells that form the mesophyll in all studied species is from 4 to 6. Thus, M. kobus is characterized by the least specialized type of mesophyll. The vascular system in the studied plants is represented by small central and lateral vascular bundles. The ground tissue is present only in the central and large side bundles. In the early stages of ontogenesis the studied plants are typical mesophytes with hypostomatic leaves adapted to exist in sufficiently moist conditions in soil and air. In practical terms, the results of investigation can be used to select optimal conditions for growing plants at the initial stages of ontogenesis.

AB  - The use of bioactive plant extracts in cosmetic products is a common practice. Most of these extracts are obtained by maceration in organic solvents, and depending on which solvents are used, the polarity and the structure of the target molecules will vary. Polyphenols are polar compounds that often display antioxidant and/or antibacterial activities. To extract them, ethanol/water mixtures are usually selected as green solvents. This solid-liquid extraction (assisted or not) requires the use of high volumes of solvents and many additional steps like mixing, agitation, filtration, and evaporation. Alternatively, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) offers many benefits for plant extraction: economical, non-toxic, and naturally concentrated extracts. However, its low polarity is not suitable to solubilize polar compounds. In this study, an experimental design was used to optimize supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of caffeine and catechins from Camellia sinensis. Catechins are recognized for skin care use (antioxidant) and caffeine is also used for its skin care properties and to prevent excess storage of fat in cells. The temperature, modifier content, and water additive percentage were used as independent variables. The results showed that while the temperature was an insignificant parameter, a higher percentage of water (up to 20% in ethanol) and modifier favored the extraction of the polar target molecules. Additionally, the SFE results were compared with ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). Finally, a sequential selective extraction of caffeine from catechins is also presented.

AB  - Objective: Immunotherapy with redirected T cells that express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a promising prospect in cancer treatment. Most CARs use murine-derived single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) as an antigen targeting moiety, which may lead to host immunogenic responses and engineered T cell disappearance. It seems that development of less immunogenic CARs, such as CARs composed of the camelid variable domain of heavy chain antibodies (VHHs) may likely overcome this obstacle. Here, we improved the expression of the VHH-based anti-MUC1 CAR gene construct using a third generation lentiviral vector in primary human T cells and assessed its effect on antigen specific targeting, activation and cytotoxicity of redirected human T cells.
   Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we established a second generation novel CAR (VHH-based anti-MUC1 CAR) that contained a camelid-derived anti-MUC1 VHH followed by an IgG3 hinge, a CD28 transmembrane domain and signalling endodomains of CD28 and CD3 zeta Next, we constructed lentiviral vectors that contained this CAR gene construct using an optimized transiently virus production method and transduced it into human T cells. Cell surface expression of CAR, cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity were assessed in the transduced CD3(+) T cells.
   Results: The transduced T cells had high levels of surface expression of CAR. T cells that expressed anti-MUC1 CAR showed significantly increased secretion of Th1 cytokines, including IL-2, TNF alpha and IFN-gamma, as well as cytotoxic activity upon recognition of MUC1 on tumour cells after co-incubation with T47D or MCF-7 (MUC1-positive) compared with A431 (MUC1-negative) or untransduced T cells.
   Conclusion: Our results suggested that, given the unique properties of VHHs to prevent immunogenic responses and tonic signalling, our novel VHH-based anti-MUC1 CAR might be effective for clinical purposes in cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Fifty compounds including seven undescribed ( 1 , 13 , 18 - 20 , 30 , 31 ) and forty-three known ( 2 - 12 , 14 - 17 , 21 - 29 , 32 - 50 ) ones were isolated from the extract of the twigs and leaves of Aglaia odorata with antineuroinflammatory activities. Their structures were determined by a combination of spectral analysis and calculated spectra (ECD and NMR). Among them, compounds 13 - 25 were found to possess tertiary amide bonds, with compounds 16 , 17 , and 19 - 21 existing detectable cis / trans mixtures in 1 H NMR spectrum measured in CDCl 3 . Specifically, the analysis of the cis - trans isomerization equilibrium of tertiary amides in compounds 19 - 24 was conducted using NMR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Bioactivity evaluation showed that the cyclopenta[ b ]benzofuran derivatives ( 2 - 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 ) could inhibit nitric oxide production at the nanomolar concentration (IC 50 values ranging from 2 to 100 nM) in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 cells, which were 413-20670 times greater than that of the positive drug (minocycline, IC 50 = 41.34 mu M). The cyclopenta[ bc ]benzopyran derivatives ( 13 - 16 ), diterpenoids ( 30 - 35 ), lignan ( 40 ), and flavonoids ( 45 , 47 , 49 , 50 ) also demonstrated significant inhibitory activities with IC 50 values ranging from 1.74 to 38.44 mu M. Furthermore, the in vivo anti-neuroinflammatory effect of rocaglaol ( 12 ) was evaluated via immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blot assays in the LPS-treated mice model. The results showed that rocaglaol ( 12 ) attenuated the activation of microglia and decreased the mRNA expression of iNOS, TNF- alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. The mechanistic study suggested that rocaglaol might inhibit the activation of the NF- kappa B signaling pathway to relieve the neuroinflammatory response.

AB  - Nasal capsular contracture is a prevalent complication commonly observed after rhinoplasty. However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of nasal capsular contracture is largely unclear compared to that of breast capsular contracture. This study aimed to identify the key genes implicated in nasal capsular contracture progression using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq). Biopsy samples were taken from Grade II to Grade IV nasal fibrous capsular tissues. The former is regarded as the relatively normal tissues and thus was set as control group, while the latter was treated as pathological group. Results from RNA-seq underwent GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis and subsequent verification by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. RNA-seq analysis showed that 3149 genes were up-regulated and 3131 genes in pathological groups compared with controls. The top 30 up-regulated genes included many chemokines (e.g., CCL18, CCL13, CCL17 and CCL8), matrix metallopeptidases (e.g., MMP9 and MMP12) and integrin proteins (e.g., ITGAM and ITGB2). GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the up-regulated genes affected various immune functions, including immune system process, cell activation, leukocyte activation, defence response and positive regulation of immune. The down-regulated gene primary influenced muscle development and functions as well as metabolic processes. In summary, this study reveal that abnormal changes of immune functions, muscle develop and metabolic processes are probably implicated in the pathogenesis of nasal capsular contracture.

AB  - A theory and neurocomputational model are presented that explain grid cell responses as the byproduct of equally dissimilar hippocampal memories. On this account, place and grid cells are best understood as the natural consequence of memory encoding and retrieval; a precise hexagonal grid is the exception rather than the rule, emerging when the animal explores a large surface that is devoid of landmarks and objects. In the proposed memory model, place cells represent memories that are conjunctions of both spatial and non-spatial attributes, and grid cells primarily represent the non-spatial attributes (e.g. sounds, surface texture, etc.) found throughout the two-dimensional recording enclosure. Place cells support memories of the locations where non-spatial attributes can be found (e.g. positions with a particular sound), which are arranged in a hexagonal lattice owing to memory encoding and consolidation processes (pattern separation) as applied to situations in which the non-spatial attributes are found at all locations of a two-dimensional surface. Grid cells exhibit their spatial firing pattern owing to feedback from hippocampal place cells (i.e. a hexagonal pattern of remembered locations for the non-spatial attribute represented by a grid cell). Model simulations explain a wide variety of results in the rodent spatial navigation literature.

AB  - Yellow camellia (Camellia chrysantha) plant is naturally distributed in Vietnam. Its flower has great ability to improve human health due to its phytochemical substances such as selens, catechin, quercetin and polyphenols. Therefore, its flower is commonly infused in dry form as tea. Freeze-drying is based on low temperatures to avoid the degradation of thermolabile constituents, preserve physicochemical and organoleptic properties. In this study, the impact of freeze-drying conditions on the quality of floral tea from Camellia bud was examined. Five different temperatures (-40,-45,-50,-55, -60 degrees C) and five working shelf pressures (0.022, 0.028, 0.034, 0.040, 0.046 mbar) were clarified. Results showed that 0.04 mbar at-55 oC were suitable for dehydration of the Camellia flower buds into functional tea. The most total phenolic content (807.4 +/- 1.3 mg GAE/100 g), flavonoid content (397.5 +/- 0.4 mg QE/100 g), DPPH free radical scavenging (206.1 +/- 0.5 mu g/mL), ABTS radical scavenging activity (45.7 +/- 0.01mM TE/g) would be maintained in the dried flower bud.

AB  - The defensive-offensive associations between algae and herbivores determine marine ecology. Brown algae utilize phlorotannin as their chemical defense against the predator Aplysia kurodai, which uses beta-glucosidase (akuBGL) to digest the laminarin in algae into glucose. Moreover, A. kurodai employs Eisenia hydrolysis-enhancing protein (EHEP) as an offense to protect akuBGL activity from phlorotannin inhibition by precipitating phlorotannin. To underpin the molecular mechanism of this digestive-defensive-offensive system, we determined the structures of the apo and tannic acid (TNA, a phlorotannin analog) bound forms of EHEP, as well as the apo akuBGL. EHEP consisted of three peritrophin-A domains arranged in a triangular shape and bound TNA in the center without significant conformational changes. Structural comparison between EHEP and EHEP-TNA led us to find that EHEP can be resolubilized from phlorotannin precipitation at an alkaline pH, which reflects a requirement in the digestive tract. akuBGL contained two GH1 domains, only one of which conserved the active site. Combining docking analysis, we propose the mechanisms by which phlorotannin inhibits akuBGL by occupying the substrate-binding pocket, and EHEP protects akuBGL against this inhibition by binding with phlorotannin to free the akuBGL pocket.

AB  - Skill learning is a fundamental adaptive process, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Some learning paradigms, particularly in the memory domain, are closely associated with gamma activity that is amplitude modulated by the phase of underlying theta activity, but whether such nested activity patterns also underpin skill learning is unknown. Here, we addressed this question by using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over sensorimotor cortex to modulate theta-gamma activity during motor skill acquisition, as an exemplar of a non-hippocampal-dependent task. We demonstrated, and then replicated, a significant improvement in skill acquisition with theta-gamma tACS, which outlasted the stimulation by an hour. Our results suggest that theta-gamma activity may be a common mechanism for learning across the brain and provides a putative novel intervention for optimizing functional improvements in response to training or therapy.

AB  - Hair is a prominent physiological feature of many animals that can be easily and non-invasively sampled. However, most previous studies have focused on human hair, and animal hair has not been widely used as a DNA source in genetic and evolutionary studies. Analysing the DNA quality of animal hair is more challenging than that of human hair because it varies across different species and is influenced by different storage conditions. To address this gap in our knowledge, this study systematically evaluated the DNA quality of various animal hair samples. Our findings show that lightly medullated hairs, which are typical in carnivores, yield greater amounts of DNA and have better sequencing results than highly medullated hairs, which are typical in ungulate herbivores. Furthermore, the roots and middle hair were more productive than the upper hair parts. Tanning and storage time impair DNA yield and sequencing quality and increase nucleotide damage. Moreover, for certain historical specimens and field samples, genomic DNA was more successfully obtained from hair samples than from skin samples. This study provides data and theoretical support for improving the use of animal hair in genetic research.

AB  - Recent studies examine the behavioral capacities of rats and mice with and without visual input, and the neuronal mechanisms underlying such capacities. These animals are assumed to be functionally blind under red light, an assumption that might originate in the fact that they are dichromats who possess ultraviolet and green cones, but not red cones. But the inability to see red as a color does not necessarily rule out form vision based on red light absorption. We measured Long-Evans rats' capacity for visual form discrimination under red light of various wavelength bands. Upon viewing a black and white grating, they had to distinguish between two categories of orientation: horizontal and vertical. Psychometric curves plotting judged orientation versus angle demonstrate the conserved visual capacity of rats under red light. Investigations aiming to explore rodent physiological and behavioral functions in the absence of visual input should not assume red-light blindness.

AB  - Head-direction (HD) cells are a fundamental component in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit for spatial navigation and help maintain an internal sense of direction to anchor the orientation in space. A classical HD cell robustly increases its firing rate when the head is oriented toward a specific direction, with each cell tuned to only one direction. Although unidirectional HD cells are reported broadly across multiple brain regions, computation modelling has predicted the existence of multiple equilibrium states of HD network, which has yet to be proven. In this study, a novel HD variant of bipolar HD cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are identified that exhibit stable double-peaked directional tuning properties. The bipolar patterns remain stable in the darkness and across environments of distinct geometric shapes. Moreover, bipolar HD cells co-rotate coherently with unipolar HD cells to anchor the external visual cue. The discovery reveals a new spatial cell type of bipolar HD cells, whose unique activity patterns may comprise a potential building block for a sophisticated local neural circuit configuration for the internal representation of direction. These findings may contribute to the understanding of how the brain processes spatial information by shedding light on the role of bipolar HD cells in this process.
   Head-direction (HD) cells function as the brain's internal compass. A classic HD cells fire preferentially when the head is oriented towards a specific direction. This study identifies a novel type of bipolar HD cells in the medial entorhinal cortex with intrinsically stable double-peaked directional tuning. Their presence adds a new potential building block for spatial navigation. image

AB  - Background: Ischemic stroke is characterized by permanent or transient obstruction of blood flow, leading to a growing risk factor and health burden. Tianmagouteng yin (TMG) is commonly used in Chinese medicine to treat cerebral ischemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of TMG against ischemic stroke. Methods: Either permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) or sham operation was performed on anesthetized Wistar male rats (n = 36). Results: Results demonstrated that TMG administration reduced the infarction volume and mitigated the neurobehavioral deficits. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Prussian blue staining revealed that TMG attenuated tissue disruption and microbleeds in hippocampus tissues. In addition, TMG down-regulated the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and p-JAK2. It also inhibited the concentrations of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), ferritin, malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conclusion: As repetitive clinical trials of neuroprotectants targeting stroke have failed previously, our results suggested that the natural product, TMG, can probably help in the vicious cycles of ischemic stroke pathology.

AB  - Background Allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C) induced by house dust mites (HDM) often begins in childhood and negatively impacts a child's quality of life. The daily burden can be further compounded by comorbid asthma. Allergen immunotherapy is the only available treatment targeting the underlying cause of allergic disease. Efficacy and safety of the SQ HDM sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablet has been demonstrated in adults and adolescents with HDM AR/C with or without asthma, but data are lacking for younger children.
   Methods Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in younger children (5-11 years) with HDM AR/C with or without asthma. Eligible subjects were randomised 1:1 to SQ HDM SLIT-tablet or placebo for similar to 1 year and had free access to AR/C symptom-relieving medications. The primary outcome was the total combined rhinitis score (TCRS) during the final 8 weeks of the treatment period (similar to 1 year). Secondary outcomes included the rhinitis daily symptom score (DSS) and medication score (DMS), the rhinoconjunctivitis total combined score (TCS), and the Paediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) score. Efficacy analyses were conducted on the full analysis set (observed cases). Asthma-related outcomes were also explored. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04145219 and EudraCT: 2019-000560-22.
   Findings A total of 1460 subjects were randomised to SQ HDM SLIT-tablet (n = 729) or placebo (n = 731). The primary outcome, TCRS, was statistically significantly different for SQ HDM SLIT-tablet (n = 693) versus placebo (n = 706), with an absolute difference of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.4; p < 0.0001) corresponding to a relative reduction of 22.0% (95% CI: 12.0, 31.1). Key secondary outcomes (DSS, DMS, TCS, PRQLQ) showed statistically significant reductions in symptoms and medication use, and improved disease-related quality of life for SQ HDM SLIT-tablet versus placebo. Improvements in asthma symptoms and reduced asthma medication use indicated an additional effect of SQ HDM-SLIT tablet versus placebo. The SQ HDM SLIT-tablet showed a higher event rate for treatment-related adverse events (AEs) than placebo. Most events were of mild or moderate severity and few subjects discontinued due to AEs (2.5%).
   Interpretation The trial confirmed the efficacy and safety of the SQ HDM SLIT-tablet for treating HDM AR/C in younger children (5-11 years) with or without asthma. The safety profile supports daily self-administration of the SQ HDM SLIT-tablet in children.

AB  - Hippocampal-dependent memory is thought to be supported by distinct connectivity states, with strong input to the hippocampus benefitting encoding and weak input benefitting retrieval. Previous research in rodents suggests that the hippocampal theta oscillation orchestrates the transition between these states, with opposite phase angles predicting minimal versus maximal input. We investigated whether this phase dependence exists in humans using network-targeted intracranial stimulation. Intracranial local field potentials were recorded from individuals with epilepsy undergoing medically necessary stereotactic electroencephalographic recording. In each subject, biphasic bipolar direct electrical stimulation was delivered to lateral temporal sites with demonstrated connectivity to hippocampus. Lateral temporal stimulation evoked ipsilateral hippocampal potentials with distinct early and late components. Using evoked component amplitude to measure functional connectivity, we assessed whether the phase of hippocampal theta predicted relatively high versus low connectivity. We observed an increase in the continuous phase-amplitude relationship selective to the early and late components of the response evoked by lateral temporal stimulation. The maximal difference in these evoked component amplitudes occurred across 180 degrees of separation in the hippocampal theta rhythm; that is, the greatest difference in component amplitude was observed when stimulation was delivered at theta peak versus trough. The pattern of theta-phase dependence observed for hippocampus was not identified for control locations. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal receptivity to input varies with theta phase, suggesting that theta phase reflects connectivity states of human hippocampal networks. These findings confirm a putative mechanism by which neural oscillations modulate human hippocampal function.

AB  - Functional endoscopic sinus Surgery (FESS) is a form of safe and effective management for chronic rhinosinusitis. Nevertheless, although FESS is minimally invasive, it poses a risk of rare orbital complications. This study aims to investigate the variations in the medial maxillary wall relative to the medial orbital wall, as depicted on computed tomography (CT) scans. We retrospectively included CT scans of the sinuses between November 2022 and April 2023. To maintain consistency, we used the coronal image that delineated the anterior ethmoidal foramen. The attachment site of the inferior turbinate to the medial maxillary wall was categorized into three classes according to its position relative to the inferomedial orbital strut. Class I indicates that the site of attachment is located within 2 mm, either medially or laterally. Class II indicates that it has been medially displaced by more than 2 mm, whereas Class III indicates that it has been laterally displaced by more than 2 mm. We enrolled 183 patients, yielding a total of 363 sides. Classes I, II, and III account for 55.4%, 41.3%, and 3.3% of the cases, respectively. A significant correlation exists between the classification and the dimensions and volume of the maxillary sinus (p < 0.001). The logistic regression model indicates a significant negative correlation between the width of the maxillary sinus and risk classification (p < 0.001), implying a protective effect with increasing width. Knowledge of the variations in the medial wall of the maxillary sinus relative to the medial orbital wall is essential for guidance toward the optimal endoscopic approach, and it demonstrates relevance to risk stratification.

AB  - In order to obtain high-performance 3D printed parts, this study focuses on the key performance indicator of impact toughness. The parametric modeling software Rhino 6 is used to design impact specimens, and the laser selective melting equipment DiMetal-100, independently developed by the South China University of Technology, is used to manufacture impact specimens. Subsequently, the CoCrMo alloy parts were annealed using an MXQ1600-40 box-type atmosphere furnace and subjected to impact testing using a cantilever beam impact testing machine XJV-22. Fractal theory was applied to analyze the fractal behavior of the resulting impact fracture surfaces. The research results indicate that the 3D-printed impact specimens exhibited excellent surface quality, characterized by brightness, low roughness, and the absence of significant defects such as warping or deformation. In terms of annealing treatment, lower annealing temperatures did not improve the impact performance of SLM-formed CoCrMo alloy parts but instead led to a decrease in toughness. While increasing the annealing temperature can improve toughness to some extent, the effect is limited. Furthermore, the relationship between impact energy and heat treatment temperature exhibits a U-shaped trend. The fractal dimension analysis shows that the parts annealed in a 1200 degrees C furnace have the highest fractal dimension and better toughness performance. This study introduces a novel approach by comprehensively integrating advanced 3D printing technology, annealing processes, and fractal theory analysis to systematically investigate the influence of annealing temperature on the impact properties of 3D-printed CoCrMo alloy parts, thereby establishing a solid foundation for the application of high-performance 3D printed parts.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) shapes the stem cell fate during differentiation by exerting relevant biophysical cues. However, the mechanism of stem cell fate decisions in response to ECM-backed complex biophysical cues has not been fully understood due to the lack of versatile ECMs. Here, we designed two versatile ECMs using colloidal self-assembly technology to probe the mechanisms of their effects on mechanotransduction and stem cell fate regulation. Binary colloidal crystals (BCC) with a hexagonally close-packed structure, composed of silica (5 mu m) and polystyrene (0.4 mu m) particles as well as a polydimethylsiloxane-embedded BCC (BCCP), were fabricated. They have defined surface chemistry, roughness, stiffness, ion release, and protein adsorption properties, which can modulate the cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). On the BCC, hASCs preferred osteogenesis at an early stage but showed a higher tendency toward adipogenesis at later stages. In contrast, the results of BCCP diverged from those of BCC, suggesting a unique regulation of ECM-dependent mechanotransduction. The BCC-mediated cell adhesion reduced the size of the focal adhesion complex, accompanying an ordered spatial organization and cytoskeletal rearrangement. This morphological restriction led to the modulation of mechanosensitive transcription factors, such as c-FOS, the enrichment of transcripts in specific signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, and the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Epigenetic analyses showed changes in histone modifications across different substrates, suggesting that chromatin remodeling participated in BCC-mediated mechanotransduction. This study demonstrates that BCCs are versatile artificial ECMs that can regulate human stem cells' fate through unique biological signaling, which is beneficial in biomaterial design and stem cell engineering.

AB  - The Weber-Fechner law proposes that our perceived sensory input increases with physical input on a logarithmic scale. Hippocampal 'time cells' carry a record of recent experience by firing sequentially during a circumscribed period of time after a triggering stimulus. Different cells have 'time fields' at different delays up to at least tens of seconds. Past studies suggest that time cells represent a compressed timeline by demonstrating that fewer time cells fire late in the delay and their time fields are wider. This paper asks whether the compression of time cells obeys the Weber-Fechner Law. Time cells were studied with a hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously accounts for the firing pattern at the trial level, cell level, and population level. This procedure allows separate estimates of the within-trial receptive field width and the across-trial variability. After isolating across-trial variability, time field width increased linearly with delay. Further, the time cell population was distributed evenly along a logarithmic time axis. These findings provide strong quantitative evidence that the neural temporal representation in rodent hippocampus is logarithmically compressed and obeys a neural Weber-Fechner Law.

AB  - Y There are rich structures in off-task neural activity which are hypothesized to reflect fundamental computations across a broad spectrum of cognitive functions. Here, we develop an analysis toolkit - temporal delayed linear modelling (TDLM) - for analysing such activity. TDLM is a domain-general method for finding neural sequences that respect a pre-specified transition graph. It combines nonlinear classification and linear temporal modelling to test for statistical regularities in sequences of task-related reactivations. TDLM is developed on the non-invasive neuroimaging data and is designed to take care of confounds and maximize sequence detection ability. Notably, as a linear framework, TDLM can be easily extended, without loss of generality, to capture rodent replay in electrophysiology, including in continuous spaces, as well as addressing second-order inference questions, for example, its temporal and spatial varying pattern. We hope TDLM will advance a deeper understanding of neural computation and promote a richer convergence between animal and human neuroscience.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are conserved and universal signal transduction modules that play important roles in regulating stress responses in plants. Although MAP3K, MP2K, and MPK family in tea plant (Camellia sinensis) have been investigated, little is known about MPK family genes responding to various abiotic stresses in tea plant. In this study, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the tea plant MAPKs (CsMPKs) family gene based on the genomic data of tea plants by bioinformatics-based methods. Here, 21 putative CsMPK genes were identified in the tea plant and divided into 4 subfamilies according to the homologous to Arabidopsis and their phylogenetic relationships. The gene structure and conserved motifs of these CsMPKs in the same group showed high similarity, suggesting that they were highly conserved and might have a similar function. The expression profiles of the CsMPK genes were further investigated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, indicating that many CsMPK genes were involved in response to cold, drought, heat, or heat combined with drought treatment, suggesting their potential roles in abiotic stress responses in tea plant. These results would provide valuable information for further exploring the functional characterization of CsMPK genes in tea plants.

AB  - We report the opportunistic predation of Roadside Hawk (Rupornis magnirostris-Accipitridae) on subterranean termite (Coptotermes testaceus -Rhinotermitidae). This predatory behaviour was observed during an avifauna survey in the municipality of Candeias do Jamari, Rondonia, Brazil, in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. There was a great abundance of C. testaceus alates because of heavy rainfall. This is the season when C. testaceus colonies produce alates in large numbers to found new colonies. The Roadside Hawk stayed on its perch and captured winged termites with little energy expenditure. The bird in question appeared to take advantage of the termite mating flight to feed opportunistically on the abundant alates. Although feeding on insects by R. magnirostris is well known, this is the first documentation of feeding on termite alates.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that testosterone attenuates stress-induced mood dysfunction and memory deterioration. However, the exact mechanism is still unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the role of long-term testosterone undecanoate on the behavioral responses in AD induced by AlCl3 + D-galactose administration and the possible alteration of the gene expression level of the Na/K ATPase pump. Adult male mice received AlCl3 in drinking water (10 mg/kg/day) and (D-gal 200 mg/kg/day), subcutaneously for 90 consecutive days, then received a single intramuscular (I.M) injection of castor oil (vehicle) on day 91, while treated groups received a single I.M injection of either low (100 mg/kg/45 days) or high dose (500 mg/kg/45 days) respectively of long-acting testosterone undecanoate on day 91. The time spent in the interaction zone during the open field test, preference index to novel objects in the novel object recognition test, spontaneous alternation percentage (SAP) in Y-maze test, and escape latency time in the Morris water maze test were used to measure the locomotor activity, long-term memory, and spatial memory in mice, respectively. The results showed that testosterone undecanoate treatment improved locomotor activity, improved preference to novel objects, improved spatial memory, and reversed anxiety and depression induced by AlCl3 + D-galactose administration in male mice, suggesting the enhancement of behavioral and memory functions brought by testosterone treatment. Moreover, testosterone undecanoate treatment did alter gene expression levels of Na/K ATPase isoforms in the brain hippocampus. In most cases, altered gene expression was significant and correlated with the observed behavioral changes. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into the effects of long-acting testosterone undecanoate administration on locomotor activity, long-term memory, anxiety, and spatial memory in male mice with Alzheimer's disease.

   c
   arek, sp. nov. found in an association with the wood-boring termite in a dipterocarp rain forest in Borneo. To evaluate the level of association with termites we documented termite-earwig interactions in the laboratory. We found that earwigs and termites mutually communicate by antennation, and we observed no form of aggressive behavior. The earwigs responded to the proximity of an experimentally irritated termite soldier by the feigning of death (thanatosis), which seems to be a defensive reaction. The occurrence of earwig adults together with the nymphs in the galleries termite strongly suggests that the earwig reproduces inside the termite colony. Spirolabia kaja Ko
   c
   arek, sp. nov. is the first earwig species for which termitophily has been demonstrated. Based on behavioral observations, we report termitophily by the earwig Spirolabia kaja Ko
   c
   arek, sp. nov. (Spongiphoridae: Labiinae). The new species was found in association with the wood-boring termite Schedorhinotermes sarawakensis (Holmgren, 1913) in a dipterocarp rain forest in Borneo; in addition to being observed in the galleries, termite-earwig interactions were subsequently documented in the laboratory. We found that earwigs and termites communicate by antennation, and we observed no form of targeted mutual or unilateral aggressive behavior. The earwigs responded to the proximity of an experimentally irritated termite soldier by conflict-avoidance behavior based on thanatosis, which seems to be a defensive reaction that may reduce the chance of being attacked by an irritated termite. Based on the analysis of gastrointestinal tract contents, we conclude that S. kaja sp. nov. is an omnivorous species that feeds mainly on plant tissues and fungi but occasionally on arthropod remains. The occurrence of S. kaja sp. nov. adults together with the nymphs (2nd to 4th instars) in the galleries of S. sarawakensis strongly suggests that the earwig can reproduce inside the termite colony. Spirolabia kaja Ko
   c
   arek, sp. nov. is the first earwig species for which termitophily has been demonstrated.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious central nervous system complication characterized by impaired memory, reduced information processing ability, and anxiety. Recently, the role of FGF19 in neuro-logical diseases has been reported. However, the effect and mechanisms of FGF19 in improving symptoms of POCD remain unknown. This study aimed to identify the role and exploring the underlying mechanisms of FGF19 in POCD. Here, rats were separated into four different groups, including control, sevoflurane (sev), sev + AAV-empty, and sev + AAV-FGF19 group. Then, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was applied to identify the effect of FGF19 on POCD rats. The result proved that FGF19 improved sevoflurane induced cognitive dysfunction in rats. Subsequently, the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and IL-10 were detected to verify the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of FGF19 in POCD rats. Furthermore, DHE fluorescent staining assay showed that FGF19 could inhibit sevoflurane-induced oxidative stress in POCD rats. Besides, NISSL staining and TUNEL assay were applied to reveal that FGF19 could alleviate hippocampal neuron injury induced by sevoflurane in rats. Moreover, mechanistic studies confirmed that FGF19 improved symptoms of POCD by mediated PGC-1 alpha/BDNF/ FNDC5 pathway. Together, these results suggested that FGF19 improves sevoflurane-induced POCD in rats through the PGC-1 alpha/BDNF/FNDC5 pathway.

AB  - One of the least understood and most threatened groups of elasmobranchs is the Rhinopristiformes, the guitarfishes, wedgefishes, and sawfishes. Numbering more than 60 species, this order includes a high percentage of Critically Endangered and Endangered species, as designated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. There is a dearth of data on these species due to sightings being infrequent and unpredictable. Globally, Rhinopristiformes are both directly targeted for their meat and large fins and are caught as bycatch in their near-shore habitats. We report here a consistent and predictable long-term presence of the Critically Endangered bowmouth guitarfish (Rhina ancylostomus) in the Gulf of Tadjoura, Djibouti. This species has been reliably encountered during diving and whale shark research activities (November-February) over seven seasons, indicating long-term site fidelity of R. ancylostomus within the area. Currently receiving minimal legal protection and facing unknown fishing pressures and ecological risks, these animals and their habitat should be prioritized for research and conservation.

AB  - Curcumin is a polyphenol substance considered to be effective in the treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. However, details regarding the exact mechanisms for the protective effects of curcumin in neuropsychiatric disorders, like depression, remain unknown. In the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) it appears that dysregulation of oxidative stress and immune systems, particularly within the hippocampal region, may play a critical role. Here, we show that pre-treatment with curcumin (40 mg kg(-1)) alleviates depression-like behaviors in a LPS-induced rat model of depression, effects which were accompanied with suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation and an inhibition of neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region, and results from ultramicrostructure electrophysiological experiments revealed that the curcumin pre-treatment significantly prevented excessive synaptic loss and enhanced synaptic functioning in this LPS-induced rat model. In addition, curcumin attenuated the increases in levels of miR-146a-5p and decreases in the expression of p-ERK signaling that would normally occur within CA1 regions of these depressed rats. Taken together, these results demonstrated that curcumin exerts neuroprotective and antidepressant activities by suppressing oxidative stress, neural inflammation and their related effects upon synaptic dysregulation. One of the mechanisms for these beneficial effects of curcumin appears to involve the miR-146a-5p/ERK signaling pathway within the hippocampal CA1 region. These findings not only elucidated some of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective/antidepressant effects of curcumin, but also suggested a role of curcumin as a potential therapeutic strategy for depression.

AB  - NLRP3 inflammasome activation is implicated in irradiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. Alternate-day fasting (ADF) has been demonstrated to improve neuroinflammation as a non-pharmacological intervention. However, the exact mechanism and the anti-inflammatory effect in irradiation-induced cognitive dysfunction still need further in-depth study. The present study examined the effects of eight-week ADF on the cognitive functions of mice as well as inflammasome-mediated hippocampal neuronal loss following irradiation in mouse models of irradiation-induced cognitive deficits using seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. The behavioral results of novel place recognition and object recognition tasks revealed that ADF ameliorated cognitive functions in irradiation-induced cognitive dysfunction mice. ADF inhibited the expression of components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ASC, and Cl.caspase-1), the downstream inflammatory factor (IL-18 and IL-18), and apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3) via western blotting. Furthermore, an increased number of neurons and activated astrocytes were observed in the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and Sholl analysis, which was jointly confirmed by western blotting. According to our study, this is the first time we found that ADF improved cognitive dysfunction induced by irradiation, and the anti-inflammatory effect of ADF could be due to inhibition in NLRP3-mediated hippocampal neuronal loss by suppressing astrocyte activation.

AB  - Rate of disappearance of fresh carcasses of various small palatable and unpalatable invertebrates exposed on soil surface in a semi-natural habitat showed how much they are protected chemically and mechanically without the contribution of their behaviour. Highly attractive species for the scavengers included woodlice Porcellionides pruinosus, young crickets Acheta domesticus, larvae of mealworm Tenebrio molitor and earwigs Forficula auricularia. Moderately attractive species was the lesser mealworm Alphitobius diaperinus. Least attractive species for the scavengers were firebugs Pyrrhocoris apterus and all ladybirds: Coccinella septempunctata, Hippodamia undecimnotata, Harmonia axyridis (adults and larvae), and Tytthaspis sedecimpunctata. Size of organisms and toughness of carcasses were not found to have influence on the speed of scavenging. Scavenging at night was slightly quicker than at day. Mostly ants were responsible for the scavenging.

AB  - The midbrain raphe serotonin (5HT) neurons provide the main ascending serotonergic projection to the forebrain, including hippocampus, which has a role in the pathophysiology of depressive disorder. Serotonin 5HT1A receptor (R) activation at the soma-dendritic level of serotonergic raphe neurons and glutamatergic hippocampal pyramidal neurons leads to a decrease in neuronal firing by activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. In this raphe-hippocampal serotonin neuron system, the existence of 5HT1AR-FGFR1 heteroreceptor complexes has been proven, but the functional receptor-receptor interactions in the heterocomplexes have only been investigated in CA1 pyramidal neurons of control Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In the current study, considering the impact of the receptor interplay in developing new antidepressant drugs, the effects of 5HT1AR-FGFR1 complex activation were investigated in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and in midbrain dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons of SD rats and of a genetic rat model of depression (the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats of SD origin) using an electrophysiological approach. The results showed that in the raphe-hippocampal 5HT system of SD rats, 5HT1AR-FGFR1 heteroreceptor activation by specific agonists reduced the ability of the 5HT1AR protomer to open the GIRK channels through the allosteric inhibitory interplay produced by the activation of the FGFR1 protomer, leading to increased neuronal firing. On the contrary, in FSL rats, FGFR1 agonist-induced inhibitory allosteric action at the 5HT1AR protomer was not able to induce this effect on GIRK channels, except in CA2 neurons where we demonstrated that the functional receptor-receptor interaction is needed for producing the effect on GIRK. In keeping with this evidence, hippocampal plasticity, evaluated as long-term potentiation induction ability in the CA1 field, was impaired by 5HT1AR activation both in SD and in FSL rats, which did not develop after combined 5HT1AR-FGFR1 heterocomplex activation in SD rats. It is therefore proposed that in the genetic FSL model of depression, there is a significant reduction in the allosteric inhibition exerted by the FGFR1 protomer on the 5HT1A protomer-mediated opening of the GIRK channels in the 5HT1AR-FGFR1 heterocomplex located in the raphe-hippocampal serotonin system. This may result in an enhanced inhibition of the dorsal raphe 5HT nerve cell and glutamatergic hippocampal CA1 pyramidal nerve cell firing, which we propose may have a role in depression.

AB  - Functional interactions between G protein-coupled receptors are poised to enhance neuronal sensitivity to neuromodulators and therapeutic drugs. Mu and delta opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) can interact when overexpressed in the same cells, but whether co-expression of endogenous MORs and DORs in neurons leads to functional interactions is unclear. Here, in mice, we show that both MORs and DORs inhibit parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PV-BCs) in hippocampal CA1 through partially occlusive signaling pathways that terminate on somato-dendritic potassium channels and presynaptic calcium channels. Using photoactivatable opioid neuropeptides, we find that DORs dominate the response to enkephalin in terms of both ligand sensitivity and kinetics, which may be due to relatively low expression levels of MOR. Opioid-activated potassium channels do not show heterologous desensitization, indicating that MORs and DORs signal independently. In a direct test for heteromeric functional interactions, the DOR antagonist TIPP-Psi does not alter the kinetics or potency of either the potassium channel or synaptic responses to photorelease of the MOR agonist [d-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO). Thus, aside from largely redundant and convergent signaling, MORs and DORs do not functionally interact in PV-BCs in a way that impacts somato-dendritic potassium currents or synaptic transmission. These findings imply that cross-talk between MORs and DORs, either in the form of physical interactions or synergistic intracellular signaling, is not a preordained outcome of co-expression in neurons.

AB  - Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants (senders) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants (receivers), however, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence.

AB  - Elephants exhibit remarkable vocal plasticity, and case studies reveal that individuals of African savannah (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants are capable of vocal production learning. Surprisingly, however, little is known about contextual learning (usage and comprehension learning) in elephant communication. Usage learning can be demonstrated by training animals to vocalize in an arbitrary (cue-triggered) context. Here we show that adult African savannah elephants (n = 13) can vocalize in response to verbal cues, reliably producing social call types such as the low-frequency rumble, trumpets and snorts as well as atypical sounds using various mechanisms, thus displaying compound vocal control. We further show that rumbles emitted upon trainer cues differ significantly in structure from rumbles triggered by social contexts of the same individuals (n = 6). Every form of social learning increases the complexity of a communication system. In elephants, we only poorly understand their vocal learning abilities and the underlying cognitive mechanisms. Among other research, this calls for controlled learning experiments in which the prerequisite is operant/volitional control of vocalizations. This article is part of the theme issue 'Vocal learning in animals and humans'.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the protective effects of SM on skeletal muscle and brain damage by regulation of BDNF/PGC1 alpha/irisin pathway via brain function related myokines in high-fat diet-induced OB mice. OB was induced by high-fat diet for 6 weeks. SM extract (SME) was administered with 200 mg/kg BW (LSM) and 500 mg/kg BW (HSM) by oral gavage every day for 12 weeks. Behavior tests such as grip strength, Y-maze, and passive avoidance test were conducted to analyze muscle and cognitive function. Histopathological changes in skeletal muscle and brain were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and the protein levels of biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, protein degradation, neuro-plasticity, and cell cycling were measured by western blot. SME regulated morphological changes (muscle cross-sectional area: 1.23%, 1.40%; density of neurons in hippocampus:1.74%, 1.73%) in T2DM mice. Importantly, SME supplementation significantly increased several muscle-derived myokines which might influence the expression of neuronal markers in OB mice (FGF21: 1.27%, 1.34%; PGC1 alpha: 1.0%, 1.32%; IRISIN: 1.9%, 1.08%; BDNF: 1.35%, 1.23%). Accordingly, SME activated hippocampal neurotrophic factors including BDNF (1.0%, 1.2%) and its associated PGC1 alpha/irisin pathway (PGC1 alpha :1.1%, 1.1%; IRISIN:1.1%, 0.9%) significantly. This study demonstrated the possibliy that protective myokines increased by SME supplementation may contribute to neuro-protection in OB mice. Taken together, the current study suggests that SME can be used to prevent skeletal muscle and brain damage in OB by protecting against oxidative stress and inflammatin via modulation of the BDNF/PGC1 alpha/irisin pathway in the therapeutic approach of obese patients.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The diversity of cell types is a challenge for quantifying aging and its reversal. Here we develop 'aging clocks' based on single-cell transcriptomics to characterize cell-type-specific aging and rejuvenation. We generated single-cell transcriptomes from the subventricular zone neurogenic region of 28 mice, tiling ages from young to old. We trained single-cell-based regression models to predict chronological age and biological age (neural stem cell proliferation capacity). These aging clocks are generalizable to independent cohorts of mice, other regions of the brains, and other species. To determine if these aging clocks could quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation, we generated single-cell transcriptomic datasets of neurogenic regions for two interventions-heterochronic parabiosis and exercise. Aging clocks revealed that heterochronic parabiosis and exercise reverse transcriptomic aging in neurogenic regions, but in different ways. This study represents the first development of high-resolution aging clocks from single-cell transcriptomic data and demonstrates their application to quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation.
   Single-cell transcriptomic data from a neurogenic region of the mouse brain were used to build aging clocks for specific neural cell types. These clocks showed that heterochronic parabiosis and exercise lead to distinct transcriptomic rejuvenation patterns across cell types.

AB  - Background/Aims: The nano-method has been used as a technique for creating novel, nontraditional antimicrobial agents. This effective method fortreating infectious diseases has many advantages over conventional antibiotics, including increased efficacy against species that have developed drug resistance, and the ability to circumvent the development of resistance that disrupts a number of biological pathways. As a result, the objective of this study was to synthesize and characterize silver nanoparticles using phenolic compounds obtained from Camellia sinensis. The nanoparticles were then used as antibacterial agents on the multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as, biofilm formation mechanism were also investigated. Methods: Ten isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were acquired from the labs of the University of Baghdad's Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Institute. The VITEK-2 system was used to confirm the diagnosis. Aqueous and methanolic extracts of Camellia sinensis leaves were used to create silver nanoparticles and obtain CAgNPs, which were then characterized using Atomic Fluorescence Microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and Zeta potential analyzers. The extracts were put through a series of assays, including High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), antibacterial activity assessments, and the microtiter plate method to determine the lowest inhibitory concentration (MIC) and antibiofilm formation. Results: Both aqueous and methanolic extracts containing silver nanoparticles included spherical nanoparticles that may be single or combined. The HPLC results showed the presence of two phenolic compounds (gallic acid and caffeine) by comparing their retention durations to those of the reference compounds. The results of the antibacterial activity of (CAgNPs) showed that the methanolic (CAgNPs) extract was more effective than the aqueous (CAgNPs) extract, producing inhibitory zones of 15.67 +/- 0.58 and 20.33 +/- 0.58 mm, at 375 and 750 ppm respectively, when compared to the aqueous (CAgNPs) extract, which produced inhibitory zones of 12.33 +/- 0.58 and 15.67 +/- 0.58 mm, respectively. The MIC result also showed that the CAgNPs methanolic extract was more effective than the CAgNPs aqueous extract. The MIC of the CAgNPs methanolic extract on S. aureus isolates were 11.718 and 23.43 mu g/ml, while the MIC of the CAgNPs aqueous extract on all S. aureus isolates were 46.87 mu g/ml except isolate No. 3 and 6 which was 11.718 and 93.75 mu g/ml respectively. Additionally, The anti-biofilm in S. aureus was increased when CAgNPs methanolic extract were used compared with the CAgNPs aqueous extract, the CAgNPs methanolic extract inhibited 80%, 90% and 100% of the biofilm formation of S. aureus in 23.43, 46.87 and 93.75 mu g/ml respectively, while the anti-biofilm activity of the CAgNPs aqueous extract on S. aureus isolates was 80% and 100% of the biofilm formation in 46.87 and 93.75 mu g/ml respectively. Conclusion: The methanolic and aqueous leaves extracts from Camellia sinensis are a successful method for producing CAgNPs. The synthesized CAgNPs also have significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus, depending on the concentrations, and inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Wild Chinese prickly ash resources provide a valuable genetic resource for Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim improvement and breeding. The Qinling Mountains was an abundant source for wild Chinese prickly ash. In this study, the phenolic and flavonoid compounds of wild germplasm resources from different altitudes and six cultivated varieties were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chromatograms of them were essentially consistent, although their chemical composition contents were greatly different. The thirty samples were divided into three categories through the hierarchical clustering analysis. Catechin, hyperoside and quercitrin were considered to be key compounds for the quality evaluation, and by contrast, the wild samples with an altitude of 2300 +/- 50 m (Group IV) had the highest content of key compounds, and presented stronger antioxidant activity and antibacterial ability, indicating that these wild samples could be identified as the excellent breeding resources. This is the first time to evaluate the quality of wild Chinese prickly ash at different altitudes in Qinling Mountains. These excellent wild germplasm resources provided substantial potential accessions for use directly in Chinese prickly ash breeding programs.

AB  - Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is an active component in Astragalus membranaceus with the potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's diseases (ADs). However, its mechanisms are still not known. Herein, we aimed to explore the systematic pharmacological mechanism of AS-IV for treating AD. Drug prediction, network pharmacology, and functional bioinformatics analyses were conducted. Molecular docking was applied to validate reliability of the interactions and binding affinities between AS-IV and related targets. Finally, experimental verification was carried out in A beta O infusion produced AD-like phenotypes to investigate the molecular mechanisms. We found that AS-IV works through a multitarget synergistic mechanism, including inflammation, nervous system, cell proliferation, apoptosis, pyroptosis, calcium ion, and steroid. AS-IV highly interacted with PPAR gamma, caspase-1, GSK3 Beta, PSEN1, and TRPV1 after docking simulations. Meanwhile, PPAR gamma interacts with caspase-1, GSK3 Beta, PSEN1, and TRPV1. In vivo experiments showed that A beta O infusion produced AD-like phenotypes in mice, including impairment of fear memory, neuronal loss, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic deficits in the hippocampus. Especially, the expression of PPAR gamma, as well as BDNF, was also reduced in the hippocampus of AD-like mice. Conversely, AS-IV improved A beta O infusion-induced memory impairment, inhibited neuronal loss and the phosphorylation of tau, and prevented the synaptic deficits. AS-IV prevented A beta O infusion-induced reduction of PPAR gamma and BDNF. Moreover, the inhibition of PPAR gamma attenuated the effects of AS-IV on BDNF, neuroflammation, and pyroptosis in AD-like mice. Taken together, AS-IV could prevent AD-like phenotypes and reduce tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic deficits, neuroinflammation, and pyroptosis, possibly via regulating PPAR gamma.

AB  - Plant viruses represent a risk to agricultural production and as only a few treatments exist, it is urgent to identify resistance mechanisms and factors. In plant immunity, plasma membrane (PM)-localized proteins play an essential role in sensing the extracellular threat presented by bacteria, fungi, or herbivores. Viruses are intracellular pathogens and as such the role of the plant PM in detection and resistance against viruses is often overlooked. We investigated the role of the partially PM-bound Calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (CPK3) in viral infection and we discovered that it displayed a specific ability to hamper viral propagation over CPK isoforms that are involved in immune response to extracellular pathogens. More and more evidence supports that the lateral organization of PM proteins and lipids underlies signal transduction in plants. We showed here that CPK3 diffusion in the PM is reduced upon activation as well as upon viral infection and that such immobilization depended on its substrate, Remorin (REM1.2), a scaffold protein. Furthermore, we discovered that the viral infection induced a CPK3-dependent increase of REM1.2 PM diffusion. Such interdependence was also observable regarding viral propagation. This study unveils a complex relationship between a kinase and its substrate that contrasts with the commonly described co-stabilisation upon activation while it proposes a PM-based mechanism involved in decreased sensitivity to viral infection in plants.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict is a common issue in the agricultural sector, often resulting in crop damage. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of threatening vocalisation playbacks as a mitigation method to deter elephant encroachment into agricultural areas. The study was conducted at the National Elephant Conservation Centre (NECC) in Kuala Gandah, Pahang, Malaysia, involving two male and five female elephants. Five soundtracks were played to observe the elephants' responses: the sound of a buzzing bee, a tiger roar, an elephant rumble, rain (control) and nocturnal jungle sounds (control). The elephants' behaviours were recorded during and after exposure to each soundtrack. The results showed that the elephants responded most strongly to the tiger roar (33%), followed by the buzzing bee sound (23%), while the elephant rumble elicited the fewest responses (8%). The tiger roar and buzzing bee sounds also resulted in the longest halt times, with the elephants stopping and standing still, particularly the older group (p < 0.05). Male and female elephants exhibited similar responses to the sound playbacks (p > 0.05). This study suggests that playback of threatening vocalisations could serve as an additional mitigation strategy to deter elephants from encroaching on agricultural sites, such as oil palm plantations.

AB  - Neural models of approach-avoidance (AA) conflict behavior and its dysfunction have focused traditionally on the hippocampus, with the assumption that this medial temporal lobe (MTL) structure plays a ubiquitous role in arbitrating AA conflict. We challenge this perspective by using three different AA behavioral tasks in conjunction with optogenetics, to demonstrate that a neighboring region in male rats, perirhinal cortex, is also critically involved but only when conflicting motivational values are associated with objects and not contextual information. The ventral hippocampus, in contrast, was found not to be essential for object-associated AA conflict, suggesting its preferential involvement in context-associated conflict. We propose that stimulus type can impact MTL involvement during AA conflict and that a more nuanced understanding of MTL contributions to impaired AA behavior (e.g., anxiety) is required. These findings serve to expand upon the established functions of the perirhinal cortex while concurrently presenting innovative behavioral paradigms that permit the assessment of different facets of AA conflict behavior.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta peptides (A beta) and impaired glucose metabolism in the brain. Osteocalcin (OCN), an osteoblast-derived protein, has been shown to modulate brain functions but whether it has any effect on AD is undetermined. In this study, daily intraperitoneal injection of OCN for 4 weeks ameliorated the anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive dysfunctions in the APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice model, as shown in the increased entries into the central area in open field test, the increased time and entries into open arms in elevated plus maze test, the increased time spent in the light chamber in light-dark transition test, as well as the reduced escape latency and the increased preference for target quadrant in Morris water maze test. A beta burden in the hippocampus and cortex of AD mice was ameliorated by OCN. Besides, OCN improved the neural network function of the brain, mainly in the enhanced power of high gamma band in the medial prefrontal cortex of AD mice. The proliferation of astrocytes in the hippocampus in AD mice was also inhibited by OCN as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, OCN enhanced glycolysis in astrocytes and microglia, as evidenced by elevated glucose consumption, lactate production, and increased extracellular acidification rate. Such an effect was abolished when the receptor of OCN - Gpr158 was knockdown in astrocytes. Our study revealed OCN as a novel therapeutic factor for AD potentially through reducing A beta burden and upregulation of glycolysis in neuroglia.

AB  - Excitotoxicity is a common pathological process in neurological diseases caused by excess glutamate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gypenoside XVII (GP-17), a gypenoside monomer, on the glutamatergic system. In vitro, in rat cortical nerve terminals (synaptosomes), GP-17 dose-dependently decreased glutamate release with an IC50 value of 16 mu M. The removal of extracellular Ca2+ or blockade of N-and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and protein kinase A (PKA) abolished the inhibitory effect of GP-17 on glutamate release from cortical synaptosomes. GP-17 also significantly reduced the phosphorylation of PKA, SNAP-25, and synapsin I in cortical synaptosomes. In an in vivo rat model of glutamate excitotoxicity induced by kainic acid (KA), GP-17 pretreatment significantly prevented seizures and rescued neuronal cell injury and glutamate elevation in the cortex. GP-17 pretreatment decreased the expression levels of sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1, glutamate synthesis enzyme glutaminase and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 but increased the expression level of glutamate metabolism enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase in the cortex of KA-treated rats. In addition, the KA-induced alterations in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits GluN2A and GluN2B in the cortex were prevented by GP-17 pretreatment. GP-17 also prevented the KA-induced decrease in cerebral blood flow and arginase II expression. These results suggest that (i) GP-17, through the suppression of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and consequent PKA-mediated SNAP-25 and synapsin I phosphorylation, reduces glutamate exocytosis from cortical synaptosomes; and (ii) GP-17 has a neuroprotective effect on KA-induced glutamate excitotoxicity in rats through regulating synaptic glutamate release and cerebral blood flow.

AB  - Osthole, a natural coumarin found in various medicinal plants, has been previously reported to have neuroprotective effects. However, the specific mechanism by which Osthole alleviates dysmnesia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective properties of Osthole against cognitive impairment in rats induced by D-galactose and elucidate its pharmacological mechanism. The rat model was established by subcutaneously injecting D-galactose at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 56 days. The effect of Osthole on cognitive impairment was evaluated by behavior and biochemical analysis. Subsequently, a combination of in silico prediction and experimental validation was performed to verify the network-based predictions, using western blot, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrate that Osthole could improve memory dysfunction induced by D-galactose in Sprague Dawley male rats. A network proximity-based approach and integrated pathways analysis highlight two key AD-related pathological processes that may be regulated by Osthole, including neuronal apoptosis, i.e., neuroinflammation. Among them, the pro-apoptotic markers (Bax), anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), the microgliosis (Iba-1), Astro-cytosis (GFAP), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-R1) were evaluated in both hippocampus and cortex. The results indicated that Osthole significantly ameliorated neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation in D-galactose-induced cognitive impairment rats. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the pharmacological mechanism of Osthole in mitigating D-galactose-induced memory impairment and identifies Osthole as a potential drug candidate for AD treatment, targeting multiple signaling pathways through network proximity and integrated pathways analysis.

AB  - Neuroinflammation characterized by microglia activation is the mechanism of the occurrence and development of various central nervous system diseases. ST2825, as a peptide-mimetic MyD88 homodimerization inhibitor, has been identified as crucial molecule with an anti-inflammatory role in several immune cells, especially microglia. The purpose of the study was to investigate the anti-neuroinflammatory effects and the possible mechanism of ST2825. Methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate neuroinflammation in male BALB/c mice and BV2 microglia cells. The NO level was determined by Griess Reagents. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were determined by ELISA. The expressions of inflammatory proteins were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis. The level of ROS was detected by DCFH-DA staining. Results: In vivo, the improved levels of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, MCP-1 and ICAM-1 in the cortex and hippocampus, were reduced after ST2825 treatment. In vitro, the levels of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory factors, including NO, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, MCP-1, iNOS, COX2 and ROS, were remarkably decreased after ST2825 treatment. Further research found that the mechanism of its anti-neuroinflammatory effects appeared to be associated with inhibition of NF-kappa B activation and down-regulation of the NLRP3/cleaved caspase-1 signaling pathway. Conclusions: The current findings provide new insights into the activity and molecular mechanism of ST2825 for the treatment of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Depression is a highly prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder worldwide. One currently accepted hypothesis of this pathogenesis is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, which involves oxidative stress and brain damage. Therefore, antioxidants, such as phenolic compounds, could be used in depression. In this study, we investigated the antidepressant-like and antioxidant effects of an aqueous extract of the leaves of three species of the genus Psidium , Myrtaceae family, in mice. The exotic Psidium guajava L. and the natives Psidium guineense Sw. and Psidium cattleianum Sabine (10, 1, and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) were administered orally (p. o.) once daily for 21 days, with or without corticosterone (20 mg/kg). After behavioral assessments (tail suspension, splash, and open-field tests), the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, liver, kidneys, and plasma were examined to determine the oxidative stress status. The three extracts and fluoxetine treatment decreased the immobility time and counteracted the oxidative stress induced by corticosterone administration. The phenolic compounds identified as major components of the extracts, quercetin in P. guajava and P. guineense and o -coumaric acid in P. cattleianum , may be involved in the biological activities. Therefore, the aqueous leaf extracts of P. guajava, P. cattleianum , and P. guineense could be potential antidepressants helpful in treating depression and other diseases with elevated nitro-oxidative stress.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neuron cultures have emerged as models of electrical activity in the human brain. Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) measure changes in the extracellular electric potential of cell cultures or tissues and enable the recording of neuronal network activity. MEAs have been applied to both human subjects and hPSC-derived brain models. Here, we review the literature on the functional characterization of hPSC-derived two- and three-dimensional brain models with MEAs and examine their network function in physiological and pathological contexts. We also summarize MEA results from the human brain and compare them to the literature on MEA recordings of hPSC-derived brain models. MEA recordings have shown network activity in two-dimensional hPSC-derived brain models that is comparable to the human brain and revealed pathology-associated changes in disease models. Three-dimensional hPSC-derived models such as brain organoids possess a more relevant microenvironment, tissue architecture and potential for modeling the network activity with more complexity than two-dimensional models. hPSC-derived brain models recapitulate many aspects of network function in the human brain and provide valid disease models, but certain advancements in differentiation methods, bioengineering and available MEA technology are needed for these approaches to reach their full potential.

AB  - Epilepsy is known to cause alterations in neural networks. However, many details of these changes remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in the properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and their synaptic inputs in a rat lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy. In the chronic phase of the model, we found a marked loss of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area. However, the membrane properties of the neurons remained essentially unaltered. The results of the electrophysiological and morphological studies indicate that the direct pathway from the entorhinal cortex to CA1 neurons is reinforced in epileptic animals, whereas the inputs to them from CA3 are either unaltered or even diminished. In particular, the dendritic spine density in the str. lacunosum moleculare, where the direct pathway from the entorhinal cortex terminates, was found to be 2.5 times higher in epileptic rats than in control rats. Furthermore, the summation of responses upon stimulation of the temporoammonic pathway was enhanced by approximately twofold in epileptic rats. This enhancement is believed to be a significant contributing factor to the heightened epileptic activity observed in the entorhinal cortex of epileptic rats using an ex vivo 4-aminopyridine model.

AB  - Objective. To explore the effect of miR-136 on temporal lobe epilepsy (Ep) and its mechanism of action. Methods. 30 male rats were injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg/kg pilocarpine to construct a rat temporal lobe epilepsy model, and they were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=6 per group): control group, Ep group, agomir NC group, miR-136 agomir group, and miR-136+LiCl group. The brain tissues of the rats were collected 7 days after the treatment. The expression of miR-136 in the hippocampus tissue was detected by qRT-PCR. H & E and Nissl staining were used to observe the histopathological changes and neuron damage in the hippocampus tissue. IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus tissue were detected by ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate in the hippocampus tissue. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of c-Caspase-3, Bcl-2, beta-catenin, Cyclin D1, and c-myc protein in the hippocampus. Results. The expression of miR-136 was significantly downregulated in the hippocampus tissue of epileptic rats. After overexpression of miR-136, the number of seizures and the duration of epilepsy in rats were significantly reduced. At the same time, hippocampal tissue damage was improved considerably, and the degree of neuronal damage decreased. Overexpression of miR-136 also significantly reduced the apoptosis rate in the hippocampus tissue and inhibited the levels of inflammatory factors. Meanwhile, miR-136 downregulates the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins. However, Wnt pathway activator LiCl could destroy the protective effect of miR-136. Conclusion. miR-136 could exert its neuroprotective influence on temporal lobe epilepsy rats by inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

AB  - In the human brain, attention plays a crucial role in encoding information into memory. Therefore, focused attention during encoding enhances the likelihood of information being effectively encoded and stored in memory. This phenomenon is creatively replicated in our proposed synaptic devices, which regulate the forgetting curves by manipulating the gate voltage. Thus, the proposed transistor devices separate long-term memory from long-lasting memory. TiO2-based synaptic transistors are used to replicate brain functions, from vision processing to memory retention. The photosensitive nature of TiO2 enables the utilization of both photo-and electric stimuli. The electrical properties of the synaptic devices induced by photostimulation replicate the human-vision process, while those elicited by electric stimulation simulate memory-retention capabilities. By applying a shallow trap with a short lifetime, light stimulation can be utilized to mimic the effects of short-term memory. A deep trap with a long lifetime is employed in electrical memory to replicate the phenomena asso-ciated with persisting memory. A simulation of the MNIST recognition of an artificial neural network constructed with the measured synaptic characteristics exhibit an accuracy rate of 92.96%, which indicates that the proposed device can be successfully incorporated into neuromorphic devices.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play significant roles in neurological diseases, including epilepsy. Our previous study identified lncRNA-GPHN as specifically downregulated in a rat model of status epilepticus (SE). Investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA-GPHN in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. SE rat and in vitro cell models were used to analyse expression dynamics, cellular localisation, and effects of lncRNA-GPHN on epileptic seizures, followed by HE staining, Nissl staining, and TUNEL staining. Luciferase Reporter assay, ChIRP assay, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blotting accompanied with TUNEL assay and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were employed to determine the molecular mechanism in lncRNA-GPHN regulating epilepsy in neurons. Post-seizure, lncRNA-GPHN in SE rats' hippocampus was markedly downregulated, hitting a nadir at 24 h. FISH and qPCR confirmed its cytoplasmic localization in neurons. EEG showed that lncRNA-GPHN overexpression significantly curtailed seizure frequency and intensity, elevating the threshold, while MWM results pointed to enhanced cognition in SE rats. Histological staining revealed less neuronal damage and better cellular integrity in overexpressing rats, accompanied with a reduction in neuronal apoptosis. In vitro, lncRNA-GPHN reduced neuronal excitability and epileptic potentials dose-dependently. q-PCR and ChIRP showed lncRNA-GPHN upregulates YWHAH by sequestering miR-320. Dual-luciferase and Western blot validated miR-320's direct suppression of YWHAH and lncRNA-GPHN's counteracting effect. TUNEL staining confirmed that miR-320 overexpression increased apoptosis, mitigated by lncRNA-GPHN overexpression and further reduced with combined overexpression. lncRNA-GPHN ameliorates epilepsy by inhibiting apoptosis via the miR-320/YWHAH axis, providing insights into epilepsy pathogenesis and potential targeted therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Black net shade treatment attenuates flavonoid biosynthesis in tea plants, while the effect of light quality is still unclear. We investigated the flavonoid and transcriptome profiles of tea leaves under different light conditions, using black nets with different shade percentages, blue, yellow and red nets to alter the light intensity and light spectral composition in the fields. Flavonol glycosides are more sensitive to light intensity than catechins, with a reduction percentage of total flavonol glycosides up to 79.6% compared with 38.7% of total catechins under shade treatment. A total of 29,292 unigenes were identified, and the KEGG result indicated that flavonoid biosynthesis was regulated by both light intensity and light spectral composition while phytohormone signal transduction was modulated under blue net shade treatment. PAL, CHS, and F3H were transcriptionally downregulated with light intensity. Co-expression analysis showed the expressions of key transcription factors MYB12, MYB86, C1, MYB4, KTN80.4, and light signal perception and signaling genes (UVR8, HY5) had correlations with the contents of certain flavonoids (p < 0.05). The level of abscisic acid in tea leaves was elevated under shade treatment, with a negative correlation with TFG content (p < 0.05). This work provides a potential route of changing light intensity and spectral composition in the field to alter the compositions of flavor substances in tea leaves and regulate plant growth, which is instructive to the production of summer/autumn tea and matcha.

AB  - G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are critical determinants of neuronal excitability. They have been proposed as potential targets to restore excitatory/inhibitory balance in acute amyloidosis models, where hyperexcitability is a hallmark. However, the role of GIRK signaling in transgenic mice models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is largely unknown. Here, we study whether progressive amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation in the hippocampus during aging alters GIRK channel expression in mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP(Sw,Ind) J9) transgenic AD mice. Additionally, we examine the impact of spatial memory training in a hippocampal-dependent task, on protein expression of GIRK subunits and Regulator of G-protein signaling 7 (RGS7) in the hippocampus of APP(Sw,Ind) J9 mice. Firstly, we found a reduction in GIRK2 expression (the main neuronal GIRK channels subunit) in the hippocampus of 6-month-old APP(Sw,Ind) J9 mice. Moreover, we found an aging effect on GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits in both wild type (WT) and APP(Sw,Ind) J9 Ind mice. Finally, when 6-month-old animals were challenged to a spatial memory training, GIRK2 expression in the APP(Sw,Ind) J9 mice were normalized to WT levels. Together, our results support the evidence that GIRK2 could account for the excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission imbalance found in AD models, and training in a cognitive hippocampal dependent task may have therapeutic benefits of reversing this effect and lessen early AD deficits.

AB  - Cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by postural, motor, and cognitive disorders, being one of the main causes of physical and intellectual disability in childhood. To minimize functional impairments, the use of resveratrol as a therapeutic strategy is highlighted due to its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in different regions of the brain. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of neonatal treatment with resveratrol on postural development, motor function, oxidative balance, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to a cerebral palsy model. Neonatal treatment with resveratrol attenuated deficits in somatic growth, postural development, and muscle strength in rats submitted to cerebral palsy. Related to oxidative balance, resveratrol in cerebral palsy decreased the levels of MDA and carbonyls. Related to mitochondrial biogenesis, was observed in animals with cerebral palsy treated with resveratrol, an increase in mRNA levels of TFAM, in association with the increase of citrate synthase activity. The data demonstrated a promising effect of neonatal resveratrol treatment, improving postural and muscle deficits induced by cerebral palsy. These findings were associated with improvements in oxidative balance and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain of rats submitted to cerebral palsy.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly accompanied by learning and memory deficits. This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis A6 (BAA6) on behaviour and memory function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The results showed that BAA6 treatment ameliorated spatial working memory deficits and inhibited hippocampal neuron loss in SHRs. The levels of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine, and the brain derived neurotrophic factor increased and that of glutamate decreased in the brain tissue of SHRs after BAA6 administration. Moreover, BAA6 reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and antioxidant glutathione in SHRs. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that BAA6 treatment changed the gut microbiota composition. BAA6 promoted beneficial Lactobacillus, Romboutsia, Blautia, and Turicibacter, and decreased the enrichment of bacterial genera such as Dietzia, Sporosarcina, Brevibacterium, NK4A214_group, Atopostipes, and Facklamia negatively associated with neurotransmitter release and anti-inflammatory effects in SHRs. Together, these results suggested that BAA6 improved memory function by ameliorating hippocampal damage, abnormal neurotransmitter release and cerebral inflammation by reshaping the gut microbiota in SHRs. This study provides a scientific basis for the development and application of BAA6 as a promising dietary intervention to reduce the risk of ADHD.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) plays a crucial role in metabolism and brain function. Glucosamine (GLN) has been recognized for its diverse beneficial effects. This study aimed to elucidate the modulation of FGF21 production by GLN and its impact on learning and memory functions. Using both in vivo and in vitro models, we investigated the effects of GLN on mice fed with a normal diet or high-fat diet and on mouse HT22 hippocampal cells, STHdhQ7/Q7 striatal cells, and rat primary cortical neurons challenged with GLN. Our results indicated that GLN promotes learning and memory functions in mice and upregulates FGF21 expression in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum, as well as in HT22 cells, STHdhQ7/Q7 cells, and cortical neurons. In animals receiving GLN together with an FGF21 receptor FGFR1 inhibitor (PD173074), the GLN-enhanced learning and memory functions and induction of FGF21 production in the hippocampus were significantly attenuated. While exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms, the potential involvement of NF-kappa B, Akt, p38, JNK, PKA, and PPAR alpha in HT22 and NF-kappa B, Akt, p38, and PPAR alpha in STHdhQ7/Q7 were noted; GLN was able to mediate the activation of p65, Akt, p38, and CREB in HT22 and p65, Akt, and p38 in STHdhQ7/Q7 cells. Our accumulated findings suggest that GLN may increase learning and memory functions by inducing FGF21 production in the brain. This induction appears to be mediated, at least in part, through GLN's activation of the NF-kappa B, Akt, p38, and PKA/CREB pathways.

AB  - This work aimed to test the effect of 7-day exposure of rats to multifunctional enkephalin analogs LYS739 and LYS744 at doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg on the protein composition of rat spleen lymphocytes, brain cortex, and hippocampus. Alterations of proteome induced by LYS739 and LYS744 were compared with those elicited by morphine. The changes in rat proteome profiles were analyzed by label-free quantification (MaxLFQ). Proteomic analysis indicated that the treatment with 3 mg/kg of LYS744 caused significant alterations in protein expression levels in spleen lymphocytes (45), rat brain cortex (31), and hippocampus (42). The identified proteins were primarily involved in RNA processing and the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. In spleen lymphocytes, the administration of the higher 10 mg/kg dose of both enkephalin analogs caused major, extensive modifications in protein expression levels: LYS739 (119) and LYS744 (182). Among these changes, the number of proteins associated with immune responses and apoptotic processes was increased. LYS739 treatment resulted in the highest number of alterations in the rat brain cortex (152) and hippocampus (45). The altered proteins were functionally related to the regulation of transcription and cytoskeletal reorganization, which plays an essential role in neuronal plasticity. Administration with LYS744 did not increase the number of altered proteins in the brain cortex (26) and hippocampus (26). Our findings demonstrate that the effect of kappa-OR full antagonism of LYS744 is opposite in the central nervous system and the peripheral region (spleen lymphocytes).

AB  - Neuroinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is notably dependent on age. One important inflammatory pathway exerted by innate immune cells of the nervous system in response to danger signals is mediated by inflammasomes (IF) and leads to the generation of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines. The protein "apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain" (ASC) modulates IF activation but has also other functions which are crucial in AD. We intended to characterize immunohistochemically ASC and pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of IF in the hippocampus (HP) of the transgenic mouse model Tg2576 (APP), in which amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology is directly dependent on age. We show in old-aged APP a significant amount of ASC in microglia and astrocytes associated withA beta plaques, in the absence of PRR described by others in glial cells. In addition, APP developed foci with clusters of extracellular ASC granules not spatiallyrelated to A beta plaques, which density correlated with the advanced age of mice and AD development. Clusters were associated withspecific astrocytes characterized by their enlarged ring-shaped process terminals, ASC content, and frequent perivascular location. Their possible implication in ASC clearance and propagation of inflammation is discussed.

AB  - Inhibitory interneurons are crucial to brain function and their dysfunction is implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions. Emerging evidence indicates that cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons (CCK+) are highly heterogenous. We find that a large subset of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons express CCK strongly; between 40 and 56% of PV+ interneurons in mouse hippocampal CA1 express CCK. Primate interneurons also exhibit substantial PV/CCK co-expression. Mouse PV+/CCK+ and PV+/CCK- cells show distinguishable electrophysiological and molecular characteristics. Analysis of single nuclei RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data shows that PV+/CCK+ cells are a subset of PV+ cells, not of synuclein gamma positive (SNCG+) cells, and that they strongly express oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes. We find that mitochondrial complex I and IV-associated OXPHOS gene expression is strongly correlated with CCK expression in PV+ interneurons at both the transcriptomic and protein levels. Both PV+ interneurons and dysregulation of OXPHOS processes are implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum (ASD) disorder and schizophrenia (SCZ). Analysis of human brain samples from patients with these conditions shows alterations in OXPHOS gene expression. Together these data reveal important molecular characteristics of PV-CCK co-expressing interneurons and support their implication in neuropsychiatric conditions.

AB  - Cigarette smoke (CS) is the major factor in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death worldwide. Furthermore, although Camellia sinensis (CN) has been known as an anti-inflammatory material, the effect of CN has not yet been known on pulmonary inflammation in COPD. Thus, we investigated the protective effects of Camellia sinensis L. extract (CLE) against pulmonary inflammation in porcine pancreas elastase (PPE) and a cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced COPD mouse model. Oral administration of CLE suppressed the symptoms such as infiltration of immune cells, cytokines/chemokines secretion, mucus hypersecretion, and injuries of the lung parenchyma. Increased inflammatory responses in COPD are mediated by various immune cells such as airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, and alveolar macrophages. Thus, we investigated the effect and mechanisms of CLE in H292, HL-60, and MH-S cells. The CLE inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-8, MUC5AC and MUC5B on CSE/LPS-stimulated H292 cells and also suppressed the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and secretion of neutrophil elastase by inhibiting reactive oxygen species in PMA-induced HL-60 cells. In particular, the CLE suppressed the release of cytokines and chemokines caused by activating the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B via the activation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 and the heme oxygenase-1 pathway in CSE/LPS-stimulated MH-S cells. Therefore, we suggest that the CLE administration be the effective approach for treating or preventing chronic pulmonary diseases such as COPD induced by CS.

AB  - Inflammation is a common feature of neurological disorders that alters cell function in microglia and astrocytes as well as other neuronal cell types. Astrocytes modulate blood flow, regulate glutamate metabolism, and exert antioxidant protection. When responding to inflammatory damage, astrocytes enhance immune cell infiltration and amplify inflammatory responses via the upregulation of cytokine production. Several molecules have been proposed to attenuate neuroinflammation and control neurological diseases. Curcumin gained attention due to its capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and its well- described anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Our study aimed to understand if oral curcumin administration could protect against central nervous system inflammatory damage induced by intracerebroventricular injection of LPS while focusing on astrocyte function. Despite its poor bioavailability, we found that curcumin reaches the central nervous system, prevents the locomotory damage caused by LPS, and reduces inflammatory signaling via IL-1 beta beta and COX-2. Furthermore, we observed that curcumin was protective against LPS-induced S100B secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid and GSH reduction in the hippocampal tissue. However, curcumin could not protect the animals from anhedonia, assessed by the sucrose preference test, and weight loss induced by LPS. Our results indicate that oral curcumin administration exerts a protective anti-inflammatory action in the central nervous system, attenuating the sickness behavior induced by ICV LPS. This work demonstrates that curcumin has an important modulative effect on astrocytes, thus suggesting that astrocytes are critical to the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin.

AB  - The phenomenon of individual variability in susceptibility/resilience to stress and depression, in which the hippocampus plays a pivotal role, is attracting increasing attention. We investigated the potential role of hippocampal cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which regulates plasticity, neuroimmune function, and stress responses that are all linked to this risk dichotomy. We used a four-week-long chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, in which mice could be stratified according to their susceptibility/resilience to anhedonia, a key feature of depression, to investigate hippocampal expression of COX-2, a marker of microglial activation Iba-1, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Rat exposure, social defeat, restraints, and tail suspension were used as stressors. We compared the effects of treatment with either the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (30 mg/kg/day) or citalopram (15 mg/kg/day). For the celecoxib and vehicle-treated mice, the Porsolt test was used. Anhedonic (susceptible) but not non-anhedonic (resilient) animals exhibited elevated COX-2 mRNA levels, increased numbers of COX-2 and Iba-1-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 area, and decreased numbers of Ki67-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Drug treatment decreased the percentage of anhedonic mice, normalized swimming activity, reduced behavioral despair, and improved conditioned fear memory. Hippocampal over-expression of COX-2 is associated with susceptibility to stress-induced anhedonia, and its pharmacological inhibition with celecoxib has antidepressant effects that are similar in size to those of citalopram.

AB  - Chronic cerebral ischemia is a complex form of stress, of which the most common hemodynamic characteristic is chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Lasting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can drive neurological disorders. Targeting ER stress shows potential neuroprotective effects against stroke. However, the role of ER stress in CCH pathological processes and the effects of targeting ER stress on brain ischemia are unclear. Here, a CCH rat model was established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Rats were treated with 4-PBA, URB597, or both for 4 weeks. Neuronal morphological damage was detected using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The expression levels of the ER stress-ASK1 cascade-related proteins GRP78, IRE1 alpha, TRAF2, CHOP, Caspase-12, ASK1, p-ASK1, JNK, and p-JNK were assessed by Western blot. The mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and iNOS were assessed by RT-PCR. For oxygen-glucose deprivation experiments, mouse hippocampal HT22 neurons were used. Apoptosis of the hippocampus and HT22 cells was detected by TUNEL staining and Annexin V-FITC analysis, respectively. CCH evoked ER stress with increased expression of GRP78, IRE1 alpha, TRAF2, CHOP, and Caspase-12. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between TRAF2 and ASK1. ASK1/JNK signaling, inflammatory cytokines, and neuronal apoptosis were enhanced, accompanied by persistent ER stress; these were reversed by 4-PBA and URB597. Furthermore, the ASK1 inhibitor GS4997 and 4-PBA displayed synergistic anti-apoptotic effects in cells with oxygen-glucose deprivation. In summary, ER stress-induced apoptosis in CCH is associated with the IRE1 alpha/TRAF2/ASK1/JNK signaling pathway. Targeting the ER stress-ASK1 cascade could be a novel therapeutic approach for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a common degenerative disease which has a great impact on people's daily lives, but there is still a certain market gap in the drug research about it. Palmatine, one of the main components of Huangteng, the rattan stem of Fibraurea recisa Pierre (Menispermaceae), has potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of palmatine on amyloid beta protein 25-35-induced rat pheochromocytoma cells and AD mice and to investigate its mechanism of action. CCK8 assays, ELISA, the Morris water maze assay, fluorescent probes, calcein/PI staining, immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis were used. The experimental results show that palmatine can increase the survival rate of A beta 25-35-induced PC12 cells and mouse hippocampal neurons, reduce apoptosis, reduce the content of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, GSH, SOD, MDA and ROS, improve the learning and memory ability of AD mice, inhibit the expression of Keap-1 and Bax, and promote the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and Bcl-2. We conclude that palmatine can ameliorate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation produced by A beta 25-35-induced PC12 cells and mice by modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that palmatine may have a potential therapeutic effect on AD and could be further investigated as a promising therapeutic agent for AD. It provides a theoretical basis for the development of related drugs.

AB  - Through GWAS studies we identified PATJ associated with functional outcome after ischemic stroke (IS). The aim of this study was to determine PATJ role in brain endothelial cells (ECs) in the context of stroke outcome. PATJ expression analyses in patient's blood revealed that: (i) the risk allele of rs76221407 induces higher expression of PATJ, (ii) PATJ is downregulated 24 h after IS, and (iii) its expression is significantly lower in those patients with functional independence, measured at 3 months with the modified Rankin scale ((mRS) <= 2), compared to those patients with marked disability (mRS = 4-5). In mice brains, PATJ was also downregulated in the injured hemisphere at 48 h after ischemia. Oxygen-glucose deprivation and hypoxia-dependent of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha also caused PATJ depletion in ECs. To study the effects of PATJ downregulation, we generated PATJ-knockdown human microvascular ECs. Their transcriptomic profile evidenced a complex cell reprogramming involving Notch, TGF-ss, PI3K/Akt, and Hippo signaling that translates in morphological and functional changes compatible with endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT). PATJ depletion caused loss of cell-cell adhesion, upregulation of metalloproteases, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cytoplasmic accumulation of the signal transducer C-terminal transmembrane Mucin 1 (MUC1-C) and downregulation of Notch and Hippo signaling. The EndMT phenotype of PATJ-depleted cells was associated with the nuclear recruitment of MUC1-C, YAP/TAZ, beta-catenin, and ZEB1. Our results suggest that PATJ downregulation 24 h after IS promotes EndMT, an initial step prior to secondary activation of a pro-angiogenic program. This effect is associated with functional independence suggesting that activation of EndMT shortly after stroke onset is beneficial for stroke recovery.

AB  - 3-(1-Naphthalenylmethyl)-1-pentyl-1H-indole (JWH-175) is a synthetic cannabinoid illegally marketed for its psychoactive cannabis-like effects. This study aimed to investigate and compare in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of JWH-175 with that of 1-naphthalenyl (1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-methanone (JWH-018), as well as evaluate the in vitro (human liver microsomes) and in vivo (urine and plasma of CD-1 male mice) metabolic profile of JWH-175. In vitro binding studies showed that JWH-175 is a cannabinoid receptor agonist less potent than JWH-018 on mouse and human CB1 and CB2 receptors. In agreement with in vitro data, JWH-175 reduced the fESPS in brain hippocampal slices of mice less effectively than JWH-018. Similarly, in vivo behavioral studies showed that JWH-175 impaired sensorimotor responses, reduced breath rate and motor activity, and increased pain threshold to mechanical stimuli less potently than JWH-018. Metabolic studies demonstrated that JWH-175 is rapidly bioactivated to JWH-018 in mice blood, suggesting that in vivo effects of JWH-175 are also due to JWH-018 formation. The pharmaco-toxicological profile of JWH-175 was characterized for the first time, proving its in vivo bio-activation to the more potent agonist JWH-018. Thus, it highlighted the great importance of investigating the in vivo metabolism of synthetic cannabinoids for both clinical toxicology and forensic purposes.

AB  - Pareiasaurs were among the world's first large terrestrial tetrapods, first appearing during the Guadalupian Epoch, and were later widespread across Pangea during the Lopingian where they formed a significant part of the large herbivore guild. The Bradysauria of the Lower Beaufort Group of the Karoo Basin of South Africa are among the oldest pareiasaurs, yet little is known of their palaeobiology. Here, we present the first volumetric body mass estimate and a new in vivo reconstruction of the earliest Karoo pareiasaur, and the phylogenetically basal-most pareiasaur, Bradysaurus baini, based on two almost complete adult mounted skeletons. Using 3D photogrammetric models of the two skeletons, we calculated a possible body mass range for B. baini by applying different densities for living tissue to reconstructions of differing soft tissue mass. Considering the larger adult Bradysaurus specimen, our volumetric body masses range from a minimum of 851.4 kg to a maximum of 1,276.5 kg, with an overall mean body mass of 1,022 kg, approximately the body weight of a large domestic cow. The study provides a more precise estimate of body mass in early members of Pareiasauridae, and we suggest that they were somewhat smaller than some late Permian taxa such as Scutosaurus karpinskii.

AB  - Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. Trichostatin A (TSA) has been revealed to show protective effect on central nervous systems in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of TSA on cognitive function of DE are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cognitive function was damaged in diabetic mice versus normal mice and treatment with TSA improved cognitive function in diabetic mice. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed 174 differentially expressed proteins in diabetic mice compared with normal mice. TSA treatment reversed the expression levels of 111 differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters, including the longevity regulating pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, peroxisomes, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis of TSA-reversed proteins revealed that UBA52, CAT, RPL29, RPL35A, CANX, RPL37, and PRKAA2 were the main hub proteins. Multiple KEGG pathway-enriched CAT and PRKAA2 levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of diabetic mice versus normal mice, which was reversed by TSA administration. Finally, screening for potential similar or ancillary drugs for TSA treatment indicated that HDAC inhibitors ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were the most promising similar drugs, and the PI3K inhibitor GSK-1059615, the Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib, and the nucleophosmin inhibitor avrainvillamide-analog-6 were the most promising ancillary drugs. In conclusion, our study revealed that CAT and PRKAA2 were the key proteins involved in the improvement of DE after TSA treatment. ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were promising similar drugs and that GSK-1059615, alisertib, and avrainvillamide-analog-6 were promising ancillary drugs to TSA in the treatment of DE.

AB  - Hemoglobin (Hb) is the oxygen transport protein in erythrocytes. In blood, Hb is a tetramer consisting of two Hb-alpha (Hb-alpha) chains and two Hb-beta (Hb-beta) chains. A number of studies have also shown that Hb-alpha is also expressed in neurons in both the rodent and human brain. In the current study, we examined for age-related regulation of neuronal Hb-alpha and hypoxia in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of intact male and female mice. In addition, to confirm the role and functions of neuronal Hb-alpha, we also utilized lentivirus CRISPR interference-based Hb-alpha knockdown (Hb-alpha CRISPRi KD) in the non-ischemic and ischemic mouse hippocampus and examined the effect on neuronal oxygenation, as well as induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and its downstream pro-apoptotic factors, PUMA and NOXA, and on neuronal survival and neurodegeneration. The results of the study revealed an age-related decrease in neuronal Hb-alpha levels and correlated increase in hypoxia in the hippocampus and cortex of intact male and female mice. Sex differences were observed with males having higher neuronal Hb-alpha levels than females in all brain regions at all ages. In vivo Hb-alpha CRISPRi KD in the mouse hippocampus resulted in increased hypoxia and elevated levels of HIF-1 alpha, PUMA and NOXA in the non-ischemic and ischemic mouse hippocampus, effects that were correlated with a significant decrease in neuronal survival and increased neurodegeneration. As a whole, these findings indicate that neuronal Hb-alpha decreases with age in mice and has an important role in regulating neuronal oxygenation and neuroprotection.

AB  - Nowadays, the only treatment for human babies suffering from hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is therapeutic hypothermia (TH). However, a better understanding of the specific effects of TH in males and females is important to improve its clinical application. The present study evaluated the short-term effects of TH on the brain injury and behavioral outcomes in male and female neonatal rats submitted to neonatal HI. Seven-day-old Wistar rats underwent a surgery for unilateral occlusion of the right common carotid artery and were exposed to a hypoxic atmosphere (8% oxygen) for 75 min. Then, the animals in the TH group were submitted to TH (scalp temperature of 32 degrees C) for 5 h. In the behavioral tests, no remarkable differences triggered by HI or TH were observed relative to SHAM animals. Only females of the HI group presented lower latency to complete the righting reflex test. TH reduced the volume of brain injury in males, but not in females. The animals of the HI group showed a reduction in the number of neurons in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus and TH partially prevented neuronal death. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, animals from the HI group showed more degenerating cells relative to the SHAM, which was reversed by TH. In the DG, animals from the HI group showed an increase in the number of degenerating neurons, which was partially reversed by TH only in males. Our data show that HI leads to a brain injury, which was attenuated by TH in a sex-dependent way and clarify the importance of the assessment of males and females in order to outline specific strategies for the treatment of each sex in newborns suffering from HI.

AB  - Impairment of the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) can lead to amyloid plaque accumulation in Alzheimer disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. This study revealed a mechanism of ALP impairment mediated by gain-of-function of lysosomal TPCN2/TPC2 (two pore segment channel 2) and suggests a molecular target for AD intervention. Using mutant PSEN1/PS1 (presenilin 1)-expressing human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and familial AD fibroblasts collected from human patients, we showed lysosomal pH was increased in AD cells due to exaggerated TPCN2-mediated calcium (Ca2+) release which increases lysosomal pH and compromises ALP degradation. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the TPCN2 channel restored lysosomal Ca2+ homeostasis, acidity of the lysosome and ALP function. Furthermore, AD mice (5xFAD) that had received treatment with the TPCN2 inhibitor tetrandrine for 6 months or injection of AAV-shTpcn2 to knock down Tpcn2 showed reduction in amyloid plaques in cortical and hippocampal regions. These treatments also improved spine morphology and density and corrected cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice assayed by immunohistochemistry, behavioral tests, and electrophysiological measurements, respectively. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously under-appreciated role of lysosomal TPCN2 in ALP impairment of AD. They also suggest targeting the lysosomal TPCN2 can serve as a therapeutic strategy for AD treatment in future drug development.

AB  - Colon cancer (CC) is one of the major causes of cancer death in humans. Despite recent advances in the management of CC, the prognosis is still poor and a new strategy for effective therapy is imperative. Deoxyelephantopin (DET), extracted from an important medicinal plant, Elephantopus scaber L., has been reported to exhibit excellent anti-inflammatory and -cancer activities, while the detailed anti-cancer mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we found that DET showed a significant CC inhibiting effect in vitro and in vivo without obvious organ toxicity. Mechanistically, DET inhibited CC cells and tumor growth by inducing G2/M phase arrest and subsequent apoptosis. DET-mediated cell cycle arrest was caused by severe DNA damage, and DET decreased the Bcl2 expression level in a dose-dependent manner to promote CC cell apoptosis, whereas restoring Bcl2 expression reduced apoptosis to a certain extent. Moreover, we identified a microRNA complementary to the 3 '-UTR of Bcl2, miR-205, that responded to the DET treatment. An inhibitor of miR-205 could recover Bcl2 expression and promoted the survival of CC cells upon DET treatment. To further examine the potential value of the drug, we evaluated the combinative effects of DET and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) through Jin's formula and revealed that DET acted synergistically with 5FU, resulting in enhancing the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of CC to 5FU. Our results consolidate DET as a potent drug for the treatment of CC when it is used alone or combined with 5FU, and elucidate the importance of the miR-205-Bcl2 axis in DET treatment.

AB  - Oxytocin is an important regulator of the social brain. In some animal models of autism, notably in Magel2(tm1.1Mus)-deficient mice, peripheral administration of oxytocin in infancy improves social behaviors until adulthood. However, neither the mechanisms responsible for social deficits nor the mechanisms by which such oxytocin administration has long-term effects are known. Here, we aimed to clarify these oxytocin-dependent mechanisms, focusing on social memory performance. Using in situ hybridization (RNAscope), we have established that Magel2 and oxytocin receptor are co-expressed in the dentate gyrus and CA2/CA3 hippocampal regions involved in the circuitry underlying social memory. Then, we have shown that Magel2(tm1.1Mus)-deficient mice, evaluated in a three-chamber test, present a deficit in social memory. Next, in hippocampus, we conducted neuroanatomical and functional studies using immunostaining, oxytocin-binding experiments, ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, calcium imaging and biochemical studies. We demonstrated: an increase of the GABAergic activity of CA3-pyramidal cells associated with an increase in the quantity of oxytocin receptors and of somatostatin interneurons in both DG and CA2/CA3 regions. We also revealed a delay in the GABAergic development sequence in Magel2(tm1.1Mus)-deficient pups, linked to phosphorylation modifications of KCC2. Above all, we demonstrated the positive effects of subcutaneous administration of oxytocin in the mutant neonates, restoring hippocampal alterations and social memory at adulthood. Although clinical trials are debated, this study highlights the mechanisms by which peripheral oxytocin administration in neonates impacts the brain and demonstrates the therapeutic value of oxytocin to treat infants with autism spectrum disorders.

AB  - Sharp wave ripple (SWR) events, present in diverse species, spontaneously occur in the hippocampus during quiescent restfulness and slow-wave sleep. SWRs comprise a negative deflection, the sharp wave (SW) event with an often-superimposed ripple (R) and are the neural correlates of memory consolidation and recall. The Anterodorsolateral lobe (ADL) (zebrafish hippocampal homolog) exhibits SW and SWR events, and since SWs initiate SWRs, their abundance typically shows the same directionality. In previous work, we observed matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)-dependent effects on depression-relevant behaviors, perineuronal net (PNN) levels, and SWR abundance in the adult rodent hippocampus. Here, we investigate MMP-2/9-dependent effects on biochemical, behavioral, and neurophysiological endpoints in juvenile zebrafish and zebrafish at the transition from the late juvenile period to early adulthood. With MMP-2/9 inhibition, juvenile zebrafish showed reduced SW amplitude and abundance together with increased fear memory retention and decreased sociability. Juvenile zebrafish also showed an increased percentage of longer-duration SW events. Except for a reduction in SW amplitude, these changes were not observed at the transition from late juvenile to early adulthood. These changes were accompanied by increased levels of chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan 4-O-sulfation, which modulates PNNs and excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) balance. Discontinuation of MMP-2/9 inhibition in juvenile zebrafish normalized deficits in ADL SW abundance and sociability. Together, these findings show that MMP-2/9 significantly influences E/I balance and learning and memory during the highly plastic juvenile period. Findings also have relevance to an emerging appreciation of PNN changes that may contribute to altered neuronal oscillations and mood or cognition.

AB  - Although effects of stress-induced anxiety on the gastrointestinal tract and enteric nervous system (ENS) are well studied, how ENS dysfunction impacts behaviour is not well understood. We investigated whether ENS modulation alters anxiety-related behaviour in rats. We used loperamide, a potent mu-opioid receptor agonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, to manipulate ENS function and assess changes in behaviour, gut and brain gene expression, and microbiota profile. Sprague Dawley (male/female) rats were acutely dosed with loperamide (subcutaneous) or control solution, and their behavioural phenotype was examined using open field and elevated plus maze tests. Gene expression in the proximal colon, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala was assessed by RNA-seq and caecal microbiota composition determined by shotgun metagenome sequencing. In female rats, loperamide treatment decreased distance moved and frequency of supported rearing, indicating decreased exploratory behaviour and increased anxiety, which was associated with altered hippocampal gene expression. Loperamide altered proximal colon gene expression and microbiome composition in both male and female rats. Our results demonstrate the importance of the ENS for communication between gut and brain for normo-anxious states in female rats and implicate corticotropin-releasing hormone and gamma-aminobutyric acid gene signalling pathways in the hippocampus. This study also sheds light on sexually dimorphic communication between the gut and the brain. Microbiome and colonic gene expression changes likely reflect localised effects of loperamide related to gut dysmotility. These results suggest possible ENS pharmacological targets to alter gut to brain signalling for modulating mood.

AB  - It is undeniable that as people get older, they become progressively more susceptible to neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memory loss is a prominent symptom of this condition and can be exacerbated by uneven levels of certain metals. This study used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to examine the levels of metals in the blood plasma, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of Wistar rats with AD induced by streptozotocin (STZ). It also tested the effects of the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT) on metal levels. The Barnes maze behavior test was used, and the STZ group showed less certainty and greater distance when exploring the Barnes maze than the control group. The results also indicated that the control group and the STZ + HT group exhibited enhanced learning curves during the Barnes maze training as compared to the STZ group. The ICP-MS analysis showed that the STZ group had lower levels of cobalt in their blood plasma than the control group, while the calcium levels in the frontal cortex of the STZ + HT group were higher than in the control group. The most important finding was that copper levels in the frontal cortex from STZ-treated animals were higher than in the control group, and that the STZ + HT group returned to equivalent levels to the control group. The antioxidant HT can restore copper levels to their basal physiological state. This finding may help explain HT's potential beneficial effect in AD-patients.

AB  - Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a devastating condition for women under 40 years old. Chemotherapy, especially the use of cisplatin, has been demonstrated to promote the apoptosis of granulosa cells in primary and secondary follicles, leading to POF. Our previous studies demonstrated that fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) plays an essential role in protecting granulosa cells from cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Various studies have suggested that the Hippo/YAP signalling pathway plays a significant role in regulating cell apoptosis and proliferation. Additionally, YAP1 is the main downstream target of the Hippo signalling pathway and is negatively regulated by the Hippo signalling pathway. However, whether the Hippo/YAP signalling pathway is involved in the protective effect of FTO on granulosa cells has not been determined. In this study, we found that after cisplatin treatment, the apoptosis of granulosa cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner, accompanied by the downregulation of FTO and YAP1. Furthermore, overexpression of FTO decreased cisplatin-induced granulosa cell apoptosis, inhibited the Hippo/YAP kinase cascade-induced phosphorylation of YAP1, and promoted the entry of YAP1 into the nucleus. The downstream targets of YAP1 (CTGF, CYR61, and ANKRD1) were also increased. Si-RNA-mediated downregulation of FTO promoted cisplatin-induced granulosa cell apoptosis, activated the Hippo/YAP kinase cascade, and inhibited the YAP1 entry into the nucleus. These effects were completely reversed by the small molecule inhibitor of YAP1-verteporfin (VP). Taken together, these data suggested that FTO-YAP1 plays a positive role in regulating the proliferation of injured granulosa cells induced by cisplatin.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may lead to serious respiratory, vascular and neurological dysfunctions. The SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E protein) is a structural viroporin able to form ion channels in cell membranes, which is critical for viral replication. However, its effects in primary neurons have not been addressed. Here we used fluorescence microscopy and calcium imaging to study SARS-CoV-2 viroporin E localization and the effects on neuron damage and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in a model of rat hippocampal neurons aged in vitro. We found that the E protein quickly enters hippocampal neurons and colocalizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in both short-term (6-8 days in vitro, DIV) and long-term (20-22 DIV) cultures resembling young and aged neurons, respectively. Strikingly, E protein treatment induces apoptosis in aged neurons but not in young neurons. The E protein induces variable increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in hippocampal neurons. Ca2+ responses to the E protein are due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores at the ER. Moreover, E protein-induced Ca2+ release is very small in young neurons and increases dramatically in aged neurons, consistent with the enhanced Ca2+ store content in aged neurons. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein quickly translocates to ER endomembranes of rat hippocampal neurons where it releases Ca2+, probably acting like a viroporin, thus producing Ca2+ store depletion and neuron apoptosis in aged neurons and likely contributing to neurological damage in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is produced by interneurons and recycled by astrocytes. In neurons, GABA activates the influx of Cl- via the GABA(A) receptor or efflux or K+ via the GABA(B) receptor, inducing hyperpolarization and synaptic inhibition. In astrocytes, the activation of both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the release of glutamate and ATP. Connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels are among the main Ca2+-dependent cellular mechanisms for the astroglial release of glutamate and ATP. However, no study has evaluated the effect of GABA on astroglial Cx43 hemichannel activity and Cx43 hemichannel-mediated gliotransmission. Here we assessed the effects of GABA on Cx43 hemichannel activity in DI NCT1 rat astrocytes and hippocampal brain slices. We found that GABA induces a Ca2+-dependent increase in Cx43 hemichannel activity in astrocytes mediated by the GABA(A) receptor, as it was blunted by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline but unaffected by GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP55845. Moreover, GABA induced the Cx43 hemichannel-dependent release of glutamate and ATP, which was also prevented by bicuculline, but unaffected by CGP. Gliotransmission in response to GABA was also unaffected by pannexin 1 channel blockade. These results are discussed in terms of the possible role of astroglial Cx43 hemichannel-mediated glutamate and ATP release in regulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain and their possible contribution to psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objective: The mechanisms behind seizure suppression by deep brain stimulation (DBS) are not fully revealed, and the most optimal stimulus regimens and anatomical targets are yet to be determined. We investigated the modulatory effect of low-frequency DBS (L-DBS) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on neuronal activity in downstream and upstream brain areas in chemically kindled mice by assessing c-Fos immunoreactivity.Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 4-6 weeks old BL/6 male mice underwent stereotaxic implantation of a unilateral stimulating electrode in the VTA followed by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) administration every other day until they showed stage 4 or 5 seizures following 3 consecutive PTZ injections. Animals were divided into control, sham-implanted, kindled, kindled-implanted, L-DBS, and kindled+L-DBS groups. In the L-DBS and kindled+L-DBS groups, four trains of L-DBS were delivered 5 min after the last PTZ injection. 48 hours after the last L-DBS, mice were transcardially perfused, and the brain was processed to evaluate c-Fos expression by immunohistochemistry.Results: L-DBS in the VTA significantly decreased the c-Fos expressing cell numbers in several brain areas including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, VTA, substantia nigra pars compacta, and dorsal raphe nucleus but not in the amygdala and CA3 area of the ventral hippocampus compared to the sham group.Conclusion: These data suggest that the possible anticonvulsant mechanism of DBS in VTA can be through restoring the seizure-induced cellular hyperactivity to normal.

AB  - BackgroundMethylphenidate (MPH) abuse has been criticized for its role in neurodegeneration. Also, a high risk of seizure was reported in the first month of MPH treatment. Topiramate, a broad-spectrum Antiepileptic Drug (AED), has been used as a neuroprotective agent in both aforementioned complications. Nanotechnology is introduced to increase desirable neurological treatment with minimum side effects. We aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective activity of topiramate loaded on nanoparticles.Methods and resultsMTT assay was performed to evaluate the cellular cytotoxicity of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSN). Male rats were randomly divided into eight groups. Rats received an intraperitoneal (i.p) MPH (10 mg/kg) injection and a daily oral dose of topiramate (TPM, 30 mg/kg), MSN with Zn core (10 and 30 mg/kg), and MSN with Cu core (10 and 30 mg/kg) for three weeks. On day 21, a seizure was induced by a single injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) to evaluate the protective effects of TPM-loaded nanoparticles on seizure latency and duration following MPH-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, the hippocampal content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GR) activities were assessed. Also, BAX and Bcl-2 as two main apoptotic markers were evaluated.ResultsMPH neurotoxicity was observed as a raised duration and reduced latency in PTZ-induced seizure. However, TPM-loaded MSN with Zn species (NE) treatment reduced the duration and improved the latency time. Also, NE and, somewhat, TPM-loaded MSN with Cu species (NM) administration reduced inflammatory cytokines, MDA, and Bax levels and increased activities in the rat hippocampus.ConclusionTPM-loaded nanoparticles could be used as neuroprotective agents against MPH-induced neurodegeneration by improving seizure parameters and reducing inflammatory, oxidant, and apoptotic factors.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is not only essential for learning and pattern separation, but it is also involved in emotional regulation. This process is vulnerable to local and peripheral inflammation, which is partly mediated by microglia in the DG. As Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with neuropsychiatric comorbidity, including depression and cognitive impairment, a reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by chronic gut-derived inflammation has been hypothesized. Here, we present the first study that examined the influence of chronic ileocolitis on microglia in the DG and on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a transgenic mouse model of CD, which is generated by a constitutive knockout of caspase 8 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs, Casp8 Delta IEC mice). Structural and transcriptional analyses revealed that microglial cell proliferation and density in the DG as well as the expression of genes associated with their homeostasis and activation in the forebrain were maintained in 14- and 24-week-old Casp8 Delta IEC mice compared to Casp8fl controls. Furthermore, different stages of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, including progenitor cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis of newly generated cells, were predominantly unaffected by chronic ileocolitis, except a potential minor phenotypic shift in maturating cells in 24-week-old mice. Together, we demonstrate largely preserved adult hippocampal neurogenesis, lacking signs of local inflammatory microglial activation despite chronic inflammation of the gut.

AB  - The Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13) has emerged as an important transcription factor involved in essential processes of the central nervous system (CNS). It predominantly functions as a transcriptional repressor, impacting the activity of several signaling pathways with essential roles in the CNS, including the JAK/STAT pathway, which is the canonical mediator of growth hormone (GH) signaling. It is now recognized that GH has important actions as a neurotrophic factor. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of KLF13 on the activity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the hippocampus-derived cell line HT22. Results showed that KLF13 directly regulates the expression of several genes involved in the JAK-STAT pathway, including Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Socs1, by associating with their proximal gene promoters. In addition, it was found that in KLF13-deficient HT22 neurons, the expression of Jak1, Stat3, Socs1, Socs3, and Igf1 was dysregulated, exhibiting mRNA levels that went up to 7-fold higher than the control cell line. KLF13 displayed a differential effect on the GH-induced JAK/STAT pathway activity, decreasing the STAT3 branch while enhancing the STAT5 branch. In KLF13-deficient HT22 cells, the activity of the STAT3 branch was enhanced, mediating the GH-dependent augmented expression of the JAK/STAT output genes Socs1, Socs3, Igf1, and Bdnf. Furthermore, GH treatment increased both the nuclear content of KLF13 and Klf13 mRNA levels, suggesting that KLF13 could be part of the mechanisms that maintain the homeostatic state of this pathway. These findings support the notion that KLF13 is a regulator of JAK/STAT activity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the alterations of the hippocampal function that may be related to anxiogenic response to thermal skin injury, including the morpho-functional alterations, and the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and Filipendula ulmaria (FU) extract in the treatment of anxiety-like behavior that coincides with thermal skin injury. A rat thermal skin injury experimental model was performed on 2-month-old male Wistar albino rats. The evaluated therapeutic protocols included HBO and/or antioxidant supplementation. HBO was applied for 7 days in the hyperbaric chamber (100% O2, 2.5 ATA, 60 min). Oral administration of FU extract (final concentration of 100 mg/kg b.w.) to achieve antioxidant supplementation was also applied for 7 days. Anxiety level was estimated in the open field and elevated plus-maze test, which was followed by anesthesia, sacrifice, and collection of hippocampal tissue samples. HBO treatment and FU supplementation significantly abolished anxiogenic response to thermal skin injury. This beneficial effect was accompanied by the reduction in hippocampal pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic indicators, and enhanced BDNF and GABA-AR alpha 2S gene expression, previously observed in untreated burns. The hippocampal relative gene expression of melatonin receptors and NPY positively responded to the applied protocols, in the same manner as mu and delta opioid receptors, while the opposite response was observed for kappa receptors. The results of this study provide some confirmations that adjuvant strategies, such as HBO and antioxidant supplementation, may be simultaneously applied in the treatment of the anxiety-like behavior that coincides with thermal skin injury.

AB  - Gut microbes may be the critical mediators for the cognitive enhancing effects of exercise. Via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), this study is aimed at determining the mechanism of how voluntary exercise improved learning and memory ability impairment post a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet. The learning and memory abilities assessed via the Morris water maze in the FMT recipient group of voluntary exercising mice were improved compared to sedentary group. 16S rRNA gene sequencing results indicated that exercise-induced changes in gut microbiota distribution were transmissible, mainly in terms of elevated Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium nodatum, as well as decreased Clostrida_UCG-014 and Akkermansia after FMT. The neuroprotective effects of FMT were mainly related to the improved insulin signaling pathway (IRS2/PI3K/AKT) and mitochondrial function; inhibition of AQP4; decreased p-Tau at serine 396 and 404; increased BDNF, PSD95, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus; and also decreased HDAC2 and HDAC3 protein expressions in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the hippocampus. The findings of qRT-PCR suggested that exercise-induced gut microbes, on the one hand, elevated GPR109A and decreased GPR43 and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus. On the other hand, it increased GPR109A and GPR41 expressions in the proximal colon tissue. In addition, total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and isovaleric acid contents were also elevated in the cecum. In conclusion, exercise-induced alterations in gut microbiota play a decisive role in ameliorating HFHC diet-induced cognitive deficits. FMT treatment may be a new considerable direction in ameliorating cognitive impairment induced by exposure to HFHC diet.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in synaptogenesis and the regulation of synaptic functions in the central nervous system. Recent studies revealed that in addition to dopaminergic and serotoninergic neuromodulatory systems, microglia also contribute to the regulation of ECM remodeling. In the present work, we investigated the physiological role of microglia in the remodeling of perineuronal nets (PNNs), predominantly associated with parvalbumin-immunopositive (PV+) interneurons, and the perisynaptic ECM around pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Adult mice were treated with PLX3397 (pexidartinib), as the inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R), to deplete microglia. Then, confocal analysis of the ECM and synapses was performed. Although the elimination of microglia did not alter the overall number or intensity of PNNs in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, it decreased the size of PNN holes and elevated the expression of the surrounding ECM. In the neuropil area in the CA1 str. radiatum, the depletion of microglia increased the expression of perisynaptic ECM proteoglycan brevican, which was accompanied by the elevated expression of presynaptic marker vGluT1 and the increased density of dendritic spines. Thus, microglia regulate the homeostasis of pre- and postsynaptic excitatory terminals and the surrounding perisynaptic ECM as well as the fine structure of PNNs enveloping perisomatic-predominantly GABAergic-synapses.

AB  - Camel milk and urine (CMU) are traditionally known for their medicinal properties, with camel milk has been reported to improve Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms. ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with no universally effective treatment. This study employs integrated network pharmacology, cheminformatics, microarray analysis and molecular modeling approaches to explore the potential therapeutic effects of a subset of camel CMU compounds for ASD. In our study, CMU compounds were analyzed collectively to explore their combined therapeutic potential in treating ASD, with the final impact assessed based on individual bioactive compounds. The study utilized a combination of active compounds collection and screening, potential target genes screening against autism, pathway and profiling. Twenty-two active compounds were identified in camel CMU, with 169 genes found to be common targets. Ten hub ASD-related genes, comprising ESRI, AKT1, CTNNB1, EGFR, CASP3, ERBB2, MMP9, PTGS2, JAK2, and GSK3(3. Network analysis revealed a multi-target and multi-pathway interaction, suggesting a synergistic effect of CMU compounds on ASD. Molecular docking studies indicated strong binding affinities between selected compounds and key target proteins associated with ASD, such as AKT1 and GSK3(3. ADMET profiling confirmed the pharmacokinetic viability of these compounds as therapeutic agents and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the top compoundsGSK3(3 complexes stability. This study provides a foundation for understanding the therapeutic potential of CMU compounds against ASD, highlighting their multi-target and multi-pathway mechanisms. CMU compounds, particularly homogentisic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, and phenylpyruvic acid, have the potential to modulate biological pathways implicated in ASD.

AB  - Kaji-ichigoside F1 (KF1), a natural oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin, is the main active constituent from Rosa roxburghii. In the southwest regions of China, particularly in Guizhou Province, this plant was used as a Miao ethnic medicine to prevent and treat dyspepsia, dysentery, hypoimmunity, and neurasthenia. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect of KF1 was evaluated against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. An NMDA-induced PC12 cell neurotoxicity assay showed that KF1 effectively improved cellular viability, inhibited the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and reduced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, KF1-treated NMDA-induced excitotoxicity mice displayed a remarkable capacity for improving spatial learning memory in the Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. In addition, KF1 increased the levels of the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, and monoamine oxidase and reduced the calcium ion concentration in the hippocampus of mice. Hematoxylin and eosin and Nissl staining indicated that KF1 effectively reduced the impairment of neurons. Furthermore, Western blot assays showed that KF1 decreased NMDAR1 expression. In contrast, the NMDAR2B (NR2B), glutamate receptor (AMPA), TrkB, protein kinase B (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), PSD95, and synapsin 1 were upregulated in NMDA-induced PC12 cells and an animal model. These results suggest that KF1 has a remarkable protective effect against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, which is directly related to the regulation of the NMDA receptor and the activation of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and BDNF/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.

AB  - Accumulating data suggest that the brain undergoes various changes during aging. Among them are loss of both white and gray matter, neurons and synapses degeneration, as well as oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical changes. The above-mentioned age-related features are closely related to autophagy and mitochondria. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the most peculiar morphological features of brain nervous tissue and to characterize the expression of autophagy and mitochondrial immunohistochemical biomarkers in neurons of different human brain zones during aging. Counting the number of neurons as well as Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B), Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A), Alpha subunit of ATP synthase (ATP5A), and Parkinson disease protein 7 (DJ1) immunohistochemical staining were performed on FFPE samples of human prefrontal cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus obtained from autopsy. Statistical analysis revealed a loss of neurons in the studied elderly group in comparison to the young group. When the expression of macroautophagy (LC3B), chaperon-mediated autophagy (HSP70, LAMP2A), and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V (ATP5A) markers for the young and elderly groups were compared, the latter was found to have a significantly higher rate of optical density, whilst there was no significance in DJ1 expression. These findings, while preliminary, suggest that both autophagy and mitochondria are involved in neuronal maintenance during aging and could indicate their potential role in adaptive mechanisms that occur in aging.

AB  - Background. Alleviating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial to delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Jia-Wei-Kai-Xin-San (JWKXS) is applied for treating AD with MCI. However, the mechanism of JWKXS in the treatment of MCI is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of JWKXS in SAMP8 mice models of MCI. Methods. MCI models were established to examine learning and memory ability and explore the pathomechanisms in brain of SAMP8 mice at 4, 6, and 8 months. The mice were treated for 8 weeks and the effects of JWKXS on MCI were characterized through Morris water maze and HE/Nissl's/immunohistochemical staining. Its mechanism was predicted by the combination of UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and system pharmacology analysis, further verified with SAMP8 mice, BV2 microglial cells, and PC12 cells. Results. It was found that 4-month-old SAMP8 mice exhibited MCI. Two months of JWKXS treatment improved the learning and memory ability, alleviated the hippocampal tissue and neuron damage. Through network pharmacology, four key signaling pathways were found to be involved in treatment of MCI by JWKXS, including TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that JWKXS attenuated neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglia activation, suppressing TLR4/NF-kappa B and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, and blocking the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways leading to neuronal apoptosis suppression in the hippocampus. Conclusion. JWKXS treatment improved the learning and memory ability and conferred neuroprotective effects against MCI by inducing anti-inflammation and antiapoptosis. Limitations. The small sample size and short duration of the intervention limit in-depth investigation of the mechanisms. Future Prospects. This provides a direction for further clarification of the anti-AD mechanism, and provides certain data support for the formulation to move toward clinical practice.

AB  - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by hemolysis and thrombosis and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although complement inhibitors have significantly changed the outcomes in PNH patients, breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) may still occur as a response to stress factors such as pregnancy, surgery, and infections. Despite the well-described association between bacterial infections and hemolysis in PNH patients, little is known about the effect of respiratory viruses on triggering hemolytic episodes. This is the first study, to our knowledge, addressing this question. We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients with PNH disease between 2016 and 2018, who were on eculizumab treatment and who presented with respiratory symptoms and were subsequently tested for 10 respiratory viruses (influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus). NTS+ patients had higher inflammatory markers, with the majority requiring antibiotics. Acute hemolysis, along with a significant drop in hemoglobin, was noted in the NTS+ group, with three of them requiring a top-up transfusion and two requiring an extra dose of eculizumab. Furthermore, the time from the last eculizumab dose was longer in the NTS+ patients who had BTH, than those who did not. Our data indicate that respiratory virus infections pose a significant risk for BTH in PNH patients on complement inhibitor treatment, underlining the need for regular screening and close monitoring of patients with respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, it implies a higher risk for patients who are not established on complement inhibitors, suggesting the necessity for greater vigilance in these patients.

AB  - Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis shows a predilection for affecting the limbic system, but structural MRI in most patients is usually unremarkable. However, the functional connectivity reorganization of limbic nodes remains unknown. Serum neurofilament light chains (sNfL) are clinically linked with the disease severity and neurological disability of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. However, the relationship between sNfL and limbic-based functional architecture has not been explored. We consecutively recruited 20 convalescent patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 24 healthy controls from March 2018 to March 2021. Resting-state functional MRI metrics, including fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and atlas-based seed functional connectivity, were analyzed to investigate regional activities and functional connectivity alterations. Correlation analysis among functional connectivity, sNfL, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal cognitive assessment outcomes were explored in patients. Compared with those of healthy controls, the fALFF and ReHo were consistently increased in regions of the posterior default mode network (DMN) hub, mainly the bilateral supramarginal gyrus and precuneus, in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis (FWE-corrected p < 0.05). Patients demonstrated disturbed functional organization characterized by reduced connectivity of the posterior DMN hub with the sensorimotor cortex and hypoconnectivity of the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) with the right fusiform gyrus but extensively enhanced thalamocortical connectivity (FWE-corrected p < 0.05). Furthermore, convalescent sNfL showed a positive correlation with enhanced thalamocortical connectivity (r = 0.4659, p = 0.0384). Onset sNfL with an independent linear correlation to convalescent MMSE performance (B coefficient, -0.013, 95% CI, -0.025 similar to -0.002, p = 0.0260) was positively correlated with intra-DMN connectivity (r = 0.8969, p < 0.0001) and limbic-sensory connectivity (r = 0.4866, p = 0.0346 for hippocampus seed and r = 0.5218, p = 0.0220 for PHG seed). Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis demonstrated disturbed functional organization with substantial thalamocortical hyperconnectivity, that was positively correlated with convalescent sNfL. Onset sNfL showed a positive correlation with intra-DMN connectivity and limbic-sensory connectivity.

AB  - Physical activity has been considered an important non-medication intervention in preserving mnemonic processes during aging. However, how aerobic exercise promotes such benefits for human health remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of aerobic exercise against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced amnesic C57BL/6J mice and BV-2 microglial cell models. In the in vivo experiment, the aerobic exercise training groups were allowed to run on a motorized treadmill 5 days/week for 4 weeks at a speed of 10 rpm/min, with LPS (0.1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally injected once a week for 4 weeks. We found that aerobic exercise ameliorated memory impairment and cognitive deficits among the amnesic mice. Correspondingly, aerobic exercise significantly increased the protein expressions of FNDC5, which activates target neuroprotective markers BDNF and CREB, and antioxidant markers Nrf2/HO-1, leading to inhibiting microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and reduced the expression of BACE-1 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of amnesic mice. We estimated that aerobic exercise inhibited neuroinflammation in part through the action of FNDC5/irisin on microglial cells. Therefore, we explored the anti-inflammatory effects of irisin on LPSstimulated BV-2 microglial cells. In the in vitro experiment, irisin treatment blocked NF-kappa B/MAPK/IRF3 signaling activation concomitantly with the significantly lowered levels of the LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 elevations and promotes the Nrf2/HO-1 expression in the LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells. Together, our findings suggest that aerobic exercise can improve the spatial learning ability and cognitive functions of LPS-treated mice by inhibiting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation through its effect on the expression of BDNF/FNDC5/irisin.

T2  - BIOINORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND APPLICATIONS
LA  - English
KW  - THERAPY
AB  - Camel milk is better tolerated than the milk of other ruminants, potentially expanding its consumer appeal. It also contains essential vitamins, minerals, and immunoglobulins, providing the milk with antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. These properties may reduce oxidative stress in camel milk consumers, ameliorating many conditions, including those of the CNS, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which camel milk administration (boiled or raw) was examined as an ASD treatment intervention. The primary endpoint was participants' total autism scores, determined using the Childhood Autistic Responsiveness Scale (CARS). A comparison of the responsiveness in these ASD intervention groups yielded a mean difference (MD) of 1.99 (0.89, 3.08) in those consuming boiled camel milk, MD = 2.77 (1.92, 3.61) in raw camel milk consumers, and MD = -1.02 (-0.10, 2.13) in cow milk consumers. Heterogeneity was notably low among the examined studies. Treatment of ASD with raw and boiled camel milk resulted in significantly lower CARS scores than the placebo. Our findings support the development of larger, more populated RCTs to establish camel milk's overall potential as a therapeutic intervention for CNS disorders.

AB  - Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, is pathogenically linked to the development of aging-related diseases. This study demonstrates that FRMD6, an upstream component of the Hippo/YAP signaling cascade, is a key regulator of senescence. Proteomic analysis revealed that FRMD6 is upregulated in senescent IMR90 fibroblasts under various senescence-inducing conditions. Silencing FRMD6 mitigated the senescence of IMR90 cells, suggesting its requirement in senescence. Conversely, the overexpression of FRMD6 alone induced senescence in cells and in lung tissue, establishing a causal link. The elevated FRMD6 levels correlated well with increased levels of the inhibitory phosphorylated YAP/TAZ. We identified cellular communication network factor 3 (CCN3), a key component of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype regulated by YAP, whose administration attenuated FRMD6-induced senescence in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, FRMD6 interacted with and activated MST kinase, which led to YAP/TAZ inactivation. The expression of FRMD6 was regulated by the p53 and SMAD transcription factors in senescent cells. Accordingly, the expression of FRMD6 was upregulated by TGF-beta treatment that activates those transcription factors. In TGF-beta-treated IMR90 cells, FRMD6 mainly segregated with p21, a senescence marker, but rarely segregated with alpha-SMA, a myofibroblast marker, which suggests that FRMD6 has a role in directing cells towards senescence. Similarly, in TGF-beta-enriched environments, such as fibroblastic foci (FF) from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, FRMD6 co-localized with p16 in FF lining cells, while it was rarely detected in alpha-SMA-positive myofibroblasts that are abundant in FF. In sum, this study identifies FRMD6 as a novel regulator of senescence and elucidates the contribution of the FRMD6-Hippo/YAP-CCN3 axis to senescence.

AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway dictates cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Its deregulation is associated with many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disease, frequently downregulated. The lack of efficient treatment for these diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), makes Wnt signaling an attractive target for therapies. Interestingly, novel Wnt signaling activating compounds are less frequently described than inhibitors, turning the quest for novel positive modulators even more appealing. In that sense, natural compounds are an outstanding source of potential drug leads. Here, we combine different experimental models, cell-based approaches, neuronal culture assays, and rodent behavior tests with Xenopus laevis phenotypic analysis to characterize quercitrin, a natural compound, as a novel Wnt signaling potentiator. We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the Xenopus secondary axis phenotype mediated by Xwnt8 injection. Using a GSK3 biosensor, we describe that quercitrin impairs GSK3 activity and increases phosphorylated GSK3 beta S9 levels. Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor downstream of GSK3, impairs the quercitrin-mediated effect. Next, we show that quercitrin potentiates the Wnt3a-synaptogenic effect in hippocampal neurons in culture, which is blocked by XAV939. Quercitrin treatment also rescues the hippocampal synapse loss induced by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta O) in mice. Finally, quercitrin rescues A beta O-mediated memory impairment, which is prevented by XAV939. Thus, our study uncovers a novel function for quercitrin as a Wnt/beta-catenin signaling potentiator, describes its mechanism of action, and opens new avenues for AD treatments.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by seizures that originate in temporal structures and that are pharmacoresistant in similar to 40 % of patients. In the context of a preclinical study aimed at developing an innovative therapy to treat TLE, we needed to perform multiple intracranial injections in the rat ventral CA3 (vCA3). To reduce invasiveness and to increase the precision reproducibility when multiple injections are performed over time, we opted for the implantation of guide cannulas.
   In the conventional approach, the guide cannula is implanted close to the target zone damaging the brain tissue along the route of the cannula insertion. This is a particularly relevant issue in our study because vCA3 is situated deep in the rat brain. The damage caused by the standard procedure would severely compromise the integrity of the hippocampal tissue necessary for the effectiveness of the therapeutic intervention.
   To overcome this problem, we developed, in TLE adult rats, two novel approaches to implant guide cannulas more superficially: the "above dentate gyrus (DG)" and the "above hippocampus (HPC)" strategies. The target brain area was then reached with the thinner infusion needle, resulting in minimally invasive approaches. We demonstrated by immunofluorescence that both novel surgical approaches enable injections of different agents into the ventral hippocampus with excellent precision and reproducibility. Being this aspect comparable between the two approaches, we concluded that the "above HPC" strategy must be preferred due to its lower invasiveness. Behavioral tests confirmed that memory, locomotion and anxiety level were not affected by the cannula-induced damage.

AB  - Maternal stress during pregnancy results in increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders in the offspring including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and autism. However, the mechanisms underlying this disease susceptibility remain largely to be determined. In this study, the involvement of the serotonin (5-HT) and kynurenine (KYN) pathways of tryptophan metabolism on the behavioral deficits induced by maternal stress during the late phase of gestation in mice was investigated. Adult offspring born to control or restraint-stressed dams were exposed to the elevated plus-maze and tail suspension tests. Metabolites of the KYN and 5-HT pathways were measured in the hippocampus and brainstem by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Female, but not male, prenatal stressed (PNS) offspring displayed a depressive-like phenotype, mainly when in proestrus/diestrus, along with reduced hippocampal 5-HT levels and high serotonin turnover rate in hippocampus and brainstem. In contrast, male PNS mice showed enhanced anxiety-like behaviors and higher hippocampal and brainstem quinolinic acid levels compared to male offspring born to non-stressed dams. These results indicate that maternal stress affects the behavior and brain metabolism of tryptophan in the offspring in a sex-dependent manner, and suggest that alterations in both the 5-HT and KYN pathways may underlie the emotional dysfunctions observed in individuals exposed to stress during in utero development.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation and significantly impairs quality of life through anxiety-like behaviors and visceral pain. Early evaluation of the risk of anxiety-like behaviors and visceral pain in IBD patients, along with targeted treatment, may benefit disease management. Visceral pain and anxiety-like behavior are often accompanied by neurological damage. Previous studies have shown that abnormal accumulation of glutamate can cause excitatory neurotoxic effects, leading to central nervous system (CNS) damage. Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), particularly EAAT2, are known to regulate glutamate levels. The impact of hippocampal EAAT2 modulation on these clinical features in IBD is yet to be evaluated. Therefore, we designed this experiment to test this hypothesis. This study aimed to investigate the impact of altered levels of hippocampal EAAT2 on anxiety-like behaviors and visceral pain in mice with IBD. We observed reduced EAAT2 expression, increased glutamate levels, elevated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) expression, and obvious glutamate toxicity in the hippocampus of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced IBD model mice. These mice exhibited significant visceral pain and anxiety-like behaviors. In summary, the reduced expression of EAAT2 in the hippocampus of individuals with IBD leads to elevated glutamate levels, resulting in neuronal damage and ultimately contributing to visceral pain and anxiety-like behaviors. These findings suggest that EAAT2 could serve as a therapeutic target for neurologically derived IBD symptoms.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is prone to modulation by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The anterior nucleus (AN) of the thalamus has extensive connections with the hippocampus, and stimulation of this region may play a role in altering neurogenesis. We have previously shown that electrical stimulation of the AN can substantially boost hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats. Here, we performed selective unilateral chemical excitation of the cell bodies of the AN as it offers a more specific and sustained stimulation when compared to electrical stimulation. Our aim is to investigate the long-term effects of KA stimulation of the AN on baseline hippocampal proliferation of neural stem cells and neurogenesis. Continuous micro-perfusion of very low doses of kainic acid (KA) was administered into the right AN for seven days. Afterwards, adult male rats received 5 '-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injections (200 mg/kg, i.p) and were euthanized at either one week or four weeks post micro-perfusion. Open field and Y-maze tests were performed before euthanasia. The KA stimulation of the AN evoked sustained hippocampal neurogenesis that was associated with improved spatial memory in the Y-maze test. Administering dexamethasone prior to and simultaneously with the KA stimulation decreased both the hippocampal neurogenesis and the improved spatial recognition memory previously seen in the Y-maze test. These results suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis may be a downstream effect of stimulation in general, and of excitation of the cell bodies of the AN in particular, and that stimulation of that area improves spatial memory in rats.

AB  - CAD software is a daily tool in ship design offices and shipyards, and every software uses NURBS or B-splines curves and surfaces as common foundations. The CAD tools of today are not static software products and most of them now include parametric design modules, which enable users to change the shape of an object based on its key geometric feature parameters with the use of sliders or equivalent controls. Although B-spline techniques are commonly applied to the representation of the ship hull curves and surfaces, the parametric deformation of the hull surfaces based on geometric parameters is less used. This paper presents a methodology to define the parametric definition of a ship hull with the use of a standard and non-specialized CAD software that is of common use in the ship design offices and universities: Rhinoceros. The presented parametric design methodology will use specific ship hull parameters or feature parameters with a clear geometric meaning, such as displacement, waterplane area, LCB, and LCF, together with the properties of the B-spline curves and the power of Grasshopper, the parametric design tool inside Rhinoceros, to create parametric ship hulls.

AB  - Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the SMS gene, which encodes spermine synthase, and aberrant polyamine metabolism. SRS is characterized by intellectual disability, thin habitus, seizure, low muscle tone/hypotonia and osteoporosis. Progress towards understanding and treating SRS requires a model that recapitulates human gene variants and disease presentations. Here, we evaluated molecular and neurological presentations in the G56S mouse model, which carries a missense mutation in the Sms gene. The lack of SMS protein in the G56S mice resulted in increased spermidine/spermine ratio, failure to thrive, short stature and reduced bone density. They showed impaired learning capacity, increased anxiety, reduced mobility and heightened fear responses, accompanied by reduced total and regional brain volumes. Furthermore, impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was evident in G56S cerebral cortex, G56S fibroblasts and Sms-null hippocampal cells, indicating that SMS may serve as a future therapeutic target. Collectively, our study establishes the suitability of the G56S mice as a preclinical model for SRS and provides a set of molecular and functional outcome measures that can be used to evaluate therapeutic interventions for SRS.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, with limited treatment options available. The underlying mechanisms and pathogenesis of SAE remain unclear. Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a membrane-associated protein, is involved in various in vivo pathophysiological processes. This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of a novel bioactive ANXA1 tripeptide (ANXA1sp) in SAE. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 each): control, SAE (intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide), vehicle (SAE + normal saline), and ANXA1sp (SAE + ANXA1sp) groups. Changes in serum inflammatory factors (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), hippocampal reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were measured. The Morris water maze and Y maze tests were used to assess learning and memory capabilities in the rats. Further, changes in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and apoptosis-related protein expression were detected using western blot. The IL-6, TNF-alpha, and ROS levels were significantly increased in the SAE group compared with the levels in the control group. Intraperitoneal administration of ANXA1sp led to a significant decrease in the IL-6, TNF-alpha, and ROS levels (p < 0.05). Compared with the SAE group, the ANXA1sp group exhibited reduced escape latency on day 5, a significant increase in the number of platform crossings and the percent spontaneous alternation, and significantly higher hippocampal MMP and ATP levels (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the expression level of PPAR-gamma protein in the ANXA1sp group was significantly increased compared with that in the other groups (p < 0.05). The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins (nuclear factor-kappa B [NF-kappa B], Bax, and Caspase-3) in the SAE and vehicle groups were significantly increased, with a noticeable decrease in Bcl-2 expression, compared with that noted in the control group. Moreover, the expressions of NF-kappa B, Bax, and Caspase-3 were significantly decreased in the ANXA1sp group, and the expression of Bcl-2 was markedly increased (p < 0.05). ANXA1sp can effectively reverse cognitive impairment in rats with SAE. The neuroprotective effect of ANXA1sp may be attributed to the activation of the PPAR-gamma pathway, resulting in reduced neuroinflammatory response and inhibition of apoptosis.

AB  - A recommendation system is an imaginative resolution for managing the restrictions in e-commerce services with item details and user details. Also, it is used to determine the user preferences to recommend the items they expected to buy. Several conventional collaborative filtering techniques are devised in the recommender model, but it has some complexities. Hence, an innovative optimization-driven deep residual network is devised in this paper for a product recommendation system. Here, the product of images is used for extracting features where the Convolutional neural network (CNN) features are computed, and then it is given as input to the deep residual network aimed at product recommendation. The deep residual network is trained using developed Elephant Herding Feedback Artificial Optimization (EHFAO), which is obtained by integrating Elephant Herding opti-mization (EHO) into the Feedback Artificial Tree (FAT). Here, the item grouping is carried out on input data based on K-means clustering. After item grouping, Cosine similarity is used to perform matching of groups, where the best group is acquired among all the available groups. Extraction of list of visitors is done from the best group. Then, the list of items is obtained from the sequence of best visitor. Next, the corresponding binary sequence is obtained for the applicable sequence of visitor. From this sequence of best visitor, the recommended product is acquired. Then, the recommended product is subjected to the sentiment analysis for which the score is determined. Here, the sentiment analysis helps to decide whether the product is recommended or not recom-mended. If the score is positive, then the same product is recommended; otherwise, the new product is rec-ommended. The proposed EHFAO-based deep residual network attained better performance in comparison to the other techniques with a maximal F-measure at 84.061%, 84.061% precision, 87.845% recall along with minimal Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.216.

AB  - Ostriches are known to be the fastest bipedal animal alive; to accomplish such an achievement, their anatomy evolved to sustain the stresses imposed by running at such velocities. Ostriches represent an excellent case study due to the fact that their locomotor kinematics have been extensively studied for their running capabilities. The shape and structure of ostrich bones are also known to be optimized to sustain the stresses imposed by the body mass and accelerations to which the bones are subjected during movements. This study focuses on the limb bones, investigating the structure of the bones as well as the material properties, and how both the structure and material evolved to maximise the performance while minimising the stresses applied to the bones themselves. The femoral shaft is hollowed and it presents an imbricate structure of fused bone ridges connected to the walls of the marrow cavity, while the tibial shaft is subdivided into regions having different mechanical characteristics. These adaptations indicate the optimization of both the structure and the material to bear the stresses. The regionalization of the material highlighted by the mechanical tests represents the capability of the bone to adapt to external stimuli during the life of an individual, optimizing not only the structure of the bone but the material itself.

AB  - Six new polyoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones F-H (1-3), norcowanol A-B (4-5), and garcinone F (6) along with twelve known compounds 7-18 were obtained from the latex of Garcinia cowa Roxb. ex Choisy. All new compounds have a 1,3,7-trioxygenated or 1,3,6,7-tetraoxygenated xanthone nucleus and differ from majority of xanthones from G. cowa by hydrated side chains. Compounds 1, 7, 8 and 18 exhibited significant neuroprotective effects on glutamate-mediated hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell death. In particular, compound 1 exhibited the most potent neuroprotective effect with >80 % cell viability in the concentration range of 2.9-115 mu M. Further studies on compound 1 showed that it decreased cellular Ca2+ influx and inhibits cellular reactive oxygen species generation in HT22 cells. A Western blot analysis showed that MAPK phosphorylation, Bax, and AIF translocation dramatically increased upon treatment with 5 mM glutamate and decreased upon a co-treatment with compound 1.

AB  - High-energy, short-duration electric pulses (EPs) are known to be effective in neuromodulation, but the biological mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that nanosecond electric pulses (nsEPs) could initiate the phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) depletion in non excitable cells identical to agonist-induced activation of the G(q11) coupled receptors. PIP2 is the precursor for multiple intracellular second messengers critically involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and plasma membrane (PM) ion channels responsible for the control of neuronal excitability. In this paper we demonstrate a novel finding that five day in vitro (DIV5) primary hippocampal neurons (PHNs) undergo significantly higher PIP2 depletion after 7.5 kV/cm 600 ns EP exposure than DIV1 PHNs and day 1-5 (D1-D5) non-excitable Chinese hamster ovarian cells with muscarinic receptor 1 (CHO-hM(1)). Despite the age of development, the stronger 15 kV/cm 600 ns or longer 7.5 kV/cm 12 mu s EP initiated profound PIP2 depletion in all cells studied, outlining damage of the cellular PM and electroporation. Therefore, the intrinsic properties of PHNs in concert with nanoporation explain the stronger neuronal response to nsEP at lower intensity exposures. PIP2 reduction in neurons could be a primary biological mechanism responsible for the stimulation or inhibition of neuronal tissues. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Adverse events induced by drug-drug interactions are a major concern in the United States. Current research is moving toward using electronic health record (EHR) data, including for adverse drug events discovery. One of the first steps in EHR-based studies is to define a phenotype for establishing a cohort of patients. However, phenotype definitions are not readily available for all phenotypes. One of the first steps of developing automated text mining tools is building a corpus. Therefore, this study aimed to develop annotation guidelines and a gold standard corpus to facilitate building future automated approaches for mining phenotype definitions contained in the literature. Furthermore, our aim is to improve the understanding of how these published phenotype definitions are presented in the literature and how we annotate them for future text mining tasks. Results Two annotators manually annotated the corpus on a sentence-level for the presence of evidence for phenotype definitions. Three major categories (inclusion, intermediate, and exclusion) with a total of ten dimensions were proposed characterizing major contextual patterns and cues for presenting phenotype definitions in published literature. The developed annotation guidelines were used to annotate the corpus that contained 3971 sentences: 1923 out of 3971 (48.4%) for the inclusion category, 1851 out of 3971 (46.6%) for the intermediate category, and 2273 out of 3971 (57.2%) for exclusion category. The highest number of annotated sentences was 1449 out of 3971 (36.5%) for the "Biomedical & Procedure" dimension. The lowest number of annotated sentences was 49 out of 3971 (1.2%) for "The use of NLP". The overall percent inter-annotator agreement was 97.8%. Percent and Kappa statistics also showed high inter-annotator agreement across all dimensions. Conclusions The corpus and annotation guidelines can serve as a foundational informatics approach for annotating and mining phenotype definitions in literature, and can be used later for text mining applications.

AB  - Within the eastern Mediterranean, increased fishing pressure coupled with a lack of basic biological information is threatening the sustainability of the rare Lusitanian cownose ray (Rhinoptera marginata). To provide baseline life-history data for this species, age estimates were obtained from vertebral band counts of 224 rays (size range: 210-998 mm disc width and 140 to 13,600 g weight) collected from Iskenderun Bay. Females ranged in size from 210 to 998 mm disc width and 238 to 13,600 g weight, while males ranged from 130 to 866 mm disc width and 140 to 8250 g weight. The index of average percent error (2.8%) and age-bias plot suggest that the aging method used represents a precise and non-biased approach. Marginal increment analysis indicated that a single opaque band is deposited annually between August and September. The oldest ages obtained for R. marginata were 9 years for males and 19 years for females, which corresponded to total lengths of 866 and 998 mm disc width, respectively. For males, limited samples prevented the accurate calculation of growth rates; however, for combined sexes, observed and disc width-at-age data resulted in the following von Bertalanffy growth parameters: DW infinity = 1102.16 mm, k = 0.148 and t(0) = -0.2167. Although additional samples are necessary to determine growth rates in males, the results of the present study indicate that R. marginata females exhibit life history characteristics similar to other Rhinoptera species.

AB  - Multiscale neuroscience conceptualizes mental illness as arising from aberrant interactions across and within multiple biopsychosocial scales. We leverage this framework to propose a multiscale disease progression model of psychosis, in which hippocampal-cortical dysconnectivity precedes impairments in episodic memory and social cognition, which lead to more severe negative symptoms and lower functional outcome. As psychosis represents a heterogeneous collection of biological and behavioral alterations that evolve over time, we further predict this disease progression for a subtype of the patient sample, with other patients showing normal-range performance on all variables. We sampled data from two cross-sectional datasets of first- and multi-episode psychosis, resulting in a sample of 163 patients and 119 non-clinical controls. To address our proposed disease progression model and evaluate potential heterogeneity, we applied a machine-learning algorithm, SuStaIn, to the patient data. SuStaIn uniquely integrates clustering and disease progression modeling and identified three patient subtypes. Subtype 0 showed normal-range performance on all variables. In comparison, Subtype 1 showed lower episodic memory, social cognition, functional outcome, and higher negative symptoms, while Subtype 2 showed lower hippocampal-cortical connectivity and episodic memory. Subtype 1 deteriorated from episodic memory to social cognition, negative symptoms, functional outcome to bilateral hippocampal-cortical dysconnectivity, while Subtype 2 deteriorated from bilateral hippocampal-cortical dysconnectivity to episodic memory and social cognition, functional outcome to negative symptoms. This first application of SuStaIn in a multiscale psychiatric model provides distinct disease trajectories of hippocampal-cortical connectivity, which might underlie the heterogeneous behavioral manifestations of psychosis.

AB  - To investigate the age and growth characteristics of shotted halibut, Eopsetta grigorjewi, in the West Sea of Korea, the samples were collected using gill nets throughout 2019. A total of 861 specimens (693 females and 168 males) were analyzed. The BW-TL relations were BW = 0.0034TL(3.3278) (R-2 = 0.8716) for females and BW = 0.0031TL(3.3359) (R-2 = 0.8860) for males. This analysis revealed that males exhibited a larger growth rate than females (p < 0.05). Notably, the anterior and posterior sections of the otolith displayed an elongated oval shape, exceeding the radius of the dorsal and ventral regions. By examining the correlation between radii in four directions and total length, the highest correlation was observed between the total length (TL) and the ventral radius (R). The evaluation of the relationship between the fish total length and the otolith ventral radiusresulted in an equation of TL = 14.657R + 9.1601 (R-2 =0.7081) for females and TL = 15.037R + 5.0265 (R-2 = 0.6992) for males (p < 0.05). The formation of annuli occurred annually, consistently in January each year, as discerned through monthly changes in marginal index (MI) values. The von Bertalanffy growth equations from the relationship between the otolith annuli radius and the total length were L-t = 83.6 (1 - exp(-0.046(t+4.70))) in females (n = 693, p < 0.05) and L-t = 56.8 (1 - exp(-0.078(t+2.16))) in males (n = 168, p < 0.05).

AB  - This study developed an efficient method for liquid storage of in vitro-derived porcine blastocysts at ambient temperature for 24 hr. We evaluated the effects of new chemically defined media (cell wash and preservation solution, Cellstor(R)-W [Cell-W] and cell suspension and preservation solution, Cellstor(R)-S [Cell-S]) for short-term storage. In the first experiment, in vitro-derived blastocyst were stored at 25oC for 24 hr in Cell-W solution, Cell-S solution and pig embryo culture (PBM) medium. There were no differences in the rates of survival and development of stored blastocysts between the Cell-S and Cell-W solutions, but the total cell number of embryos that survived after storage in Cell-S solution was significantly higher (p < .05) than that in the Cell-W solution. In the second experiment, Cell-S solution was used to store the in vitro-derived blastocysts at 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Storage at 20 degrees C resulted in a significant decrease in the rates of survival and development of stored blastocysts compared to storage at 25 degrees C or 30 degrees C. No differences in survival and development rates were observed between storage at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, but the damage to the embryo quality after storage and culture was significantly lower at 25 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. In the third experiment, Cell-S solution was supplemented with beta-mercaptoethanol and curcumin, either alone or in combination, as antioxidant agents. Although the supplementation with curcumin did not improve survival, it significantly increased the development rate of stored blastocysts compared with the control blastocysts stored without antioxidants. In conclusion, when porcine blastocysts were stored at 25 degrees C for 24 hr, a Cell-S solution may be effective for maintaining the survival and development of in vitro embryos.

AB  - This study aimed to reveal the prognostic role of the Hippo pathway in different histopathological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The TCGA-KIRC (n = 537), TCGA-KIRP (n = 291) and TCGA-KICH (n = 113), which contain data about clear cell (ccRCC), papillary (pRCC) and chromophobe RCC (chRCC), respectively, were investigated. Gene Set Variation Analysis was used to compare the activity of many pathways within a single sample. Oncogenic pathway-related expression differed between cases of ccRCC involving low and high Hippo pathway activity. There were two subsets of ccRCC, in which the cancer exhibited lower and higher Hippo signalling activity, respectively, compared with normal tissue. In the ccRCC cohort, lower Hippo pathway activity was associated with a higher clinical stage (p < 0.001). The Hippo pathway (HR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.17-0.50, p < 0.001), apoptosis (HR = 6.02; 95% CI = 1.47-24.61; p = 0.013) and the p53 pathway (HR = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.02-0.36; p < 0.001) were identified as independent prognostic factors for ccRCC. The 5-year overall survival of the ccRCC patients with low and high Hippo pathway activity were 51.9% (95% CI = 45.0-59.9) and 73.6% (95% CI = 67.8-79.9), respectively. In conclusion, the Hippo pathway plays an important role in the progression of ccRCC. Low Hippo pathway activity is associated with poor outcomes in ccRCC, indicating the tumour suppressor function of this pathway.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is defined as a declined cognition, measured by neuropsychological tests, that persists for months or even longer after surgery. Heterogeneities in the diagnosis of POCD usually involve differences in the test batteries, the cutoffs, and the timing of assessments. Although peripheral and CSF markers of neuroinflammation have been shown to correlate with increased risk of POCD, most of them are non-specific and cannot be used for POCD diagnosis. These factors hampered the understanding of the pathogenesis of POCD as well as the development of effective preventions/treatments. In this study, we found Ttr in a panel of potential POCD biomarkers identified using time-series analysis of the transcriptomes and proteomes of the hippocampi of POCD mice that diagnosed on individual basis with composite Z-scores of test batteries consisting of Y maze and open field test. Compared with their counterparts without POCD, the levels of Ttr were significantly lower in the peripheral circulation as well as in the hippocampi of the mice developed POCD at all indicated time points after surgery. The levels of peripheral TTR in human patients with delayed neurocognitive recovery were found to be reduced at 24 h after abdominal surgery, compared with those who did not. Endogenous expression of Ttr was verified in microglia cells both in vitro and in vivo. Results of in vitro assay indicated a potential role of Ttr in ameliorating LPS-induced microglial priming and protecting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in proinflammatory microenvironment, which was one of the determinant factors in regulating the pathological progression of POCD.

AB  - Survival for high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor. Most patients who recur, present with metastatic disease, and few tar getable pathways that govern spread to distant sites are currently known. We previously developed a metastatic mouse model to select cells with enhanced ability to spread to the bone and brain and identified a signature based on differentially expressed genes, which also predicted patient survival. To discover new neuroblastoma therapies, we utilized the Connectivity Map to identify compounds that can reverse this metastatic transcriptional signature and found calcipotriol, a vitamin D3 analog, to be a compound that selectively targets cell lines with enhanced metastatic potential. Calcipotriol treatment of enhanced metastatic, but not parental, cells reduces proliferation and survival via vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling, increases the expression of RASSF2, a negative regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, and reduces the levels of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ. RASSF2 is required for the effects of calcipotriol and for the reduction of levels and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ. Migration of the enhanced metastatic cells and YAP/TAZ levels are reduced after calcipotriol treatment and YAP overexpression reduces calcipotriol sensitivity. Furthermore, metastatic cells that overexpress VDR also showed lower tumor burden in vivo.

AB  - It was previously reported that the delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonist SNC80 and antagonist naltrindole modulate the excitability of hippocampal glutamate neurons in primary cultures. The present study aimed to investigate the acute effects of these ligands on the firing activity of hippocampal (LC) noradrenaline, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in in vivo conditions. Adult Wistar male rats were used. SNC80 and naltrindole were administered intravenously. Neuronal firing activity was assessed using extracellular single-unit electrophysiology. SNC80, administered first at 1-3 mg/kg, dose-dependently inhibited CA1/3 glutamate, DRN 5-HT, and VTA dopamine neurons. Naltrindole, administered at 1-3 mg/kg after SNC80, did not have any additional effect. Naltrindole, administered first at 1-3 mg/kg, stimulated DRN 5-HT neurons in a dose-dependent manner; this stimulation was dose-dependently reversed by 1-3 mg/kg of SNC80. SNC80 and naltrindole inhibited LC noradrenaline neurons when only they were co-administered at 3 mg/kg, and only when SNC80 was administered first. In conclusion, DOR ligands alter the firing activity of hippocampal glutamate and brainstem monoamine neurons in in vivo conditions. The psychoactive effects of DOR ligands, reported in previous studies, might be explained, at least in part, by their ability to modulate the firing activity of hippocampal glutamate and brainstem monoamine neurons.

AB  - Hydrogels based on poly(vinyl alcohol), silk sericin, and gelatin containing Camellia oleifera oil (CO)-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) were fabricated. The loading of CO into CSNPs was achieved by a two-step procedure, which included an oil-in-water emulsion and an ionic gelation method. SEM images of CO-loaded CSNPs illustrated the spherical shape with aggregation of the nanoparticles. The particle size and polydispersity index were 541 -1089 nm and 0.39 -0.65, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were 3 -16 % and 4 -6 %, respectively. The gelatin/poly(vinyl alcohol)/sericin hydrogels were fabricated and incorporated with CO or CO-loaded CSNPs with different concentrations of CO-loaded CSNPs. All hydrogels demonstrated a porous structure. Besides, the hydrogels containing CO-loaded CSNPs showed a more controlled and sustained release profile than the hydrogels containing CO. Moreover, the hydrogels showed tyrosinase inhibition (9 -13 %) and antioxidant activity (37 -60 %). Finally, the hydrogels containing CO-loaded CSNPs were non-toxic to the Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts and NCTC clone 929 cells, even at a high dosage of 50 mg/ mL. As a result, these hydrogels exhibited excellent potential for use in cosmeceutical industries.

AB  - Australian wildlife rehabilitators (AWR) are at increased risk of developing Q fever, a serious zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Previous studies have suggested that Australian wildlife may be a potential C. burnetii infection source for humans. However, a recent serological survey of AWR found no association between C. burnetii exposure and direct contact with any wildlife species. To further explore the potential risk that wildlife may pose, this study aimed to identify associations between self-reported Q fever in AWR and risk factors for exposure to C. burnetii. An online cross-sectional survey was implemented in 2018 targeting AWR nationwide. Risk factors for self-reported Q fever were determined using multivariable logistic regression. Medically diagnosed Q fever was self-reported in 4.5% (13/287) of unvaccinated respondents. Rehabilitators who self-reported medically diagnosed Q fever were significantly more likely to: primarily rehabilitate wildlife at a veterinary clinic (OR 17.87, 95% CI: 3.09-110.92), have domestic ruminants residing on the property where they rehabilitate wildlife (OR 11.75, 95% CI: 2.91-57.42), have been educated at a High School/Technical and Further Education level (OR 10.29, 95% CI: 2.13-84.03) and be aged >50 years (OR 6.61, 95% CI: 1.60-38.35). No association was found between self-reported Q fever and direct contact with wildlife. These findings support previous work suggesting that AWR are at increased risk of C. burnetii infection and may develop Q fever potentially via exposure to traditional infection sources including livestock, other domestic animals, or contaminated environments, in association with their rehabilitation practices and lifestyle. Although Q fever vaccination is recommended for AWR, vaccine uptake is low in this population. Future studies should aim to determine the level of Q fever awareness and identify barriers to Q fever vaccination in this at-risk group. The difficulty in accessing the AWR population also highlights the need for a national centralized AWR database.

AB  - Many growth factors have been studied as additives accelerating lumbar fusion rates in different animal models. However, their low hydrolytic and thermal stability both in vitro and in vivo limits their workability and use. In the proposed work, a stabilized vasculogenic and prohealing fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2-STAB(R)) exhibiting a functional half-life in vitro at 37 degrees C more than 20 days was applied for lumbar fusion in combination with a bioresorbable scaffold on porcine models. An experimental animal study was designed to investigate the intervertebral fusion efficiency and safety of a bioresorbable ceramic/biopolymer hybrid implant enriched with FGF2-STAB(R) in comparison with a tricortical bone autograft used as a gold standard. Twenty-four experimental pigs underwent L2/3 discectomy with implantation of either the tricortical iliac crest bone autograft or the bioresorbable hybrid implant (BHI) followed by lateral intervertebral fixation. The quality of spinal fusion was assessed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), biomechanical testing, and histological examination at both 8 and 16 weeks after the surgery. While 8 weeks after implantation, micro-CT analysis demonstrated similar fusion quality in both groups, in contrast, spines with BHI involving inorganic hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate along with organic collagen, oxidized cellulose, and FGF2- STAB(R) showed a significant increase in a fusion quality in comparison to the autograft group 16 weeks post-surgery (p = 0.023). Biomechanical testing revealed significantly higher stiffness of spines treated with the bioresorbable hybrid implant group compared to the autograft group (p < 0.05). Whilst histomorphological evaluation showed significant progression of new bone formation in the BHI group besides non-union and fibrocartilage tissue formed in the autograft group. Significant osteoinductive effects of BHI based on bioceramics, collagen, oxidized cellulose, and FGF2-STAB(R) could improve outcomes in spinal fusion surgery and bone tissue regeneration.

AB  - IL-25 is implicated in the pathogenesis of viral asthma exacerbations. However, the effect of IL-25 on antiviral immunity has yet to be elucidated. We observed abundant expression and colocalization of IL-25 and IL-25 receptor at the apical surface of uninfected airway epithelial cells and rhinovirus infection increased IL-25 expression. Analysis of immune transcriptome of rhinovirus-infected differentiated asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) treated with an anti-IL-25 monoclonal antibody (LNR125) revealed a re-calibrated response defined by increased type I/III IFN and reduced expression of type-2 immune genes CCL26, IL1RL1 and IL-25 receptor. LNR125 treatment also increased type I/III IFN expression by coronavirus infected BECs. Exogenous IL-25 treatment increased viral load with suppressed innate immunity. In vivo LNR125 treatment reduced IL-25/type 2 cytokine expression and increased IFN-beta expression and reduced lung viral load. We define a new immune-regulatory role for IL-25 that directly inhibits virus induced airway epithelial cell innate anti-viral immunity.
   IL-25 and its receptor are expressed in airway epithelial cells of healthy individuals and patients with asthma and antibody-mediated blockade of IL-25 enhances antiviral immunity and blocks virus-exacerbated asthma responses.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) improves neuronal mitochondrial function and cognition in adults after brain injury and in those afflicted by psychiatric disorders. However, the influence of EPO on mitochondria and cognition during development remains unexplored. We previously observed that EPO stimulates hippocampal-specific neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis early in postnatal development in mice. Here we show that EPO promotes mitochondrial respiration in developing postnatal hippocampus by increasing mitochondrial content and enhancing cellular respiratory potential. Ultrastructurally, mitochondria profiles and total vesicle content were greater in presynaptic axon terminals, suggesting that EPO enhances oxidative metabolism and synaptic transmission capabilities. Behavioural tests of hippocampus-dependent memory at early adulthood, showed that EPO improves spatial and short-term memory. Collectively, we identify a role for EPO in the murine postnatal hippocampus by promoting mitochondrial function throughout early postnatal development, which corresponds to enhanced cognition by early adulthood. Robert Jacobs, Mostafa Aboouf, et al. examined the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) in hippocampal mitochondrial function and memory in two mouse models: one overexpressing EPO in the brain, and juvenile mice treated during three days with a high dose of intraperitoneal EPO. Their results suggest that erythropoietin in the neonatal brain may impact spatial memory by increasing mitochondrial content.

AB  - Blood pressure (BP) is determined by several physiological factors that are regulated by a range of complex neural, endocrine, and paracrine mechanisms. This study examined a collection of 198 human genes related to BP regulation, in the biological processes and functional prisms, as well as gene expression in organs and tissues. This was made in conjunction with an orthology analysis performed in 19 target organisms along the phylogenetic tree. We have demonstrated that transport and signaling, as well as homeostasis in general, are the most prevalent biological processes associated with BP gene orthologs across the examined species. We showed that these genes and their orthologs are expressed primarily in the kidney and adrenals of complex organisms (e.g., high order vertebrates) and in the nervous system of low complexity organisms (e.g., flies, nematodes). Furthermore, we have determined that basic functions such as ion transport are ancient and appear in all organisms, while more complex regulatory functions, such as control of extracellular volume emerged in high order organisms. Thus, we conclude that the complex system of BP regulation evolved from simpler components that were utilized to maintain specific homeostatic functions that play key roles in existence and survival of organisms.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of neurodegenerative disease with a complex pathophysiology that remains not fully understood, and the exact mechanism of neurodegeneration is uncertain. Ferroptosis has been linked to the progression of degenerative diseases observed in AD models. The present study is designed to investigate the protective effects of spermidine, a potent antioxidant and iron chelator, and its synergistic interactions with ciprofloxacin, another iron chelator, in modulating ferroptosis and mitigating AD progression in rats. This study investigated AD-related biomarkers like neurotoxic amyloid beta (A beta), arginase I, and serotonin. Spermidine demonstrated an anti-ferroptotic effect in the AD model, evident from the modulation of ferroptosis parameters such as hippocampus iron levels, reduced protein expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15). Additionally, the administration of spermidine led to a significant increase in protein expression of phosphorylated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (p-Nrf2) and upregulation of Cystine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) gene expression. Moreover, spermidine notably decreased p53 protein levels, acrolein, and gene expression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1). Overall, our findings suggest that spermidine and/or ciprofloxacin may offer potential benefits against AD by modulating ferroptosis. Furthermore, spermidine enhanced the antioxidant efficacy of ciprofloxacin and reduced its toxic effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Rett syndrome (RTT) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the X-chromosome. These mutations distort the function of a protein (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2), which controls the expression of several other genes. The resulting pathology, which manifests mostly in female patients, is associated with a number of deficits in brain functioning and development. On the cellular level, the defective functioning of mitochondria-the powerplants of the cells-is one of several hallmarks of RTT. Mitochondria contain more than 1000 different proteins, and their composition differs among tissues. Our study aims to reveal differences between the mitochondrial proteomes of a mouse model of RTT and wild-type (WT) mice. Two brain regions were studied, the hippocampus and neocortex, both of which are pivotal for cognitive function. Indeed, numerous differences were identified, which are not only mouse strain (genotype)-specific but also brain-region-specific. These differentially expressed proteins could affect mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative phosphorylation, and other important aspects of mitochondrial functioning. The data obtained will contribute to improving our understanding of mitochondrial malfunctioning during the progression of RTT, and they will pave the way for further translational medicine research. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with mutations in the X-chromosomal MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2) gene. Most patients are young girls. For 7-18 months after birth, they hardly present any symptoms; later they develop mental problems, a lack of communication, irregular sleep and breathing, motor dysfunction, hand stereotypies, and seizures. The complex pathology involves mitochondrial structure and function. Mecp2(-/y) hippocampal astrocytes show increased mitochondrial contents. Neurons and glia suffer from oxidative stress, a lack of ATP, and increased hypoxia vulnerability. This spectrum of changes demands comprehensive molecular studies of mitochondria to further define their pathogenic role in RTT. Therefore, we applied a comparative proteomic approach for the first time to study the entity of mitochondrial proteins in a mouse model of RTT. In the neocortex and hippocampus of symptomatic male mice, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent mass-spectrometry identified various differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins, including components of respiratory chain complexes I and III and the ATP-synthase FoF1 complex. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 8, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1, and ATP synthase subunit d are upregulated either in the hippocampus alone or both the hippocampus and neocortex of Mecp2(-/y) mice. Furthermore, the regulatory mitochondrial proteins mitofusin-1, HSP60, and 14-3-3 protein theta are decreased in the Mecp2(-/y) neocortex. The expressional changes identified provide further details of the altered mitochondrial function and morphology in RTT. They emphasize brain-region-specific alterations of the mitochondrial proteome and support the notion of a metabolic component of this devastating disorder.

AB  - Eggs not only contain all the molecules necessary to nurture new life but are also rich in nutrients such as high-quality protein. For example, epidemiologic studies have shown that egg intake is positively correlated with cognitive function. Thus, we specifically examined the effect of ovalbumin, a major protein present in egg whites, on cognitive function. First, we found that an orally administered enzymatic digest of ovalbumin improves cognitive function in mice fed a high-fat diet. Then, we narrowed down candidate peptides based on the prediction of peptide production according to enzyme-substrate specificity and comprehensive peptide analysis of the digest. We found that three peptides, namely ILPEY, LYRGGLEP, and ILELP, improve cognitive function after oral administration. We also showed that ILPEY, LYRGGLEP, and ILELP were present in the digest and named them ovomemolins A (OMA), B, and C, respectively. Notably, ovomemolins are the first peptides derived from egg whites that have been shown to improve cognitive function. The cognitive improvement induced by OMA, the most abundant of the peptides in the digest, was inhibited by methyllycaconitine, an antagonist of alpha 7nAChR, which is known to be related to memory. These results suggest that OMA improves cognitive function through the acetylcholine system. After OMA administration, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression and the number of 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine-positive cells suggested that OMA increases hippocampal BDNF expression and neurogenesis.
   We found that an enzymatic digest of ovalbumin, the major egg protein, ameliorates cognitive decline when administered orally to mice. We searched for peptides that improve cognitive function from this enzyme digest and found three new orally active peptides, which we named ovomemolins A-C. Ovomemolin A improved cognitive function depends on the acetylcholine system and increased BDNF expression and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Ovomemolins are the first example of egg protein-derived peptides that ameliorate cognitive decline.image

AB  - Aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3 NPs) have been widely used in vaccine manufacture, food additives, human care products, and cosmetics. However, they also have adverse effects on different organs, including the liver, kidneys, and testes. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant, particularly against metals by forming melatonin-metal complexes. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of melatonin against Al2O3 NP-induced toxicity in the rat brain. Forty adult male Wistar rats were allocated to four groups: the untreated control (received standard diet and distilled water), Al2O3 NP-treated (received 30 mg/kg body weight Al2O3 NPs), melatonin and Al2O3 NP-treated (received 30 mg/kg body weight Al2O3 NPs + 10 mg/kg body weight melatonin), and melatonin-treated (received 10 mg/kg body weight melatonin) groups. All treatments were by oral gavages and administered daily for 28 days. Afterward, the rats were sacrificed, and samples from various brain regions (cerebrum, cerebellum, and hippocampus) were subjected to biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analyses. Al2O3 NPs substantially increased malondialdehyde, ,g-amyloid 1-42 peptide, acetylcholinesterase, and ,g-secretase-1 expression, whereas they markedly decreased glutathione levels. Furthermore, Al2O3 NPs induced severe histopathological alterations, including vacuolation of the neuropil, enlarged pericellular and perivascular spaces, vascular congestion, neuronal degeneration, and pyknosis. Al2O3 NP treatment also resulted in an intense positive caspase-3 immunostaining. Conversely, the administration of melatonin alleviated the adverse effects induced by Al2O3 NPs. Therefore, melatonin can diminish the neurotoxic effects induced by Al2O3 NPs.

AB  - Background: Status Epilepticus (SE) leads to the development of epilepsy with the contribution of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, has been shown to have neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects in animal models. This study aimed to determine whether uridine ameliorates ER stress and apoptosis following epileptogenic insult. Secondly, this study aimed to establish the effect of uridine on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters that contribute to ER stress. Methods: Status epilepticus was induced using lithium-pilocarpine in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Following SE termination, rats were treated with uridine, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), or saline twice daily for 48 h. Expressions of hippocampal glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), Inositol-Requiring Protein 1 (IRE1 alpha), Protein kinase RNA-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK), and C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP) were determined by western blotting 48 h after SE. Uridine's effects on apoptosis, inflammation or oxidation were evaluated by analyses of cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) protein expressions or pro-inflammatory cytokine levels or levels of oxidative stress markers, respectively. Results: Expressions of all ER stress-related proteins significantly increased 48 h after SE. Uridine treatment markedly decreased GRP78, IRE1 alpha, and CHOP levels. A decrease in the PERK level was observed following the administration of 4-PBA; however, uridine had no effect. Cleaved caspase-3 and PARP1 levels were increased in the SHAM group, while uridine and 4-PBA treatment effectively decreased their expressions. Treatment with uridine significantly reduced Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while tending to increase Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) levels. Uridine treatment also significantly attenuated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which increased 48 h post-SE. Conclusion: Our data indicate that uridine alleviates ER stress after SE. This effect may be attributed to the regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress. Uridine shows promise as a potential preventive agent for epilepsy.

AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that neuroinflammation is the key to perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND); however, the specific mechanism postsurgery and anesthesia has not yet been fully clarified. The present study is aimed at exploring the effects of P2X4/NLRP3 signaling pathway in neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment after surgery. 12-14-month-old male C57BL/6 mice undergoing open tibial fracture surgery by sevoflurane anesthesia were administered P2X4R inhibitor 5-BDBD or saline was intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days after surgery. Then, the animals were subjected to Morris water maze test or sacrificed to collect the hippocampus. The level of P2X4R and NLRP3 was estimated by Western blot, the activation of microglia was detected via immunohistochemistry, and the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results indicated that tibial surgery caused cognitive impairment, increased the expression of P2X4R and NLRP3, and aggravated the neuroinflammation and microglia activation. However, intraperitoneal injection of 5-BDBD attenuated these effects. In conclusion, these findings indicated that the P2X4/NLRP3 pathway might be involved in the pathophysiology of PND.

AB  - Rhinoviral infections cause approximately 50% of upper respiratory tract infections and novel treatment options are urgently required. We tested the effects of 10 mu M to 20 mu M sphingosine on the infection of cultured and freshly isolated human cells with minor and major group rhinovirus in vitro. We also performed in vivo studies on mice that were treated with an intranasal application of 10 mu L of either a 10 mu M or a 100 mu M sphingosine prior and after infection with rhinovirus strains 1 and 2 and determined the infection of nasal epithelial cells in the presence or absence of sphingosine. Finally, we determined and characterized a direct binding of sphingosine to rhinovirus. Our data show that treating freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells with sphingosine prevents infections with rhinovirus strains 2 (minor group) and 14 (major group). Nasal infection of mice with rhinovirus 1b and 2 is prevented by the intranasal application of sphingosine before or as long as 8 h after infection with rhinovirus. Nasal application of the same doses of sphingosine exerts no adverse effects on epithelial cells as determined by hemalaun and TUNEL stainings. The solvent, octylglucopyranoside, was without any effect in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the positively charged lipid sphingosine binds to negatively charged molecules in the virus, which seems to prevent the infection of epithelial cells. These findings indicate that exogenous sphingosine prevents infections with rhinoviruses, a finding that could be therapeutically exploited. In addition, we demonstrated that sphingosine has no obvious adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Sphingosine prevents rhinoviral infections by a biophysical mode of action, suggesting that sphingosine could serve to prevent many viral infections of airways and epithelial cells in general. Future studies need to determine the molecular mechanisms of how sphingosine prevents rhinoviral infections and whether sphingosine also prevents infections with other viruses inducing respiratory tract infections. Furthermore, our studies do not provide detailed pharmacokinetics that are definitely required before the further development of sphingosine.

AB  - Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), threatening the life quality of the diabetic population. However, there is still a lack of effective approaches for its intervention. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that was not previously investigated for its effect on DCD. In this study, EPA was found to improve DCD in a mouse model of type 2 DM (T2DM) induced by streptozotocin and a high-fat diet, exhibiting profound protective effects on cognitive dysfunction, neuronal loss, and cerebral oxidative stress and inflammation. While EPA did not attenuate advanced glycation end product-induced neuron injury, we hypothesized that EPA might protect neurons by regulating microglia polarization, the effect of which was confirmed by the co-culture of neurons and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia. RNA sequencing identified nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) antioxidant signaling as a major target of EPA in microglia. Mechanistically, EPA increased sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1 or P62) levels that might structurally inhibit Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1), leading to nuclear translocation of NRF2. P62 and NRF2 predominantly mediated EPA's effect since the knockdown of P62 or NRF2 abolished EPA's protective effect on microglial oxidative stress and inflammation and sequential neuron injuries. Moreover, the regulation of P62/KEPA1/NRF2 axes by EPA was confirmed in the hippocampi of diabetic mice. The present work presents EPA as an effective nutritional approach and microglial P62/KEAP1/NRF2 as molecular targets for the intervention of DCD.
   Microglia were activated under diabetic conditions, causing hippocampal neuron injury. EPA inhibited microglia activation possibly through modulation of the P62/KEAP1/NRF2 antioxidant signaling pathway.

AB  - We have previously suggested a key role of the hippocampus in the preconditioning action of moderate hypobaric hypoxia (HBH). The preconditioning efficiency of HBH is associated with acoustic startle prepulse inhibition (PPI). In rats with PPI > 40%, HBH activates the cholinergic projections of hippocampus, and PNU-282987, a selective agonist of alpha 7 nicotinic receptors (alpha 7nAChRs), reduces the HBH efficiency and potentiating effect on HBH of its solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anticholinesterase agent) when administered intraperitoneally. In order to validate the hippocampus as a key structure in the mechanism of hypoxic preconditioning and research a significance of alpha 7nAChR activation in the hypoxic preconditioning, we performed an in vivo pharmacological study of intrahippocampal injections of PNU-282987 into the CA1 area on HBH efficiency in rats with PPI & GE; 40%. We found that PNU-282987 (30 mu M) reduced HBH efficiency as with intraperitoneal administration, while DMSO (0.05%) still potentiated this effect. Thus, direct evidence of the key role of the hippocampus in the preconditioning effect of HBH and some details of this mechanism were obtained in rats with PPI & GE; 40%. The activation of alpha 7nAChRs is not involved in the cholinergic signaling initiated by HBH or DMSO via any route of administration. Possible ways of the potentiating action of DMSO on HBH efficiency and its dependence on alpha 7nAChRs are discussed.

AB  - Studies have shown that melatonin (MLT) can delay ovarian aging, but the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that granulosa cells isolated from mice follicles can synthesize MLT; the addition of MLT in ovary culture system inhibited follicle activation and growth; In vivo experiments indicated that injections of MLT to mice during the follicle activation phase can reduce the number of activated follicles by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-FOXO3 pathway; during the early follicle growth phase, MLT administration suppressed follicle growth and atresia, and multiple pathways involved in folliculogenesis, including PI3K-AKT, were suppressed; MLT deficiency in mice increased follicle activation and atresia, and eventually accelerated age-related fertility decline; finally, we demonstrated that prolonged high-dose MLT intake had no obvious adverse effect. This study presents more insight into the roles of MLT in reproductive regulation that endogenous MLT delays ovarian aging by inhibiting follicle activation, growth and atresia.
   Chan Yang, Qinghua Liu, et al. use in vitro and SNAT-null mouse models to investigate the role of melatonin in ovarian aging. Their results suggest that melatonin can delay ovarian aging by inhibiting follicle activation, growth and atresia, providing more insight into how melatonin impacts reproduction.

AB  - Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is acknowledged to have potent neurotoxicity. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), the most abundant polyphenol in the human diet, is well-known for its neuroprotective activity. This investigation was performed to determine the effects and mechanisms of CGA on TMT-induced neurobehavioral dysfunctions. Mice received oral administrations of CGA (30 mg kg(-1)) for 11 days, in which they were intraperitoneally injected with TMT (2.7 mg kg(-1)) once on the 8th day. The daily intake of CGA significantly alleviated TMT-induced epilepsy-like seizure and cognition impairment, ameliorating hippocampal neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation. Oral gavage of CGA potentially exerted neuroprotective effects through JNK/c-Jun and TLR4/NF kappa B pathways. Microbiome analysis revealed that daily consumption of CGA raised the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in TMT-treated mice. SCFAs, the gut microbial metabolites associated with neuroprotection, were increased in the mouse hippocampus following CGA treatment. TMT-induced neurotransmitter disorders were regulated by oral gavage of CGA, especially dl-kynurenine and acetylcholine chloride. Additionally, neurotransmitters in the mouse hippocampus were found to be highly associated with the gut microbiota. Our findings provided research evidence for the neuroprotective effect of CGA on TMT-induced neurobehavioral dysfunctions.

AB  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lysophospholipid that signals through six G-protein coupled receptors (LPARs), LPA1 to LPA6. LPA has been described as a potent modulator of fibrosis in different pathologies. In skeletal muscle, LPA increases fibrosis-related proteins and the number of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). FAPs are the primary source of ECM-secreting myofibroblasts in acute and chronic damage. How-ever, the effect of LPA on FAPs activation in vitro has not been explored. This study aimed to investigate FAPs' response to LPA and the downstream signaling mediators involved. Here, we demonstrated that LPA mediates FAPs activation by increasing their proliferation, expression of myofibroblasts markers, and upregu-lation of fibrosis-related proteins. Pretreatment with the LPA1/LPA3 antagonist Ki16425 or genetic deletion of LPA1 attenuated the LPA-induced FAPs activation, resulting in decreased expression of cyclin e1, a-SMA, and fibronectin. We also evaluated the activation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in response to LPA. Our results showed that LPA induces FAK phosphorylation in FAPs. Treatment with the P-FAK inhibitor PF-228 partially prevented the induction of cell responses involved in FAPs activation, suggesting that this pathway mediates LPA signaling. FAK activation controls downstream cell signaling within the cytoplasm, such as the Hippo pathway. LPA induced the dephosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivator YAP (Yes-associated protein) and promoted direct expression of target pathway genes such as Ctgf/Ccn2 and Ccn1. The blockage of YAP transcriptional activity with Super-TDU further confirmed the role of YAP in LPA-induced FAPs activa-tion. Finally, we demonstrated that FAK is required for LPA-dependent YAP dephosphorylation and the induc-tion of Hippo pathway target genes. In conclusion, LPA signals through LPA1 to regulate FAPs activation by activating FAK to control the Hippo pathway.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
