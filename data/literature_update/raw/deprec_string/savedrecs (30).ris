AB  - Mutations in PCDH19 gene, which encodes protocadherin-19 (PCDH19), cause Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 9 (DEE9). Heterogeneous loss of PCDH19 expression in neurons is considered a key determinant of the disorder; however, how PCDH19 mosaic expression affects neuronal network activity and circuits is largely unclear. Here, we show that the hippocampus of Pcdh19 mosaic mice is characterized by structural and functional synaptic defects and by the presence of PCDH19-negative hyperexcitable neurons. Furthermore, global reduction of network firing rate and increased neuronal synchronization have been observed in different limbic system areas. Finally, network activity analysis in freely behaving mice revealed a decrease in excitatory/inhibitory ratio and functional hyperconnectivity within the limbic system of Pcdh19 mosaic mice. Altogether, these results indicate that altered PCDH19 expression profoundly affects circuit wiring and functioning, and provide new key to interpret DEE9 pathogenesis.

AB  - In brief Bulls are selected for field fertility and semen quality, but traits such as polyspermy are not considered and can increase aneuploidy during in vitro embryo production. This study links bull-specific proteomic signatures to polyspermy and embryo quality, further refining bull selection criteria.Abstract Male fertility plays a pivotal role in the success rates of in vitro embryo production. While livestock breeding programs rigorously select bulls according to their predicted field fertility, specific traits such as polyspermy rates are not routinely evaluated. Despite the known negative impact of polyspermy on embryo survival, the paternal factors involved remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to address this gap by evaluating the in vitro outcomes of four bulls, focusing on sperm motility, fertilization rates, polyspermy incidence, embryo development and quality. In addition, we analyzed the proteome profiles of sperm, 2-4 cell stage embryos and blastocysts derived from those bulls to identify potential molecular factors associated with male fertility. Bulls with comparable sperm motility parameters displayed varying in vitro fertilization outcomes. Notably, the bull with the highest polyspermy rate achieved blastocyst rates similar to those of bulls with lower polyspermy rates. The number of apoptotic cells in the blastocysts was bull-dependent. Proteomic analysis revealed bull-specific signatures in sperm and blastocysts, with no differences at the 2-4 cell stage. Differences in the sperm proteome suggested that bull-dependent penetration and polyspermy rates might be associated with the ability of the sperm to undergo capacitation and acrosomal reaction. At the blastocyst level, the bull with the highest polyspermy rates produced lower quality blastocysts due to imbalances in key proteins and pathways for embryo development. In conclusion, bulls with similar blastocyst rates may differ in polyspermy rates and resulting embryo quality underscoring the importance of careful bull selection for in vitro embryo production.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor for dementia, which is a common neurodegenerative disorder. DM is known to activate inflammation, oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) generation, all capable of inducing neuronal dysfunctions, thus participating in the neurodegeneration progress. In that process, disturbed neuronal glucose supply plays a key role, which in hippocampal neurons is controlled by the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). We investigated the expression of GLUT4, nuclear factor NF-kappa B subunit p65 [NFKB (p65)], carboxymethyllysine and synapsin1 (immunohistochemistry), and soma area in human postmortem hippocampal samples from control, obese, and obese+DM subjects (41 subjects). Moreover, in human SH-SY5Y neurons, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and glycated albumin (GA) effects were investigated in GLUT4, synapsin-1 (SYN1), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), synaptophysin (SYP) proteins, and respective genes; NFKB binding activity in the SLC2A4 promoter; effects of increased histone acetylation grade by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibition. Hippocampal neurons (CA4 area) of obese+DM subjects displayed reduced GLUT4 expression and neuronal soma area, associated with increased expression of NFKB (p65). Challenges with TNF and GA decreased the SLC2A4/GLUT4 expression in SH-SY5Y neurons. TNF decreased SYN1, TH, and SYP mRNAs and respective proteins, and increased NFKB binding activity in the SLC2A4 promoter. Inhibition of HDAC3 increased the SLC2A4 expression and the total neuronal content of CRE-binding proteins (CREB/ICER), and also counterbalanced the repressor effect of TNF upon these parameters. This study revealed reduced postmortem human hippocampal GLUT4 content and neuronal soma area accompanied by increased proinflammatory activity in the brains of DM subjects. In isolated human neurons, inflammatory activation by TNF reduced not only the SLC2A4/GLUT4 expression but also the expression of some genes related to neuronal function (SYN1, TH, SYP). These effects may be related to epigenetic regulations (H3Kac and H4Kac status) since they can be counterbalanced by inhibiting HDAC3. These results uncover the improvement in GLUT4 expression and/or the inhibition of HDAC3 as promising therapeutic targets to fight DM-related neurodegeneration.

AB  - Despite differences in structure and living environment, several animal appendages (e.g., octopus arms, elephant trunks, etc.) follow a common pattern: the logarithmic spiral. This paper reports a new class of soft robots that morphologically replicate the spiral based on a common design principle across scales. This allows for speedy and inexpensive fabrication, while cables are used to provide a simple yet effective control mechanism. We further present a grasping strategy, inspired by the octopus, that can automatically adapt to a target object's shape. Through extensive tests, we illustrate the dexterity of SpiRobs and the ability to grasp objects that vary in size by more than two orders of magnitude and up to 260 times self-weight. Last, we demonstrate scalability via three additional variants: a miniaturized gripper, a 1-m-long manipulator mounted on a drone, and an array of SpiRobs that can tangle up various objects.

AB  - Background: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a ubiquitous second messenger that transduces extracellular signals in virtually all eukaryotic cells. The soluble Beggiatoa photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (bPAC) rapidly raises cAMP in blue light and has been used to study cAMP signaling pathways cell-autonomously. But low activity in the dark might raise resting cAMP in cells expressing bPAC, and most eukaryotic cyclases are membrane-targeted rather than soluble. Our aim was to engineer a plasma membrane-anchored PAC with no dark activity (i.e., no cAMP accumulation in the dark) that rapidly increases cAMP when illuminated.
   Results: Using a streamlined method based on expression in Xenopus oocytes, we compared natural PACs and confirmed bPAC as the best starting point for protein engineering efforts. We identified several modifications that reduce bPAC dark activity. Mutating a phenylalanine to tyrosine at residue 198 substantially decreased dark cyclase activity, which increased 7000-fold when illuminated. Whereas Drosophila larvae expressing bPAC in mechanosensory neurons show nocifensive-like behavior even in the dark, larvae expressing improved soluble (e.g., bPAC(R278A)) and membrane-anchored PACs exhibited nocifensive responses only when illuminated. The plasma membrane-anchored PAC (PACmn) had an undetectable dark activity which increased >4000-fold in the light. PACmn does not raise resting cAMP nor, when expressed in hippocampal neurons, affect cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) activity in the dark, but rapidly and reversibly increases cAMP and PKA activity in the soma and dendrites upon illumination. The peak responses to brief (2 s) light flashes exceed the responses to forskolin-induced activation of endogenous cyclases and return to baseline within seconds (cAMP) or similar to 10 min (PKA).
   Conclusions: PACmn is a valuable optogenetic tool for precise cell-autonomous and transient stimulation of cAMP signaling pathways in diverse cell types.

AB  - Coronary heart disease (CHD) has been the number one killer in the United States for decades and causes millions of deaths each year. Clinical treatment of heart ischemic injury relieves symptoms in the acute stage of CHD; however, patients with an infarcted heart muscle can develop heart failure (HF) due to chronic maladaptive remodeling. Regenerative therapy has been studied as a potential treatment option for myocardial infarction (MI) and HF. Cardiac patches have been designed and tested to increase therapeutic retention and integration. However, the delivery usually requires invasive surgical techniques, including open-chest surgeries and heart manipulation. Those procedures may cause chronic adhesions between the heart anterior wall and the chest wall. This study created and tested an injectable ExoGel by embedding mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes into a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel. ExoGel was injected into the pericardial cavity of rats with transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced heart failure. ExoGel therapy reduced LV chamber size and preserved wall thickness. The feasibility and safety of ExoGel injection were further confirmed in a pig model.

AB  - Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs), particularly (17 alpha,20E)-17,20-[(1-methoxyethylidene)bis (oxy)]-3-oxo-19-norpregna-4,20-diene-21-carboxylic-acid-methyl-ester (YK11), are increasingly popular among athletes seeking enhanced performance. Serving as an Androgen Receptor (AR) agonist, YK11 stimulates muscle growth while inhibiting myostatin. Our study delved into the impact of YK11 on the rat hippocampus, analyzing potential alterations in neurochemical mechanisms and investigating its synergistic effects with exercise (EXE), based on the strong relationship between SARM users and regular exercise. Utilizing Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, we demonstrated YK11 remarkable brain permeability, with molecular docking analysis revealing YK11 inhibitory effects on 5-alpha-reductase type II (5 alpha R2), suggesting high cell bioavailability. Throughout a 5 -week experiment, we divided the animals into the following groups: Control, YK11 (0.35 g/kg), EXE (swimming exercise), and EXE + YK11. Our findings showed that YK11 displayed a high binding affinity with AR in the hippocampus, influencing neurochemical function and modulating aversive memory consolidation, including the downregulation of the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling, irrespective of EXE combination. In the hippocampus, YK11 increased pro -inflammatory IL-1 beta and IL -6 cytokines, while reducing anti-inflammatory IL -10 levels. However, the EXE + YK11 group counteracted IL -6 effects and elevated IL -10. Analysis of apoptotic proteins revealed heightened p38 MAPK activity in response to YK11-induced inflammation, initiating the apoptotic cascade involving Bax/Bcl-2/cleaved caspase-3. Notably, the EXE + YK11 group mitigated alterations in Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. In conclusion, our findings suggest that YK11, at anabolic doses, significantly alters hippocampal neurochemistry, leading to impairments in memory consolidation. This underscore concerns about the misuse risks of SARMs among athletes and challenges common perceptions of their minimal side effects.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs mostly in the elderly and is characterized by chronic progressive cognitive dysfunction, which seriously threatens the health and life-quality of patients. Alterations at the molecular level, which causes pathological changes of AD brain, have impacted the progression of AD. In this review, we illustrate the recent evidence of the alteration of neuroprotective proteins in AD, such as changes in their contents and variants. Furthermore, we elucidate the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene changes. Finally, we highlight the epigenetic changes in AD, which helps to display the characteristics of the disease and provides guidance regarding research hot spots in the field against AD.

AB  - Unselective use of antibiotics to treat children with COVID-19 is one of the major issues during the pandemic in Serbia. Thus far, there has been no evidence about the predictors of multiple antibiotic use in the treatment of children with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of antibiotic use, as well as to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with a greater number of antibiotics and with a longer antibiotic treatment administered to hospitalized children with COVID-19 during the lockdown in Serbia. This study included all children who were hospitalized from 6 March to 31 May 2020 at the only pediatric COVID-19 hospital, and who were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from medical records. The antibiotic treatment included the use of azithromycin, cephalosporin (ceftriaxone), ampicillin-amikacin, and hydroxychloroquine. The overall prevalence of antibiotics use in children hospitalized with COVID-19 regardless of age was 47.2% (43.3% in children aged 1-5 years and 44.4% in those aged 5-17 years). In children aged 1-5 years, not having a family member affected by COVID-19 (B = -1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.43, -0.34, p = 0.011), having pneumonia on chest X-ray (B = 0.81, 95%CI 0.34, 1.29, p = 0.002), being a boy (B = -0.65, 95%CI -1.17, -0.13, p = 0.018), and having higher C-reactive protein (CRP) values on admission (B = 0.12, 95%CI 0.07, 0.17, p = 0.001) were associated with the administration of a higher number of antibiotics. These factors, along with having fever (B = 3.20, 95%CI 1.03, 5.37, p = 0.006), were associated with a longer duration of antibiotic treatment in children aged 1-5 years. In children aged 5-17 years, having pharyngeal erythema (B = 1.37, 95%CI 0.61, 2.13, p = 0.001), fever (B = 0.43, 95%CI 0.07, 0.79, p = 0.018), and pneumonia on chest X-ray (B = 0.91, 95%CI 0.53, 1.29, p = 0.001), not having rhinorrhea (B = -1.27, 95%CI -2.47, -0.08, p = 0.037), being a girl (B = 0.52, 95%CI 0.08, 0.97, p = 0.021), and having higher CRP values on admission (B = 0.04, 95%CI 0.01, 0.06, p = 0.006) were associated with the administration of a higher number of antibiotics. These factors, not including the absence of rhinorrhea, were associated with a longer duration of antibiotics treatment in children aged 5-17 years. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters were associated with the use of multiple antibiotics and a longer duration of antibiotic treatment both among children aged 1-5 years and those aged 5-17 years.

AB  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is an atypical bacterial pathogen responsible for community-acquired pneumonia primarily among school-aged children and young adults. Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) has been used as a medicinal and edible plant in China for centuries, the constituents from which possessed various bioactivities. Notably, flavonoids existing in residues of C. oleifera defatted seeds exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we investigated the impact of total flavonoids from C. oleifera (TFCO) seed extract on M. pneumoniae pneumonia. TFCO was obtained using multiple column chromatography methods and identified as kaempferol glycosides via UPLC-HRESIMS. In a M. pneumoniae pneumonia mouse model, TFCO significantly reduced the lung damage, suppressed IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha production, and curbed TLR2 activation triggered by M. pneumoniae. Similarly, in RAW264.7 macrophage cells stimulated by lipid-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs), TFCO suppressed the generation of proinflammatory cytokines and TLR2 expression. Moreover, TFCO diminished the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, JNK, ERK, p38, and p65 nuclear translocation in vitro. In conclusion, TFCO alleviated M. pneumoniae-induced lung damage via inhibition of TLR2-mediated NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in M. pneumoniae-triggered lung inflammation.

AB  - Background: Inactivation of the Hippo pathway promotes Yap nuclear translocation, enabling execution of a transcriptional program that induces tissue growth. Genetic lesions of Hippo intermediates only identify a minority of cancers with illegitimate YAP activation. Yap has been implicated in resistance to targeted therapies, but the mechanisms by which YAP may impact adaptive resistance to MAPK inhibitors are unknown. Methods: We screened 52 thyroid cancer cell lines for illegitimate nuclear YAP localization by immunofluorescence and fractionation of cell lysates. We engineered a doxycycline (dox)-inducible thyroid-specific mouse model expressing constitutively nuclear YAPS127A, alone or in combination with endogenous expression of either Hras(G12V) or Braf(V600E). We also generated cell lines expressing dox-inducible sh-miR-E-YAP and/or YAP(S127A). We used cell viability, invasion assays, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, qRT-PCRs, flow cytometry and cell sorting, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing and in vivo tumorigenesis to investigate YAP dependency and response of BRAF-mutant cells to vemurafenib. Results: We found that 27/52 thyroid cancer cell lines had constitutively aberrant YAP nuclear localization when cultured at high density (NU-YAP), which rendered them dependent on YAP for viability, invasiveness and sensitivity to the YAP-TEAD complex inhibitor verteporfin, whereas cells with confluency-driven nuclear exclusion of YAP (CYT-YAP) were not. Treatment of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells with RAF kinase inhibitors resulted in YAP nuclear transloca-tion and activation of its transcriptional output. Resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant thyroid cells was driven by YAP-dependent NRG1, HER2 and HER3 activation across all isogenic human and mouse thyroid cell lines tested, which was abrogated by silencing YAP and relieved by pan-HER kinase inhibitors. YAP activation induced analogous changes in BRAF melanoma, but not colorectal cells. Conclusions: YAP activation in thyroid cancer generates a dependency on this transcription factor. YAP governs adaptive resistance to RAF kinase inhibitors and induces a gene expression program in BRAF(V600E)-mutant cells encom-passing effectors in the NRG1 signaling pathway, which play a central role in the insensitivity to MAPK inhibitors in a lineage-dependent manner. HIPPO pathway inactivation serves as a lineage-dependent rheostat controlling the magnitude of the adaptive relief of feedback responses to MAPK inhibitors in BRAF-(V600E) cancers.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to measure the neuropeptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), and their receptors, termed VPAC1, VPAC2 and PAC1 in ruminants. To date, we are unaware of any reported quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) measurements for these genes in either sheep (weathers) or cows (steers). To this end, we isolated total RNA from 15 different tissues from both wethers and steers and performed qPCR measurements. These data revealed expression for VIP and PACAP in the brain and intestines of both ruminant species, while VPAC1 and PAC1 receptors were detected in the brain, throughout the intestines (e.g., duodenum, jejunum, ilium, and colon), metabolically relevant organs (e.g., liver, kidney, and fat), and spleen (a primary immune organ). In contrast, VPAC2 was not detected in wethers, and only detected in spleen and omasum (muscular third stomach) in steers. Collectively, these data reveal for the first-time tissue expression profiles for the VIP and PACAP ligands and their receptors in ruminants that will provide researchers a better understanding of their biological activities in these animals. Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Pituitary Adenylate-Cyclase-Activating Peptide (PACAP) are anti-inflammatory neuropeptides that play important roles in human and rodent gut microbiota homeostasis and host immunity. Pharmacologically regulating these neuropeptides is expected to have significant health and feed efficiency benefits for agriculturally relevant animals. However, their expression profile in ruminant tissues is not well characterized. To this end, we screened for VIP and PACAP neuropeptides and their endogenous GPCRs using 15 different tissues from wethers and steers by RT-qPCR. Our results revealed relatively similar expression profiles for both VIP and PACAP neuropeptide ligands in the brain and intestinal tissue of both species. In contrast, the tissue expression profiles for VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 were more widespread and disparate, with VPAC1 being the most diversely expressed receptor with mRNA detection in the brain and throughout the gastrointestinal tract. These data are an important first step to allow for future investigations regarding the VIP and PACAP signaling pathways in livestock ruminant species.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP), a central effector in the Hippo pathway, is involved in the regulation of organ size, stem cell self-renewal, and tissue regeneration. In this study, we observed YAP activation in patients with alcoholic steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Accumulation of this protein in the nucleus was also observed in murine livers that were damaged after chronic-plus-single binge or moderate ethanol ingestion combined with carbon tetrachloride intoxication (ethanol/CCl4). To understand the role of this transcriptional coactivator in alcohol-related liver injury, we knocked out the Yap1 gene in hepatocytes of floxed homozygotes through adeno-associated virus (AAV8)-mediated deletion utilizing Cre recombinase. Yap1 hepatocyte-specific knockouts (KO) exhibited hemorrhage, massive hepatic necrosis, enhanced oxidative stress, elevated hypoxia, and extensive infiltration of CD11b(+) inflammatory cells into hepatic microenvironments rich for connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) during ethanol/CCl4-induced liver damage. Analysis of whole-genome transcriptomics indicated upregulation of genes involved in hypoxia and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, whereas genes related to hepatocyte proliferation, progenitor cell activation, and ethanol detoxification were downregulated in the damaged livers of Yap1 KO. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh)1a1, a gene that encodes a detoxification enzyme for aldehyde substrates, was identified as a potential YAP target because this gene could be transcriptionally activated by a hyperactive YAP mutant. The ectopic expression of the human ALDH1A1 gene caused increase in hepatocyte proliferation and decrease in hepatic necrosis, oxidative stress, ECM remodeling, and inflammation during ethanol/CCl4-induced liver damage. Taken together, these observations indicated that YAP was crucial for liver repair during alcohol-associated injury. Its regulation of ALDH1A1 represents a new link in liver regeneration and detoxification.

AB  - Ischemic stroke triggers a cascade of events that facilitates neural protection and spontaneous recovery, which accounts for a major part of functional recovery. Despite the cellular and molecular facilitations on neural protection, the molecular mechanisms of spontaneous recovery have not been fully understood. Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1), a member of CAPS family, plays a major role in synaptic transmission and synaptic effectiveness by regulating vesicle exocytosis. Here, the molecular mechanism of CAPS1 in spontaneous recovery after ischemic stroke was studied. In this study, transient left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used as the ischemic stroke model. The whole brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological score analysis showed decreased infarct volume and neurological scores at 7 days as compared with 1 day after MCAO, suggesting the spontaneous recovery. Elisa and Western blot analysis showed elevated BDNF and CAPS1 expression levels in bilateral hippocampus at both 1 day and 3 days after MCAO. Then, inhibition of CAPS1 by adeno-associated virus (AAV) microinjection in the hippocampus attenuated the spontaneous recovery of both motor and memory impairment induced by MCAO. In addition, elevated p-TrkB levels were detected after MCAO, which were reduced by CAPS1-AAV microinjection, indicating that CAPS1 could induce BDNF secretion after ischemic stroke. Moreover, we found elevated combination of CAPS1 with dense core vesicles (DCV) in the hippocampus at both 1 day and 3 days after MCAO, which could also be inhibited by CAPS1-AAV microinjection, indicating the potential mechanism of CAPS1 in regulating BDNF release after MCAO. Finally, we found that CAPS1/BDNF signaling could influence the neurogenesis in the hippocampus after MCAO. In conclusion, CAPS1 regulates neurogenesis by up-regulating BDNF release in the hippocampus, which finally facilitate spontaneous recovery after ischemic stroke.

AB  - The Morris water maze (MWM) is regarded as one of the most popular tests for detecting spatial memory in rodents. Long-term potentiation and cGMP synthesis seem to be among the crucial factors involved in this type of learning. Muscarinic (M-1, M-4, and M-5 receptors) and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are important targets in the search for antipsychotic drugs with the potency to treat cognitive disabilities associated with the disorder. Here, we show that muscarinic receptor activators (VU0357017, VU0152100, and VU0238429) and an mGlu(2) receptor activator, LY487379, dose-dependently prevented the development of cognitive disorders as a result of MK-801 administration in the MWM. The dose-ranges of the compounds were as follows: VU0357017, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg; VU0152100, 0.05, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg; VU0238429, 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg; and LY487379, 0.5, 3, and 5 mg/kg. The co-administration of LY487379 with each of the individual muscarinic receptor ligands showed no synergistic effect, which contradicts the results obtained earlier in the novel object recognition (NOR) test. MWM learning resulted in increased cGMP synthesis, both in the cortex and hippocampi, when compared to that in intact animals, which was prevented by MK-801 administration. The investigated compounds at the highest doses reversed this MK-801-induced effect. Neither the procedure nor the treatment resulted in changes in GluN2B-NMDA expression.

AB  - This study assessed the potential protective effects of Mangiferin (MANGI) at various concentrations (10, 50 and 100 mu M) on follicular survival and activation, enzyme activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the relative mRNA expression for BAX, BCL2 and SOD in porcine ovarian tissue cultured in vitro for 48 h with and without chemical stress induced by 0.3 mu g/mL doxorubicin (DOX). The results indicated that when MANGI was associated with DOX, regardless of the tested concentration, MANGI increased (p < 0.05) follicle survival when compared to DOX alone, with only MANGI 10 + DOX and MANGI 50 + DOX treatments reducing follicular degeneration to levels comparable with the culture control. Regarding antioxidant enzymes, all treated groups decreased (p < 0.05) SOD activity compared to cultured control, while MANGI 10 treatment showed lower (p < 0.05) CAT activity compared to DOX treatment. Compared to cultured control, the mRNA levels of SOD were reduced (p < 0.05) in the MANGI 100, MANGI 10 + DOX and MANGI 100 + DOX treatments. In conclusion, supplementing the culture medium with MANGI attenuated the toxicity induced by DOX during the in vitro culture of pig preantral follicles enclosed in ovarian tissue.

AB  - The molecular code that controls synapse formation and maintenance in vivo has remained quite sparse. Here, we identify that the secreted protein Adamtsl3 functions as critical hippocampal synapse organizer acting through the transmembrane receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). Traditionally, DCC function has been associated with glutamatergic synaptogenesis and plasticity in response to Netrin-1 signaling. We demonstrate that early post-natal deletion of Adamtsl3 in neurons impairs DCC protein expression, causing reduced density of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Adult deletion of Adamtsl3 in either GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons does not interfere with DCC-Netrin-1 function at glutamatergic synapses but controls DCC signaling at GABAergic synapses. The Adamtsl3-DCC signaling unit is further essential for activity-dependent adaptations at GABAergic synapses, involving DCC phosphorylation and Src kinase activation. These findings might be particularly relevant for schizophrenia because genetic variants in Adamtsl3 and DCC have been independently linked with schizophrenia in patients.

AB  - Loss of noradrenaline (NA)-rich afferents from the Locus Coeruleus (LC) ascending to the hippocampal formation has been reported to dramatically affect distinct aspects of cognitive function, in addition to reducing the proliferation of neural progenitors in the dentate gyrus. Here, the hypothesis that reinstating hippocampal noradrenergic neurotransmission with transplanted LC-derived neuroblasts would concurrently normalize both cognitive performance and adult hippocampal neurogenesis was investigated. Post-natal day (PD) 4 rats underwent selective immunolesioning of hippocampal noradrenergic afferents followed, 4 days later, by the bilateral intrahippocampal implantation of LC noradrenergic-rich or control cerebellar (CBL) neuroblasts. Starting from 4 weeks and up to about 9 months post-surgery, sensory-motor and spatial navigation abilities were evaluated, followed by post-mortem semiquantitative tissue analyses. All animals in the Control, Lesion, Noradrenergic Transplant and Control CBL Transplant groups exhibited normal sensory-motor function and were equally efficient in the reference memory version of the water maze task. By contrast, working memory abilities were seen to be consistently impaired in the Lesion-only and Control CBL-Transplanted rats, which also exhibited a virtually complete noradrenergic fiber depletion and a significant 62-65% reduction in proliferating 5-bromo-2 ' deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive progenitors in the dentate gyrus. Notably, the noradrenergic reinnervation promoted by the grafted LC, but not cerebellar neuroblasts, significantly ameliorated working memory performance and reinstated a fairly normal density of proliferating progenitors. Thus, LC-derived noradrenergic inputs may act as positive regulators of hippocampus-dependent spatial working memory possibly via the concurrent maintenance of normal progenitor proliferation in the dentate gyrus.

AB  - Mangiferin, a naturally occurring potent glucosylxanthone, is mainly isolated from the Mangifera indica plant and shows potential pharmacological properties, including anti-bacterial, anti-inflammation, and antioxidant in sepsis-induced lung and kidney injury. However, there was a puzzle as to whether mangiferin had a protective effect on sepsis-associated encephalopathy. To answer this question, we established an in vitro cell model of sepsis-associated encephalopathy and investigated the neuroprotective effects of mangiferin in primary cultured hippocampal neurons challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neurons treated with 20 mu mol/L or 40 mu mol/L mangiferin for 48 h can significantly reverse cell injuries induced by LPS treatment, including improved cell viability, decreased inflammatory cytokines secretion, relief of microtubule-associated light chain 3 expression levels and several autophagosomes, as well as attenuated cell apoptosis. Furthermore, mangiferin eliminated pathogenic proteins and elevated neuroprotective factors at both the mRNA and protein levels, showing strong neuroprotective effects of mangiferin, including anti-inflammatory, anti-autophagy, and antiapoptotic effects on neurons in vitro.

AB  - The composition of the extracellular milieu can vary significantly under physiological and pathological conditions, thereby altering the functional set point of brain cells. While global changes in the extracellular milieu are known to affect network activity, a detailed understanding of how specific changes in ion species impact individual cells remains elusive. Current modulation methods involve the use of diluted salts, such as KCl, where lack of precise control complicates data interpretation. This study achieves enhanced resolution by using a miniaturized iontronic micropipette. The micropipette, with a tip filled with polyelectrolyte and an outlet size below 2 mu m, allows for on-demand ionic manipulation of single cells, without simultaneous co-delivery of solvents or other solutes. Electrical, chemical, and optical characterizations, supported by computational modeling, confirm the device's high spatial and temporal precision. Validated in hippocampal slices, the device demonstrates iontronic release of potassium ions (K+), with a low current (<200 nA), that effectively, rapidly, and reversibly modulates individually targeted neurons and astrocytes. These findings underscore the potential of iontronic micropipettes to elucidate the distinct responses of neuronal and glial cells to specific changes in the local extracellular milieu, offering insights for neuroscience research and therapeutic innovation.

AB  - It was unknown whether hyperthermia increased the efficacy of histamine to raise the force of cardiac contractions via human H1-histamine receptors. To that end, we measured the force in isolated human atrial preparations (HAPs) excised from the right atrium of patients who underwent cardiac surgery due to severe two- or three-vessel coronary heart disease. For comparison, we also measured the force in paced (1 Hz) left and spontaneously beating right atrial preparations of transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac human H1-histamine receptors (H1-TG). Histamine (100 mu M) was less efficient in raising the force in left atrial preparations from H1 TG mouse atria under hyperthermia than under hypothermia. Oppositely, histamine was more efficient in augmenting force during hyperthermia than during hypothermia in isolated electrically stimulated (1 Hz) HAPs. In sum, the contractile response to activation of H1-histamine receptor in H1-TG mice and in HAPs are opposite with regard to hyperthermia dependence. In patients with fever, histamine might thus be important, to preserve cardiac contractile function as a compensatory mechanism.

AB  - The potential neurotoxic effects of propofol, an extensively utilized anesthetic, underline the urgency to comprehend its influence on neuronal health. Insights into the role of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha, small nucleolar RNA host gene 1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (RAR alpha-Snhg1-Bdnf) network can offer significant advancements in minimizing these effects. The study targets the exploration of the RAR alpha and Snhg1 regulatory network's influence on Bdnf expression in the realm of propofol-induced neurotoxicity. Harnessing the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and utilizing JASPAR and RNA-Protein Interaction Prediction (RPISeq) database for projections, the study embarks on an in-depth analysis employing both in vitro and in vivo models. The findings draw a clear link between propofol-induced neurotoxicity and the amplification of RAR signaling pathways, impacting hippocampal development and apoptosis and leading to increased RAR alpha and Snhg1 and decreased Bdnf. Propofol is inferred to accentuate neurotoxicity by heightening RAR alpha and Snhg1 interactions, culminating in Bdnf suppression.

AB  - Cardiac pathologies are characterized by intense remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that eventually leads to heart failure. Cardiomyocytes respond to the ensuing biomechanical stress by reexpressing fetal contractile proteins via transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes, such as alternative splicing (AS). Here, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC) is up-regulated and relocates to the sarcomeric Z-disc upon ECM pathological remodeling. We show that this is an active site of localized translation, where the ribonucleoprotein associates with the translation machinery. Alterations in hnRNPC expression, phosphorylation, and localization can be mechanically determined and affect the AS of mRNAs involved in mechanotransduction and cardiovascular diseases, including Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein 1. We propose that cardiac ECM remodeling serves as a switch in RNA metabolism by affecting an associated regulatory protein of the spliceosome apparatus. These findings offer new insights on the mechanism of mRNA homeostatic mechanoregulation in pathological conditions.

AB  - Background: Autologous vein grafts are widely used for bypass procedures in cardiovascular surgery. However, these grafts are susceptible to failure due to vein graft disease. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the latest-generation FRAME external support on vein graft remodeling in a preclinical model. Methods: We performed autologous internal jugular vein interposition grafting in porcine carotid arteries for one month. Four grafts were supported with a FRAME mesh, while seven unsupported grafts served as controls. The conduits were examined through flowmetry, angiography, macroscopy, and microscopy. Results: The one-month patency rate of FRAME-supported grafts was 100% (4/4), whereas that of unsupported controls was 43% (3/7, Log-rank p = 0.071). On explant angiography, FRAME grafts exhibited significantly more areas with no or mild stenosis (9/12) compared to control grafts (3/21, p = 0.0009). Blood flow at explantation was higher in the FRAME grafts (145 +/- 51 mL/min) than in the controls (46 +/- 85 mL/min, p = 0.066). Area and thickness of neo-intimal hyperplasia (NIH) at proximal anastomoses were similar for the FRAME and the control groups: 5.79 +/- 1.38 versus 6.94 +/- 1.10 mm2, respectively (p = 0.558) and 480 +/- 95 vs. 587 +/- 52 mu m2/mu m, respectively (p = 0.401). However, in the midgraft portions, the NIH area and thickness were significantly lower in the FRAME group than in the control group: 3.73 +/- 0.64 vs. 6.27 +/- 0.64 mm2, respectively (p = 0.022) and 258 +/- 49 vs. 518 +/- 36 mu m2/mu m, respectively (p = 0.0002). Conclusions: In our porcine model, the external mesh FRAME improved the patency of vein-to-carotid artery grafts and protected them from stenosis, particularly in the mid regions. The midgraft neo-intimal hyperplasia was two-fold thinner in the meshed grafts than in the controls.

AB  - Prediabetes (PrDM) is a prodromal stage of diabetes mellitus (DM) with an increasing prevalence worldwide. During DM progression, individuals gradually develop complications in various organs. However, lungs are suggested to be affected later than other organs, such as the eyes, heart or brain. In this work, we studied the effects of PrDM on male Wistar rats' lungs and whether the regular consumption of white tea (WTEA) for 2 months contributes to the improvement of the antioxidant profile of this tissue, namely through improved activity of the first line defense antioxidant enzymes, the total antioxidant capacity and the damages caused in proteins, lipids and histone H2A. Our data shows that PrDM induced a decrease in lung superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and histone H2A levels and an increase in protein nitration and lipid peroxidation. Remarkably, the regular WTEA intake improved lung antioxidant enzymes activity and total antioxidant capacity and re-established the values of protein nitration, lipid peroxidation and histone H2A. Overall, this is the first time that lung is reported as a major target for PrDM. Moreover, it is also the first report showing that WTEA possesses relevant chemical properties against PrDM-induced lung dysfunction.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a mental illness characterized by aberrant synaptic plasticity and connectivity. A large bulk of evidence suggests genetic and functional links between postsynaptic abnormalities and SCZ. Here, we performed quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus of SCZ patients to investigate the mRNA and protein expression of three key spine shapers: the actin-binding protein cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2), the sheddase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), and the synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97). Our analysis of the SCZ post-mortem brain indicated increased DLG1 mRNA in DLPFC and decreased CAP2 mRNA in the hippocampus of SCZ patients, compared to non-psychiatric control subjects, while the ADAM10 transcript was unaffected. Conversely, no differences in CAP2, SAP97, and ADAM10 protein levels were detected between SCZ and control individuals in both brain regions. To assess whether DLG1 and CAP2 transcript alterations were selective for SCZ, we also measured their expression in the superior frontal gyrus of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, also in Parkinson's disease patients, we found a selective reduction of CAP2 mRNA levels relative to controls but unaltered protein levels. Taken together, we reported for the first time altered CAP2 expression in the brain of patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders, thus suggesting that aberrant expression of this gene may contribute to synaptic dysfunction in these neuropathologies.

AB  - As mammals evolved with exposure to particular diets, naturally abundant compounds may have become part of the set of environmental co-determinants that shaped brain structure and function. Here we investigated whether bioactive factors found in apples directly affect hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult mouse. We found that quercetin, the most abundant flavanol in apple peel, was anti -proliferative at high concentrations but pro-neurogenic at low concentrations. This was confirmed in vivo, with intraperitoneally delivered quercetin promoting survival and neuronal differentiation, without affecting proliferation. Using a bioassay-guided fractionation approach we also identified additional pro-neurogenic compounds in apple flesh that were not related to flavonoids. We found that 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid significantly increased neural precursor cell proliferation and neurogenesis. This work shows that both flavonoids and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid are pro-neurogenic, not only by activating precursor cell proliferation but also by promoting cell cycle exit, cellular survival, and neuronal differentiation.

AB  - NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play an important role in synaptic plasticity both in physiological and pathological conditions. GluN2A and GluN2B are the most expressed NMDAR regulatory subunits, in the hippocampus and other cognitive-related brain structures. GluN2B is characteristic of immature structures and GluN2A of mature ones. Changes in GluN2A expression were associated with complex phenotypes that led to complex neurodevelopmental disorders, including the occurrence of seizures. However, little is known about the role of GluN2A in these phenotypes. In this work, we reduced GluN2A expression in mature neuronal cultures and observed an altered GluN2A/GluN2B ratio. Furthermore, those neurons exhibit an increase in immature dendritic spines and dendritic branching, as well as an increased response to glutamate stimulus. This phenotype (considering GluN2A/GluN2B ratio, index branching and glutamate response) resembles those observed at immature neuronal stages in vitro. We propose that this immature phenotype led to a higher response to glutamate stimulus which, in vivo, would be the basis of reduced threshold for seizure onset in GluN2A-pathological conditions.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders being also a comorbid state of other diseases. We aimed to evaluate the anxiolytic-like effects of carvedilol (CVD), a drug used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure with potent antioxidant effects, in animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). To do this, female Swiss mice were exposed to different stressors for 21 days. Between days 15 and 21, the animals received oral CVD (5 or 10 mg/kg) or the antidepressant desvenlafaxine (DVS 10 mg/kg). On the 22(nd) day, behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate locomotor activity (open field) and anxiety-like alterations (elevated plus-maze-EPM and hole board-HB tests). After behavioral determinations, the animals were euthanized, and the adrenal gland, blood and brain areas, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus were removed for biochemical analysis. CUS reduced the crossings while increased rearing and grooming, an effect reversed by both doses of CVD and DVS. CUS decreased the number of entries and permanence time in the open arms of the EPM, while all treatments reversed this effect. CUS reduced the number of head dips in the HB, an effect reversed by CVD. The CUS reduced weight gain, while only CVD5 reversed this effect. A reduction in the cortical layer size of the adrenal gland was observed in stressed animals, which CVD reversed. Increased myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as well as reduction of interleukin-4 (IL-4) induced by CUS, were reversed by CVD. DVS and CVD increased IL-6 in both brain areas. In the hippocampus, DVS caused an increase in IFN-gamma. Our data show that CVD presents an anxiolytic effect partially associated with immune-inflammatory mechanism regulation.

AB  - Several lines of evidence have shown that platelet-derived factors are key molecules in brain-body communication in pathological conditions. Here, we identify platelets as key actors in the modulation of fear behaviors in mice through the control of inhibitory neurotransmission and plasticity in the hippocampus. Interfering with platelet number or activation reduces hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and modulates fear learning and memory in mice, and this effect is reversed by serotonin replacement by serotonin precursor (5-HTP)/benserazide. In addition, we unravel that natural killer (NK) cells participate in this mechanism, regulating interleukin13 (IL-13) levels in the gut, with effects on serotonin production by enterochromaffin cells and uptake by platelets. Both NK cells and platelet depletion reduce the activation of hippocampal inhibitory neurons and increase the long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. Understanding the role of platelets in the modulation of neuro-immune interactions offers additional tools for the definition of the molecular and cellular elements involved in the growing field of brain-body communication.

AB  - Background Anatomical and cognitive adaptations to overcome morpho-mechanical limitations of laryngeal sound production, where body size and the related vocal apparatus dimensions determine the fundamental frequency, increase vocal diversity across taxa. Elephants flexibly use laryngeal and trunk-based vocalizations to form a repertoire ranging from infrasonic rumbles to higher-pitched trumpets. Moreover, they are among the few evolutionarily distantly related animals (humans, pinnipeds, cetaceans, birds) capable of imitating species-atypical sounds. Yet, their vocal plasticity has so far not been related to functions within their natural communicative system, in part because not all call types have been systematically studied. Here, we reveal how Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) produce species-specific squeaks (F0 300-2300 Hz) by using acoustic camera recordings to visualize sound emission and examining this alongside acoustic, behavioral, and morphological data across seven captive groups. Results We found that squeaks were emitted through the closed mouth in synchrony with cheek depression and retraction of the labial angles. The simultaneous emission of squeaks with nasal snorts (biphonation) in one individual confirmed that squeak production was independent of nasal passage involvement and this implicated oral sound production. The squeaks' spectral structure is incongruent with laryngeal sound production and aerodynamic whistles, pointing to tissue vibration as the sound source. Anatomical considerations suggest that the longitudinal closed lips function as the vibrators. Acoustic and temporal parameters exhibit high intra- and inter-individual variability that enables individual but no call-subtype classification. Only 19 of 56 study subjects were recorded to squeak, mostly during alarming contexts and social arousal but some also on command. Conclusion Our results strongly suggest that Asian elephants force air from the small oral cavity through the tensed lips, inducing self-sustained lip vibration. Besides human brass players, lip buzzing is not described elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Given the complexity of the proposed mechanism, the surprising absence of squeaking in most of the unrelated subjects and the indication for volitional control, we hypothesize that squeak production involves social learning. Our study offers new insights into how vocal and cognitive flexibility enables mammals to overcome size-related limitations of laryngeal sound production. This flexibility enables Asian elephants to exploit a frequency range spanning seven octaves within their communicative system.

AB  - Astrocytes govern critical aspects of brain function via spontaneous calcium signals in their soma and processes. A significant proportion of these spontaneous astrocytic calcium events are associated with mitochondria, however, the extent, sources, or kinetics of astrocytic mitochondrial calcium influx have not been studied in the adult mouse brain. To measure calcium influx into astrocytic mitochondria in situ, we generated an adenoassociated virus (AAV) with the astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter driving expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f tagged to mito7, a mitochondrial matrix targeted signal sequence. Using this construct, we observed AAV-mediated expression of GCaMP6f in adult mouse astrocytic mitochondria that co-localized with MitoTracker deep red (MTDR) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and in the hippocampal stratum radiatum (HPC). Astrocytic mitochondria co-labeled with MTDR and GCaMP6f displayed robust, spontaneous calcium influx events in situ, with subcellular differences in calcium influx kinetics between somatic, branch, and branchlet mitochondria, and inter-regional differences between mitochondria in DLS and HPC astrocytes. Calcium influx into astrocytic mitochondria was strongly dependent on endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores, but did not require the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU. Exposure to either glutamate, D1 or D2 dopamine receptor agonists increased calcium influx in some mitochondria, while simultaneously decreasing calcium influx in other mitochondria from the same astrocyte. These findings show that astrocytic mitochondria possess unique properties with regard to their subcellular morphology, mechanisms of calcium influx, and responses to neurotransmitter receptor agonists. Our results have important implications for understanding the role of astrocytic mitochondria during pathological processes.

AB  - ARID1A, an SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling gene, is commonly mutated in cancer and hypothesized to be a tumor suppressor. Recently, loss-of-function of ARID1A gene has been shown to cause intellectual disability. Here we generate Arid1a conditional knockout mice and investigate Arid1a function in the hippocampus. Disruption of Arid1a in mouse forebrain significantly decreases neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) proliferation and differentiation to neurons within the dentate gyrus (DG), increasing perinatal and postnatal apoptosis, leading to reduced hippocampus size. Moreover, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate cellular heterogeneity and reveal that Arid1a is necessary for the maintenance of the DG progenitor pool and survival of post-mitotic neurons. Transcriptome and ChIP-seq analysis data demonstrate that ARID1A specifically regulates Prox1 by altering the levels of histone modifications. Overexpression of downstream target Prox1 can rescue proliferation and differentiation defects of NSPCs caused by Arid1a deletion. Overall, our results demonstrate a critical role for Arid1a in the development of the hippocampus and may also provide insight into the genetic basis of intellectual disabilities such as Coffin-Siris syndrome, which is caused by germ-line mutations or microduplication of Arid1a.

AB  - Membrane Bound O-Acyltransferase Domain-Containing 4 (MBOAT4) protein catalyzes ghrelin acylation, leading to prominent ghrelin activity, hence characterizing its role as an anti-obesity target. We extracted 625 exonic SNPs from the ENSEMBL database and one phenotype-based missense mutation associated with obesity (A46T) from the HGMD (Human Gene Mutation Database). These were differentiated on deleterious missense SNPs of the MBOAT4 gene through MAF (minor allele frequency: <0.01) cut-off criteria in relation to some bioinformatics-based supervised machine learning tools. We found 8 rare-coding and harmful missense SNPs. The consensus classifier (PredictSNP) tool predicted that the SNP (G57S, C: rs561065025) was the most pathogenic. Several trained in silico algorithms have predicted decreased protein stability [Delta Delta G (kcal/mol)] function in the presence of these rare-coding pathogenic mutations in the MBOAT4 gene. Then, a stereochemical quality check (i.e. validation and assessment) of the 3D model was performed, followed by a blind cavity docking approach, used to search for druggable cavities and molecular interactions with citrus flavonoids of the Rutaceae family, ranked with energetic estimations. Significant interactions with Phloretin 3',5'-Di-C-Glucoside were also observed at R304, W306, N307, A311, L314 and H338 with (iGEMDOCK: -95.82 kcal/mol and AutoDock: -7.80 kcal/mol). The RMSD values and other variables of MD simulation analyses on this protein further validated its significant interactions with the above flavonoids. The MBOAT4 gene and its molecular interactions could serve as an interventional future anti-obesity target. The current study's findings will benefit future prospects for large population-based studies and drug development, particularly for generating personalized medicine.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - BACKGROUNDEarly weaning is prone to damage intestinal barrier function, resulting in diarrhea, whereas rutin, as a natural flavonoid with multiple biological functions, shows potential in piglets. Therefore, the effects of dietary rutin on growth, antidiarrheal, barrier function, antioxidant status and cecal microbiota of weaned piglets were investigated with the control group (CON) (basal diet) and Rutin (basal diet+500 mg kg-1 rutin) groups fed for 14 days.RESULTSThe results showed that dietary 500 mg kg-1 rutin significantly decreased diarrhea index, serum diamine oxidase activity and total aerobic bacterial population in mesenteric lymph nodes, whereas it significantly increased the gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) and serum growth hormone content, jejunal villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio, and also enhanced jejunal claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1 mRNA and protein expression. Meanwhile, dietary rutin significantly decreased inflammation-associated mRNA expression, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, swollen mitochondrial number and mitochondrial area in the jejunum, whereas it increased the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activities and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, dietary rutin significantly increased Firmicutes abundance and decreased Campylobacterota abundance, which were closely associated with the decreased diarrhea index and MDA content or increased Claudin-1 expression and T-SOD activity.CONCLUSIONDietary 500 mg kg-1 rutin increased G:F by improving intestinal morphology, and alleviated diarrhea by enhancing intestinal barrier, which might be associated with the enhanced antioxidant capacity via activating the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway and the improved cecal microbial composition in weaned piglets.

AB  - Metabolic processes in fetuses can significantly influence piglet weight at birth. Understanding the genetic determinants of systemic metabolism is crucial for uncovering how genetic and molecular pathways impact biological mechanisms, particularly during the fetal phase. We present data on 1112 plasma metabolites using untargeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods, of 260 backcross (BC) fetuses from two sires' breeds at 63 days post-conception. Eight chemical superclasses have been identified, with lipids accounting for the majority of metabolites. Genomic heritability (h(2)) was estimated for each metabolite, revealing that 50% had h(2) values below 0.2, with a higher average in the amino acid class compared with the lipid. We annotated 448 significant metabolite quantitative trait loci associated with 10 metabolites, primarily lipids, indicating strong genetic regulation. Additionally, metabolite associations with sex, fetal weight and sire's breed were explored, revealing significant associations for 354 metabolites. Fetal weight influenced the largest number of metabolites, particularly glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, emphasizing the genetic and metabolic complexity underlying fetal development. These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic regulation of metabolite levels and their associations with key phenotypic traits in fetuses, providing insights into metabolic pathways, potential biomarkers and serving as a baseline dataset for metabolomics studies of fetuses.

AB  - Zinc is a trace metal vital for various functions in nerve cells, although the effect of zinc deficiency on neuronal autophagy remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate whether zinc deficiency induced by treatment with N, N, N ', N '-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), a zinc chelator, affects and alters autophagy activity. In cell viability assays, TPEN showed cytotoxicity in HT-22 cells. TPEN treatment also increased LC3-II levels and the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I. Western blot analysis showed that phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase levels and the ratio of phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase to total AMP-activated protein kinase increased. Protein levels of the mammalian target of rapamycin and sirtuin 1 decreased following TPEN treatment. When TPEN-treated HT-22 cells were cotreated with autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (1 mM), or bafilomycin A1 (3 nM), the TPEN-induced decrease in cell viability was exacerbated. Cotreatment with chloroquine (10 mu M) partially restored cell viability. The study showed that zinc deficiency induces autophagy and may be cytoprotective in neurons. We expect our results to add a new perspective to our understanding of the neuronal pathology related to zinc deficiency.

AB  - Since Teleostei fins have a strong regenerative capacity, further research was conducted on the regulation of gene expression during fin regeneration. This research focuses on miRNA, which is a key post-transcriptional regulatory molecule. In this study, a miRNA library for the fin regeneration of zebrafish was constructed to reveal the differential expression of miRNA during fin regeneration and to explore the regulatory pathway for fin regeneration. Following the injection of miRNA agomir into zebrafish, the proliferation of blastema cells and the overall fin regeneration area were significantly reduced. It was observed that the miRNAs impaired blastocyte formation by affecting fin regeneration through the inhibition of the expressions of genes and proteins associated with blastocyte formation (including yap1 and Smad1/5/9), which is an effect associated with the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that miRNAs can impair the patterns and mineralization of newly formed fin rays. The miRNAs influenced fin regeneration by inhibiting the expression of a range of bone-related genes and proteins in osteoblast lineages, including sp7, runx2a, and runx2b. This study provides a valuable reference for the further exploration of morphological bone reconstruction in aquatic vertebrates.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9) technology is growing rapidly and has been greatly influencing the efficiency and effectiveness of genetic modifications in different applications. One aspect of research gaining importance in the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the introduction of CRISPR materials into target organisms. Although we previously demonstrated the efficacy of electroporation- and lipofection-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene disruption in porcine zygotes, we still believe that the efficiency of this system could be improved by combining these two methods. The present study was thus conducted to clarify the effects of a combination of electroporation and lipofection for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 components into zona pellucida (ZP)-intact and -free zygotes. The results revealed that electroporation alone significantly increased the biallelic mutation rates in the resulting blastocysts compared to lipofection alone, irrespective of the presence of ZP. None of ZP-intact zygotes treated by lipofectamine alone had any mutations, suggesting that removal of the ZP is necessary for enabling CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing via lipofection treatment in the zygotes. Additional lipofectamine treatment after electroporation did not improve the rates of total and biallelic mutations in the resulting blastocysts derived from either ZP-intact or -free zygotes.

AB  - An enriched environment stimulates adult hippocampal plasticity, but the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms are complex, and thus a matter of debate. We studied the behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in adult male and female Wistar rats that were housed in an enriched environment (EE) for two months. Both EE males and females performed better than control animals in a Barnes maze, meaning that EE enhances spatial memory. However, the expression levels of neurogenesis markers KI67, DCX, Nestin, and Syn1 increased only in EE females, while in EE males only KI67 and BDNF were higher than in the corresponding control. The number of DCX+ neurons on brain slices increased in the dentate gyrus of EE females only, i.e., the level of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was increased in female but not in male rats. The level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and signaling pathway components was upregulated in EE females. Of 84 miRNAs tested, in the hippocampi of EE female rats we detected upregulation in the expression levels of 12 miRNAs related to neuronal differentiation and morphogenesis, while in EE males four miRNAs were upregulated and involved in the regulation of cell proliferation/differentiation, and one was downregulated and associated with the stimulation of proliferation. Taken altogether, our results point to sex-specific differences in adult hippocampal plasticity, IL-10 expression, and miRNA profiles induced by an enriched environment.

AB  - Intracellular variable fragments of heavy-chain antibody from camelids (intra-VHH) have been successfully used as chaperones to solve the 3D structure of active G protein-coupled receptors bound to their transducers. However, their effect on signalling has been poorly explored, although they may provide a better understanding of the relationships between receptor conformation and activity. Here, we isolated and characterized iPRC1, the first intra-VHH recognizing a member of the large glycoprotein hormone receptor family, the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR). This intra-VHH recognizes the FSHR third intracellular loop and decreases cAMP production in response to FSH, without altering G alpha s recruitment. Hence, iPRC1 behaves as an allosteric modulator and provides a new tool to complete structure/activity studies performed thus far on this receptor.

AB  - Skin wound healing is a complex biological process involving haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation/repair and remodelling. However, skin scarring, as one of the important stages in the healing process, can adversely affect the structure and function of related organs. Currently, effective treatments to address such scars remain insufficient. In this study, we established a full-thickness skin excision wound model using male ICR mice, which were randomly divided into a Control group and a CuATSM group. The CuATSM group received CuATSM (30 mg/kg) via gavage, with daily treatments continuing throughout the observation period. The Control group received an equivalent volume of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Wound healing progression was evaluated through macroscopic photography, histological analyses, Western blotting and quantification of relevant biochemical markers at different healing stages. Our study reveals that CuATSM not only promotes rapid skin wound healing but also reduces scar formation in the late healing phase. Furthermore, our findings suggest that this effect is mediated through the ferroptosis-induced Hippo/YAP signalling pathway and macrophage polarisation. These findings highlight CuATSM as a promising therapeutic candidate for achieving scarless wound repair in clinical applications.

AB  - There is a currently a lack of large-area plasma sterilization devices that can intelligently identify the shape of a wound for automatic sterilization. For this reason, in this work, a plasma sterilization device with wound-edge recognition was developed using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a high-performance image-processing platform to realize intelligent and precise sterilization of wounds. SOLIDWORKS was used to design the mechanical structure of the device, and it was manufactured using 3D printing. The device used an improvement of the traditional Sobel detection algorithm, which extends the detection of edges in only the x and y directions to eight directions (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees, 225 degrees, 270 degrees, and 315 degrees), completing the wound-edge detection by adaptive thresholding. The device can be controlled according to different shapes of sterilization area to adjust the positioning of a single plasma-jet tube in the horizontal plane for two-dimensional movement; the distance between the plasma-jet tube and the surface of the object to be sterilized can be also adjusted in the vertical direction. In this way, motors are used to move the plasma jet and achieve automatic, efficient, and accurate plasma sterilization. It was found that a good sterilization effect could be achieved at both the culture-medium level and the biological-tissue level. The ideal sterilization parameters at the culture-medium level were a speed of 2 mm/s and a flow rate of 0.6 slm, while at the biological-tissue level, these values were 1 mm/s and 0.6 slm, respectively.

AB  - Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious neuropsychiatric syndrome among older patients, and lacks effective therapies. Omega-3 fatty acids, possessing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, have shown potent neuroprotective effects in several diseases. The present study investigated whether omega-3 fatty acids could exert a neuroprotective role against POD in aged mice. A mouse model of POD was established to explore the role of omega-3 fatty acids in laparotomy-induced delirium-like behavior by evaluating systemic inflammatory changes, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and behavior at different time points in aged mice. Oral gavage with omega-3 fatty acids (300 mg/kg) for 3 weeks before surgery significantly attenuated anesthesia/surgery-induced POD-like behavior and the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines from the peripheral blood in aged mice. Moreover, it also remarkably mitigated neuroinflammation and the oxidative stress response (malondialdehyde [MDA] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of surgical mice. Our findings provided evidence that pretreatment with omega-3 fatty acids may play a vital role in the treatment of POD through mechanisms involving its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be a promising prevention strategy for POD in aged patients.

AB  - Psilocybin, a naturally occurring, tryptamine alkaloid prodrug, is currently being investigated for the treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders. Preclinical reports suggest that the biological effects of psilocybin-containing mushroom extract or "full spectrum" (psychedelic) mushroom extract (PME), may differ from those of chemically synthesized psilocybin (PSIL). We compared the effects of PME to those of PSIL on the head twitch response (HTR), neuroplasticity-related synaptic proteins and frontal cortex metabolomic profiles in male C57Bl/6j mice. HTR measurement showed similar effects of PSIL and PME over 20 min. Brain specimens (frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum) were assayed for the synaptic proteins, GAP43, PSD95, synaptophysin and SV2A, using western blots. These proteins may serve as indicators of synaptic plasticity. Three days after treatment, there was minimal increase in synaptic proteins. After 11 days, PSIL and PME significantly increased GAP43 in the frontal cortex (p = 0.019; p = 0.039 respectively) and hippocampus (p = 0.015; p = 0.027) and synaptophysin in the hippocampus (p = 0.041; p = 0.05) and amygdala (p = 0.035; p = 0.004). PSIL increased SV2A in the amygdala (p = 0.036) and PME did so in the hippocampus (p = 0.014). In the striatum, synaptophysin was increased by PME only (p = 0.023). There were no significant effects of PSIL or PME on PSD95 in any brain area when these were analyzed separately. Nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant increase in each of the 4 proteins over all brain areas for PME versus vehicle control, while significant PSIL effects were observed only in the hippocampus and amygdala and were limited to PSD95 and SV2A. Metabolomic analyses of the pre-frontal cortex were performed by untargeted polar metabolomics utilizing capillary electrophoresis - Fourier transform mass spectrometry (CE-FTMS) and showed a differential metabolic separation between PME and vehicle groups. The purines guanosine, hypoxanthine and inosine, associated with oxidative stress and energy production pathways, showed a progressive decline from VEH to PSIL to PME. In conclusion, our synaptic protein findings suggest that PME has a more potent and prolonged effect on synaptic plasticity than PSIL. Our metabolomics data support a gradient of effects from inert vehicle via chemical psilocybin to PME further supporting differential effects. Further studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings and to identify the molecules that may be responsible for the enhanced effects of PME as compared to psilocybin alone.

AB  - Background/aims Vascular dementia (VD) results in cognition and memory deficit. Exosomes and their carried microRNAs (miRs) contribute to the neuroprotective effects of mesenchymal stromal cells, and miR-132-3p plays a key role in neuron plasticity. Here, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of MSC EX and their miR-132-3p cargo in rescuing cognition and memory deficit in VD mice. Methods Bilateral carotid artery occlusion was used to generate a VD mouse model. MiR-132-3p and MSC EX levels in the hippocampus and cortex were measured. At 24-h post-VD induction, mice were administered with MSC EX infected with control lentivirus (EXCon), pre-miR-132-3p-expressing lentivirus (EXmiR-132-3p), or miR-132-3p antago lentivirus (EXantagomiR-132-3p) intravenously. Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed, and the mice were killed in 21 days after VD. The effects of MSC EX on neuron number, synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine density, and A beta and p-Tau levels in the hippocampus and cortex were determined. The effects of MSC EX on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-injured neurons with respect to apoptosis, and neurite elongation and branching were determined. Finally, the expression levels of Ras, phosphorylation of Akt, GSK-3 beta, and Tau were also measured. Results Compared with normal mice, VD mice exhibited significantly decreased miR-132-3p and MSC EX levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Compared with EXCon treatment, the infusion of EXmiR-132-3p was more effective at improving cognitive function and increasing miR-132-3p level, neuron number, synaptic plasticity, and dendritic spine density, while decreasing A beta and p-Tau levels in the cortex and hippocampus of VD mice. Conversely, EXantagomiR-132-3p treatment significantly decreased miR-132-3p expression in cortex and hippocampus, as well as attenuated EXmiR-132-3p treatment-induced functional improvement. In vitro, EXmiR-132-3p treatment inhibited RASA1 protein expression, but increased Ras and the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 beta, and decreased p-Tau levels in primary neurons by delivering miR-132-3p, which resulted in reduced apoptosis, and increased neurite elongation and branching in OGD-injured neurons. Conclusions Our studies suggest that miR-132-3p cluster-enriched MSC EX promotes the recovery of cognitive function by improving neuronal and synaptic dysfunction through activation of the Ras/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway induced by downregulation of RASA1.

AB  - Poor nutritional quality in the early stages of development is associated with neurological diseases in adulthood. Studies showed that obesity-induced oxidative stress contributes to the genesis of neurological diseases through dysregulation of the brainstem and hypothalamus. Fluoxetine (Fx) is an antidepressant member in the family of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) that can induce positive effects by reducing oxidative damage in brain tissues. We aimed to evaluate the late effect of Fx in the brainstem and hypothalamus of overnourished rats during development. Male Wistar rats, after birth, were randomly divided into the normal-nourished group (N, n = 9) and the overnourished group (O, n = 3). On the 39th day of life, the groups were subdivided into normofed, and the overnourished group treated or not with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg daily) (NF, NV, OF, and OV). All groups were treated from the 39th to the 59th day of life, and within 90 days, the tissues were collected for oxidative stress analysis. Briefly, our results showed that Fx treatment induced a tissue-dependent long-lasting effect in overfed animals, increasing the enzymatic defense (i.e., CAT and GST activity) in the hypothalamus, but more intensive, increasing the non-enzymatic defense (i.e., Total Thiols and GSH levels) in the brainstem. Overall, our study suggests that serotonin modulation at the final stage of brain development causes a long-lasting impact on brain structures in overfed rats at a different mode.

AB  - Background: Gastrodiae Rhizoma (Tianma), the dried tuber of Gastrodia elata Bl. (Orchidaceae), is listed as a top-grade herbal medicine in Shen-nong Ben-ts'ao Jing and has been used for treating headaches, dizziness, vertigo and convulsion. It has a neuroprotective effect and extends the lifespan in mouse models of Huntington's disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease. However, its effect on senescence remains unknown.
   Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the anti-aging effects and the underlying mechanism of Gastrodiae Rhizoma.
   Methods: D-galactose (D-gal)- and BeSO4-induced cellular senescence and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity were evaluated in SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells. D-gal-induced aging mice were used as an in vivo model. Animal behaviors including nesting and burrowing and Morris water maze were conducted. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus was assessed by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, and the aging-related proteins were assessed by Western blot analysis. The potential neuritogenesis activity of the partially purified fraction of Gastrodiae Rhizoma (TM-2) and its major ingredients were investigated in PC12 cells.
   Results: TM-2 could improve D-gal-induced learning and memory impairement by inhibiting oxidative stress, increasing hippocampal neurogenesis and regulating the SH2B1-Akt pathway. Moreover, N6-(4-hydroxybenzyl) adenine riboside (T1-11) and parishins A and B, three constituents of TM-2, had anti-aging activity, as did T1-11 and parishin A induced neuritogenesis.
   Conclusion: Our data suggested that TM-2 slowed down D-gal-induced cellular and mouse brain aging. These results indicate that Gastrodiae Rhizoma has a beneficial effect on senescence. It may be used for neuroprotection and promoting neurogenesis.

AB  - The objective was to compare effects of encapsulated or free glutathione (GSH) on the quality of frozen-thawed bull sperm. Ejaculates were collected via artificial vagina from six mature Holstein bulls once weekly for 6 weeks. All ejaculates had motility >= 70%, sperm concentration >= 1.0 x 10(9)/ml and <= 15% morphologically abnormal sperm. Each week, semen was pooled and diluted with lecithin-based extenders containing various concentrations of encapsulated (E0, E1, E2.5 and E5 mM) or free (F0, F1, F2.5 and F5 mM) GSH, with total glutathione content determined before and after cryopreservation. Total GSH in fresh semen was (mean+SEM) 4.8 +/- 0.2 nmol/10(8) sperm, whereas in frozen-thawed semen of group F0 (control), it decreased to 1.4 +/- 0.2 nmol/10(8) s perm, a 7 0.8% r eduction (p<.05). In addition, total GSH in frozen-thawed semen from groups E2.5, E5 and F5 were 2.4 +/- 0.2, 2.8 +/- 0.2 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 nmol/10(8) sperm, respectively (E5 versus. F0, p<.05). Compared to group F0, frozen-thawed sperm from group E2.5 had greater (p<.05) percentages of sperm that were viable (Annexin-V) (61.1 +/- 1.8 versus. 71.1 +/- 1.8) and that had cell membrane integrity (eosin-nigrosin) (64.5 +/- 3.1 versus. 80.0 +/- 3.1). Furthermore, frozen-thawed sperm from group E2.5 had the numerically highest total and progressive motility (CASA) and cell membrane functionality (HOS) and the lowest percentage of early apoptotic sperm (Annexin-V). However, acrosome membrane integrity (PSA) of E5 had the lowest mean (p<.05), whereas E2.5 caused a small nonsignificant decrease (69.1 +/- 1.4%) compared to E0 and F0. In conclusion, 2.5 mM encapsulated GSH in semen extender significantly improved the quality of frozen-thawed bull sperm.

AB  - The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3(25b+). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype. Together, this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3(25b+)-dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Thus, our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Plant-derived compounds, including isothiocyanates (ITCs), represent important sources of chemo-preventive and anticancer agents. ITCs naturally originate from glucosinolates (GLSs), the major phytochemicals in the plant family of Brassicaceae, a widely cultivated and economically important plant family. In this study, the wellknown sulforaphane ITC (SFN) was compared with the ITC derived from the 10-(methylsulfinyl) decylglucosinolate, the most abundant GLS of Camelina sativa. In the experimental condition tested, SFN inhibits the viability of the lung cancer A549 cell line in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Under the same experimental conditions, camelina ITC showed a higher selective cytotoxic activity compared to SFN, as well as higher in vitro antioxidant activity, highlighting it as a promising plant-derived molecule with protective effects against carcinogenesis.

AB  - The recombinant B6.CBA-D13Mit76C mouse strain is characterized by an altered sensitivity of 5-HT1A receptors and upregulated 5-HT1A gene transcription. Recently, we found that in B6.CBA-D13Mit76C mice, chronic fluoxetine treatment produced the pro-depressive effect in a forced swim test. Since 5-HT2A receptor blockade may be beneficial in treatment-resistant depression, we investigated the influence of chronic treatment (14 days, intraperitoneally) with selective 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (0.5 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg), or fluoxetine + ketanserin on the behavior, functional activity of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, serotonin turnover, and transcription of principal genes of the serotonin system in the brain of B6.CBA-D13Mit76C mice. Ketanserin did not reverse the pro-depressive effect of fluoxetine, while fluoxetine, ketanserin, and fluoxetine + ketanserin decreased the functional activity of 5-HT1A receptors and Htr1a gene transcription in the midbrain and hippocampus. All tested drug regimens decreased the mRNA levels of Slc6a4 and Maoa in the midbrain. These changes were not accompanied by a significant shift in the levels of serotonin and its metabolite 5-HIAA. Notably, ketanserin upregulated enzymatic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2). Thus, despite some benefits (reduced Htr1a, Slc6a4, and Maoa transcription and increased TPH2 activity), prolonged blockade of 5-HT2A receptors failed to ameliorate the adverse effect of fluoxetine in the case of abnormal functioning of 5-HT1A receptors.

AB  - Breast regression protein 39 (BRP39) is a 39 kDa protein that is a member of chitolectin class of glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (GH18). High expression levels of BRP39 have been detected in breast carcinoma. It helps in proliferation of cells during the progression of this disease and may act as a signaling factor. BRP39 may act as a potential candidate for rational structure-based drug design against breast carcinoma. In this study, we report the crystal structure of mouse recombinant BRP39 expressed in E. coli. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 2.6 angstrom resolution. The overall structure of BRP39 consisted of two globular domains: a large (beta/alpha)8 triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain and a small (alpha + beta) domain. Three non-proline cispeptides were detected in the sugar-binding cleft of BRP39, including Ser57-Phe58, Leu141-Tyr142, and Trp353Ala354. The latter residues were conserved in other GH18 family members. It was notable that the conformation of critical Trp100 residue within the sugar-binding cleft was oriented away from the barrel. The side-chain conformation was found to be similar to that observed in chitinases, however, it was oriented into the barrel in other chitinase-like proteins (CLPs). The conformation of this critical residue may have significant implications in sugar binding. Further, two amino acid substitutions were observed in the sugar-binding groove of BRP39. The conserved Asn100 and Arg263 in Hcgp39 and other CLPs proteins (SPX-40 structures) were substituted by Lys101 and Lys264 in BRP39 which may have a significant impact on the sugar-binding properties.

AB  - Herein, we aim to investigate the effect of Alpinae Oxyphyllae Fructus (AOF) on cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced models of AD. Mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with LPS, and then administrated AOF using a gavage for 6 weeks. Spatial working memory was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water maze test, whereas the levels of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, p-GSK3 beta, GSK3 beta, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were evaluated using western blot and ELISA assay. Our data showed that AOF was able to significantly alleviate the memory decline in LPS-induced AD mice. Moreover, AOF was able to protect neurons through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and significantly decrease NF-kappa B, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampal and cortex tissues, which were reversed through the use of LY294002. Additionally, we discovered that AOF could significantly decrease the high expression of cytokines as well as the expression and translocation of NF-kappa B induced by LPS in PC12 cells. These results demonstrate the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of AOF in both cell and animal models of AD, thereby slowing down the process and development of the disease.

AB  - Soft tissue growth is crucial across various physiological applications, with mathematical modelling playing a pivotal role in understanding the underlying processes. The volumetric growth theory serves as a commonly used mathematical framework in this context. Our previous research on volumetric growth theory primarily concentrated on defining the incremental growth tensor in loaded and stressed configurations, revealing that this approach closely aligns with experimental observations of residual hoop stress distribution. However, given the assumptions employed, the approach has limitations in accurately predicting the growth timeline. In this work, we address these issues by incorporating the effect of initial residual strain and introducing a new mixed trigger growth evolution law. In this growth law, we do not use growth saturation as an upper limit, as this assumption cannot represent many physiological conditions. Instead, we propose that growth in soft tissues leads to a new equilibrium state. To illustrate this idea, we introduce a growth incompatibility function, denoted as I . We establish the analytical relationship between I and the opening angle in a simplified cylindrical geometry resembling the structure of the heart or arteries. We put forth a revised growth law that is both stress and incompatibility driven/Our results show that by using this mixed trigger growth law, tissues will not grow indefinitely. Instead, a stress-driven homeostasis incompatibility state will be reached. In addition, by accounting for the initial opening angle in the model, we can accurately trace the growth history of the heart, aligning with experimental data obtained from measuring the opening angle in young pigs from birth to maturity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Treating cognitive impairment is a challenging and necessary research topic. ZeXieYin Formula (ZXYF), is a traditional herbal formula documented in the book of HuangDiNeiJing. Our previous studies demonstrated the ameliorative effects of ZXYF on atherosclerosis by reducing the plasma trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) level. TMAO is a metabolite of gut microorganisms, our recent research found that the increasing level of TMAO may have adverse effects on cognitive functions. Aim of the study: Our study mainly focused on the therapeutic effects of ZXYF on TMAO-induced cognitive impairment in mice and explored its underlying mechanism. Materials and methods: After the TMAO-induced cognitive impairment mice models were established, we applied behavioral tests to estimate the learning and memory ability of the ZXYF intervention mice. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the TMAO levels in plasma and the brain. The effects of ZXYF on the hippocampal synaptic structure and the neurons were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Nissl staining. In addition, western-blotting (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were used to detect the level of related proteins in the synaptic structure and further verify the changes in synaptic plasticity and the mTOR pathway after ZXYF administration. Results: Behavioral tests showed that the learning and memory ability of mice impaired after a period of TMAO intervention and ZXYF could alleviate these changes. A series of results showed that ZXYF partly restored the damage of hippocampal synapse and neurons in TMAO-induced mice, at the same time, the expression of synapse-related proteins and mTOR pathway-related proteins were significantly regulated compared with the damage caused by TMAO. Conclusion: ZXYF could alleviate TMAO-induced cognitive impairment by improving synaptic function, reducing neuronal damage, regulating synapse-associated proteins, and regulating the mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common brain lesion associated with severe sepsis, for which ferroptosis is a key driving factor. Thus, suppressing ferroptosis may be an effective strategy for treating SAE. Quercetin (QUE) is a natural flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its role on ferroptosis in SAE remains unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of QUE on cecal ligation perforation (CLP)-induced SAE. Methods: In vivo and in vitro SAE models were established using CLP and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. Both models underwent pre-treatment with QUE. Results: QUE attenuated CLP-induced symptoms, including temperature changes, neurological severity scores, learning and memory dysfunction, inflammatory cytokine release, and microglia activation in SAE mice, and inhibited LPS-induced microglia recruitment and chemotaxis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) axis may play a key role in QUE-mediated protection against SAE. Moreover, QUE significantly inhibited LPS-induced CXCL2 up-regulation and protein secretion from microglia. Recombinant mouse-derived CXCL2 (rmCXCL2) promoted inflammatory cytokine secretion, NF-kappa B/NLRP3 signaling activation, and microglia recruitment and chemotaxis. Furthermore, rmCXCL2 induced ferroptosis in mouse hippocampal neurons, as evidenced by elevated malondialdehyde levels, decreased glutathione levels, excessive iron uptake, and altered ferroptosis-related protein expression. The CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 effectively reversed the effects of rmCXCL2. Importantly, in vivo experiments further demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of QUE on SAE was inhibited by rmCXCL2. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that CXCL2 secreted by activated microglia mediates microglia self-activation and induces hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis via CXCR2 and that QUE exerts neuroprotective effects on SAE by blocking interactions between microglia and neurons via CXCL2/CXCR2 pathway inhibition.

AB  - Zirconia ceramic (ZC) implants are becoming more common, but comparisons between preclinical histology and long-term clinical trials are rare. This investigation comprised (1) 8-year clinical follow-up of one-piece ZC or titanium (Ti) implants supporting full overdentures and (2) histomorphometric analysis of the same implants in an animal model, comparing implants with various surface treatments. Methods: (1) Clinical trial: 24 completely edentulous participants (2 groups of N = 12) received 7 implants (one-piece ball-abutment ZC or Ti; maxilla N = 4, mandible N = 3) restored with implant overdentures. Outcomes after 8-years included survival, peri-implant bone levels, soft-tissue responses, and prosthodontic issues. (2) Preclinical trial: 10 New Zealand sheep received 4 implants bilaterally in the femoral condyle: Southern Implants ZC or Ti one-piece implants, identical to the clinical trial, and controls: Southern ITC (R) two-piece implants with the same surface or Nobel (NBC) anodised (TiUnite (TM)) surface. %Bone-implant contact (%BIC) was measured after 12 weeks of unloaded healing. Results: 8 of 24 participants (33%) of an average age of 75 +/- 8 years were recalled; 21% of original participants had died, and 46% could not be contacted. 80.4% of implants survived; excluding palatal sites, 87.5% of Ti and 79% of ZC implants survived. All failed implants were in the maxilla. Three ZC implants had fractured. Bone loss was similar for Ti vs. ZC; pocket depths (p = 0.04) and attachment levels (p = 0.02) were greater for Ti than ZC implants. (1.7 +/- 1.6 mm vs. 1.6 +/- 1.3 mm). All implants in sheep femurs survived. %BIC was not statistically different for one-piece blasted surface Ti (80 +/- 19%) versus ZC (76 +/- 20%) or ITC (R) (75 +/- 16 mm); NBC had significantly higher %BIC than ITC (84 +/- 17%, p = 0.4). Conclusion: Short-term preclinical results for ZC and Ti one-piece implants showed excellent bone-implant contact in unloaded femoral sites. This differed from the long-term clinical results in older-aged, edentulous participants. While ZC and Ti implants showed equivalent performance, the risks of peri-implantitis and implant loss in older, completely edentulous patients remain a significant factor.

AB  - Background: Specialised anti-herbivory metabolites are abundant in the solanaceous genus Nicotiana. These metabolites include the large family of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (HGL-DTGs). Many HGL-DTGs occur exclusively within the Nicotiana genus, but information from the molecular model species N. tabacum, N. benthamiana, and the tree tobacco N. glauca is limited. Objectives: We studied HGL-DTG occurrence and complexity in these species with the aim of providing in-depth reference annotations and comprehensive HGL-DTG inventories. Methods: We analysed polar metabolite extracts in comparison to the previously investigated wild reference species N. attenuata using positive ESI(+) and negative ESI(-) mode electrospray ionisation LC-MS and MS/MS. Results: We provide annotations of 66 HGL-DTGs with in-source and MS/MS fragmentation spectra for selected HGL-DTGs with exemplary fragment interpretations of ESI(+) as well as less studied ESI(-) spectra. We assemble a potential biosynthesis pathway comparing the presence of HGL-DTGs in N. tabacum, N. glauca, and N. benthamiana to N. attenuata. Approximately one-third of HGL-DTGs are chromatographically resolved isomers of hexose, deoxyhexose, or malonate conjugates. The number of isomers is especially high for conjugates with low numbers of deoxyhexose moieties. Conclusions: We extend the number of known HGL-DTGs with a focus on Nicotiana model species and demonstrate that the HGL-DTG family of N. tabacum plants can be surprisingly complex. Our study provides an improved basis with detailed references to previous studies of wild Nicotiana species and enables inference of HGL-DTG pathways with required enzymes for the biosynthesis of this important family of specialised defence metabolites.

AB  - BackgroundHippocampal damage caused by status epilepticus (SE) can bring about cognitive decline and emotional disorders, which are common clinical comorbidities in patients with epilepsy. It is therefore imperative to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for protecting hippocampal damage after SE. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of contributing factors in epilepsy. Given the therapeutic benefits of mitochondrial replenishment by exogenous mitochondria, we hypothesized that transplantation of mitochondria would be capable of ameliorating hippocampal damage following SE. MethodsPilocarpine was used to induced SE in mice. SE-generated cognitive decline and emotional disorders were determined using novel object recognition, the tail suspension test, and the open field test. SE-induced hippocampal pathology was assessed by quantifying loss of neurons and activation of microglia and astrocytes. The metabolites underlying mitochondrial transplantation were determined using metabonomics. ResultsThe results showed that peripheral administration of isolated mitochondria could improve cognitive deficits and depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. Exogenous mitochondria blunted the production of reactive oxygen species, proliferation of microglia and astrocytes, and loss of neurons in the hippocampus. The metabonomic profiles showed that mitochondrial transplantation altered multiple metabolic pathways such as sphingolipid signaling pathway and carbon metabolism. Among potential affected metabolites, mitochondrial transplantation decreased levels of sphingolipid (d18:1/18:0) and methylmalonic acid, and elevated levels of D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, these findings provide the first direct experimental evidence that artificial mitochondrial transplantation is capable of ameliorating hippocampal damage following SE. These new findings support mitochondrial transplantation as a promising therapeutic strategy for epilepsy-associated psychiatric and cognitive disorders.

AB  - Mitochondria are organelles of bacterial origin historically identified as the cell power plant. In addition to energy, mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species and they have been found to have a key role in cell defense regulation, cell stress and damage. All the investigations regarding the nature of the molecules mediating these processes include compounds from mammalian cell metabolism. We hypothesize that the bacterial origin of mitochondria brings them to produce small fermentation products when cell is subjected to stress. In this work we studied the effect of hyperglycemia on the metabolome of hippocampal HN9.10e neurons, an in vitro model of one of the most vulnerable regions of central nervous system. Targeted metabolites were analyzed in the cell culture medium by liquid chromatography - diode array detection and headspace - gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Twenty-two low molecular weight metabolites were identified and quantified in the growth medium of the cells, treated with 25, 50 or 75 mM glucose, sampled along 8 days to mimic a prolonged hyperglycemia. The results of statistical analysis showed the clear impairment of neuronal metabolism already after 48 h, represented by a significant reduction of the metabolic activity, together with the production of typical fermentative compounds.

AB  - Simple Summary The total replacement of fish oil (FO) with camelina oil (CO) in the diets of juvenile tench (Tinca tinca L.) did not have negative effects on survival rates or growth performance. When juveniles were fed with diets containing levels of CO of 40% or higher, lipid content in whole-body tench was significantly lower than those fed the control diet whereas linolenic acid content was significantly higher. No differences in total saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in whole-body juveniles. The nutritional indices were within optimal values for healthy foods for human consumption. Tench (Tinca tinca L.) plays a key role in the diversification of inland aquaculture, but its culture is mainly based on extensive culture systems with usually low and unpredictable yields. Rearing procedures under controlled conditions are essential to promote and consolidate tench production, and it is necessary to set up adequate feeding in early growth phases. Fish oil (FO) is currently the main source of lipids in aquafeeds, but considering the stagnation of smaller pelagic fisheries, alternative oils should be addressed. In a ninety-day experiment, the effects of partial and total replacement of FO with camelina oil (CO) on juvenile tench growth performance and whole-body composition were evaluated. Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets with different levels of CO were tested: 0% (control), 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%. The survival rate was 100%, and no significant differences in growth performance (total length, weight, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, and biomass gain) were found. The lipid content in whole-body juveniles was significantly lower when juveniles were fed diets containing 40% and higher levels of CO than those fed the control diet whereas linolenic acid content was significantly higher. No differences in sigma SFA, sigma MUFA, sigma PUFA, sigma n - 3, or sigma n - 6 whole-body content were found. The nutritional indices sigma PUFA/sigma SFA and sigma n - 6/sigma n - 3 showed a linear increase trend with dietary CO inclusion whereas the EPA + DHA showed an opposite tendency. Compared to the control diet, EPA + DHA content (g kg(-1)) was significantly lower in juvenile tench fed a 100% CO diet, and sigma n - 6/sigma n - 3 was significantly higher in juvenile tench fed 80% and 100% CO diets. Overall, the results indicate that the total replacement of FO with CO in diets is feasible without negative effects on growth performance whereas the nutritional quality of juvenile tench was unaffected with a maximum replacement of 80%.

AB  - Vigorous research confirmed the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidementia effects of apigenin (Api). The present study evaluated the beneficial impacts of Api administration on , brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), oxidative stress, and inflammation induced by social isolation (SI) stress in rats. For this purpose, rats underwent a 28-day SI period followed by a 4-week oral Api treatment (50 mg/kg/day, PO). On Day 56, behaviour tests were performed, including an elevated plus maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM), and three-chamber social tests. The oxidative stress markers, IL-6, and BDNF levels were measured in the hippocampus. Our results showed that SI stress caused an increase in anxiety and a decrease in spatial memory, sociability, and social preference index. In addition, SI stress increased hippocampal levels of IL-6 and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, whereas it reduced the hippocampal BDNF level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Our study indicated that Api attenuates anxiety and causes improvements in spatial memory and social interaction. These desirable effects of Api might be related to amelioration in the BDNF level, IL-6, and oxidative stress biomarkers in the hippocampus.
   This study demonstrated that social isolation was associated with increased levels of anxiety, impaired spatial memory, and reduced social interaction. Api was effective in attenuating these adverse behavioural effects. Moreover, Api significantly mitigated oxidative stress and inflammation, while simultaneously elevating BDNF levels in the hippocampus.image

AB  - Herbivores rarely consume toxic plants. An increase in the proportion of toxic plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) in poisonous plants can promote detoxification and related metabolic capacity of animals. Poisonous plants with thick taproots like Stellera chamaejasme (SC) are important stored food for the plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) during the winter and promote the development of detoxification mechanisms in this animal. In this study, plateau zokors were administered gavages of 0.2, 1.05, and 2.10 ml/kg SC water extracts. Serum samples were collected from plateau zokors to measure the levels of transaminases and oxidative stress. Transcriptome analysis was conducted to evaluate the differential genes of multiple metabolic pathways to investigate the relationship between the physiological processes and metabolic adaptation capacity of these animals in response to SC. After SC administration, plateau zokors showed significant hepatic granular degeneration and inflammatory reactions in the liver and aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and malondialdehyde levels increased in a dose-dependent manner. Further, differential expression was also found in the plateau zokor livers, with most enrichment in inflammation and detoxification metabolism pathways. The metabolic adaptation responses in P450 xenobiotic clearance, bile secretion, and pancreatic secretion (Gusb, Hmgcr, Gstm1, Gstp1, and Eobag004630005095) were verified by mRNA network analysis as key factors related to the mechanism. Plateau zokors respond to SC PSMs through changes in liver physiology, biochemistry, and genes in multiple metabolic pathways, validating our hypothesis that plateau zokors can metabolize PSMs when they ingest toxic plants.

AB  - Associative memory is a type of hippocampal-dependent episodic memory that declines with age. Studies have examined the neural substrates underlying associative memory and considered the hippocampus holistically; however, the association between associative memory decline and volumetric change in hippocampal subfields in the context of normal aging remains uncharacterized. Leveraging the distinct linguistic features of Chinese characters to evaluate distinct types of false recognition, we investigated age-related differences in associative recognition and hippocampal subfield volumes, as well as the relationship between behavioral performance and hippocampal morphometry in 25 younger adults and 32 older adults. The results showed an age-related associative memory deficit, which was exacerbated after a 30-min delay. Older adults showed higher susceptibility to false alarm errors with recombined and orthographically related foils compared to phonologically or semantically related ones. Moreover, we detected a disproportionately age-related, time-dependent increase in orthographic errors. Older adults exhibited smaller volumes in all hippocampal subfields when compared to younger adults, with a less pronounced effect observed in the CA2/3 subfield. Group-collapsed correlational analyses revealed associations between specific hippocampal subfields and associative memory but not item memory. Additionally, multi-subfield regions had prominent associations with delayed recognition. These findings underscore the significance of multiple hippocampal subfields in various hippocampal-dependent processes including associative memory, recollection-based retrieval, and pattern separation ability. Moreover, our observations of age-related difficulty in differentiating perceptually similar foils from targets provide a unique opportunity for examining the essential contribution of individual hippocampal subfields to the pattern separation process in mnemonic recognition.

AB  - BackgroundSOUL-tang has been clinically used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) in South Korea, but its scientific efficacy remains unclear. Clarifying its neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms is essential for evaluating its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of SOUL-tang and its active component, isoacteoside (ISO), in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and an animal model using the forced swimming test (FST).ResultsSOUL-tang and ISO protected SH-SY5Y cells from amyloid-beta (A beta)-induced damage by preventing cell death and reducing lactate dehydrogenase and inflammatory cytokine levels. In the FST, they reduced immobility time and decreased AD-inducing factors (A beta and total tau proteins) while increasing neuroprotective factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein) in the hippocampus. Additionally, SOUL-tang and ISO alleviated oxidative stress by enhancing superoxide dismutase activity and reducing malondialdehyde levels. They also modulated inflammatory responses by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hippocampal neurotransmitter levels were significantly improved without inducing adverse effects.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that SOUL-tang exhibits neuroprotective effects by attenuating harmful substances associated with AD. Therefore, SOUL-tang may be a promising therapeutic candidate for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, with potential translational value for clinical application.

AB  - Plants of the Asteraceae family are broadly used against microorganisms pathogenic to people and animals, although their potential has not been studied completely so far. In an in vitro experiment, we tested ethanolic, ethyl-ether, and dimethyl-sulfoxide extracts from the fruits, leaves, shoots, and roots of Xanthium strumarium L. for their effects on 13 species of bacteria and larvae of 3 species of nematodes. Over-8-mm-wide growth-inhibition zones of the colonies around disks saturated with ethanolic extracts from the fruits were observed for 11 bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumonia ssp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniassp. ozaenae, K. aerogenes, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis. Ethanol extract from the leaves inhibited growth of the colonies of 10 bacteria: E. cloacae, K. pneumonia ssp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniassp. ozaenae, S. enterica, E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, E. faecalis, E. faecium, S. aureus, and B. subtilis. Ethanol extract from the stem inhibited growth of the colonies of only 6 bacteria: K. aerogenes, E. cloacae, P. vulgaris, E. faecium, S. aureus, and B. subtilis. Ethanol extract from the root inhibited growth of 10 bacteria: E. cloacae, K. pneumonia ssp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniassp. ozaenae, K. aerogenes, S. enterica, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus. We analyzed the effects of extracts based on ethyl ether and dimethyl sulfoxide, finding no antiparasitic activity or expressed anthelmintic properties of various extracts from the fruits, leaves, stem, and roots of X. strumarium against larvae of the nematodes Strongyloides papillosus, Haemonchus contortus, and Muell e-rius capillaris.

AB  - The heartbeat is initiated by pacemaker cells residing in the sinoatrial node (SAN). SAN cells generate spontaneous action potentials (APs), i.e., normal automaticity. The sympathetic nervous system increases the heart rate commensurate with the cardiac output demand via stimulation of SAN beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR). While SAN cells reportedly represent a highly heterogeneous cell population, the current dogma is that, in response to beta AR stimulation, all cells increase their spontaneous AP firing rate in a similar fashion. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cell-to-cell variability in the responses of a large population of SAN cells. We measured the beta AR responses among 166 single SAN cells isolated from 33 guinea pig hearts. In contrast to the current dogma, the SAN cell responses to beta AR stimulation substantially varied. In each cell, changes in the AP cycle length were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.97) with the AP cycle length before beta AR stimulation. While, as expected, on average, the cells increased their pacemaker rate, greater responses were observed in cells with slower basal rates, and vice versa: cells with higher basal rates showed smaller responses, no responses, or even decreased their rate. Thus, beta AR stimulation synchronized the operation of the SAN cell population toward a higher average rate, rather than uniformly shifting the rate in each cell, creating a new paradigm of beta AR-driven fight-or-flight responses among individual pacemaker cells.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tea (Camellia sinensis) has been consumed for centuries as traditional medicine for various diseases, including diabetes. The mechanism of action of many traditional medicines, including tea, often requires elucidation. Purple tea is a natural mutant of Camellia sinensis, grown in China and Kenya, and is rich in anthocyanins and ellagitannins.Aim of the study: Here we aimed to determine whether commercial green and purple teas are a source of ellagitannins and whether green and purple teas, purple tea ellagitannins and their metabolites urolithins have antidiabetic activity.Materials and methods: Targeted UPLC-MS/MS was employed to quantify the ellagitannins corilagin, strictinin and tellimagrandin I, in commercial teas. The inhibitory effect of commercial green and purple teas and purple tea ellagitannins was evaluated on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. The bioavailable urolithins were then investigated for additional antidiabetic effects, by evaluating their effect on cellular glucose uptake and lipid accumulation. Results: Corilagin, strictinin and tellimagrandin I (ellagitannins) were identified as potent inhibitors of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, with Ki values significantly lower (p < 0.05) than acarbose. Commercial green-purple teas were identified as ellagitannin sources, with especially high concentrations of corilagin. These commercial purple teas, containing ellagitannins, were identified as potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with IC50 values significantly lower (p < 0.05) than green teas and acarbose. Urolithin A and urolithin B were as effective (p> 0.05) as metformin in increasing glucose uptake in adipocytes, muscle cells and hepatocytes. In addition, similar (p > 0.05) to metformin, both urolithin A and urolithin B reduced lipid accumulation in adipocytes and hepatocytes.Conclusions: This study identified green-purple teas as an affordable widely available natural source with antidiabetic properties. Furthermore, additional antidiabetic effects of purple tea ellagitannins (corilagin, strictinin and tellimagrandin I) and urolithins were identified.

AB  - The potency of human and veterinary rabies vaccines is measured based on the National Institute of Health (NIH) potency test that is laborious, time-consuming, variable, and requires sacrifice of large numbers of mice. ELISAbased methods quantifying rabies glycoprotein (rGP) are being developed as potential alternatives to the NIH potency test for release of rabies vaccines. The aim of the current study was focused on the evaluation of in vitro -and in vivo -based assays in order to assess their concurrence for adequate and reliable assessment of immunogenicity and protective potency of a plant-derived recombinant rGP. The recombinant rGP of strain ERA.KK was engineered, expressed and purified from Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The recombinant rGP excluded the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains. It was purified by chromatography (>= 90%) from the plant biomass, characterized, and mainly presented as high molecular weight forms, most likely soluble aggregates, of the rGP ectodomain. It was well-recognized and quantified by an ELISA, which utilizes two mouse monoclonal antibodies, D1-25 and 1112-1, and which should only recognize the native trimeric form of the rGP. However, in mice, the recombinant rGP did not induce the production of anti-rabies virus neutralizing antibodies and did not confer protection after intracerebral viral challenge. Similar immunogenicity was observed in guinea pigs and rabbits. Our results demonstrate that use of the ELISA method described here is not predictive of performance in vivo. These data highlight the critical need to develop in vitro potency assays that reliably define the antigen content that can induce a protective response.

AB  - Magnesium (Mg) is crucial in numerous physiological functions, including neuromuscular activity, energy metabolism, and cognitive processes. Despite its significance, the bioavailability and functional impact of different Mg formulations remain underexplored. This study investigates the long-term effects of chronic organic Mg supplementation (citrate, glycinate, malate) on tissue-specific Mg distribution and functional outcomes in rats. Thirty-eight adult Sprague Dawley rats were allocated into control and Mg-supplemented groups, receiving 35.4 mg/kg/day of elemental Mg for 8 weeks. Cognitive and behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate learning, memory, and anxiety-like behavior, including the Morris water maze, open-field test, and elevated plus maze. Neuromuscular function was assessed via the grip strength and rotarod performance tests. Biochemical analyses of brain regions, skeletal muscle, and vascular tissue were performed to determine Mg levels, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and corticosterone concentrations. Results demonstrated that Mg-malate supplementation significantly increased Mg levels in skeletal muscle and whole-brain tissue, correlating with enhanced neuromuscular performance. Mg-citrate selectively elevated hippocampal BDNF levels, improving spatial learning and memory, while Mg-glycinate exhibited anxiolytic properties by reducing thigmotaxis behavior. Interestingly, despite increased aortic Mg levels, vascular relaxation responses were diminished in Mg-malate and Mg-citrate groups, suggesting a complex interplay between Mg accumulation and vascular reactivity. These findings highlight the formulation-dependent bioavailability and functional effects of Mg, emphasizing the necessity of targeted supplementation strategies for neurological, muscular, and cardiovascular health. Further clinical studies are warranted to validate these effects in human populations.

AB  - In this study, taxonomic classification of intestinal microbiota from healthy Barbour's seahorses (Hippocampus barbouri) was determined as it plays an important role in host nutrition and immunity. Genomic DNA was extracted from the intestinal mucus samples of eleven Barbour's seahorses, which were subjected to high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes targeting V3-V4 regions. The results showed that there were 302,891 amplicon sequence reads representing all samples, with 46 total operational taxonomic units (OTU). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were the most predominant phyla observed, with 13 classes, 22 orders, 28 families, and 35 genera, respectively. The results also revealed that the most abundant OTUs were affiliated with the genus Shewanella. Findings in this study may shed light on further studies in exploring the potential implications of intestinal microbiota to seahorses in terms of health status, development, growth, and survival. This could also be used as baseline data for preliminary screening of bacterial species as potential probiotics.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that N-acyl dopamines (N-ADA and N-DDA) protect the neural cells of healthy donors and patients with Parkinson's disease from OS. In this study, we assessed the effects of N-acyl dopamines on the expression of neurotrophic factors in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal cultures enriched with dopaminergic neurons under conditions of OS induced by hydrogen peroxide. We showed that hydrogen peroxide treatment increased BDNF but not GDNF mRNA levels, while it did not affect the secretion of corresponding proteins into the culture medium of these cells. Application of N-acyl dopamines promoted BDNF release into the culture medium. Under conditions of OS, N-DDA also increased TRKB, TRKC and RET mRNA levels. Furthermore, N-acyl dopamines prevented cell death 24 h after OS induction and promoted the expression of antioxidant enzymes GPX1, GPX7, SOD1, SOD2 and CAT, as well as reduced the BAX/BCL2 mRNA ratio. These findings indicate that stimulation of the expression of neurotrophic factors and their receptors may underlie the neuroprotective effects of N-acyl dopamines in human neurons.

AB  - The present study was conducted to determine the effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA(B)) receptor positive allosteric modulator BHF177 on refractory epilepsy (RE). An RE rat model was initially established via treatment with lithium-pilocarpine. The RE rats were then treated with BHF177 or the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP46381, followed by recording of their seizure rate and assessment of their spatial learning in the Morris water maze test. Treatment of BHF177 reduced the seizure intensity, whereas this effect was revered upoj treatment with CGP46381. Immunohistochemistry revealed that BHF177 treatment diminished P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in the hippocampal tissues of RE rats. Next, we found that BHF177 activated GABA(B) receptor, resulting in upregulated expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and PI3K, as well as antiapoptotic factors (Bcl-2 and mTOR), along with suppression of the apoptosis factors Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampal tissues. Further, activation of GABA(B) receptors by BHF177 alleviated the inflammatory response in hippocampal tissues of RE rats, as evidenced by reduced VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. Next, we treated primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons with BHF177 and the IRS-1 selective inhibitor NT157. BHF177 inhibited hippocampal apoptosis in rat hippocampal neurons by regulating the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt axis through crosstalk between GABA(B) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors. Collectively, our findings indicate that the BHF177 inhibited neuron apoptosis, thus protecting against RE through the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt axis, which may present a new therapeutic channel for RE.

AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 is the most common cause of diarrhea in neonatal and postweaning pigs. After adhering to small intestinal epithelial cells via glycoprotein receptor recognition, the pathogen can produce enterotoxins, impair intestinal integrity, trigger watery diarrhea, and induce inflammation via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MAPK) pathways. Inhibiting ETEC K88 adhesion to cell surfaces by interfering with the receptor-fimbriae recognition provides a promising strategy to prevent the initiation and progression of infection. Ovomucin is a highly glycosylated protein in chicken egg white with diverse bioactivities. Ovomucin hydrolysates prepared by the enzymes Protex 26L (OP) and pepsin/pancreatin (OPP) were previously revealed to prevent adhesion of ETEC K88 to IPEC-J2 cells. Herein, we investigated the protective effects of ovomucin hydrolysates on ETEC K88-induced barrier integrity damage and inflammation in IPEC-J2 and Caco-2 cells. Both hydrolysates inhibited ETEC K88 adhesion to cells and protected epithelial cell integrity by restoring transepithelial electronic resistance (TEER) values. Removing sialic acids in the hydrolysates reduced their antiadhesive capacities. Ovomucin hydrolysates suppressed ETEC-induced activation of NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways in both cell lines. The ability of ETEC K88 in activating calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK II), elevating intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and inducing oxidative stress was attenuated by both hydrolysates. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential of ovomucin hydrolysates to prevent ETEC K88 adhesion and alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells.

AB  - The effect of the synthetic analogue of leu-enkephalin (dalargin) on the level of corticosterone in the blood and the mass of the adrenal glands in rats with various typological features of behavior in the model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was studied. Groups were formed: active low-anxiety (ALA) and high-anxiety (AHA), as well as passive low-anxiety (PLA) and high-anxiety (PHA) rats. Each of the four groups of rats was divided into three subgroups, where subgroup 1 is an intact control. Twenty days after the first stressful exposure, rats from subgroup 3 were injected intramuscularly with dalargin for seven days, and rats from subgroup 2 were injected with saline solution. It was found that the course of injections of dalargin into rats in the PTSD model had a positive effect on the studied indicators only in the group of active high-anxiety animals.

AB  - Heat stress is an important influence on the male reproductive organs. Therefore, the effects of heat stress on genes or pathways related to the reproductive system of male mice were experimentally explored in this paper to further determine the effects of heat stimulation on mammals. Herein, models of heat-exposed mouse testicular tissue and heat - excited cells were successfully established. Many scorched vesicles were found after heat excitation of testis supporting cells, testicular mesenchymal (TM4) cells. Western blot, in situ terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP Nick end labeling (TUNEL) and transmission electron microscopy showed that membrane rupture, mitochondrial damage and autophagic vesicles occurred in TM4 cells after thermal excitation. The N-segment fragment of the associated protein shear was increased, and the TUNEL result was positive. In conclusion, thermal excitation induced apoptosis and scorch death in TM4 cells. Thus, the Hippo pathway and apoptosis-related pathway were significantly enriched after heat stimulation in mouse testis, and the scorch death effect in TM4 cells was induced by heat excitation.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homolog, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), are the main transcriptional downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Decreased Hippo pathway activity leads to nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ where they interact with TEAD transcription factors to induce target gene expression. Unrestrained YAP/TAZ activity can lead to excessive growth and tumor formation in a short time, underscoring the evolutionary need for tight control of these two transcriptional coactivators. Here, we report that the AP-1 component JUN acts as specific repressor of YAP/TAZ at joint target sites to decrease YAP/TAZ activity. This function of JUN is independent of its heterodimeric AP-1 partner FOS and the canonical AP-1 function. Since expression of JUN is itself induced by YAP/TAZ, our work identifies a JUN-dependent negative feedback loop that buffers YAP/TAZ activity at joint genomic sites. This negative feedback loop gets disrupted in liver cancer to unlock the full oncogenic potential of YAP/TAZ. Our results thus demonstrate an additional layer of control for the interplay of YAP/TAZ and AP-1.
   AP-1 transcription factor complexes formed by JUN/FOS are required for full transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ in cancer. This work identifies an unexpected FOS-independent role of JUN in buffering oncogenic YAP/TAZ activity at target genes, providing a negative feedback mechanism in liver cancer.JUN antagonizes YAP activation-induced growth arrest in human cancer cells by interfering with YAP target gene expression.JUN acts as specific repressor of YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity at joint target sites.JUN-mediated YAP/TAZ repression depends on JUN homodimerization and corepressor proteins NCOR1/2, but is independent of its heterodimeric AP-1 partner FOS.Overexpression of FOS-binding incompetent JUN suppresses YAP-dependent liver cancers.
   Negative feedback signaling by homodimerized JUN-JUN-NCOR1/2 repressor complex acts as a tumor suppressor by buffering oncogenic YAP/TAZ activity in hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - The study aimed to assess the impact of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on rats' neurobehavior compared to bulk zinc oxide (BZnO). Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups. The control group received Tween 80 (10%), while the ZnONP groups were given ZnONPs at 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight dosages, and the bulk zinc oxide (BZnO) groups received BZnO at the same dosages. Behavioral observations, neurobehavioral examinations, and assessments of brain tissue oxidative markers, neurotransmitter levels, and histopathological changes were performed. The results indicated that ZnONP at a dosage of 5 mg/kg improved general behavior, locomotor activity, memory, and recognition and reduced fearfulness in rats. Conversely, the higher dosage of 10 mg/kg and the bulk form had adverse effects on general behavior, locomotor activity, and learning ability, with the bulk form demonstrating the most severe impact-znONP-5 treatment increased antioxidant enzyme levels and decreased inflammatory markers. BZnO-5 exhibited lower oxidative stress markers, although still higher than BZnO-10. Furthermore, ZnONP-5 and BZnO-5 increased neurotransmitter levels compared to higher dosages. ZnONP-5 upregulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, while BZnO-5 showed increased BDNF mRNA expression and decreased expression of genes related to apoptosis and inflammation. In summary, ZnONPs at 5 mg/kg demonstrated positive effects on rat brain function and behavior, while higher dosages and the bulk form had detrimental effects. In conclusion, the studies emphasized the importance of further assessing various doses and forms of zinc oxide on brain health, highlighting the significance of dosage considerations when using nanomaterials.

AB  - Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an etiological agent of enteric disease that results in high mortality rates in piglets. The economic impact of the virus is considerable, causing significant losses to the pig industry. The development of an efficacious subunit vaccine to provide promising protection against TGEV is of the utmost importance. The viral antigen, spike glycoprotein (S), is widely regarded as one of the most effective antigenic components for vaccine research. In this study, we employed immunoinformatics and molecular dynamics approaches to develop an 'ideal' multi-epitope vaccine. Firstly, the dominant, non-toxic, highly antigenic T (Th, CTL) and B cell epitopes predicted from the TGEV S protein were artificially engineered in tandem to design candidate subunit vaccines. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation results demonstrate that it exhibits robust interactions with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Of particular significance was the finding that the vaccine was capable of triggering an immune response in mammals, as evidenced by the immune simulation results. The humoral aspect is typified by elevated levels of IgG and IgM, whereas the cellular immune aspect is capable of eliciting the robust production of interleukins and cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-2). Furthermore, the adoption of E. coli expression systems for the preparation of vaccines will also result in cost savings. This study offers logical guidelines for the development of a secure and efficacious subunit vaccine against TGEV, in addition to providing a novel theoretical foundation and strategy to prevent associated CoV infections.

AB  - Streptococcus suis serovar 2 (S. suis serovar 2) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes meningitis in pigs and humans, and is a serious threat to the swine industry and public health. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which S. suis serovar 2 penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial to elucidating the pathogenesis of meningitis. In a previous study, we found that expression of the virulence factor enolase (Eno) by S. suis serovar 2 promotes the expression of host heat shock protein family D member 1 (HSPD1) in brain tissue, which leads to the apoptosis of porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMECs) and increased BBB permeability, which in turn promotes bacterial translocation across the BBB. However, the mechanism by which HSPD1 mediates Eno-induced apoptosis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Eno promotes the translocation of HSPD1 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, where HSPD1 binds to beta-actin (ACTB), the translocated HSPD1, and its interaction with ACTB led to adverse changes in cell morphology and promoted the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac), and cleaved caspase-3; inhibited the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP); and finally promoted cell apoptosis. These results further elucidate the role of HSPD1 in the process of Eno-induced apoptosis and increased BBB permeability, increasing our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of meningitis, and providing a framework for novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of the world population. Genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors are known to play a role in this psychiatric disorder. While there is a high concordance in monozygotic twins, about half of twin pairs are discordant for schizophrenia. To address the question of how and when concordance in monozygotic twins occur, we have obtained fibroblasts from two pairs of schizophrenia discordant twins (one sibling with schizophrenia while the second one is unaffected by schizophrenia) and three pairs of healthy twins (both of the siblings are healthy). We have prepared iPSC models for these 3 groups of patients with schizophrenia, unaffected co-twins, and the healthy twins. When the study started the co-twins were considered healthy and unaffected but both the co-twins were later diagnosed with a depressive disorder. The reprogrammed iPSCs were differentiated into hippocampal neurons to measure the neurophysiological abnormalities in the patients. We found that the neurons derived from the schizophrenia patients were less arborized, were hypoexcitable with immature spike features, and exhibited a significant reduction in synaptic activity with dysregulation in synapse-related genes. Interestingly, the neurons derived from the co-twin siblings who did not have schizophrenia formed another distinct group that was different from the neurons in the group of the affected twin siblings but also different from the neurons in the group of the control twins. Importantly, their synaptic activity was not affected. Our measurements that were obtained from schizophrenia patients and their monozygotic twin and compared also to control healthy twins point to hippocampal synaptic deficits as a central mechanism in schizophrenia.

AB  - Objective: Trimethyltin (TMT) chloride is an organotin compound used in industry. It has been linked to generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory processes, and neuronal death. Carvacrol is a monoterpene phenol found in the Lamiaceae plant family, modulating inflammatory conditions and necroptosis in neural tissue. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of carvacrol in a rat model of hippocampal neuronal injury induced by TMT. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=12): group 1 receiving saline, group 2 received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a vehicle for 21 days, group 3 receiving a single dose of TMT (8 mg/kg) and groups 4 and 5 receiving carvacrol 40 and 70 mg/kg daily for 21 days after a single dose of TMT. All injections were intraperitoneal (I.P.). Caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, , and Bdnf gene expression and the number of pyknotic neurons in the hippocampus were quantified. Spatial memory was assessed with a radial arm maze. Results: Statistical analysis of histological data revealed the carvacrol significantly attenuated cognitive dysfunction and the number of pyknotic neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats treated with TMT. Based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), carvacrol modulated the expression of genes involved in apoptosis ( Bax and Caspase-3) ) and upregulated anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and brain derived neurotrophic factor ( Bdnf ) genes in the hippocampal tissue. Conclusion: These findings revealed neuroprotective effects of carvacrol which might be mediated by apoptotic and anti-apopetotic factors.

AB  - Theanine is a unique major amino acid in tea plants responsible for umami taste and mental health benefits of tea. However, theanine biosynthesis and physiological role in tea plants are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that tea plant theanine synthetase is encoded by a glutamine synthetase gene CsTSI. The expression pattern of CsTSI is closely correlated with theanine and glutamine levels in various tissues. CsTSI transcripts were accumulated in root tip epidermal cells, pericycle and procambial cells, where CsTSI presents as a cytosolic protein. Ectopic expression of the gene in Arabidopsis led to greater glutamine and theanine production than controls when fed with ethylamine (EA). RNAi knockdown or overexpression of CsTSI in tea plant hairy roots reduced or enhanced theanine and glutamine contents, respectively, compared with controls. The CsTSI recombinant enzymes used glutamate as an acceptor and ammonium or EA as a donor to synthesize glutamine and theanine, respectively. CsTSI expression in tea roots responded to nitrogen supply and deprivation and was correlated with theanine contents. This study provides fresh insights into the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of theanine, which may facilitate the breeding of high-theanine tea plants for improving the nutritional benefit of tea.

AB  - Controlled reperfusion by monitoring the blood pressure, blood flow, and specific blood parameters during extracorporeal reperfusion after cardiac arrest has the potential to limit ischemia-reperfusion injury. The intracellular calcium overload as part of the ischemia-reperfusion injury provides the possibility for the injury to be counteracted by the early suppression of serum calcium with the aim of improving survival and the neurological outcome. We investigated the effects of prolonged serum calcium suppression via sodium citrate during extracorporeal resuscitation using the CARL protocol (CARL-controlled automated reperfusion of the whole body) compared to a single-dose approach in a porcine model after prolonged cardiac arrest. A control group (N = 10) was resuscitated after a 20 min cardiac arrest, initially lowering the intravascular calcium with the help of a single dose of sodium citrate as part of the priming solution. Animals in the intervention group (N = 13) received additional sodium citrate for the first 15 min of reperfusion. In the control group, 9/10 (90.0%) animals survived until day 7 and 7/13 (53.8%) survived in the intervention group (p = 0.09). A favorable neurological outcome on day 7 after the cardiac arrest was observed in all the surviving animals using a species-specific neurological deficit score. The coronary perfusion pressure was significantly lower with a tendency towards more cardiac arrhythmias in the intervention group. In conclusion, a prolonged reduction in serum calcium levels over the first 15 min of reperfusion after prolonged cardiac arrest tended to be unfavorable regarding survival and hemodynamic variables compared to a single-dose approach in this animal model.

AB  - We explored sex-biased effects of the primary stress glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone on the miRNA expression profile in the rat hippocampus. Adult adrenalectomized (ADX) female and male rats received a single corticosterone (10 mg/kg) or vehicle injection, and after 6 h, hippocampi were collected for miRNA, mRNA, and Western blot analyses. miRNA profiling microarrays showed a basal sex-biased miRNA profile in ADX rat hippocampi. Additionally, acute corticosterone administration triggered a sex-biased differential expression of miRNAs derived from genes located in several chromosomes and clusters on the X and 6 chromosomes. Putative promoter analysis unveiled that most corticosterone-responsive miRNA genes contained motifs for either direct or indirect glucocorticoid actions in both sexes. The evaluation of transcription factors indicated that almost 50% of miRNA genes sensitive to corticosterone in both sexes was under glucocorticoid receptor regulation. Transcription factor-miRNA regulatory network analyses identified several transcription factors that regulate, activate, or repress miRNA expression. Validated target mRNA analysis of corticosterone-responsive miRNAs showed a more complex miRNA-mRNA interaction network in males compared to females. Enrichment analysis revealed that several hippocampal-relevant pathways were affected in both sexes, such as neurogenesis and neurotrophin signaling. The evaluation of selected miRNA targets from these pathways displayed a strong sex difference in the hippocampus of ADX-vehicle rats. Corticosterone treatment did not change the levels of the miRNA targets and their corresponding tested proteins. Our data indicate that corticosterone exerts a sex-biased effect on hippocampal miRNA expression, which may engage in sculpting the basal sex differences observed at higher levels of hippocampal functioning.

AB  - Inosine has robust neuroprotective effects, but it is unclear if inosine acts as direct ligand of adenosine receptors or if it triggers metabolic effects indirectly modifying the activity of adenosine receptors. We now combined radioligand binding studies with electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices to test how inosine controls synaptic transmission and plasticity. Inosine was without effect at 30 mu M and decreased field excitatory post-synaptic potentials by 14% and 33% at 100 and 300 mu M, respectively. These effects were prevented by the adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist DPCPX. Inosine at 300 (but not 100) mu M also decreased the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP), an effect prevented by DPCPX and by the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist SCH58261. Inosine showed low affinity towards human and rat adenosine receptor subtypes with K-i values of > 300 mu M; only at the human and rat A(1) receptor slightly higher affinities with K-i values of around 100 mu M were observed. Affinity of inosine at the rat A(3) receptor was higher (K-i of 1.37 mu M), while it showed no interaction with the human orthologue. Notably, the effects of inosine on synaptic transmission and plasticity were abrogated by adenosine deaminase and by inhibiting equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT) with dipyridamole and NBTI. This shows that the impact of inosine on hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity is not due to a direct activation of adenosine receptors but is instead due to an indirect modification of the tonic activation of these adenosine receptors through an ENT-mediated modification of the extracellular levels of adenosine.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, patients generally forget to take pills or skip medication due to side effects, affecting the treatment efficacy. In this study, we combined a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), (PLGA)-poly(ethylene glycol), and (PEG)-PLGA thermo-sensitive hydrogel with curcumin (PGC) to deliver an intramuscular injection that could continuously release curcumin and maintain it at a constant level in blood to prevent AD development or progression. We evaluated the drug release profile and cytotoxicity of PGC and its effects on AD pathology through in vitro and in vivo studies and on cognitive function through an aluminum-chloride-induced AD rat model. In the in vitro study, PGC exhibited a lack of cytotoxicity, excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and microglial modulation. In the Morris water maze test, the PGC injection-administered AD rats presented well-focused searching behavior with the shortest swimming path and longest retention times in the quadrant where the platform was initially located. Furthermore, PGC reduced amyloid-beta aggregation and deposition and significantly increased hippocampal activity. This study demonstrated that intramuscular PGC injection can effectively prevent AD development or progression in rats without inducing toxicity; therefore, this strategy could help overcome the present challenges in AD management in humans.

AB  - Objective: Epilepsy is accompanied by inflammation, and the anti-inflammatory agents may have anti-seizure effects. In this investigation, the effect of deep brain stimulation, as a potential therapeutic approach in epileptic patients, was investigated on seizure-induced inflammatory factors.
   Materials and Methods: In the present experimental study, rats were kindled by chronic administration of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 34 mg/Kg). The animals were divided into intact, sham, low-frequency deep brain stimulation (LFS), kindled, and kindled +LFS groups. In kindled+LFS and LFS groups, animals received four trains of intra-hippocampal low-frequency deep brain stimulation (LFS) at 20 minutes, 6, 24, and 30 hours after the last PTZ injection. Each train of LFS contained 200 pulses at 1 Hz, 200 mu A, and 0.1 ms pulse width. One week after the last PTZ injection, the Y-maze test was run, and then the rats' brains were removed, and hippocampal samples were extracted for molecular assessments. The gene expression of two pro-inflammatory factors [interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)], and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (as a biological marker of astrocytes reactivation) were evaluated.
   Results: Obtained results showed a significant increase in the expression of of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and GFAP at one-week post kindling seizures. The application of LFS had a long-lasting effect and restored all of the measured changes toward normal values. These effects were gone along with the LFS improving the effect on working memory in kindled animals.
   Conclusion: The anti-inflammatory action of LFS may have a role in its long-lasting improving effects on seizure-induced cognitive disorders.

AB  - The Onychostoma macrolepis (O. macrolepis) is a rare and endangered wild species. Their endangered extinction might be due to their low fertility. To further illustrate the molecular mechanism of gonad development of the male and female O. macrolepis, the present study carried out de novo testicular and ovarian transcriptome sequencing. By comparing ovary and testis, 30,869 differentially expressed unigenes (9870 in female, 20999 in male) were identified. In addition, KEGG and GO analysis suggested that the Hedgehog signaling pathway have important roles in testis maintenance and spermatogenesis, whereas the Hippo signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway are likely to participate in ovary maintenance. RT-qPCR analysis results were consistent with transcriptome sequencing that all of gender differentiation-related genes (FOXL2, GDF9, WNT4, CYP19A1, SOX9 and GATA4), temperature-enriched genes (NOVA1, CTGF and NR4A1), clock-related genes (PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, BMAL1 and CIPC) were significantly differential expression in testis compared with ovaries. Taken together, these results revealed a potential molecular mechanism that low fertility of the O. macrolepis might strong correlate with the gonadal dyssynchrony development of the male and female, which might provide theoretical basis and technical support for artificial reproduction and germplasm resource protection of the O. macrolepis.

AB  - Synapse loss is the principal cause of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD). Synapse development depends on the intricate dynamics of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Cofilin, the major protein regulating actin dynamics, can be sequestered into cofilactin rods, intra-neurite bundles of cofilin-saturated actin filaments that can disrupt vesicular trafficking and cause synaptic loss. Rods are a brain pathology in human AD and mouse models of AD and ADRD. Eliminating rods is the focus of this paper. One pathway for rod formation is triggered in similar to 20% of rodent hippocampal neurons by disease-related factors (e.g., soluble oligomers of Amyloid-beta (A beta)) and requires cellular prion protein (PrP (c)), active NADPH oxidase (NOX), and cytokine/chemokine receptors (CCRs). FDA-approved antagonists of CXCR4 and CCR5 inhibit A beta-induced rods in both rodent and human neurons with effective concentrations for 50% rod reduction (EC50) of 1-10 nM. Remarkably, two D-amino acid receptor-active peptides (RAP-103 and RAP-310) inhibit A beta-induced rods with an EC50 of similar to 1 pM in mouse neurons and similar to 0.1 pM in human neurons. These peptides are analogs of D-Ala-Peptide T-Amide (DAPTA) and share a pentapeptide sequence (TTNYT) antagonistic to several CCR-dependent responses. RAP-103 does not inhibit neuritogenesis or outgrowth even at 1 mu M, >10(6)-fold above its EC50. N-terminal methylation, or D-Thr to D-Ser substitution, decreases the rod-inhibiting potency of RAP-103 by 10(3)-fold, suggesting high target specificity. Neither RAP peptide inhibits neuronal rod formation induced by excitotoxic glutamate, but both inhibit rods induced in human neurons by several PrP (c)/NOX pathway activators (A beta, HIV-gp120 protein, and IL-6). Significantly, RAP-103 completely protects against A beta-induced loss of mature and developing synapses and, at 0.1 nM, reverses rods in both rodent and human neurons (T-1/2 similar to 3 h) even in the continuous presence of A beta. Thus, this orally available, brain-permeable peptide should be highly effective in reducing rod pathology in multifactorial neurological diseases with mixed proteinopathies acting through PrP (c)/NOX.

AB  - The central serotoninergic system is critical for stress responsivity and social behavior, and its dysregulations have been centrally implicated in virtually all neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetic serotonin depletion animal models could provide a tool to elucidate the causes and mechanisms of diseases and to develop new treatment approaches. Previously, mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) have been developed, showing altered behaviors and neurotransmission. However, the effect of congenital serotonin deficiency on emotional and social behavior in rats is still largely unknown, as are the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we used a Tph2 knockout (Tph2(-/-)) male rat model to study how the lack of serotonin in the rat brain affects anxiety-like and social behaviors. Since oxytocin is centrally implicated in these behaviors, we furthermore explored whether the effects of Tph2 knockout on behavior would relate to changes in the oxytocin system. We show that Tph2(-/-) rats display reduced anxiety-like behavior and a high level of aggression in social interactions. In addition, oxytocin receptor expression was increased in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices, paraventricular nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and some subregions of the hippocampus, which was paralleled by increased levels of oxytocin in the medial frontal cortex and paraventricular nucleus but not the dorsal raphe nucleus, central amygdala, and hippocampus. In conclusion, our study demonstrated reduced anxiety but exaggerated aggression in Tph2(-/-) male rats and reveals for the first time a potential involvement of altered oxytocin system function. Meanwhile, the research of oxytocin could be distinguished in almost any psychiatric disorder including anxiety and mental disorders. This research potentially proposes a new target for the treatment of such disorders, from a genetic serotonin deficiency aspect.

AB  - Diabetes and mood disorders are intricately interconnected, with each condition elevating the risk of the other. This bidirectional relationship, further exacerbated by neuroinflammation, fosters an environment conducive to the development of anxiety and depression. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide, offer promising therapeutic options that not only target type 2 diabetes but also can positively influence mood. Our study's primary goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of semaglutide, in mitigating anxiety and depression within an animal model of diabetes. The neuroprotective properties of semaglutide were evaluated by examining its influence on the kynurenine pathway and neurobiological markers (GFAP, NEFL, NSE, and GAL3) in the perfrontal cortex, selected for its key role in cognitive function and emotional regulation, impaired in diabetes and mood disorders. Additionally, we examined semaglutide's impact on peripheral inflammation and stress parameters to elucidate its role in modulating systemic inflammatory responses linked to mood disorders. Additionally, we conducted behavioral assessments to better understand how semaglutide influences anxiety and depression-related behaviors in diabetic mice. Semaglutide therapy significantly improved behavioral patterns and neurochemical markers in diabetic mice. The frequency of administration significantly influenced the outcomes, whereas the dosage appeared to have a limited impact. Here we show that semaglutide expands its therapeutic potential beyond diabetes, significantly influencing mood disorders through neuroinflammatory pathways. Semaglutide has the potential to be a key element in formulating integrated treatment strategies that address both metabolic health and mental well-being, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals navigating these interrelated challenges.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effectiveness of administering 80 ppm nitric oxide in reducing kidney injury, mitochondrial dysfunction and regulated cell death in kidneys during experimental perfusion. Twenty-four sheep were randomized into four groups: two groups received 80 ppm NO conditioning with 90 min of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB + NO) or 90 min of CPB and hypothermic circulatory arrest (CPB + CA + NO), while two groups received sham protocols (CPB and CPB + CA). Kidney injury was assessed using laboratory (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, an acute kidney injury biomarker) and morphological methods (morphometric histological changes in kidney biopsy specimens). A kidney biopsy was performed 60 min after weaning from mechanical perfusion. NO did not increase the concentrations of inhaled NO2 and methemoglobin significantly. The NO-conditioning groups showed less severe kidney injury and mitochondrial dysfunction, with statistical significance in the CPB + NO group and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression as a trigger of apoptosis and necroptosis in renal tissue in the CPB + CA + NO group compared to the CPB + CA group. The severity of mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tissue was insignificantly lower in the NO-conditioning groups. We conclude that NO administration is safe and effective at reducing kidney injury, mitochondrial dysfunction and regulated cell death in kidneys during experimental CPB.

AB  - According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), sleep serves to renormalize synaptic connections that have been potentiated during the prior wake phase due to ongoing encoding of information. SHY focuses on glutamatergic synaptic strength and has been supported by numerous studies examining synaptic structure and function in neocortical and hippocampal networks. However, it is unknown whether synaptic down-regulation during sleep occurs in the hypothalamus, i.e., a pivotal center of homeostatic regulation of bodily functions including sleep itself. We show that sleep, in parallel with the synaptic down-regulation in neocortical networks, down-regulates the levels of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the hypothalamus of rats. Most robust decreases after sleep were observed at both sites for AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit. Comparing the effects of selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and total sleep deprivation, we moreover provide experimental evidence that slow-wave sleep (SWS) is the driving force of the down-regulation of AMPARs in hypothalamus and neocortex, with no additional contributions of REM sleep or the circadian rhythm. SWS-dependent synaptic down-regulation was not linked to EEG slow-wave activity. However, spindle density during SWS predicted relatively increased GluA1 subunit levels in hypothalamic synapses, which is consistent with the role of spindles in the consolidation of memory. Our findings identify SWS as the main driver of the renormalization of synaptic strength during sleep and suggest that SWS-dependent synaptic renormalization is also implicated in homeostatic control processes in the hypothalamus.
   Sleep normalizes synaptic connections in the cortex and hippocampus that have been potentiated during the preceding wake phase. This study shows that slow-wave sleep also down-regulates AMPA receptor levels in the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates sleep.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Flos Magnoliae (the dried flower buds of Magnolia biondii Pamp, FM) is a known herbal traditional medicine used for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea caused by rhinitis and sinusitis. Magnolol, a neolignan from the magnolia family, is a secondary metabolite known to have antiallergic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic effect of magnolol in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR) remain elusive.Aims of the study: Anoctamin 1 (ANO1), a calcium-activated anion channel, mediates mucus and electrolyte secretion in nasal airway epithelial cells, whereas calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (ORAI1) participates in the activation of T-lymphocytes and mast cells. The aim of our study is to understand the mechanisms of action of magnolol against AR, i.e., whether it acts through the modulation of ANO1 and ORAI1 channels that are expressed in nasal epithelial cells and T-lymphocytes, respectively.Materials and methods: Whole-cell patch clamp was used to record the activity of ORAI1 and ANO1 ion channels in ORAI1 or ANO1 overexpressed HEK293T cells, while the Ussing chamber apparatus was used to measure electrolyte transport via the epithelium, in Calu-3 cells cultured in an air-liquid interface. Additionally, calcium imaging of Jurkat T-lymphocytes was used to assess changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. Magnolol toxicity was assessed using the CCK-8 assay, and its effect on T-lymphocyte proliferation was measured by labeling human primary T-lymphocytes with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester. Finally, OVA-induced Balb/c mice were employed to evaluate the effect of magnolol on nasal symptoms, as well as cytokine and eosinophil infiltration in AR. Results: Magnolol inhibits ORAI1 and ANO1 channels in a concentration-dependent manner. Magnolol (30 mu M) inhibits anti-CD3 induced cellular proliferation and production of IL-2 via ORAI1 channels in T-lymphocytes. Further, ATP-induced electrolyte transport mediated by ANO1 channels is significantly inhibited by magnolol in IL-4 sensitized Calu-3 cells. Notably, 300 mu M magnolol significantly attenuates cytokine and eosinophil infiltration, thus alleviating AR symptoms in mice OVA-induced AR.Conclusion: Magnolol may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of AR.

AB  - The objective was to determine effects of slow--release melatonin on post--thaw sperm quality in rams exposed to mild testicular heat stress (HS; scrotal neck insulation). Twelve yearling Dorset rams were randomly and equally allocated to receive either 36 mg melatonin in 1 ml corn oil or 1 ml corn oil injected subcutaneously (SQ); 15 day later, all rams had HS for 96 h (start of HS = start of Week 0). Semen was collected before HS and once weekly from Weeks 1 to 7, extended in Steridyl CSS One Step, held at 5 degrees C for similar to 3 h, loaded into 0.5 ml straws, held 5 cm above liquid nitrogen for 10 min and then plunged. Computer assisted semen analysis (CASA) was conducted on frozen--thawed sperm. There were group and week effects for total and progressive motility (p <.001), plus group and week effects and group*week interactions (p <.001) for post--thaw total abnormalities, acrosome integrity, post--thaw sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and high mitochondrial membrane potential (HMMP). Post-thaw sperm total and progressive motility, acrosome integrity and HMMP were higher (p <.05) in melatonin versus control groups from Weeks 1 to 7, and the melatonin group reached baseline level (pre--heat stress) at Week 7 (75.79 +/- 0.96, 65.48 +/- 1.51, 75.00 +/- 0.89 and 67.00 +/- 1.06, respectively; mean +/- SEM). Conversely, post--thaw sperm total abnormalities and DFI were lower (p <.05) in melatonin versus control, and both reached baseline at Week 7 in the melatonin group (26.00 +/- 0.57 and 5.66 +/- 0.17, respectively). Coiled tails, distal midpiece reflexes, distal cytoplasmic droplets, ruffled acrosomes, bowed midpieces, pyriform heads and knobbed acrosomes were the most common abnormalities in both groups, with lower percentages in melatonin-treated rams. Results supported our hypothesis that HS reduces post-thaw sperm quality, and that melatonin lessens those reductions, manifested by significantly better total and progressive motility, acrosome integrity and HMMP, and fewer sperm total abnormalities and DFI.

AB  - Vectored monoclonal antibody (mAb) expression mediated by adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery leads to sustained therapeutic mAb expression and protection against a wide range of infectious diseases in both small and large animal models, including nonhuman primates. Using our rationally engineered AAV6 triple mutant capsid, termed AAV6.2FF, we demonstrate rapid and robust expression of two potent human antibodies against Marburg virus, MR78 and MR191, following intramuscular (IM) administration. IM injection of mice with 1 x 10(11) vector genomes (vg) of AAV6.2FF-MR78 and AAV6.2FF-MR191 resulted in serum concentrations of approximately 141 mu g/mL and 195 mu g/mL of human IgG, respectively, within the first four weeks. Mice receiving 1 x 10(11) vg (high) and 1 x 10(10) vg (medium) doses of AAV6.2FF-MR191 were completely protected against lethal Marburg virus challenge. No sex-based differences in serum human IgG concentrations were observed; however, administering the AAV-mAb over multiple injection sites significantly increased serum human IgG concentrations. IM administration of three two-week-old lambs with 5 x 10(12) vg/kg of AAV6.2FF-MR191 resulted in serum human IgG expression that was sustained for more than 460 days, concomitant with low levels of anti-capsid and anti-drug antibodies. AAV-mAb expression is a viable method for prolonging the therapeutic effect of recombinant mAbs and represents a potential alternative "vaccine" strategy for those with compromised immune systems or in possible outbreak response scenarios.

AB  - Depression is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with high incidence and disability. Electroacupuncture (EA) is effective in the treatment of depression. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Social isolation stress during post-weaning period can impair purinergic signaling in the brain of rodents and has emerged as a major risk factor for depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R) in the antidepressant-like effects of EA. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to group-housed (GH) or social isolated (SI) groups at post-natal day 21. After 6 weeks of social isolation, EA was performed on acupoints "Bai-hui" (GV20) and "Yin-tang" (GV29), or non-acupoints for 4 weeks. The SI mice received either intracerebroventricular injection of a selective P2Y1R agonist, MRS2365 (1 nmol); or a selective P2Y1R antagonist, MRS2179 (2 mu mol), before and after EA. We found that SI mice exhibited depression-like behaviors accompanied with anxiety-like behaviors. The expressions of P2Y1R were well co-localized with GFAP-positive astrocytes and increased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of SI mice. After treated with MRS2179, the depression-like behaviors of SI mice were attenuated, but not with MRS2365. Meanwhile, we found that EA could attenuate social isolation caused depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inhibited the up-regulation of P2Y1R in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of SI mice. Notably, the positive effects of EA on depression-like behaviors of SI mice could be reversed by MRS2365, while MRS2365 had no effect on the anxiolytic-like effects of EA. Therefore, we provide new evidence that EA could ameliorate depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in social isolation stress mice, and P2Y1R was involved in the antidepressant-like effects of EA.

AB  - Spatial environment includes multiple scales, which can be specifically divided into operable nearscale figural space, navigable space consisting of single -viewpoint space and environmental space, and large-scale geographic space. It is very important for human and other animal's daily life to distinguish the spatial environment at different scales. The representation of spatial scale is related to its corresponding functional requirements. The parietal lobe is responsible for the representation of near -scale space. Navigable spatial representation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex shows a "coarse to fine" gradient along the posterior to anterior axis. However, the scale representation of abstract social space shows a dichotomy. Future research should focus on temporal dynamics of spatial scale representation and the influence of spatial scale on the format of the cognitive map.

AB  - Background G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) is a critical signaling molecule involved in maintaining energy balance and immune homeostasis, making it a widely studied drug target. However, its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of GPR43 activation in an A beta(1-42)-induced AD mouse model and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Methods Experiments were performed using A beta(1-42)-induced C57BL/6 mice (in vivo model) and the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 (in vitro model). GPR43 gene expression and protein levels were analyzed in the brains of AD mice. Lentivirus-mediated GPR43 overexpression was employed to assess its effects on AD-like behaviors and pathological features. Cyclosporin A (CSA), a cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibitor, was used to investigate the pathological mechanisms of GPR43 in AD. Result Compared to wild-type mice, GPR43 expression was downregulated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of A beta(1-42)-induced AD mice and was primarily localized to neurons. GPR43 activation improved spatial learning and memory in AD mice. Furthermore, it upregulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and synaptophysin (SYP), indicating enhanced neuronal and synaptic function. GPR43 upregulation also modulated the levels of mitochondrial damage-related enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and reduced mitochondrial swelling. Notably, GPR43 downregulated CypD protein levels, which are linked to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) channels, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. Finally, in GPR43-knockdown cells, treatment with CSA significantly reduced the apoptosis rate, decreased BAX and Caspase-9 levels, and increased BCL-2 expression. Conclusion GPR43 inhibits apoptosis in AD mice through the CypD signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a novel target for drug development in AD treatment.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) affects a significant proportion of the population over the age of 60 years, and its prevalence is increasing. While symptomatic treatment is available for motor symptoms of PD, non-motor complications such as dementia result in diminished life quality for patients and are far more difficult to treat. In this study, we analyzed PD-associated alterations in the hippocampus of PD patients, since this brain region is strongly affected by PD dementia. We focused on synapses, analyzing the proteome of post-mortal hippocampal tissue from 16 PD cases and 14 control subjects by mass spectrometry. Whole tissue lysates and synaptosomal fractions were analyzed in parallel. Differential analysis combined with bioinformatic network analyses identified neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1) to be significantly dysregulated in PD and interacting with proteins of the synaptic compartment. Modulation of NPTX1 protein levels in primary hippocampal neuron cultures validated its role in synapse morphology. Our analysis suggests that NPTX1 contributes to synaptic pathology in late-stage PD and represents a putative target for novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The lipids oxidation is essential, keeping in view the taste, quality of nutritional components, and toxicity of lipids. We used oxidized sunflower oil combined with green tea to check its effects on hematological and serum biochemical parameters and liver in rabbits. Sunflower oil was oxidized continuously for 5 hours on hot plates at 100 degrees C. The rabbit groups were made, one group was fed a regular diet, and the other was fed with oxidized oil (2ml/kg body weight). Three groups were provided with green tea (50-50 ratio) at the dose rate of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg combined with oxidized sunflower oil (2m/kg). Green tea alone was fed to two groups (200 mg and 100 mg/kg). The feeding regimen was continued for twenty-one days. The blood samples were collected on days zero, 11th, and 21st to analyze hematological and biochemical parameters. At the end of the experiment, one rabbit from each group was slaughtered, and the liver was extracted for histopathology. In the groups fed with oxidized sunflower oil alone or combined with green tea at various doses, significant alterations (P<0.05) in hematology and biochemical indices were observed. The high doses of green tea improved the alteration. No ill effect was observed in the groups fed green tea alone. Oxidized sunflower oil alone led to cholestasis and fatty changes in the liver, while green tea minimized the toxic effects confirming its anti-oxidant properties.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a classic famous prescription that has been utilized for centuries to address dementia. New investigations have shown that the anti -dementia effect of KXS is connected with improved neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism is not well elucidated. Aim of the study: We propose to discover the ameliorative impact of KXS on Alzheimer 's disease (AD) and its regulatory role on the mitochondrial autophagy-nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway. Materials and methods: The Y maze, Morris water maze, and new objection recognition tests were applied to ascertain the spatial learning and memory capacities of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice after KXS-treatment. Meanwhile, the biochemical indexes of the hippocampus were detected by reagent kits. The pathological alterations and mitochondrial autophagy in the mice ' hippocampus were detected utilizing hematoxylin and eosin (H &E), immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Besides, the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways protein expressions were determined employing the immunoblot analysis. Results: The results of behavioral tests showed that KXS significantly enhanced the AD mice ' spatial learning and memory capacities. Furthermore, KXS reversed the biochemical index levels and reduced amyloid- beta protein deposition in AD mice brains. Besides, H &E staining showed that KXS remarkably ameliorated the neuronal damage in AD mice. Concurrently, the results of transmission electron microscopy suggest that KXS ameliorated the mitochondrial damage in microglia and promoted mitochondrial autophagy. Moreover, the immunofluorescence outcomes exhibited that KXS promoted the expression of protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) associated with microtubule and the generation of autophagic flux. Notably, the immunofluorescence co -localization results confirmed the presence of mitochondrial autophagy in microglia. Finally, KXS promoted the protein expressions of the PINK1/Parkin pathway and reduced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Most importantly, these beneficial effects of KXS were attenuated by the mitochondrial autophagy inhibitor chloroquine.

AB  - The hippocampus is a crucial structure of the brain, recognised for its roles in the formation of memory, and our ability to navigate the world. Despite its importance, clear understanding of how the human hippocampus develops and its contribution to disease is limited due to the inaccessible nature of the human brain. In this regard, the advent of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technologies has enabled the study of human biology in an unprecedented manner, through the ability to model development and disease as both 2D monolayers and 3D organoids. In this review, we explore the existing efforts to derive the hippocampal lineage from hPSCs and evaluate the various aspects of the in vivo hippocampus that are replicated in vitro. In addition, we highlight key diseases that have been modelled using hPSC-derived cultures and offer our perspective on future directions for this emerging field.

AB  - Background: Quercetin, the key ingredient in Xiaoyao Kangai Jieyu Formula, has been previously found to relieve breast cancer-related depression (BCRD). Purpose: We want to explore the potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets of quercetin alleviating BCRD. Methods: BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 4T1 cells and corticosterone (CORT) to create a BCRD mice model. The primary hippocampal neurons were co-induced with 10 mu g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 200 mu M CORT for 6 h to establish an in vitro model of BCRD. Quercetin was applied to explore its effect on disease symptoms, gut microbiota, and lipid metabolism of BCRD mice. Lipid metabolism-related genes were screened based on network pharmacology. Molecular docking was employed to prove whether quercetin bound to prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). PTGS2 overexpression was carried out to explore the underlying mechanism of quercetin treatment on BCRD. Results: Quercetin treatment not only altered the composition and abundance of gut microbiota but also alleviated abnormal lipid metabolism in BCRD mice. In particular, quercetin down-regulated BCRD and lipid metabolism-related genes screened by network pharmacology, especially PTGS2. Further, molecular docking verified the stable binding between quercetin and PTGS2. In hippocampal neurons, quercetin promoted proliferation but reduced ferroptosis-related markers (total Fe, Fe2 +, MDA, and ROS) levels by targeting PTGS2. In BCRD mice, quercetin reduced the high immobility time and increased the sucrose preference rate and serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and noradrenaline (NE) levels. Meanwhile, quercetin increased CD4 +/CD8 + T cells ratio and IL-2 and IFN- gamma levels but reduced CA153 and IL-10 levels to alleviate BCRD development. However, PTGS2 overexpression reversed these effects of quercetin on BCRD. Conclusion: Quercetin inhibited neuronal ferroptosis and promoted immune responses in BCRD mice by targeting the lipid metabolism -related gene PTGS2. This provided a reference for quercetin in the treatment of BCRD.

AB  - Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) poses a significant threat to the livestock industry. Through their recognition of the conserved epitopes presented by the swine leukocyte antigen (SLA), T cells play a pivotal role in the antiviral immunity of pigs. Herein, based on the peptide binding motif of SLA-2*HB01, from an original SLA-2 allele, a series of functional T-cell epitopes derived from the dominant antigen VP1 of FMDV with high binding capacity to SLA-2 were identified. Two parallel peptides, Hu64 and As64, from the O and Asia I serotypes, respectively, were both crystallized with SLA-2*HB01. Compared to SLA-1 and SLA-3, the SLA-2 structures showed the flexibility of residues in the P4, P6, and P8 positions and in their potential interface with TCR. Notably, the peptides Hu64 and As64 adopted quite similar overall conformation when bound to SLA-2*HB01. Hu64 has two different conformations, a more stable 'chair' conformation and an unstable 'boat' conformation observed in the two molecules of one asymmetric unit, whereas only a single 'chair' conformation was observed for As64. Both Hu64 and As64 could induce similar dominant T-cell activities. Our interdisciplinary study establishes a basis for the in-depth interpretation of the peptide presentation of SLA-I, which can be used toward the development of universal vaccines.

AB  - Background: Wu-Mei-Wan (WMW), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been applied in the treatment of gastro-intestinal diseases with long-term diarrhea and mucopurulent bloody stool as the main symptoms since ancient times. Studies have shown that WMW inhibits intestinal inflammation, repairs damaged intestinal mucosa, resists colon necrosis, and resists intestinal fibrosis. However, the specific mechanism of action is not yet clear.
   Objective: Ulcerative colitis (UC), an intestinal disease with intestinal inflammation and injury as the main pathological manifestations, is one of the high-risk factors for colon cancer. Inhibiting the inflammatory response and promoting colonic epithelial repair are critical to the treatment of UC. However, there is still a lack of remedies with satisfactory curative effects. In this study, the role of WMW in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice and its related mechanisms are discussed from two aspects: intestinal inflammation and tissue repair.
   Methods: DSS was used to induce colitis in mice and the therapeutic effect of WMW was analyzed by disease activity score, histopathological score, colon length measurement, serum cytokine detection, and flow cytometry. Macrophage activation and colonic stem cell proliferation were observed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of critical molecules in macrophage activation and colonic stem cell proliferation signaling pathways in colon tissue was detected with immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, RT-qPCR, and Western blot.
   Results: WMW could significantly alleviate DSS-induced colitis. We showed that WMW could reduce disease activity, reduce pathological scores, limit weight loss, inhibit colon shortening, inhibit inflammatory factor secretion, attenuate inflammatory response, and promote the repair of damaged colonic epithelium. WMW inhibited the activation of colonic macrophages, and its mechanism might be inhibiting the Notch/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 pathway; WMW promoted the proliferation of colonic stem cells, and its mechanism was associated with the regulation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway.
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that WMW could treat UC via a mechanism that inhibited the intestinal inflammatory response and repaired damaged intestinal mucosa.

AB  - Young age is often characterized by high consumption of processed foods and fruit juices rich in fructose, which, besides inducing a tendency to become overweight, can promote alterations in brain function. The aim of this study was therefore to (a) clarify brain effects resulting from fructose consumption in juvenile age, a critical phase for brain development, and (b) verify whether these alterations can be rescued after removing fructose from the diet. Young rats were fed a fructose-rich or control diet for 3 weeks. Fructose-fed rats were then fed a control diet for a further 3 weeks. We evaluated mitochondrial bioenergetics by high-resolution respirometry in the hippocampus, a brain area that is critically involved in learning and memory. Glucose transporter-5, fructose and uric acid levels, oxidative status, and inflammatory and synaptic markers were investigated by Western blotting and spectrophotometric or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A short-term fructose-rich diet induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, associated with an increased concentration of inflammatory markers and decreased Neurofilament-M and post-synaptic density protein 95. These alterations, except for increases in haptoglobin and nitrotyrosine, were recovered by returning to a control diet. Overall, our results point to the dangerous effects of excessive consumption of fructose in young age but also highlight the effect of partial recovery by switching back to a control diet.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Precision livestock farming (PLF) will have a profound influence on animal husbandry, farm animal welfare and animal-based production chains. Even though consumers ultimately pay the costs of innovations, their perceptions of PLF technologies have been under-investigated. To explore consumer perceptions of PLF technologies within the pork and dairy value chains, altogether six focus group discussions were conducted in Finland, the Netherlands and Spain. The results indicate that consumers expect that PLF technologies will enhance the health and welfare of farm animals, while generating environmental improvements and increasing transparency in livestock farming. They, however, also expressed the fear that PLF technologies will lead to more industrialisation in livestock farming; that PLF technologies and data are vulnerable to misuse and cyber-crime; and that PLF information may be inadequately communicated to consumers. The findings are used to formulate directions for strengthening the acceptance of PLF technologies among European consumers.
   Scholars in the fields of animal science and technology have investigated how precision livestock farming (PLF) can contribute to the quality and efficiency of animal husbandry and to the health and welfare of farm animals. Although the results of such studies provide promising avenues for the development of PLF technologies and their potential for the application in animal husbandry, the perspectives of consumers with regard to PLF technologies have yet to be the subject of much investigation. To address this research gap, the current study explores consumer perceptions of PLF technologies within the pork and dairy value chains. The investigation is based on results from six focus group discussions conducted in three European countries, each reflecting a different market environment: Finland, the Netherlands and Spain. The results indicate that consumers expect the implementation of different PLF technologies to enhance the health and welfare of farm animals, while generating environmental improvements and increasing the transparency of value-chain processes. The analysis further reveals three over-arching consumer concerns: (1) the fear that the integration of PLF technologies will introduce more industrialisation into livestock farming production; (2) the concern that PLF technologies and data are vulnerable to misuse and cyber-crime; and (3) the concern that PLF information is not communicated adequately to allow informed purchase decisions. The research findings provide directions for members of the animal-based food value chain to make informed decisions to improve their sustainability, social responsibility and credibility by endorsing the acceptance of PLF (technologies) amongst European consumers.

AB  - Although events are not always known to be important when they occur, people can remember details about such incidentally encoded information using episodic memory. Importantly, when information is explicitly encoded for use in an expected test of retention (as in most assessments in animals), it is possible that it is used to generate a planned action1-3; thus, the remembered action can occur without remembering the earlier episode. By contrast, when a test is unexpected, transforming information into an action plan is unlikely because the importance of the information and the nature of the test are not yet known. Thus, accurate performance in an unexpected test after incidental encoding documents episodic memory.1-8 Here, we present evidence that rats replay episodic memories of incidentally encoded information in an unexpected assessment of memory. In one task,9 rats reported the third -last item in an explicitly encoded list of trial -unique odors. In a second task,10 rats foraged in a radial maze in the absence of odors. On a critical test, rats foraged in the radial maze, but scented lids covered the food. Next, memory of the third -last odor was assessed. All participating rats correctly answered the unexpected question. These results suggest that rats encoded multiple pieces of putatively unimportant information, and later they replayed a stream of episodic memories when that information was needed to solve an unexpected problem. We propose that rats replay episodic memories of incidentally encoded information, which documents a critical aspect of human episodic memory in a non -human animal.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Camellia nitidissima C.W.Chi (CNC), an ethnomedicine mainly distributed in Southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is known as "Panda in plants" and "Camellias Queen" due to its golden blossom. CNC has been applied as a traditional folk medicine in cancer therapy.Aim of the study: This study utilized network pharmacology analysis combined with experimental validation to identify the substance basis and potential molecular mechanism of CNC against lung cancer.Materials and methods: The active ingredients of CNC were identified based on published literature. The associated potential targets of CNC in lung cancer treatment were predicted using integrated network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking. The underlying molecular mechanism of CNC in lung cancer were validated in human lung cancer cell lines.Results: A total of 30 active ingredients and 53 targets of CNC were screened. An enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) revealed that the effects of CNC in lung cancer mainly involve protein binding, regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and signal transduction. KEGG pathways analysis suggested that CNC might exert cancer suppression effects mainly through pathways in cancer, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Molecular docking revealed that CNC has high affinity for binding of EGFR, SRC, AKT1, and CCND1 to the key active ingredients including luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, eriodictyol and 3'4-O-dimethylcedrusin. In in vitro experiments, CNC played the inhibitory roles in lung cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis, causing G0/G1 and S cell cycle arrest, increasing intracellular ROS levels, and promoting the apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3. Meanwhile, CNC also regulated the expression of core proteins EGFR, SRC, and AKT.Conclusion: These results comprehensively clarified the associated substance basis and underlying molecular mechanism of CNC against lung cancer, which would be contributed to develop promising anti-cancer pharmaceuticals or therapeutic approaches for lung cancer therapy.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Senegenin (SEN), an active compound extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Polygala tenuifolia Willd. (a species in the genus Polygala, family Polygalaceae), could nourish neurons and resist neuronal damage in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (A beta) depositions in neuronal cells may cause pathological changes such as oxidative stress which one return could cause severe damage to mitochondria in AD patients or animal models. Mitophagy is an important mechanism to selectively remove damaged mitochondria. In neurons, this process is mainly mediated by PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin pathway. Previous studies have shown that SEN could reduce mitochondrial damage and inhibit apoptosis in neurons. Therefore, this study speculated that SEN might activate mitophagy to clear damaged mitochondria, thereby mitigating A beta-induced cell damage in neuronal cells.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to determine the effects of SEN on A beta-induced cell damage, and further to explore whether SEN could induce mitophagy. Moreover, the regulatory role of mitophagy in the neuroptrotective effect of SEN would be elucidated.
   Materials and methods: This study established an in vitro cell damage model using A beta(1-42) to treat mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells. The effects of SEN on cell damage were determined by MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected by Cytation (TM) 5 cell imaging microplate detection system. The apoptotic rate was analyzed by flow cytometry. The effects of SEN on mitophagy were detected by transmission electron microscope, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting.
   Results: Firstly, HT22 cells were treated with 30 mu M A beta(1-42) for 24 h to establish the damage model. It was found that 30 mu M A beta(1-42) caused neuronal damages as evidenced by reduced cell viability, increased LDH release and ROS, collapsed MMP and elevated apoptosis. Secondly, A beta(1-42)-incubated cells were treated with 10, 20, 40 and 60 mu M SEN for 24 h. SEN significantly reduced the damage of A beta(1-42)-incubated cells as shown by recovered cell viability and MMP, reduced apoptosis and ROS. Notably, SEN induced the formation of mitophagosomes and mitolysosomes, and elevated the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II. Moreover, SEN down-regulated the expression of p62, promoted the accumulation of full-length PINK1 and the translocation of Parkin to mitochondria, decreased the expression of mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60, thus activating the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, when cells were pretreated with 5 mu M CsA (Cyclosporine A, a mitophagy inhibitor) for 2 h and then co-treated with 20 and 40 mu M SEN for 24 h, the protective effects of SEN were compromised.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that SEN could alleviate A beta(1-42)-induced cell damage through PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Our findings justify the traditional use of P. tenuifolia in China with anti-aging or anti-neurodegenerative effects.

AB  - Background: Hydroxytyrosol (HT), as the main compound in olive leaves with its potential ability to cross bloodbrain barrier (BBB), has exhibited the advantaged antidepressant effect. However, no information is available regarding the brain regional uptake of HT, as well the underlying antidepressant mechanism remains unclear.
   Purpose: To comprehensively reveal the brain uptake of HT and its specific mechanism on the accompanying antidepressant activity.
   Study design and methods: The BBB penetration and brain regional distribution of HT in the normal and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive mice in consideration with the BBB integrality were analyzed. Then, the hippocampal region-specific responses of biomolecules and concurrent alterations in the therapeutic effect of HT on depression were explored using untargeted metabolomics, spatial-resolved metabolomics and tissue proteomics, which were confirmed by LPS-induced BV-2 microglia and CUMS mice.
   Results: BBB permeability analysis in normal and CUMS mice confirmed that increased BBB permeability of CUMS mice was induced by the deficiency of tight junction-related proteins. Consistently, according to the established LC-MS/MS method, it was found that HT could not be largely detected in the cerebrospinal fluids and brains of normal mice after oral administration, while it could excessively penetrate the BBB (200-fold higher), and mostly distributed in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Meanwhile, multi-omics analysis combined with targeted analysis discovered that HT could mainly improve fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism in the hippocampus with region-specific responses and accompanying inhibition of C3-CD11b pathway in CUMS mice. Besides, in vitro experiments further confirmed the anti-complement ability of HT, which could inhibit C3-CD11b pathway for alleviating the LPS-induced BV-2 microglia activation.
   Conclusion: HT can excessively penetrate the BBB and be mostly distributed in the hippocampus of depressive mice, which contribute to improve fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism in the hippocampus with region-specific responses and accompanying inhibition of C3-CD11b pathway for microglia activation. These findings give the clearer understanding of brain regional pharmacokinetics of HT and its accompanying molecular mechanism against depression.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of enmein, an active constituent of Isodon japonicus Hara, on glutamate release in rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals (synaptosomes) and evaluated its neuroprotective potential in a rat model of kainic acid (KA)-induced glutamate excitotoxicity. Enmein inhibited depolarization-induced glutamate release, FM1-43 release, and Ca2+ elevation in cortical nerve terminals but had no effect on the membrane potential. Removing extracellular Ca2+ and blocking vesicular glutamate transporters, N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, or protein kinase C (PKC) prevented the inhibition of glutamate release by enmein. Enmein also decreased the phosphorylation of PKC, PKC-alpha, and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrates in synaptosomes. In the KA rat model, intraperitoneal administration of enmein 30 min before intraperitoneal injection of KA reduced neuronal cell death, glial cell activation, and glutamate elevation in the hippocampus. Furthermore, in the hippocampi of KA rats, enmein increased the expression of synaptic markers (synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95) and excitatory amino acid transporters 2 and 3, which are responsible for glutamate clearance, whereas enmein decreased the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD11b. These results indicate that enmein not only inhibited glutamate release from cortical synaptosomes by suppressing Ca2+ influx and PKC but also increased KA-induced hippocampal neuronal death by suppressing gliosis and decreasing glutamate levels by increasing glutamate uptake.

AB  - Learning and memory formation rely on synaptic plasticity, the process that changes synaptic strength in response to neuronal activity. In the tripartite synapse concept, molecular signals that affect synapse strength and morphology originate not only from the pre- and post-synaptic neuronal terminals but also from astrocytic processes ensheathing many synapses. Despite significant progress made in understanding astrocytic contribution to synaptic plasticity, only a few astrocytic plasticity-related proteins have been identified so far. In this study, we present evidence indicating the role of astrocyte-secreted Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) in neuronal plasticity. We show that Lcn2 expression is induced in hippocampal astrocytes in a kainate-evoked aberrant plasticity model. Next, we demonstrate that chemically induced long-term potentiation (cLTP) similarly increases Lcn2 expression in astrocytes of neuronal-glial co-cultures, and that glutamate causes the immediate release of Lcn2 from these cultures. Additionally, through experiments in primary astrocytic cultures, we reveal that Lcn2 release is triggered by calcium signaling, and we demonstrate that a brief treatment of neuronal-glial co-cultures with Lcn2 alters the morphology of dendritic spines. Based on these findings, we propose Lcn2 as an activity-dependent molecule released by astrocytes that influences dendritic spine morphology.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Age-related cognitive decline and neuroinflammation are significant contributors to neurodegenerative diseases. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, aging is often associated with "kidney deficiency," a concept linked to impaired bone marrow production and brain function. Epimedii Folium and Curculiginis Rhizoma (XY), a classic herbal pair used to tonify the kidney, are traditionally employed to enhance vitality, bone health, and cognitive function. While previous studies suggest XY's efficacy in pathological models, its impact on natural aging process requires further investigation. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of XY against cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in naturally aged mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: Network pharmacology was used to identify potential targets and pathways, while molecular docking assessed the binding interactions between active compounds from XY and key target proteins. Naturally aged mice were orally treated with XY (2.34, 4.68 g/kg/day) for 26 days. Cognitive function was assessed using behavioral tests. Histological analysis, ELISA, real-time PCR, and Western blotting were employed to evaluate hippocampal neuronal damage, inflammatory markers, senescence-related proteins, and NLRP3 inflammasome components. Results: Network pharmacology identified key targets and pathways associated with aging and neuroinflammation. Molecular docking confirmed strong binding affinities between active components (e.g., Icariin, Epimedin B, Epimedin C) and relevant protein targets. In vivo, XY treatment significantly improved cognitive performance, ameliorated hippocampal neuronal damage, and suppressed microglial activation in aged mice. Furthermore, XY downregulated the expression of senescence markers (p53, p21, p16, CDK6), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma), factors associated with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and key components indicative of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1 beta). Conclusions: XY alleviates age-related cognitive decline and neuroinflammation in naturally aged mice. These beneficial effects are mediated, at least in part, by reducing inflammatory mediators, modulating microglial activation, attenuating cellular senescence pathways, and suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of XY for managing age-related cognitive impairment and associated neuroinflammation.

AB  - With prolonged ethanol ingestion, disturbances in the emotional spectrum develop, and memory problems are noted. These symptoms could be mediated by the development of neurochemical changes in the hippocampus of the brain. Although there is evidence that hippocampus is vulnerable to chronic alcohol intoxication and that neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration develop in this brain region, the key molecular mechanisms have not been identified. The aim of the study was to investigate changes in the immune system in the periphery as well as in the hippocampus of rat brain during ethanol exposure and during pharmacological correction with azithromycin (AZM). Long-term ethanol exposure was modeled by injecting rats with a 20% ethanol solution (4 g/kg) for 4 weeks. General biochemical and clinical blood analysis was performed in animals. Expression levels of the cytokine genes (Il1 beta, Ccl2, Il6, Il11, Il13, Tnf alpha, Tgf beta), Toll-like receptor system genes (Tlr3, Tl4, Tlr7, Nfkb1, Hmgb1), and TLR system-related microRNA molecules (miR-182, miR-155-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-let-7b) were evaluated in the hippocampus. IL-1 beta protein content was also assessed in the hippocampus. Prolonged exposure to alcohol caused increase in the mRNA and protein levels of IL-1 beta, and decrease in the mRNA levels of Tnf alpha, Il11, Tlr3, and Tlr7. The contents of miRlet7b, miR96, and miR155 were downregulated in the hippocampus after long-term alcohol exposure. Elevated levels of THE Il1 beta mRNA and protein and Hmgb1 mRNA were maintained under conditions of ethanol abstinence. The Tlr3 mRNA levels were decreased after abstinence. Administration of AZM reduced the IL1 beta, TLR3, and HMGB1 mRNA levels under conditions of ethanol abstinence; and at higher doses of the drug decrease in the IL-1 beta protein levels in the hippocampus of rat brain was observed. Thus, the study provided new insights into the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus during prolonged exposure to ethanol and upon abstinence. The obtained results allowed us to suggest a number of tasks for further studies in this direction.

AB  - This paper explored the potential mediating role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the oxytocin (OT) systems in hemorrhagic shock (HS) and/or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Morbidity and mortality after trauma mainly depend on the presence of HS and/or TBI. Rapid "repayment of the O-2 debt" and prevention of brain tissue hypoxia are cornerstones of the management of both HS and TBI. Restoring tissue perfusion, however, generates an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury due to the formation of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species. Moreover, pre-existing-medical-conditions (PEMC's) can aggravate the occurrence and severity of complications after trauma. In addition to the "classic" chronic diseases (of cardiovascular or metabolic origin), there is growing awareness of psychological PEMC's, e.g., early life stress (ELS) increases the predisposition to develop post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD) and trauma patients with TBI show a significantly higher incidence of PTSD than patients without TBI. In fact, ELS is known to contribute to the developmental origins of cardiovascular disease. The neurotransmitter H2S is not only essential for the neuroendocrine stress response, but is also a promising therapeutic target in the prevention of chronic diseases induced by ELS. The neuroendocrine hormone OT has fundamental importance for brain development and social behavior, and, thus, is implicated in resilience or vulnerability to traumatic events. OT and H2S have been shown to interact in physical and psychological trauma and could, thus, be therapeutic targets to mitigate the acute post-traumatic effects of chronic PEMC's. OT and H2S both share anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and vasoactive properties; through the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway, where their signaling mechanisms converge, they act via the regulation of nitric oxide (NO).

AB  - Implant-based breast reconstruction is a common standard of care for breast cancer patients following mastectomy. To support implant weight and placement, surgeons utilize autologous tissues, acellular dermal matrices (ADMs), or synthetic meshes. While ADMs provide structural support, they present significant risks, including infection transmission and seroma. Conversely, synthetic meshes exhibit poor cellular adhesion, leading to inadequate tissue integration. To address these challenges, there is a need for a matrix that enhances tissue integration while minimizing infection risks and other complications. Silk fibroin (SF), a natural biopolymer, possesses excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties. This study introduces a novel engineered silk matrix (ESM) as an advanced solution for soft tissue regeneration, specifically in breast reconstruction surgery. The present study establishes the safety of ESM and evaluates its potential a tissue regeneration matrix through extensive in-vitro and in-vivo analyses. In-vitro assays demonstrated superior cellular adhesion, proliferation of human mammary fibroblast cells (HMFCs), collagen deposition and angiogenesis in ESM compared to collagen matrices and ADMs. Safety assessments, conducted in accordance with ISO 10993 guidelines, confirmed noncytotoxic nature of ESM. Furthermore, subcutaneous implantation revealed no systemic toxicity or adverse tissue reactions. In-vivo studies utilizing a Yorkshire pig model of simulated breast reconstruction surgery, demonstrated superior performance of ESM over collagen matrices in tissue regeneration. The findings showed enhanced fibroblast density, increased collagen deposition, and improved vascularization. These results suggest that ESM is a safer and more effective alternative to ADMs in breast reconstruction, with the potential to revolutionize post-mastectomy care for breast cancer patients.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide but has no effective treatment. Amyloid beta (A beta) protein, a primary risk factor for AD, accumulates and aggregates in the brain of patients with AD. Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) has been identified as a receptor of A beta and A beta-PirB molecular interactions that cause synapse elimination and synaptic dysfunction. PirB deletion has been shown to suppress A beta-induced synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits in AD model mice, implying that PirB mediates A beta-induced AD pathology. Therefore, inhibiting the A beta-PirB molecular interaction could be a successful approach for combating AD pathology. We previously showed that lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) is an endogenous antagonist of type1 Nogo receptor and PirB and that LOTUS overexpression promotes neuronal regeneration following damage to the central nervous system, including spinal cord injury and ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether LOTUS inhibits A beta-PirB interaction and A beta-induced dendritic spine elimination. Methods:The inhibitory role of LOTUS against A beta-PirB (or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2: LilrB2) binding was assessed using a ligand-receptor binding assay in Cos7 cells overexpressing PirB and/or LOTUS. We assessed whether LOTUS inhibits A beta-induced intracellular alterations and synaptotoxicity using immunoblots and spine imaging in a primary cultured hippocampal neuron. Results: We found that LOTUS inhibits the binding of A beta to PirB overexpressed in Cos7 cells. In addition, we found that A beta-induced dephosphorylation of cofilin and A beta-induced decrease in post-synaptic density-95 expression were suppressed in cultured hippocampal neurons from LOTUS-overexpressing transgenic (LOTUS-tg) mice compared with that in wild-type mice. Moreover, primary cultured hippocampal neurons from LOTUS-tg mice improved the A beta-induced decrease in dendritic spine density. Finally, we studied whether human LOTUS protein inhibits A beta binding to LilrB2, a human homolog of PirB, and found that human LOTUS inhibited the binding of A beta to LilrB2 in a similar manner. Conclusions: This study implied that LOTUS improved A beta-induced synapse elimination by suppressing A beta-PirB interaction in rodents and inhibited A beta-LilrB2 interaction in humans. Our findings revealed that LOTUS may be a promising therapeutic agent in counteracting A beta-induced AD pathologies.

AB  - Lon protease 1 (LONP1) is a highly conserved serine peptidase that plays an important role in the protein quality control system in mammalian mitochondria. LONP1 catalyzes the degradation of oxidized, dysfunctional, and misfolded matrix proteins inside mitochondria and regulates mitochondrial gene expression and genome integrity. Therefore, LONP1 is up-regulated and suppresses cell death in response to oxidative stress, heat shock, and nutrient starvation. On the other hand, translocation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and active caspase-3 into mitochondria is involved in apoptosis of parvalbumin (PV) cells (one of the GABAergic interneurons) and necrosis of CA1 neurons in the rat hippocampus, respectively, following status epilepticus (SE). In the present study, we investigated whether LONP1 may improve neuronal viability to prevent or ameliorate translocation of active caspase-3 and HMGB1 in mitochondria within PV and CA1 neurons. Following SE, LONP1 expression was up-regulated in mitochondria of PV and CA1 neurons. LONP1 knockdown deteriorated SE-induced neuronal death with mitochondrial accumulation of active caspase-3 and HMGB1 in PV cells and CA1 neurons, respectively. LONP1 knockdown did not affect the aberrant mitochondrial machinery induced by SE. Therefore, our findings suggest, for the first time, that LONP1 may contribute to the alleviation of mitochondrial overloads of active caspase-3 and HMGB1, and the maintenance of neuronal viability against SE.

AB  - With the extensive application of data analysis in various parts of the landscape design process, Building Information Modeling (BIM), City Information Modeling (CIM), and Landscape Information Modeling (LIM) all aim to achieve key data sharing and collaboration in the whole cycle and promote the development of smart cities. Landscape element indicators are complex, diverse, and difficult to quantify, which is one of the reasons for the slow development of LIM. However, with the development requirements of LIM, quantifying landscape elements and transforming landscapes into digital landscape information has become a hot spot in the landscape design industry. Landscape parametric design aims to transform the design elements into quantifiable parameters, obtain the design scheme by changing the value of the parameters, and form the design results based on digital information. It is one of the foundations of LIM. Based on the Rhino + Grasshopper (R+G) platform, this study takes Shuixizhuang Park as an example and establishes the parametric design approach for the park entrance. The approach involves several steps: (1) Confirming the boundary and key points of the park to prepare the basic data for parametric design. (2) Utilizing the Physarealm Algorithm Method (PAM) to simulate crowd paths, the Site Slope Algorithm Model (SSAM) to analyze terrain slope, the Road Intersection Algorithm Model (RIAM) to determine the scope of the park entrance area based on the national and local design codes, and the Crowd Density Algorithm Model (CDAM) and Crowd Convenience Algorithm Model (CCAM) to analyze the density and convenience of the crowd to preliminarily confirm the park entrance. (3) Meeting the basic requirements of the crowd and vehicle gathering and spread by using the Square Area Review Algorithm Model (SARAM) and Parking Lot Review Algorithm Model (PLRAM) to recheck the site area of the park entrance square and park lot to optimize the park entrance. This approach constructs several site analysis models based on the R+G platform and introduces PAM to analyze crowd activity paths, proposing a landscape parametric design method that integrates crowd activity and landscape design requirements. Compared with the classical design, the landscape parametric design derived from the comprehensive data analysis reduces human interference, is more scientific and practical, and better meets the requirements of people entering the park. The approach also provides ideas for other landscape parametric site selections. By adjusting the values of element parameters, the approach can also be applied to the site selection and design of other landscapes.

AB  - Elephant herding optimization (EHO) has received widespread attention due to its few control parameters and simple operation but still suffers from slow convergence and low solution accuracy. In this paper, an improved algorithm to solve the above shortcomings, called Gaussian perturbation specular reflection learning and golden-sine-mechanism-based EHO (SRGS-EHO), is proposed. First, specular reflection learning is introduced into the algorithm to enhance the diversity and ergodicity of the initial population and improve the convergence speed. Meanwhile, Gaussian perturbation is used to further increase the diversity of the initial population. Second, the golden sine mechanism is introduced to improve the way of updating the position of the patriarch in each clan, which can make the best-positioned individual in each generation move toward the global optimum and enhance the global exploration and local exploitation ability of the algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, tests are performed on 23 benchmark functions. In addition, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Friedman tests with 5% are invoked to compare it with other eight metaheuristic algorithms. In addition, sensitivity analysis to parameters and experiments of the different modifications are set up. To further validate the effectiveness of the enhanced algorithm, SRGS-EHO is also applied to solve two classic engineering problems with a constrained search space (pressure-vessel design problem and tension-/compression-string design problem). The results show that the algorithm can be applied to solve the problems encountered in real production.

AB  - Over recent years, a growing number of bacterial species have become resistant to clinically relevant antibiotics. Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) having a potent antimicrobial activity and a negligible toxicity toward mammalian cells attract attention as new templates for the development of antibiotic drugs. Here, we mined genomes of all living Camelidae species and found a novel family of Bac7-like proline-rich cathelicidins which inhibited bacterial protein synthesis. The N-terminal region of a novel peptide from the alpaca Vicugna pacos named VicBac is responsible for inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis with an IC50 value of 0.5 mu M in the E. coli cell-free system whereas the C-terminal region allows the peptide to penetrate bacterial membranes effectively. We also found that the full-length VicBac did not induce bacterial resistance after a two-week selection experiment, unlike the N-terminal truncated analog, which depended on the SbmA transport system. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory action of VicBac and its N-terminal truncated variant on various human cell types was found by multiplex immunoassay. The presence of the C-terminal tail in the natural VicBac does not provide for specific immune-modulatory effects in vitro but enhances the observed impact compared with the truncated analog. The pronounced antibacterial activity of VicBac, along with its moderate adverse effects on mammalian cells, make this molecule a promising scaffold for the development of peptide antibiotics.

AB  - Three new alkaloids, hipporidine A ( 1 ), hipporidine B ( 2 ), and (-)-lobeline N -oxide ( 3 ), were discovered from the whole plant of Hippobroma longiflora together with five known compounds ( 4 - 8 ). Their 2,6-disubstituted piperidine structures were established based on the HRESIMS, NMR (COSY, HMBC, HSQC, NOESY), and UV spectroscopic data. Hipporidines A ( 1 ) and B ( 2 ) possess a rare 1,3-oxazinane moiety. Compound 3 is the N -oxide derivative of (-)-lobeline ( 6 ). Moreover, the absolute configuration of norlobeline ( 5 ) was established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Three major secondary metabolites ( 6 - 8 ) were evaluated for their neuroprotective effect against paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity. Consequently, pretreatment with compound 8 at a concentration of 1.0 mu M displayed significant attenuation on paclitaxel-damaged neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons without interfering with the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel on cervical cancer SiHa cells.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects over 69 million people annually worldwide, and those with pre-existing depression have worse recovery. The molecular mechanisms that may contribute to poor recovery after TBI with co-morbid depression have not been established. TBI and depression have many commonalities including volume changes, myelin disruption, changes in proliferation, and changes in glutamatergic signaling. We used a well-established animal model of depression, the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat, to elucidate changes after TBI that may influence the recovery trajectory. We compared the histological and molecular outcomes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus after experimental TBI using the lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) in the WKY and the parent Wistar (WIS) strain. We showed that WKY had exaggerated myelin loss after LFPI and baseline deficits in proliferation. In addition, we showed that while after LFPI WIS rats exhibited glutamate receptor subunit changes, namely increased GluN2B, the WKY rats failed to show such injury-related changes. These differential responses to LFPI helped to elucidate the molecular characteristics that influence poor recovery after TBI in those with pre-existing depression and may lead to targets for future therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Background: Wnt signaling plays key roles in cellular and physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration during development and tissue homeostasis in adults. This pathway can be defined as Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent or beta-catenin-independent or "non-canonical", both signaling are involved in neurite and synapse development/maintenance. Porcupine (PORCN), an acylase that o-acylates Wnt ligands, a major modification in secretion and interaction with its receptors. We use Wnt-C59, a specific PORCN inhibitor, to block the secretion of endogenous Wnts in embryonic hippocampal neurons (DIV 4). Under these conditions, the activity of exogenous Wnt ligands on the complexity of the dendritic tree and axonal polarity were evaluated
   Methods: Cultured primary embryonic hippocampal neurons obtained from Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (E18), were cultured until day in vitro (DIV) 4 (according to Banker ' s protocol) and treated with Wnt-C59 for 24 h, Wnt ligands were added to the cultures on DIV 3 for 24 h. Dendritic arbors and neurites were analysis by fluorescence microscopy. Transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 on DIV 2 of plasmid expressing eGFP and KIF5-Cherry was carried out to evaluate neuronal polarity. Immunostaining was performed with MAP1B and Tau protein. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with Wnt3a, beta-catenin and GSK-3 beta (p-Ser9). Quantitative analysis of dendrite morphology was carried out with ImageJ (NIH) software with Neuron J Plugin.
   Results: We report, here, that Wnt-C59 treatment changed the morphology of the dendritic arbors and neurites of embryonic hippocampal neurons, with decreases beta-catenin and Wnt3a and an apparent increase in GSK-3 beta (p-Ser9) levels. No effect was observed on axonal polarity. In sister cultures, addition of exogenous Wnt3a, 5a and 7a ligands rescued the changes in neuronal morphology. Wnt3a restored the length of neurites to near that of the control, but Wnt7a increased the neurite length beyond that of the control. Wnt5a also restored the length of neurites relative to Wnt concentrations.
   Conclusions: Results indicated that Wnt ligands, added exogenously, restored dendritic arbor complexity in embryonic hippocampal neurons, previously treated with a high affinity specific Porcupine inhibitor. We proposed that PORCN is an emerging molecular target of interest in the search for preclinical options to study and treat Wnt-related diseases.

AB  - Bio-based adhesives have shown promise in the engineered wood products industry, and there is a substantial growth of research on bio-based bonding agents. Wood is a renewable resource, and most of the engineered wood products are synthetic adhesive-bonded composites and laminates. Environmental concerns exist for the use of adhesives made from fossil fuels lowering the bio-content of the bonded wood products. Bio-based adhesives are getting more attention since they are environmentally friendly green products without any adverse effects on the environment. However, there is a remaining challenge for the industry to make them more effective than synthetic ones in terms of their mechanical properties and long-term durability. These adhesives, with different components such as cellulose, proteins, lignins, and tannins are adhesives which exhibit great potential for the bonding of specially engineered wood products. The modification of bio-based adhesives with different dispersing agents and cross-linkers can improve their strength and water resistance properties to compete with synthetic adhesives. The blending of proteins and carbohydrates can yield good bio-adhesives with acceptable adhesive properties. All these improvements of bio-based adhesives help us move towards 'sustainable' products where clean synthesis, biomass and water-based processing are highly desirable. Based on studies conducted in recent decades, the objective of this article is to review the production processes of adhesives from different bioresources, their necessary modification for improving properties and their utilization in the wood-based industries. Finding the research gaps would also help to hasten the research activities for applying these bio-based adhesives at the industrial scale.

AB  - Barley-koji is prepared by inoculating barley, a beneficial prebiotic source, with the fungi Aspergillus luchuensis mut. kawachii. In this study, the prebiotic effects of barley-koji on human colonic microbiota were evaluated in vitro compared with barley, using pig feces. The enzyme-resistant fraction of the following sample groups each was added to respective fermenters: cellulose, barley (Commander and beta 104), and barley-koji (Commander-koji and beta 104-koji). Short-chain fatty acid and ammonia-nitrogen production increased and decreased, respectively, in barley-koji and barley groups. Furthermore, the propionate concentration increased in the barley group, showing a positive correlation with the abundance of the genus Dialister. In the barley-koji group, however, acetate and n-butyrate concentrations increased during the early stages of incubation, and the relative abundance of the genus Megasphaera was higher than those of the other genera. Therefore, this study demonstrated that barley-koji might possess beneficial physiological properties for colonic fermentation, which differ from those of barley.

AB  - BackgroundOlfactory epithelial stem cells hold significant potential for treating olfactory dysfunction by facilitating tissue maintenance and repair. Understanding the inherent qualities of these stem cells is crucial for optimizing their therapeutic efficacy.MethodsOlfactory epithelial samples were collected from patients with deviated nasal septum (DNS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). These were cultured to form olfactory neurospheres (ONS), which were then analyzed for neural stem cell markers, neurotrophic factor production, and their ability to differentiate into olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). The regenerative efficacy of these ONS was tested in a methimazole-induced hyposmic mouse model, with the effects on cellular senescence, apoptosis, and proliferation in the olfactory epithelium assessed.ResultsBoth DNS- and CRS-derived ONS exhibited neural stem cell characteristics. DNS-ONS displayed superior self-renewal capacity and higher neurotrophic factor production compared to CRS-ONS, which showed impaired OSN maturation and lower neurotrophic factor levels. In vivo, DNS-ONS were more effective in restoring olfaction, as evidenced by reduced cellular senescence, decreased apoptosis, and increased cell proliferation in the OE of methimazole-induced hyposmic mice.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate ONS source for therapeutic applications, with DNS-ONS showing greater promise for olfactory epithelium repair and olfactory function restoration.

AB  - Alcohol is the most consumed and abused psychoactive drug globally, but the molecular mechanisms driving alcohol action and its associated behaviors in the brain remain enigmatic. Here, we have discovered a transmembrane protein TMEM132B that is a GABAA receptor (GABAAR) auxiliary subunit. Functionally, TMEM132B promotes GABAAR expression at the cell surface, slows receptor deactivation, and enhances the allosteric effects of alcohol on the receptor. In TMEM132B knockout (KO) mice or TMEM132B I499A knockin (KI) mice in which the TMEM132B-GABAAR interaction is specifically abolished, GABAergic transmission is decreased and alcohol-induced potentiation of GABAAR-mediated currents is diminished in hippocampal neurons. Behaviorally, the anxiolytic and sedative/hypnotic effects of alcohol are markedly reduced, and compulsive, binge-like alcohol consumption is significantly increased. Taken together, these data reveal a GABAAR auxiliary subunit, identify the TMEM132B-GABAAR complex as a major alcohol target in the brain, and provide mechanistic insights into alcohol-related behaviors.

AB  - Investigators conducting behavioral experiments often need precise control over the timing of the delivery of stimuli to subjects and to collect precise times of subsequent behavioral responses. Furthermore, investigators want fine-tuned control over how various multi-modal cues are presented. behaviorMate takes an 'Intranet of Things' approach, using a networked system of hardware and software components for achieving these goals. The system outputs a file with integrated timestamp-event pairs that investigators can then format and process using their own analysis pipelines. We present an overview of the electronic components and GUI application that make up behaviorMate as well as mechanical designs for compatible experimental rigs to provide the reader with the ability to set up their own system. A wide variety of paradigms are supported, including goal-oriented learning, random foraging, and context switching. We demonstrate behaviorMate's utility and reliability with a range of use cases from several published studies and benchmark tests. Finally, we present experimental validation demonstrating different modalities of hippocampal place field studies. Both treadmill with burlap belt and virtual reality with running wheel paradigms were performed to confirm the efficacy and flexibility of the approach. Previous solutions rely on proprietary systems that may have large upfront costs or present frameworks that require customized software to be developed. behaviorMate uses open-source software and a flexible configuration system to mitigate both concerns. behaviorMate has a proven record for head-fixed imaging experiments and could be easily adopted for task control in a variety of experimental situations.

AB  - Tachykinin receptor 3 (TACR3) is a member of the tachykinin receptor family and falls within the rhodopsin subfamily. As a G protein-coupled receptor, it responds to neurokinin B (NKB), its high-affinity ligand. Dysfunctional TACR3 has been associated with pubertal failure and anxiety, yet the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Hence, we have investigated the relationship between TACR3 expression, anxiety, sex hormones, and synaptic plasticity in a rat model, which indicated that severe anxiety is linked to dampened TACR3 expression in the ventral hippocampus. TACR3 expression in female rats fluctuates during the estrous cycle, reflecting sensitivity to sex hormones. Indeed, in males, sexual development is associated with a substantial increase in hippocampal TACR3 expression, coinciding with elevated serum testosterone and a significant reduction in anxiety. TACR3 is predominantly expressed in the cell membrane, including the presynaptic compartment, and its modulation significantly influences synaptic activity. Inhibition of TACR3 activity provokes hyperactivation of CaMKII and enhanced AMPA receptor phosphorylation, associated with an increase in spine density. Using a multielectrode array, stronger cross-correlation of firing was evident among neurons following TACR3 inhibition, indicating enhanced connectivity. Deficient TACR3 activity in rats led to lower serum testosterone levels, as well as increased spine density and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus. Remarkably, aberrant expression of functional TACR3 in spines results in spine shrinkage and pruning, while expression of defective TACR3 increases spine density, size, and the magnitude of cross-correlation. The firing pattern in response to LTP induction was inadequate in neurons expressing defective TACR3, which could be rectified by treatment with testosterone. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the intricate interplay between TACR3, sex hormones, anxiety, and synaptic plasticity. These findings highlight potential targets for therapeutic interventions to alleviate anxiety in individuals with TACR3 dysfunction and the implications of TACR3 in anxiety-related neural changes provide an avenue for future research in the field.

AB  - Introduction: Many socially significant diseases are associated with prenatal developmental disorders. Previously, we showed the pathological role of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1 in post-hypoxic reoxygenation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of prenatal severe hypoxia (PSH) on HIF1 alpha protein expression as well as on HIF1-dependent activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and anaerobic glycolysis in the hippocampus (HPC) of offspring that reached adulthood.Methods: PSH was induced during the critical period of fetal hippocampal formation on gestation days 14-16 in a hypobaric chamber (180 Torr, 5% oxygen, 3 hours). Subsequent studies were conducted on both the HPC of adult control and PSH rats under normal conditions, as well as in response to severe hypobaric hypoxia (SH) or psycho-emotional stress ("learned helplessness" model, LH). We evaluated HIF1 alpha protein levels using both immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques. The amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was also determined by western blotting. Colorimetric enzymatic assays were employed to analyze enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the concentration of lactate, NADPH, reduced glutathione (GSHred), and malonic dialdehyde (MDA).Results: We showed that PSH caused a stable increase in the content of HIF1 alpha protein in the HPC, which was accompanied by an increase in the efficiency of anaerobic glycolysis. This was confirmed by increased LDH activity and lactate concentration. At the same time, the amounts of G6PD, NADPH, and reduced glutathione decreased in the HPC of PSH rats, whereas the concentration of MDA, an oxidative stress marker, exceeded the control values. In a series of experiments using the LH or SH stress, it was shown that in the HPC of control rats, there was an increase in the amount of HIF1 alpha in response to stress, which was also accompanied by more efficient anaerobic glycolysis and decreased of PPP-dependent NADPH production, similar to the intact PSH rats. In PSH rats, emotional stress resulted in higher HIF1 alpha levels without affecting glycolysis or PPP.Conclusion: Therefore, the increased content and activity of the transcription factor HIF1 alpha in the HPC of adult rats exposed to prenatal hypoxia leads to an imbalance between glycolysis and PPP, which is accompanied by oxidative stress.

AB  - Post-myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro-robot mounted micro-needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI-acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF-laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

AB  - Wound healing involves the participation of platelets, growth factors, and other mediators. In this context, the properties of the dressing play a crucial role in tissue regeneration. To address this need, functionalized alginate hydrogels were developed with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and condensed tannins (TA) extracted from the bark of Pinus radiata for use as wound dressings. The hydrogels were physicochemically characterized, including assessments of their antioxidant, antibacterial, in vitro, and in vivo wound-healing properties. A polyelectrolyte layer was detected on the surfaces of the Alg/rGO4.5 hydrogels, composed of C-C/C-H bonds (39.9 %), which prevented fiber relaxation during swelling and reduced the density of negative charges on the surface (-46.8 mV), thereby increasing the hydrophobicity of the hydrogel (92.3 degrees). The electrical conductivity of the hydrogels significantly increased with the addition of rGO, reaching values of up to 27.7 mS/m, a property that is important for promoting cell migration in the wound-healing process. Additionally, the TA release reached 26.4 % in Alg/ rGO9/TA9, enhancing the antioxidant capacity of the material (46.0 +/- 5.8 mg TE/100 g). The TA exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli and supported cell viability, achieving a rate of 145 %, indicating notable cell regeneration. In vivo studies conducted on Yorkshire pigs showed that the Alg/rGO9/TA9 hydrogels achieved complete wound closure in 21 days and demonstrated superior tissue regeneration compared to a commercial dressing. Histologically, the functionalized hydrogel promoted better re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation, highlighting the potential of these hydrogels as wound dressings. This study underscores the importance of hydrogel functionalization in enhancing their properties and applicability in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Background: Astrocytes play a vital role in offering functional support for neurons, which are related to the pathogenic mechanism of depression. Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) is demonstrated with antidepressant-like activities.
   Purpose: We aimed to investigate whether GRb1 can inhibit mitophagy-mediated astrocytic pyroptosis to protect neurons in depression.
   Study Design: Model rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for determining the in vivo antidepressant activity of GRb1.
   Methods: The mitophagy-mediated antipyroptosis role of GRb1 was assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + ATP-stimulated astrocytes. The mechanism by which GRb1 protects synaptic plasticity was investigated using hippocampal neurons incubated in an astrocyte medium. The rat depressive-like behaviors were determined through sucrose preference, forced swimming, and the open-field tests. Escitalopram was used in the anti-depression control of GRb1. Cyclosporin A (CsA), a mitophagy inhibitor, and interleukin (IL)-1 beta were used to reverse the role of GRb1 in mitophagy and pyroptosis, respectively.
   Results: GRb1 inhibited LPS-induced inflammation and activation in the astrocytes and repressed nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) pathway. Also, GRb1 repressed LPS + ATP-promoted astrocytic pyroptosis. During GRb1 treatment, the activation of mitophagy with a decrease in ROS was observed in LPS + ATPs-stimulated astrocytes. CsA enhanced GRb1-decreased ROS and promoted astrocytic pyroptosis. The GRb1-treated astrocyte medium suppressed neuron death and increased neuron viability and synaptic density. Escitalopram and GRb1 improved the depressive-like behaviors of the rats. GRb1 activated mitophagy and inhibited astrocytic activation and pyroptosis in rats with depression. It also reduced impairments in synaptic structures and increased synaptic density in depressive-like rats. IL-1 beta increased astrocytic pyroptosis and reversed GRb1-enhanced synaptic plasticity in the rats exposed to CUMS. There were no statistical changes in depressive-like behaviors between GRb1 and Escitalopram groups.
   Conclusion: GRb1 modulates mitophagy and the NF-kappa B pathway to inhibit astrocytic pyroptosis, thereby maintaining neurological homeostasis by repressing inflammation and enhancing synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The recent discovery of new innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) has revolutionized the field of allergies. Since most allergic diseases induce a type 2 immune response, Th2 cells, which produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in an antigen-dependent manner, in addition to basophils and mast cells which are activated by antigen-specific IgE, are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis. However, since group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) produce type 2 cytokines (i.e., IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, GM-CSF, and amphiregulin) in response to various cytokines, including IL-33 in the surrounding environment, the possibility has emerged that there are two types of allergies: allergies induced in an antigen-dependent manner by Th2 cells and allergies induced in an antigen-independent manner by ILC2s. In order to make an impact on the increasing incidence of allergic diseases in the world, it is essential to research and develop new treatments that focus not only on Th2 cells but also on ILC2s. In this chapter, the role of ILCs in allergic diseases, which has rapidly changed with the discovery of ILCs, is discussed, focusing mainly on ILC2s.

AB  - Clinical depression is of great medical and social importance. At the moment, it is believed that chronic stress is a significant risk factor in the occurrence of depression. In a series of studies, it has been found that the dopamine (DA)ergic system of the brain and its pathways can take part in the reaction to chronic stress, and, accordingly, in the processes of formation and course of depressive episodes. In this regard, the goal of this work was to study the change in expression of both the DA receptor gene Drd2 and Drd2-dependent genes (Bdnf, Ntrk2, Slc6a3, Pdyn, and Per2) in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra of rats with chronic blockade of D-2 receptors by haloperidol, using it as a potential pharmacological model of depression. The study was conducted on 45 male Wistar rats with a potential haloperidol-induced model of depression. The relative level of expression of Drd2-dependent genes was analyzed by real-time PCR based on TaqMan technology. As a result of the work, it was shown that chronic administration of haloperidol inhibits the expression of the Bdnf, Slc6a3, and Per2 genes in the prefrontal cortex and Pdyn in the hippocampus, leading to a decrease in the activity of stress adaptation mechanisms in the DAergic system of the brain and the development of a depressive-like phenotype. In addition, we also showed that even slight chronic stress in a shortened forced swimming test (without haloperidol administration) affects the expression of the genes of interest that we have chosen. All genes studied, one way or another, took part in the depression-related stress response; however, Bdnf and Ntrk2 apparently played the most important role. Thus, in the course of this work, it was shown that chronic blockade of D-2 receptors by haloperidol leads to the formation of a depressive-like phenotype in rats and affects the expression of genes involved in the development of depression.

AB  - In this study, the distinct patterns of glial response and neurodegeneration within the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus were examined in 5XFAD mice at 6 and 12 months of age. The primary feature of this transgenic mouse model is the rapid onset of amyloid pathology. We employed quantitative assessments via immunohistochemistry, incorporating double staining techniques, followed by observation with light microscopy and subsequent digital analysis of microscopic images. We identified significantly increased A beta deposition in these three hippocampal regions at 6 and 12 months of transgenic mice. Moreover, the CA1 and CA3 regions showed higher vulnerability, with signs of reactive astrogliosis such as increased astrocyte density and elevated GFAP expression. Additionally, we observed a significant rise in microglia density, along with elevated inflammatory markers (TNF alpha) in these hippocampal regions. These findings highlight a non-uniform glial and neuronal response to A beta plaque deposition within the hippocampal regions of 5xFAD mice, potentially contributing to the neurodegenerative and memory deficit characteristics of Alzheimer's disease in this model.

AB  - Exocytosis is a fundamental process used by eukaryotes to regulate the composition of the plasma membrane and facilitate cell-cell communication. To investigate exocytosis in neuronal morphogenesis, previously we developed computational tools with a graphical user interface to enable the automatic detection and analysis of exocytic events from fluorescence timelapse images. Although these tools were useful, we found the code was brittle and not easily adapted to different experimental conditions. Here, we developed and validated a robust and versatile toolkit, named pHusion, for the analysis of exocytosis, written in ImageTank, a graphical programming language that combines image visualization and numerical methods. We tested pHusion using a variety of imaging modalities and pH-sensitive fluorophores, diverse cell types and various exocytic markers, to generate a flexible and intuitive package. Using this system, we show that VAMP3-mediated exocytosis occurs 30-times more frequently in melanoma cells compared with primary oligodendrocytes, that VAMP2-mediated fusion events in mature rat hippocampal neurons are longer lasting than those in immature murine cortical neurons, and that exocytic events are clustered in space yet random in time in developing cortical neurons.

AB  - To investigate if the artificial delivery of microRNAs naturally present in the breastmilk can impact the gut and brain of young rats according to weaning. Animals from a new transgenic rat line expressing the green-fluorescent protein in the endocrine lineage (cholecystokinin expressing cells) received a single oral bolus of miR-320-3p or miR-375-3p embedded in DiOleyl-Succinyl-Paromomycin (DOSP) on D-12. The pups were weaned early (D-15), or regularly (D-30). The expression of relevant miRNA, mRNAs, chromatin complexes, and duodenal cell density were assessed at 8 h post-inoculation and on D-45. The miR-320-3p/DOSP induced immediate effects on H3K4me3 chromatin complexes with polr3d promoter (p < 0.05). On regular weaning, on D-45, miR-320-3p and 375-3p were found to be downregulated in the stomach and upregulated in the hypothalamus (p < 0.001), whereas miR-320-3p was upregulated in the duodenum. After early weaning, miR-320-3p and miR-375-3p were downregulated in the stomach and the duodenum, but upregulated in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Combination of miR-320-3p/DOSP with early weaning enhanced miR-320-3p and chromogranin A expression in the duodenum. In the female brain stem, miR-320-3p, miR-504, and miR-16-5p levels were all upregulated. Investigating the oral miRNA-320-3p loads in the duodenal cell lineage paved the way for designing new therapeutics to avoid unexpected long-term impacts on the brain.

TI  - RETRACTED: Colostomy Delays Cell Loss in the Brain and Improves Juvenile Survival in a Neonatal Rat Model of Hirschsprung's Disease (Retracted Article)
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
LA  - English
AB  - Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital malformation characterized by the absence of enteric ganglia in the distal intestine and gut obstruction. Our previous study indicates the brain pathology during the disease progression. A subpopulation of Hirschsprung's disease patients is also associated with anomalies of the central nervous system. In the investigation, we studied a rat model of Hirschsprung's disease, known as spotting lethal (sl/sl) ETB-/- rats, which carries a spontaneous deletion in endothelin receptor B (human gene name: EDNRB) and manifests a similar phenotype as humans with Hirschsprung's disease. Homozygous mutant sl/sl rats were successfully rescued from premature death by performing colostomy and dramatically survived to their juvenile age. By the body weight measured, their body growth was not revealed to be significantly different between ETB-/- and wildtype ETB+/+ or heterozygous (+/sl) ETB+/- groups while all underwent the same colostomy. Cell loss was investigated in several brain regions by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay (TUNEL) in ETB+/+, ETB-/-, and ETB+/- rats. Number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cerebellum and the hippocampus of ETB-/- rats was significantly increased compared with that of the ETB+/+ and ETB+/- rats. TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the molecular layer and granular cell layers of the cerebellum. In contrast, no significant difference in the density of TUNEL-positive cells was revealed in the cerebral cortex. These results suggest that either endothelin receptor B sl mutation or colostomy has predominant lasting effects on the cell survival/loss in the cerebellum and hippocampus of adult ETB-/- rats. Our findings provide the information on cellular changes in the brains of patients with Hirschsprung's disease due to congenital EDNRB mutation as well as clinically relevant interventions.

AB  - Foods consumed by living organisms contain antioxidants of different antioxidant capacities. In a mixture of antioxidants, the resultant antioxidant potential can be different from the mathematical sum of antioxidant activities exerted by individual components. The possible interactions include synergism, antagonism, and additivity between the bioactive compounds. The study was focused on the synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions of bioactive components on antioxidant activity in a ternary mixture of green tea (Camellia sinensis) with the added bee honey and Citrus limonum extract. The resultant antioxidant activity was assessed in terms of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Green tea brew held at each temperature with bee honey added and bee honey with Citrus limonum extract added were analyzed for the TPC, TFC, and TEAC. The observed values of TPC, TFC, and TEAC of the binary and ternary mixtures were compared with the expected values or the mathematical sum of each TPC, TFC, and TEAC of individual ingredients. The TPC and TEAC of each sample demonstrated synergism where the effect was antagonistic on TFC. Each sample demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.05) in all TPC, TFC, and TEAC. The impact of the temperature of green tea brew at which the additives were added, particularly room (29 degrees C) and chilling temperatures (7 degrees C), was addressed considering the effect of additive and temperature collectively on the resultant antioxidant activity.

AB  - Phosphatidylserine (PS) improves learning and memory capacity. In this study, PS formulation was optimized by a response surface methodology. Moreover, we found that PS not only functions as a biologically active component in food preparations but also improves the emulsion's physical stability. Our results showed that the PS emulsions are characterized by a smaller particle size, higher zeta-potential (negative), higher viscosity, and lower surface tension and centrifugal stability constants than the emulsion without PS. Furthermore, we explored the neuroprotective effects of PS emulsion and its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with 2% (w/w) PS emulsion for three months enhanced spatial learning and memory in 5-and 12-week old mice in the Morris water maze test. Western-blotting analysis displayed that the 2% (w/w) PS emulsion treated group upregulated BDNF, TrkB, PSD95, mTOR, MBP, and ErbB4 expression in the hippocampus of 5-and 12-week old mice. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed elevated Nrg-1 and ErbB4 mRNA expression in the 2% (w/w) PS emulsion treated groups, and high Nrg-1 and ErbB4 expression levels were associated with better myelination. In conclusion, we reported PS emulsions with high stability and high bioavailability. Meanwhile, 2% (w/w) PS emulsion enhances learning, memory, and myelination in mice by activating the BDNF/TrkB and Nrg-1/ErbB4 signaling.

AB  - Tolerance of tea clones to drought was evaluated in an irrigation trial, in terms of the percentage yield loss caused by absence of irrigation. There was a wide range of variation between clones, with consistent responses to two separate drought years and significant clone x irrigation interactions. The yield loss was correlated with a drought tolerance index (DTI), estimated from the yield in unirrigated plots in a drought year compared to the year before the drought. The DTI estimates do not require irrigation trials to be done, thus simplifying clone testing. A study of nearly 1000 clones and their parents showed that drought tolerance, as estimated by DTI, is a heritable characteristic. DTI and actual yield loss in the irrigation trial were not correlated with irrigated yield, indicating that drought tolerance may be selected for independently from actual yield.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, a distinctive woody oil-bearing species indigenous to China, is susceptible to anthracnose which significantly impacts both the quantity and quality of the oil produced. This study investigates the biological role of the CfRGS1 gene, a G protein signal regulator found in Colletotrichum fructicola, in order to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of this pathogen, which could be helpful for the control of anthracnose in Ca. oleifera. The identification and functional analysis of the G protein signaling regulator CfRgs1 in C. fructicola were conducted as part of this research. Our research demonstrated that the targeted deletion of the CfRGS1 gene in C. fructicola resulted in impaired growth and appressorium formation. Additionally, the mutants exhibited deficiencies in responding to cell wall integrity and oxidative stress, ultimately leading to decreased pathogenicity. This study highlights the significance of the G protein signaling pathway in the pathogenicity of C. fructicola, suggesting that targeting CfRgs1 could be a promising approach for the development of novel fungicides.

AB  - Numerous research projects focused on the management of acute pulmonary hypertension as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) might lead to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction related to acute respiratory distress syndrome. For that reason, inhalative therapeutic options have been the subject of several clinical trials. In this experimental study, we aimed to examine the hemodynamic impact of the inhalation of the SIN-1A formulation (N-nitroso-N-morpholino-amino-acetonitrile, the unstable active metabolite of molsidomine, stabilized by a cyclodextrin derivative) in a porcine model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Landrace pigs were divided into the following experimental groups: iNO (inhaled nitric oxide, n = 3), SIN-1A-5 (5 mg, n = 3), and SIN-1A-10 (10 mg, n = 3). Parallel insertion of a PiCCO system and a pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz) was performed for continuous hemodynamic monitoring. The impact of iNO (15 min) and SIN-1A inhalation (30 min) was investigated under physiologic conditions and U46619-induced acute pulmonary hypertension. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was reduced transiently by both substances. SIN-1A-10 had a comparable impact compared to iNO after U46619-induced pulmonary hypertension. PAP and PVR decreased significantly (changes in PAP: -30.1% iNO, -22.1% SIN-1A-5, -31.2% SIN-1A-10). While iNO therapy did not alter the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), SIN-1A administration resulted in decreased MAP and SVR values. Consequently, the PVR/SVR ratio was markedly reduced in the iNO group, while SIN-1A did not alter this parameter. The pulmonary vasodilatory impact of inhaled SIN-1A was shown to be dose-dependent. A larger dose of SIN-1A (10 mg) resulted in decreased PAP and PVR in a similar manner to the gold standard iNO therapy. Inhalation of the nebulized solution of the new SIN-1A formulation (stabilized by a cyclodextrin derivative) might be a valuable, effective option where iNO therapy is not available due to dosing difficulties or availability.

AB  - This experiment was designed to study mechanisms affecting growth of in vivo-derived (IVD) and in vitro-produced (IVP) fetuses of cattle. Day-7 IVD or IVP cattle blastocysts were transferred to recipients, with pregnant females being slaughtered on Days 90 or 180 of gestation or allowed to undergo parturition. Uteri and contents were dissected and physically measured, and maternal and fetal plasma and amniotic and allantoic fluids were collected for IGF-1 and IGF-2 determinations, and IGFBP profile characterization. Transcripts for IGF-1 and IGF-2 mRNA in placental and fetal tissues, and IGF-1r and IGF-2r in placentomes were determined. There was a greater fetal weight in the IVP group, which was associated with greater IGF-1 and IGF-2 concentrations in maternal circulation, and changes in IGFBP profiles within fetal fluids. Day-90 IVP-derived fetuses were longer, had greater organ weights, larger placentomes, less placentome IGF-2r mRNA transcript, and greater maternal IGF-1 and IGF-2 concentrations than controls. On Day 180 and at parturition tissues from IVP-derived fetuses/calves were from larger uteri, with larger placentomes/fetal membranes, fetuses/calves weighed more, had greater fetal hepatic IGF-2 mRNA transcript, had less fetal plasma IGF-1 and greater allantoic IGF-2 concentrations, greater and lesser IGFBP activities in the allantoic and amniotic fluids, respectively, and greater glucose and fructose accumulation in fetal fluids. Components of the IGF system were differentially regulated not only according to the gestation period (Days 90 or 180) and fluid type (maternal or fetal plasma, amniotic or allantoic fluids), but also based on conceptus origin (IVP or IVD) in cattle.

AB  - Yang et al. report a novel class of nuclear localization signals served by the family of WW domains, termed WW-NLS, to elucidate the nuclear import mechanism of YAP1 and thus propose a new strategy to interfere with YAP1-dependent cancer progression.
   The nuclear translocation of YAP1 is significantly implicated in the proliferation, stemness, and metastasis of cancer cells. Although the molecular basis underlying YAP1 subcellular distribution has been extensively explored, it remains to be elucidated how the nuclear localization signal guides YAP1 to pass through the nuclear pore complex. Here, we define a globular type of nuclear localization signal composed of folded WW domains, named as WW-NLS. It directs YAP1 nuclear import through the heterodimeric nuclear transport receptors KPNA-KPNB1, bypassing the canonical nuclear localization signal that has been well documented in KPNA/KPNB1-mediated nuclear import. Strikingly, competitive interference with the function of the WW-NLS significantly attenuates YAP1 nuclear translocation and damages stemness gene activation and sphere formation in malignant breast cancer cells. Our findings elucidate a novel globular type of nuclear localization signal to facilitate nuclear entry of WW-containing proteins including YAP1.

AB  - Triterpenoids from Camellia species comprise a diverse class of bioactive compounds with great therapeutic potential. However, triterpene biosynthesis in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) remains elusive. Here, we identified eight putative 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) genes (CsOSC1-8) from the tea genome and characterized the functions of five through heterologous expression in yeast and tobacco and transient overexpression in tea plants. CsOSC1 was found to be a beta-amyrin synthase, whereas CsOSC4, 5, and 6 exhibited multifunctional alpha-amyrin synthase activity. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis showed that the CsOSC6M259T/W260L double mutant yielded >40% lupeol, while the CsOSC1 W259L single mutant alone was sufficient for lupeol production. The V732F mutation in CsOSC5 altered product formation from friedelin to taraxasterol and psi-taraxasterol. The L254 M mutation in the cycloartenol synthase CsOSC8 enhanced the catalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis governing triterpene diversity in tea plants and offer potential avenues for OSC engineering.

AB  - Exposure to early-life stress (ELS) has been related to an increased susceptibility to psychiatric disorders later in life. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are still under investigation, glucocorticoid signaling has been proposed to be a key mediator. Here, we used two preclinical models, the prenatal stress (PNS) animal model and an in vitro model of hippocampal progenitor cells, to assess the long-term effect of ELS on FKBP5, NR3C1, NR3C2, and FoxO1, four stress-responsive genes involved in the effects of glucocorticoids. In the hippocampus of male PNS rats sacrificed at different time points during neurodevelopment (PND 21, 40, 62), we found a statistically significant up-regulation of FKBP5 at PND 40 and PND 62 and a significant increase in FoxO1 at PND 62. Interestingly, all four genes were significantly up-regulated in differentiated cells treated with cortisol during cell proliferation. As FKBP5 was consistently modulated by PNS at adolescence (PND 40) and adulthood (PND 62) and by cortisol treatment after cell differentiation, we measured a panel of miRNAs targeting FKBP5 in the same samples where FKBP5 expression levels were available. Interestingly, both miR-20b-5p and miR-29c-3p were significantly reduced in PNS-exposed animals (both at PND40 and 62) and also in the in vitro model after cortisol exposure. Our results highlight the key role of miR-20b-5p and miR-29c-3p in sustaining the long-term effects of ELS on the stress response system, representing a mechanistic link possibly contributing to the enhanced stress-related vulnerability to mental disorders.

AB  - With an increasing aging population and Alzheimer's disease tsunami, it is critical to identify early antecedents of brain aging to target for intervention and prevention. Women and men develop and age differently, thus using a sex differences lens can contribute to identification of early risk biomarkers and resilience. There is growing evidence for fetal antecedents to adult memory impairments, potentially through disruption of maternal prenatal immune pathways. Here, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines will have sex-dependent effects on specific brain circuitry regulating offspring's memory and immune function that will be retained across the lifespan. Using a unique prenatal cohort, we tested this in 204 adult offspring, equally divided by sex, who were exposed/unexposed to an adverse in utero maternal immune environment and followed into early midlife (similar to age 50). Functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines in utero (i.e., higher maternal IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels) was significantly associated with sex differences in brain activity and connectivity underlying memory circuitry and performance and with a hyperimmune state, 50 years later. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 alone, was not significantly associated with memory circuitry in midlife. Predictive validity of prenatal exposure was underscored by significant associations with age 7 academic achievement, also associated with age 50 memory performance. Results uniquely demonstrated that adverse levels of maternal in utero pro-inflammatory cytokines during a critical period of the sexual differentiation of the brain produced long-lasting effects on immune function and memory circuitry/function from childhood to midlife that were sex-dependent, brain region-specific, and, within women, reproductive stage-dependent.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of naringin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced jejunal barrier function in mice. Forty-five 3-week-old healthy male Balb/c mice with similar body weights were randomly divided into control group, LPS group, LPS + naringin group, with 15 mice in each treatment group. The mice were intraperitoneally injected with the same dose of saline or LPS (10 mg per kg BW) at 43 d. The blood samples, liver and jejunal tissues were collected after 3 h of injection. The results showed that LPS significantly increased the serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, d-lactate (d-LA) concentration, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in liver and jejunum, while decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and catalase (CAT) in liver and jejunum. The LPS treatment caused an increase in the crypt depth and a decrease in the villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (V/C) of the jejunum. In addition, the LPS treatment significantly increased the mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), while decreased mRNA expressions of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), occludin, claudin, mucin 2 (MUC2) and junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2), Gpx, SOD1, GST, CAT and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). However, the naringin treatment mitigated these effects induced by LPS. Taken together, our findings suggested that naringin attenuates LPS-induced intestinal barrier damage by inhibiting inflammatory factors and improving antioxidant function and intestinal tight junction, which might be mediated by activating the Nrf2 signaling and suppressing the TLR4/p38 MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling.

AB  - The majority of Nigerian population, particularly those living in rural communities can no longer afford animal protein in their daily meals due to the high cost of these products especially from conventional sources (cattle, sheep, and poultry) caused by high cost of feeds and feedingstuffs. This calls for dependence on alternative meat sources like rabbits which can survive mainly on forages with concentrates supplementation. Because of the high cost of maize, which is a source of energy in diets of rabbits, this study was therefore designed to evaluate the chemical composition of processed jackfruit seed meal and its feeding value as an alternative energy source. Bunches of jackfruits were harvested, the seed separated from the pulp and divided into four groups of 10kg each for fermentation. The maize cob solution prepared by mixing 100 gm of ash obtained after burning maize cob into 1 litre of distilled water in a plastic bowl was added to the first capped plastic bowl containing 10kg of cracked jackfruit seeds. The rumen digesta filtrate was poured into the second capped plastic bowl containing 10kg of jackfruit seed, and plain water was added to the jackfruit seed in the third bowl. Each sample was fermented at room temperature for 48 hours and thereafter rinsed, sun-dried, and milled using a 2 mm mesh hammer mill. Five diets were formulated with fermented jackfruit seed meals replacing maize in the control diet. Thirty-five weaned (ages between 4-5 weeks old), crossbred rabbits were used for the experiment. The experimental design employed was completely randomized. Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedures of GenStat 14th edition. The results showed that rumen digesta filtrate fermentation media increased the crude protein from 5.34% in the raw jackfruit seed meal to 7.10%. The rumen digesta filtrate media reduced (P <= 0.01) the concentration of phytates (3.17 +/- 0.56mg/100g), oxalates (34.10 +/- 0.58 mg/100g), tannins (1.64 mg/100g), relative to other media. Rabbits fed control diet recorded a significant (P <= 0.01) higher average daily weight gain (11.36g), which was similar to 10.75g for rabbits on rumen digesta filtrate fermented jackfruit seed meal (RDFFJM) diet. The feed conversion ratio of 3.80 recorded for rabbits on (RDFFJM) diet was superior (P=0.001) compared to those recorded for other treatment diets. Rabbits fed plain water fermented jackfruit seed meal recorded the highest percentage of protein (34.4+2.08), ash (32.0+1.15), and fibre (56.3+1.15) digestibility. Most of the haematological and serum biochemical parameters were within the normal ranges. It was concluded that the rumen digesta filtrate fermented jackfruit seed meal diet enhanced the performance of the growing rabbits relative to the maize-based diet and other treatment diets.

AB  - Dysregulation of Hippo signaling is observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Moreover, overactivation of YAP is crucial for tumor progression. Although the inhibitory phospho-cascade is functional, the reason for YAP hyperactivation in PAAD remains unclear. Recent studies have revealed that the ubiquitin modification of YAP also plays an important role in the Hippo/YAP axis and cancer progression. To gain a better understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the ubiquitination and deubiquitination of YAP, we carried out siRNA screening for critical deubiquitinases in PAAD. By using a deubiquitinase (DUB) library, we identified valosin-containing protein-interacting protein 1 (VCPIP1) as an important effector of YAP function and PAAD progression. Inhibition of VCPIP1 hampered PAAD progression via Hippo signaling. Clinical data revealed that VCPIP1 was elevated in PAAD and correlated with poor survival in PAAD patients. Biochemical assays demonstrated that VCPIP1 interacted with YAP, inhibiting K48-linked polyubiquitination and thereby increasing YAP stability. YAP directly binds to the VCPIP1 promoter region, enhancing its transcription in PAAD. Our study revealed a forward feedback loop between VCPIP1 and Hippo signaling in PAAD, indicating that VCPIP1 is a potential therapeutic drug target in PAAD.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9-based multiplex genome editing via electroporation is relatively efficient; however, lipofection is versatile because of its ease of use and low cost. Here, we aimed to determine the efficiency of lipofection in CRISPR/Cas9-based multiplex genome editing using growth hormone receptor (GHR) and glycoprotein alphagalactosyltransferase 1 (GGTA1)-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) in pig zygotes. Zona pellucida-free zygotes were collected 10 h after in vitro fertilization and incubated with Cas9, gRNAs, and Lipofectamine 2000 (LP2000) for 5 h. In Experiment 1, we evaluated the mutation efficiency of gRNAs targeting either GHR or GGTA1 in zygotes transfected using LP2000 and cultured in 4-well plates. In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of the culture method on the development, mutation rate, and mutation efficiency of zygotes with simultaneously double-edited GHR and GGTA1, cultured using 4-well (group culture) and 25-well plates (individual culture). In Experiment 3, we assessed the effect of additional GHR-targeted lipofection before and after simultaneous double gRNA-targeted lipofection on the mutation efficiency of edited embryos cultured in 25-well plates. No significant differences in mutation rates were observed between the zygotes edited with either gRNA. Moreover, the formation rate of blastocysts derived from GHR and GGTA1 double-edited zygotes was significantly increased in the 25-well plate culture compared to that in the 4-well plate culture. However, mutations were only observed in GGTA1 when zygotes were transfected with both gRNAs, irrespective of the culture method used. GHR mutations were detected only in blastocysts derived from zygotes subjected to GHR-targeted lipofection before simultaneous double gRNA-targeted lipofection. Overall, our results suggest that additional lipofection before simultaneous double gRNA-targeted lipofection induces additional mutations in the zygotes.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an important edible oil woody plant in China. Anthracnose is a serious disease of C. oleifera, causing severe economic losses and posing a huge threat to the C. oleifera industry. The fungi Colletotrichum siamense is one of the main pathogens causing anthracnose of C. oleifera. In this study, antifungal activity of microorganisms isolated from garbage enzyme against C. siamense were investigated for the first time. 8 strains were isolated and purified from garbage enzyme. By morphological observation, gene sequence analysis, among the strains, 4 isolates were identified as Trichoderma harzianum and 4 isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis. The result showed that 8 isolates displayed a relatively good potential on inhibiting the mycelial growth in C. siamense, but T. harzianum was more effective than B. subtilis as a biocontrol agent, with the best efficiency of 76.5%. In the vitro treatments, the combination of T. harzianum and B. subtilis were the most effective treatments in reducing the incidence and severity of anthracnose in C.oleifera, with the highest control efficiency of 77.56%. It can be concluded that T. harzianum and B. subtilis are promising biocontrol agents to manage anthracnose. These promising results provided valuable information on using garbage enzyme of wastes as a new source of antagonists to control fungi disease.

AB  - The rising incidence of neuroinflammation in modern society has garnered significant attention. Current research primarily focuses on dietary supplementation with edible fungi to mitigate cognitive impairment, but there is still a big gap. This study investigated the effects of Tricholoma matsutake powder (TP) and its primary bioactive components, proteins (TPT) and polysaccharides (TPS), on memory function in LPS-induced neuroinflammatory mice and also preliminarily explored the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that daily oral administration of TPT reversed cognitive and memory impairment caused by LPS in mice, alleviated Nissl body reduction, increased cholinergic system activity, and modulated oxidative stress. Furthermore, TPT mitigated the increase of intestinal permeability in LPS-induced mice, thereby modulating inflammation progression and its transmission to the hippocampus. It also enhances synaptic plasticity by regulating microglial and astrocyte activation. The protective mechanism of TPT on synaptic plasticity involves increasing dendritic spine density, particularly enhancing the proportion of mushroom spines, and mitigating synaptic ultrastructural damage. These findings suggest that T. matsutake mitigates memory impairment and that the relative amount of protein plays a more prominent prophylactic role. This provides valuable insights for developing nutritional products to prevent neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - BackgroundThe interrelationship between cellular metabolism and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process has made it an interesting topic to investigate the adjuvant effect of therapeutic diets in the treatment of cancers. However, the findings are controversial. In this study, the effects of glucose limitation along and with the addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB) were examined on the expression of specific genes and proteins of EMT, Wnt, Hedgehog, and Hippo signaling pathways, and also on cellular behavior of gastric cancer stem-like (MKN-45) and non-stem-like (KATO III) cells.Methods and resultsThe expression levels of chosen genes and proteins studied in cancer cells gradually adopted a low-glucose condition of one-fourth, along and with the addition of bHB, and compared to the unconditioned control cells. The long-term switching of the metabolic fuels successfully altered the expression profiles and behaviors of both gastric cancer cells. However, the results for some changes were the opposite. Glucose limitation along and with the addition of bHB reduced the CD44+ population in MKN-45 cells. In KATO III cells, glucose restriction increased the CD44+ population. Glucose deprivation alleviated EMT-related signaling pathways in MKN-45 cells but stimulated EMT in KATO III cells. Interestingly, bHB enrichment reduced the beneficial effect of glucose starvation in MKN-45 cells, but also alleviated the adverse effects of glucose restriction in KATO III cells.ConclusionsThe findings of this research clearly showed that some controversial results in clinical trials for ketogenic diet in cancer patients stemmed from the different signaling responses of various cells to the metabolic changes in a heterogeneous cancer mass.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a crippling condition that affects millions of elderly adults each year, yet there remains a serious need for improved methods of diagnosis. Metabolomic analysis has been proposed as a potential methodology to better investigate and understand the progression of this disease; however, studies of human brain tissue metabolomics are challenging, due to sample limitations and ethical considerations. Comprehensive comparisons of imaging measurements in animal models to identify similarities and differences between aging- and AD-associated metabolic changes should thus be tested and validated for future human non-invasive studies. In this paper, we present the results of our highresolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of AD and wild-type (WT) mouse models, based on animal age, brain regions, including cortex vs. hippocampus, and disease status. Our findings suggest the ability of HRMAS NMR to differentiate between AD and WT mice using brain metabolomics, which potentially can be implemented in in vivo evaluations.

AB  - Charles Livesey Walton (1881-1953) was born on the Isle of Man, but moved in childhood via Yorkshire to the south coast of Pembrokeshire (Wales). Later, having become a man of private means, he relocated to Devon. He was associated with the Marine Biological Laboratory of the United Kingdom in Plymouth from 1907 until 1912, where he developed expertise on sea anemones. His first publication was on these animals, in 1907 with Professor Herbert John Fleure of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he eventually gained employment in 1912. There, he changed course to work on various aspects of veterinary and agricultural zoology, themes he pursued at the University College of North Wales, Bangor. He considered his major contribution to have been his work there on "liver rot" (fasciolosis) in sheep, carried out from 1919 and during the economic depression of the 1920s. As a marine zoologist, he is probably best known for his co-authorship of The biology of the sea-shore (1922) with Frederick William Flattely. He moved from Bangor in 1927 to the Long Ashton Research Station, University of Bristol, as an agricultural entomologist. As part of a multidisciplinary team there, he developed and tested chemical treatments against a wide variety of plant pests and diseases. Retiring to St David's, Pembrokeshire, he catalogued plants of the peninsula. Walton apparently never married. The comprehensive bibliography presented here constitutes an appropriate memorial alongside his influential final book, Farmers' warfare (1947).

AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on preovulatory follicle (POF) turnover, prolificacy, and endocrine and metabolic milieu in Malpura sheep. Fifty cyclic ewes with 3-3.5 body condition scores on a five-point scale were allocated equally to two groups (n = 25) following estrus synchronization and were supplemented with 0.6 mL/kg body weight of n-3 PUFA-rich fish oil (FO) or palm oil (PO) as control, for 60 d following an acclimatization period of 7 d. All ewes were mated with sexually active rams at the end of the supplementation period. On ultrasonographic ovarian scanning at the last fourth estrus, the mean number of POFs was 77.8% greater (P < 0.01) in FO ewes than in the PO ewes. The proportion of ewes with multiple ovulations two months after the beginning of supplementation was 56% in the FO group as compared to 8% in the PO group. The number of fetuses was 46% higher (P < 0.01) in the FO than in the PO ewes at d 45 of gestation. At lambing, the twinning percent in the FO ewes was three times greater than in the PO ewes (27.3 vs. 9.1%). Plasma cholesterol, estradiol, and insulin concentrations were lower (P < 0.01) in ewes fed with FO than those offered PO group at the end of the feeding period. It was concluded that the dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFA-rich FO in well-fed Malpura ewes improved the number of follicles and ovulation rate which led to an increased prolificacy, accompanied by a reduction of plasma cholesterols, estradiol, and insulin.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and dry eye disease (DED) using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, and patients with an NPC diagnosis were included. Next, one NPC patient was matched to four non-NPC participants via demographic data and systemic comorbidities. In total, 4184 and 16,736 participants were enrolled in the NPC and non-NPC groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the development of DED one year after the diagnosis of NPC. Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of DED. In this study, 717 and 2225 DED cases were found in the NPC and non-NPC groups, respectively, and the NPC group showed a significantly higher incidence of DED development compared to the non-NPC group (aHR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.33-1.58, p < 0.0001) in the multivariable analysis. The other covariates that were positively correlated with DED development included age over 40 years, an education level higher than senior high school, hypertension, DM, allergic pulmonary diseases, allergic otolaryngologic diseases, and allergic dermatological diseases (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, the presence of NPC is an independent risk factor for subsequent DED.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of hCG or GnRH on structural changes of the corpora lutea (CL) and the regulation of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes involved in P-4 secretion in post-ovulatory (po-CL) and accessory CL (acc-CL). Sixty-four ewes were assigned to three groups receiving: 300 IU of hCG (hCG) or 4 mu g Buserelin (GnRH) or 1 mL of saline solution (Control) on Day (d) 4 post artificial insemination (FTAI). Laparoscopic ovarian were performed on d 4, 14 and, 21 post-FTAI to determine the numbers of CL. Blood samples were collected for serum LH and P-4 analysis. On d 14 post-FTAI, both CL were removed from the ovary to determine large luteal cell (LLC) number and to evaluate the expression of steroidogenic enzymes (HSD3B1, STAR, CYP11A1). Only hCG and GnRH treated ewes generated acc-CL. The LLC in both po- and acc-CL were significantly greater in the hCG group compared to GnRH and Control groups (P<0.05). Overall, hCG group showed the greatest immunodetection of HSD3B1and STAR in both po- and acc-CL (P<0.05). rnRNA expression of HSD3B1, STAR and CYP11A1 in the acc-CL tended to be greater in hCG group than in GnRH group (P<0.1). The LH concentration was increased in GnRH group (P<0.05) and P-4 concentration was greater in hCG group compared to the other groups (P<0.05). In conclusion, administration of hCG has a notably impact on acc-CL development and the expression of steroidogenic enzymes compared to GnRH treatment in ewes. This leads to elevated P-4 concentration and improved luteal function.

AB  - Slowing and/or reversing brain ageing may alleviate cognitive impairments. Previous studies have found that exercise may mitigate cognitive decline, but the mechanisms underlying this remain largely unclear. Here we provide unbiased analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data, showing the impacts of exercise and ageing on specific cell types in the mouse hippocampus. We demonstrate that exercise has a profound and selective effect on aged microglia, reverting their gene expression signature to that of young microglia. Pharmacologic depletion of microglia further demonstrated that these cells are required for the stimulatory effects of exercise on hippocampal neurogenesis but not cognition. Strikingly, allowing 18-month-old mice access to a running wheel did by and large also prevent and/or revert T cell presence in the ageing hippocampus. Taken together, our data highlight the profound impact of exercise in rejuvenating aged microglia, associated pro-neurogenic effects and on peripheral immune cell presence in the ageing female mouse brain.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic pathogen with a 36% case-fatality rate in humans. No vaccines or specific therapeutics are currently approved for use in humans or the camel host reservoir. Here, we computationally designed monomeric and homo-oligomeric miniproteins that bind with high affinity to the MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein, the main target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development. We show that these miniproteins broadly neutralize a panel of MERS-CoV S variants, spanning the known antigenic diversity of this pathogen, by targeting a conserved site in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The miniproteins directly compete with binding of the dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor to MERS-CoV S, thereby blocking viral attachment to the host entry receptor and subsequent membrane fusion. Intranasal administration of a lead miniprotein provides prophylactic protection against stringent MERS-CoV challenge in mice, motivating its future clinical development as a next-generation countermeasure against this virus with pandemic potential.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the association between thyroid diseases and chronic sinusitis (CRS) in a matched cohort in a study conducted within the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (2002-2015). A total of 6024 patients with CRS were 1:4-matched for age, sex, household income, and region of residence with 24,096 control participants. Effects of a previous history of thyroid disease, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, autoimmune thyroiditis, and Graves' disease, were investigated using conditional logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were performed in regard to the presence of nasal polyposis. A history of hypothyroidism (2.8% vs. 1.8%), hyperthyroidism (2.0% vs. 1.5%), thyroiditis (1.1% vs. 0.8%), autoimmune thyroiditis (0.4% vs. 0.3%), and Graves' disease (0.3% vs. 0.2%) was not more prevalent in the CRS group than in the control group according to univariate analysis (all p > 0.05). Hypothyroidism was associated with CRS in the multivariate-adjusted model (odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.57). In the subgroup analyses, thyroid diseases were not statistically significantly associated with CRS after being classified according to the presence or absence of nasal polyps. Additional studies are required to elucidate the relationship between thyroid diseases and CRS, as this may aid in screening and clinical decision making.

AB  - Simple Summary Regulation of synaptic plasticity through control of disinhibition is an important process in the prevention of excessive plasticity in both physiological and pathological conditions. Interneuron-selective interneurons, such as the ones expressing VIP in the hippocampus, may play a crucial role in this process. In this paper we showed that endogenous activation of VPAC(1)-not VPAC(2) receptors-exerts an inhibitory control of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in the hippocampus, through a mechanism dependent on GABAergic transmission. This suggests that VPAC(1)-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission at GABAergic synapses to interneurons will ultimately influence NMDA-dependent LTP expression by modulating inhibitory control of pyramidal cell dendrites and postsynaptic depolarization during LTP induction. Accordingly, the transduction pathways mostly involved in this effect were the ones involved in TBS-induced LTP expression like NMDA receptor activation and CaMKII activity. In addition, the actions of endogenous VIP through VPAC(1) receptors may indirectly influence the control of dendritic excitability by Kv4.2 channels. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), acting on both VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptors, is a key modulator of hippocampal synaptic transmission, pyramidal cell excitability and long-term depression (LTD), exerting its effects partly through modulation GABAergic disinhibitory circuits. Yet, the role of endogenous VIP and its receptors in modulation of hippocampal LTP and the involvement of disinhibition in this modulation have scarcely been investigated. We studied the modulation of CA1 LTP induced by TBS via endogenous VIP release in hippocampal slices from young-adult Wistar rats using selective VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptor antagonists, evaluating its consequence for the phosphorylation of CamKII, GluA1 AMPA receptor subunits and Kv4.2 potassium channels in total hippocampal membranes obtained from TBS stimulated slices. Endogenous VIP, acting on VPAC(1) (but not VPAC(2)) receptors, inhibited CA1 hippocampal LTP induced by TBS in young adult Wistar rats and this effect was dependent on GABAergic transmission and relied on the integrity of NMDA and CaMKII-dependent LTP expression mechanisms but not on PKA and PKC activity. Furthermore, it regulated the autophosphorylation of CaMKII and the expression and Ser(438) phosphorylation of Kv4.2 potassium channels responsible for the A-current while inhibiting phosphorylation of Kv4.2 on Thr(607). Altogether, this suggests that endogenous VIP controls the expression of hippocampal CA1 LTP by regulating disinhibition through activation of VPAC(1) receptors in interneurons. This may impact the autophosphorylation of CaMKII during LTP, as well as the expression and phosphorylation of Kv4.2 K+ channels at hippocampal pyramidal cell dendrites.

AB  - The MAP kinase ERK is important for neuronal plasticity underlying associative learning, yet specific molecular pathways for neuronal ERK activation are undetermined. RapGEF2 is a neuron-specific cAMP sensor that mediates ERK activation. We investigated whether it is required for cAMP-dependent ERK activation leading to other downstream neuronal signaling events occurring during associative learning, and if RapGEF2-dependent signaling impairments affect learned behavior. Camk2 alpha-cre+/-::RapGEF2fl/fl mice with depletion of RapGEF2 in hippocampus and amygdala exhibit impairments in context- and cue-dependent fear conditioning linked to corresponding impairment in Egr1 induction in these two brain regions. Camk2 alpha-cre+/-::RapGEF2fl/fl mice show decreased RapGEF2 expression in CA1 and dentate gyrus associated with abolition of pERK and Egr1, but not of c-Fos induction, following fear conditioning, impaired freezing to context after fear conditioning, and impaired cAMP-dependent long-term potentiation at perforant pathway and Schaffer collateral synapses in hippocampal slices ex vivo. RapGEF2 expression is largely eliminated in basolateral amygdala, also involved in fear memory, in Camk2 alpha-cre+/-::RapGEF2fl/fl mice. Neither Egr1 nor c-fos induction in BLA after fear conditioning, nor cue-dependent fear learning, are affected by ablation of RapGEF2 in BLA. However, Egr1 induction (but not that of c-fos) in BLA is reduced after restraint stress-augmented fear conditioning, as is freezing to cue after restraint stress-augmented fear conditioning, in Camk2 alpha-cre+/-::RapGEF2fl/fl mice. Cyclic AMP-dependent GEFs have been genetically associated as risk factors for schizophrenia, a disorder associated with cognitive deficits. Here we show a functional link between one of them, RapGEF2, and cognitive processes involved in associative learning in amygdala and hippocampus.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia in the elderly, with late-onset AD (LOAD) accounting for 95% of the cases. The etiology underlying LOAD, however, remains unclear. Using a humanized mouse model, we showed previously that exposure to ozone (O3), a potential environment risk factor, in a cyclic exposure protocol that mimics a human exposure scenario, accelerated AD-like neuropathophysiology in old humanized male ApoE3 (E3) but not ApoE4 (E4) mice. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques, we further demonstrate here that the ApoE genotype has the greatest influence on transcriptional changes, followed by age and O3 exposure. Notably, AD-related genes were expressed even at baseline and in young mice, but the differences in the expression levels are obvious in old age. Importantly, although both E3 and E4 mice exhibited some AD-related transcriptomic alterations, old E3 mice exposed to O3, which showed memory impairment, experienced more pronounced disruptions in the expression of genes related to redox balance, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and cellular senescence in the hippocampus, compared with O3-exposed old E4 mice. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying memory loss in O3-exposed old E3 male mice and emphasize the complexity of interactions between gene, environment, and aging in AD pathophysiology.

AB  - The mammalian brain relies on significant oxygen metabolic consumption to fulfill energy supply, brain function, and neural activity. In this study, in vivo electrochemistry is combined with physiological and ethological analyses to explore oxygen metabolic consumption in an area of the mouse brain that includes parts of the primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. The oxygen levels at different locations of this boundary section are spatially resolved by measuring the electrical current in vivo using ingeniously designed anti-biofouling carbon fiber microelectrodes. The characteristics of the current signals are further interpreted by simultaneously recording the physiological responses of the mice. Additionally, ethological tests are performed to validate the correlation between oxygen levels and mouse behavior. It is found that high-dose caffeine injection can evoke spatial variability in oxygen metabolic consumption between the four neighboring brain regions. It is proposed that the oxygen metabolic consumption in different brain regions is not independent of each other but is subject to spatial regulation control following the rules of "rank of brain region" and "relative distance." Furthermore, as revealed by in vivo wireless electrochemistry and ethological analysis, mice are at risk of neuronal damage from long-term intake of high-dose caffeine.

AB  - Nasal delivery has emerged as a non-invasive route to administer drugs for brain delivery. In particular, poly- electrolyte complexes-based nanocarriers have been demonstrated to be advantageous for nasal delivery of peptide drugs and vaccines. Pramlintide (Pram) is a peptide that emerges as a novel neuroprotective strategy to modify the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we examined the effects of the intranasal administration of dextran-pramlintide polyelectrolyte complex-coated nanoemulsions (PEC-NE DexS/Pram ) in an experimental model of AD induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of amyloid-beta (A(31-42) 1-42 ) peptide in mice. PEC-NE DexS/Pram displayed droplet size lower than 200 nm and a negatively charged surface. The locomotor activity of the animals was not affected by the i.c.v. A(3 1-42 injection or Pram treatment. On the other hand, the intranasal administration of PEC-NE DexS/Pram at a dose of 100 mu g/day for 14 consecutive days restored the impairment induced by A(3 1-42 injection in the discriminative learning and the short-term spatial reference memory of mice. However, Pram treatment did not alter the A(3 1-42-induced anhedonic behavior, oxidative stress parameters, or the pre-synaptic SNAP-25 and post-synaptic PSD-95 levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate cognitive-enhancing properties of intranasal Pram administration in an animal model of AD.

AB  - Glutamate receptor ion channels, including alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS. Previous work suggested thatAMPA receptors produce a synaptic current with a millisecond duration. However, we find that about two-thirds of principal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region also express AMPA receptors with reduced desensitization that can stay active for half a second after repetitive stimuli. These slow AMPA receptors are expressed at about half of the synapses, with a flat spatial distribution. The increased charge transfer from slow AMPA receptors allows short-term potentiation from a postsynaptic locus and reliable triggering of action potentials. Biophysical and pharmacological observations imply slow AMPA receptors incorporate auxiliary proteins, and their activation lengthens miniature synaptic currents. These data indicate that AMPA receptors are a major source of synaptic diversity. Synapses harboring slowAMPA receptors could have unique roles in hippocampal function.

AB  - The WIP proteins are essential for plant development, but their functions in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) remain poorly understood. In this study, six WIP members were identified in the tea plants and conducted a systematic analysis of their structure characteristics, expression patterns, promoter cis-acting elements, and functional roles. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CsWIP family contains members with characteristic C2H2 zinc finger domains. Expression analysis across different tissues revealed a constitutive expression pattern. Promoter cis-acting element analysis identified several key regulatory elements associated with growth, development, and stress responses, highlighting the potential regulatory roles of CsWIP genes. Subcellular localization studies showed that CsWIP proteins primarily localize in the nucleus. Overexpression of CsWIP3 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and increased lignin content, indicating its role in plant growth and lignification, with its function also validated in Solanum lycopersicum. Additionally, yeast two- hybrid assays identified interactions between CsWIP3 and CsTTG, CsAim32, and CsDUF1005, all of which are involved in regulating plant development, flower formation, and lignin biosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the functions of the CsWIP gene family in tea plants, revealing their functional diversity and potential applications in enhancing growth and development in tea plants.

AB  - Background: The neonatal mortality rate in Pakistan is thethird highest in Asia, with 8.6 million preterm babies. These newborns require warmth, nutrition, and infection protection, typically provided by incubators. However, the high maintenance and repair costs of incubators pose a barrier to accessibility for many premature and low birth weight neonates in low- and middle-income countries. This study aims to implement a context-specific kangaroo mother care (KMC) model in Sanghar within secondary health care facilities and catchment communities. Objective: This study aims to achieve at least 80% KMC coverage for premature and low birth weight neonates. Methods: This research uses a mixed methods design grounded in implementation science principles, with the goal of developing adaptive strategies tailored to district and facility managers, as well as health care workers, leveraging previous evidence on the benefits of KMC. The research is conducted in the district of Sanghar, Sindh with an emphasis on promoting KMC for infants weighing between 1200 and 2500 g in three facilities. It includes preimplementation data collection, training of health care providers and lady health workers, and intervention involving mother-baby skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding initiation, and postdischarge follow-ups. Ethical considerations and data management are prioritized, to improve KMC coverage and neonatal health outcomes. Results: This research will be implemented over a period of 18 months. The primary objective of this research is to achieve an 80% improvement in KMC coverage, with the secondary objectiveto promote optimal breastfeeding practices among postpartum mothers. Key indicators includethe proportion of eligible infants enrolled in KMC, the percentage of mother-baby pairs receiving skin-to-skin care postdischarge, and the duration of KMC during the neonatal period. Additionally, the study will assess exclusive breastfeeding rates, neonatal weight gain, and neonatal deaths within the cohort. The data management team will evaluate the effectiveness of the model in achieving the targeted KMC coverage. Conclusions: The integration of KMC into the health care system will provide valuable insights for policy makers regarding effective implementation and scaling strategies. The study's findings will highlight facilitators and barriers to KMC adoption, benefiting regions across Pakistan and globally. Additionally, these findings will offer valuable insights for the development of future newborn care programs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by rapid brain cell degeneration affecting different areas of the brain. Hippocampus is one of the earliest involved brain regions in the disease. Modern technologies based on high-throughput data have identified transcriptional profiling of several neurological diseases, including AD, for a better comprehension of genetic mechanisms of the disease. In this study, we investigated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of hippocampus of AD patients. The identified DEGs were submitted to Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and ClueGo to explore genes with a higher degree centrality and to comprehend their biological role. Subsequently, MCODE was used to identify subnetworks of interconnected DEGs. Our study found 40 down-regulated genes and 36 up-regulated genes as consensus DEGs. Analysis of the co-expression network revealed ACOT7, ATP8A2, CDC42, GAD1, GOT1, INA, NCALD, and WWTR1 to be genes with a higher degree centrality. ClueGO revealed the pathways that were mainly enriched, such as clathrin coat assembly, synaptic vesicle endocytosis, and DNA damage response signal transduction by p53 class mediator. In addition, we found a subnetwork of 12 interconnected genes (AMPH, CA10, CALY, NEFL, SNAP25, SNAP91, SNCB, STMN2, SV2B, SYN2, SYT1, and SYT13). Only CA10 and CALY are targets of known drugs while the others could be potential novel drug targets.

KW  - ANESTHESIA
AB  - Patients are usually highly stressed during the immediate perioperative period. It remains unclear whether increased stress contributes to postoperative brain dysfunction. Here, the clinical perioperative setting was mimicked via exploratory laparotomy and perioperative restraint stress. The stress response was assessed by measuring the levels of stress hormones and IL-6 in peripheral blood. Behaviors were evaluated with the open field, novel object recognition, and Barnes maze tests. We found that surgical stress and non-surgery-related stress synergistically trigger meningeal CD8(+)T cell accumulation, brain dysfunction, and increased stress hormone and IL-6 levels in the peripheral blood of adult mice, but simple surgical stress or non-surgery-related stress had no significant effect on these parameters. Limiting meningeal CD8(+) T cell accumulation with an anti-CD8 antibody alleviated the impact of surgery plus perioperative stress on brain function, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis. The partial elimination of microglia before surgery alleviated postoperative meningeal CD8(+) T cell accumulation, cognitive dysfunction, and decreased hippocampal chemotactic factor levels. Our findings indicate that the synergistic effect of surgical stress and non-surgery-related stress contributes to postoperative brain dysfunction by triggering meningeal CD8(+) T cell accumulation, suggesting the potential of limiting non-surgery-related stress as a preventive method for postoperative brain dysfunction.

AB  - This study focuses on the fabrication and characterization of alginate-based films functionalized by incorporating nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). The effect of different NLC/alginate mass ratios (R = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.35) on the physical, morphological, mechanical, and barrier properties of the calcium-alginate films was evaluated. The addition of the NLCs significantly improved the UV-absorbing properties, without greatly altering their trans-parent appearance. As the NLC concentration increased, the tensile strength, elastic modulus, and swelling ratio of the films decreased, while their thermal stability, water vapor permeability, and contact angle increased. Scan-ning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the films revealed that NLC incor-poration led to a more porous internal structure anda rougher surface. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis indicated that there were no new interactions between the calcium-alginate and NLC constituents within the films. Overall, this study shows that NLCs can be successfully incorporated into calcium-alginate films and used to modulate their physicochemical properties. In future, it will be useful to examine the potential of these films to incorporate hydrophobic bioactives such as drugs, nutraceuticals, antimicrobials, antioxidants, and pig-ments for specific pharmaceutical or food applications.

AB  - Running exercise has beneficial effects on brain health. However, the effects of relatively short-term running exercise (STEx) on behavior, and its underlying signaling pathways, are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the possibility that the regulation by STEx of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, encoded by NOS1), which are important molecules for anxiety regulation, might involve mechanisms of epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation. C57BL/6J male mice were divided into sedentary (SED, n = 12) and STEx (EX, n = 15) groups; STEx was conducted with the mice for a duration of 11 days. STEx reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and STEx reduced Nos1 alpha and increased Bdnf exon I and IV mRNA levels in the hippocampus. Interestingly, behavioral parameters were associated with Bdnf exon I and IV and Nos1 alpha mRNA levels in the ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampal region. However, STEx had no effect on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (Pgc-1 alpha) or fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (Fndc5) mRNA levels, which are relatively long-term exercise-induced upstream regulators of BDNF. In parallel with gene expression changes, we found, for the first time, that STEx downregulated Bdnf promoter IV and upregulated Nos1 DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus, and these patterns were partially different between the dorsal and ventral regions. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of running exercise on mood regulation may be controlled by alterations in epigenetic mechanisms, especially in the ventral hippocampus. These effects occur even after a relatively short-term period of exercise.

AB  - A variety of factors can cause vaginal loss. The patients are suffering from great psychological and physical pain, and there is an urgent need for vagina reconstruction. 3D-bioprinting is expected to achieve vaginal morphological restoration and true functional reconstruction. The current study aimed to explore the biomimetic 3D vagina tissue printing with acellular vagina matrix (AVM) bioink. The AVM from pig was converted to bioink by 15% gelatin and 3% sodium alginate mixed with the AVM solution. Rheology, scanning electron microscopy and HE staining were performed to characterize the bioink's viscosity, morphologies and biocompatibility. After printing, the viability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in the printed 3D scaffolds in vitro was investigated by a live/dead assay kit. Then, subcutaneous transplantation in rats were divided randomly into 3D scaffold group and 3D scaffold encapsulating CM-Dil-labeled BMSCs group. The results of HE, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining revealed that 3D scaffold encapsulating BMSCs expressed significant effects on the vascularization and epithelization of the printed vagina tissue, and the BMSCs could acquire the phenotype of vaginal epithelial cells and endothelial-like cells. The work showed that the biomimetic 3D vagina tissue with AVM bioink encapsulating BMSCs is a promising approach for vagina reconstruction.

AB  - Age-induced impairments in learning and memory are in part caused by changes to hippocampal synaptic plasticity during aging. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) are implicated in synaptic plasticity processes. mTOR is also well known for its involvement in aging. Recently, p75(NTR) and mTOR were shown to be mechanistically linked, and that p75(NTR) mediates age-induced impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Yet the consequences of p75(NTR)-mTOR interaction on hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and the role of mTOR in age-induced cognitive decline, are unclear. In this study, we utilize field electrophysiology to study the effects of mTOR inhibition and activation on long-term potentiation (LTP) in male young and aged wild-type (WT) mice. We then repeated the experiments on p75(NTR) knockout mice. The results demonstrate that mTOR inhibition blocks late-LTP in young WT mice but rescues age-related late-LTP impairment in aged WT mice. mTOR activation suppresses late-LTP in aged WT mice while lacking observable effects on young WT mice. These effects were not observed in p75(NTR) knockout mice. These results demonstrate that the role of mTOR in hippocampal synaptic plasticity is distinct between young and aged mice. Such effects could be explained by differing sensitivity of young and aged hippocampal neurons to changes in protein synthesis or autophagic activity levels. Additionally, elevated mTOR in the aged hippocampus could cause excessive mTOR signaling, which is worsened by activation and alleviated by inhibition. Further research on mTOR and p75(NTR) may prove useful for advancing understanding and, ultimately, mitigation of age-induced cognitive decline.

AB  - Lagarosiphon major (Ridl.) Moss ex Wager (Hydrocharitaceae) is a submerged freshwater plant native to South Africa, and a destructive invader of waterways across Europe, Australasia and the U.S.A. Native range exploration identified a leaf mining ephydrid fly, Hydrellia lagarosiphon, as a promising biological control candidate agent. Host specificity was conducted on H. lagarosiphon, using laboratory no-choice and paired choice tests. A number of non-target native Potamogeton species sustained feeding damage under no-choice and paired choice testing. To prevent rejection of a potentially safe agent, multi-generational population persistence trials were conducted on select native Potamogetonaceae. The non-target species could not sustain a viable H. lagarosiphon population beyond two generations. A risk assessment, incorporating the preference and relative survival, indicated that three non-target species presented extremely low (<1.3%) risk of sustaining damage relative to that of L. major. Potamogeton polygonifolius and P. x lanceolatus present a reproductive risk of 5.61% and 11.5% respectively but could not support a viable population beyond the 2nd generation. These results, coupled with damage efficacy and predicted colonisation, demonstrate the potential H. lagarosiphon has as a biological control agent for L. major in Ireland.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) is one of the important systems that regulate gastrointestinal function. The ENS is made up of enteric glial cells (EGCs) and neurons. For a long time, it was believed that the function of EGCs was only to give structural support to neurons. However, recent evidence indicates EGCs are involved in most gut functions, including the development and plasticity of the ENS, epithelial barrier, and motility. However, it remains unclear whether EGCs have the potential to modify colonic motility following irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D). This study aimed to investigate changes in EGCs during IBS-D and assessed the effects of manipulating EGCs. An IBS-D rat model was constructed using acetic acid and restraint stress, and DL-fluorocitric acid (FC), an inhibitor of EGCs, was administered. The changes in EGCs and colonic motility were studied by employing techniques comprising morphological, molecular biological and functional experiments. The results showed significant activation of EGCs in the myenteric plexus (MP) of the IBS-D-induced rat colon with accelerated colonic motility. FC significantly reduced the activation of EGCs and colonic motility caused by acetic acid and restraint stress. Hypercontraction of the colon caused by IBS-D may be associated with activation of EGCs in the MP of the colon and this was prevented by FC. Therefore, regulating colon hypercontraction through interference with the activation of EGCs has significant prospects for clinical application to alleviate diarrhea in patients with IBS-D.

AB  - Contact inhibition of proliferation is a critical cell density control mechanism governed by the Hippo signalling pathway. The biochemical signalling underlying cell density-dependent cues regulating Hippo signalling and its downstream effectors, YAP, remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the tight junction protein ZO-2 is required for the contact-mediated inhibition of proliferation. We additionally determined that the well-established molecular players of this process, namely Hippo kinase LATS1 and YAP, are regulated by ZO-2 and that the scaffolding function of ZO-2 promotes the interaction with and phosphorylation of YAP by LATS1. Mechanistically, YAP is phosphorylated when ZO-2 brings LATS1 and YAP together via its SH3 and PDZ domains, respectively, subsequently leading to the cytoplasmic retention and inactivation of YAP. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ZO-2 maintains Hippo signalling pathway activation by promoting the stability of LATS1 to inactivate YAP.

AB  - Decellularized extracellular matrices (ECMs) are being extensively used for tissue engineering purposes and detergents are predominantly used for this. A facile detergent-free decellularization method is developed for dermal matrix and compared it with the most used detergent-based decellularization methods. An optimized, single-step, cost-effective Hypotonic/Hypertonic (H/H) Sodium Chloride (NaCl) solutions-based method is employed to decellularize goat skin that resulted in much higher yield than other methods. The ECM composition, mechanical property, and cytocompatibility are evaluated and compared with other decellularization methods. Furthermore, this H/H-treated decellularized dermal ECM (ddECM) exhibits a residual DNA content of <50 ng mg(-1) of dry tissue. Moreover, 85.64 +/- 3.01% of glycosaminoglycans and 65.53 +/- 2.9% collagen are retained compared to the native tissue, which is higher than the ddECMs prepared by other methods. The cellular response is superior in ddECM (H/H) than other ddECMs prepared by detergent-based methods. Additionally, a bioink is formulated with the ddECM (H/H), showing good shear thinning and shear recovery properties. Process optimization in terms of print speed, flow rate, and viscosity is done to obtain a bioprinting window for ddECM bioink. The printed constructs with optimized parameters have adequate mechanical and cell adhesive properties and excellent isotropic cellular alignment.

AB  - Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) face dynamic and static obstacles in the process of transporting patients in medical environments, and they need to avoid these obstacles in real time. This paper proposes a bionic obstacle avoidance strategy based on the adaptive behavior of antelopes, aiming to address this problem. Firstly, the traditional artificial potential field and dynamic window algorithm are improved by using the bionic characteristics of antelope migration. Secondly, the success rate and prediction range of AGV navigation are improved by adding new potential field force points and increasing the window size. Simulation experiments were carried out on a numerical simulation platform, and the verification results showed that the bionic obstacle avoidance strategy proposed in this paper can avoid dynamic and static obstacles at the same time. In the example, the success rate of path planning is increased by 34%, the running time is reduced by 33%, and the average path length is reduced by 1%. The proposed method can help realize the integration of "dynamic and static" avoidance in the process of transporting patients and effectively save time by using AGVs to transport patients. It provides a theoretical basis for realizing obstacle avoidance and rapidly loading AGVs in medical environments.

AB  - There are a number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are considered "orphan receptors" because the information on their known ligands is incomplete. Yet, these receptors are important targets to characterize, as the discovery of their ligands may lead to potential new therapies. GPR75 was recently deorphanized because at least two ligands appear to bind to it, the chemokine CCL5 and the eicosanoid 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Recent reports suggest that GPR75 may play a role in regulating insulin secretion and obesity. However, little is known about the function of this receptor in the brain. To study the function of GPR75, we have generated a knockout (KO) mouse model of this receptor and we evaluated the role that this receptor plays in the adult hippocampus by an array of histological, proteomic, and behavioral endpoints. Using RNAscope (R) technology, we identified GPR75 puncta in several Rbfox3-/NeuN-positive cells in the hippocampus, suggesting that this receptor has a neuronal expression. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in 3-month-old GPR75 KO animals revealed that several markers of synapses, including synapsin I and II are downregulated compared with wild type (WT). To examine the functional consequence of this down-regulation, WT and GPR75 KO mice were tested on a hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. Both contextual memory and anxiety-like behaviors were significantly altered in GPR75 KO, suggesting that GPR75 plays a role in hippocampal activity.

AB  - Previously we showed that the vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) induces synaptic plasticity in acute brain slices prepared from the mouse and human neocortex (Lenz et al., 2021). Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata-a brain region implicated in memory acquisition. No major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral hippocampus while a significant increase in both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies and synapse numbers were evident in the dorsal hippocampus 6 hr after atRA administration. The intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells were not significantly different and hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential neuronal changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, that is, for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic strength. Indeed, in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, therefore, extending our previous results regarding the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our data show that atRA mediates synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells.

AB  - Designing ultra-black materials with strong and broadband light absorption and efficient photothermal conversion properties is of great importance in many fields, including camouflage, catalysis, thermal therapy, and solar energy conversion. The West African Gaboon viper (Bitis rhinoceros), a master of camouflage, features black spots on its dorsal scales. The crest-ridge structure in its black scales has been proven to be a typical antireflection structure. Herein, an artificial biomimetic ultra-black sponge (BUBS) that imitates the crest-ridge structure in the black scales of B. rhinoceros is successfully fabricated through growth of vertically aligned carbon nanosheet arrays derived from cobalt-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) on a loofah sponge. The vertically aligned carbon nanosheet arrays result in enhanced broadband light absorption (up to 97.08% on average ) and photothermal conversion (equilibrium temperature of 80.7 degrees C under 1 sun illumination) of BUBS. Benefiting from its efficient light absorption and photothermal conversion, the BUBS is incorporated into solar-powered vapor generation and desalination devices. The BUBS shows a higher water evaporation rate and efficiency of 1.93 kg m(-2) h(-1 )and 98.5%, respectively, compared with other state-of-the-art devices under 1 sun illumination. Furthermore, the BUBS also shows continuous and high water evaporation rates and excellent salt-rejection in various brines, ensuring its potential application in solar-powered desalination.

AB  - In this study, chicken bone gelatin (CBG) was extracted as a new substitute for traditional pig bone gelatin, and bacterial cellulose (BC) was used as the compound to prepare Oregano essential oil (OEO) Pickering emulsion. To explore a protein/polysaccharide emulsion system that can effectively prolong the functional activity of OEO during storage. The results indicated that the variation in CBG and BC content significantly influenced the physicochemical properties of the emulsions. The optimal formulation of OEO Pickering emulsion, prepared with a CBG-BC ratio of 6:2 (v/v), exhibited superior characteristics including appearance, encapsulation efficiency, and stability during preservation. After 7 d of storage at 4 degrees C, the rheological properties remained stable, with no significant differences observed in antioxidant and antibacterial activities. It was verified in the beef freshkeeping experiment that the shelf life of beef samples in the 6-2-2 treatment group was 6 d longer than that in the control group and 3 d longer than that in the pure OEO group. This experiment enhanced the utilization of poultry by-products and provided a valuable reference for exploring suitable protein-polysaccharide systems embedding active substances for food preservation.

AB  - BackgroundThe establishment of stable porcine embryonic stem cells (pESCs) can contribute to basic and biomedical research, including comparative developmental biology, as well as assessing the safety of stem cell-based therapies. Despite these advantages, most pESCs obtained from in vitro blastocysts require complex media and feeder layers, making routine use, genetic modification, and differentiation into specific cell types difficult. We aimed to establish pESCs with a single cell-passage ability, high proliferative potency, and stable in long-term culture from in vitro-derived blastocysts using a simplified serum-free medium.MethodsWe evaluated the establishment efficiency of pESCs from in vitro blastocysts using various basal media (DMEM/F10 (1:1), DMEM/F12, and a-MEM) and factors (FGF2, IWR-1, CHIR99021, and WH-4-023). The pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of the established pESCs were analyzed under feeder or feeder-free conditions. Ultimately, we developed a simplified culture medium (FIW) composed of FGF2, IWR-1, and WH-4-023 under serum-free conditions.ResultsThe pESC-FIW lines were capable of single-cell passaging with short cell doubling times and expressed the pluripotency markers POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG, as well as cell surface markers SSEA1, SSEA4, and TRA-1-60. pESC-FIW showed a stable proliferation rate and normal karyotype, even after 50 passages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that pESC-FIW were similar to reported pESC maintained in complex media and showed gastrulating epiblast cell characteristics. pESC-FIW were maintained for multiple passages under feeder-free conditions on fibronectin-coated plates using mTeSR (TM), a commercial medium used for feeder-free culture, exhibiting characteristics similar to those observed under feeder conditions.ConclusionsThese results indicated that inhibition of WNT and SRC was sufficient to establish pESCs capable of single-cell passaging and feeder-free expansion under serum-free conditions. The easy maintenance of pESCs facilitates their application in gene editing technology for agriculture and biomedicine, as well as lineage commitment studies.

AB  - Neurostimulation of the hippocampal formation has shown promising results for modulating memory but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In particular, the effects on hippocampal theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset, which are both crucial for memory processes, are unknown. Moreover, these effects cannot be investigated using current computational models, which consider theta oscillations with a fixed amplitude and phase velocity. Here, we developed a novel computational model that includes the medial septum, represented as a set of abstract Kuramoto oscillators producing a dynamical theta rhythm with phase reset, and the hippocampal formation, composed of biophysically realistic neurons and able to generate theta-nested gamma oscillations under theta drive. We showed that, for theta inputs just below the threshold to induce self-sustained theta-nested gamma oscillations, a single stimulation pulse could switch the network behavior from non-oscillatory to a state producing sustained oscillations. Next, we demonstrated that, for a weaker theta input, pulse train stimulation at the theta frequency could transiently restore seemingly physiological oscillations. Importantly, the presence of phase reset influenced whether these two effects depended on the phase at which stimulation onset was delivered, which has practical implications for designing neurostimulation protocols that are triggered by the phase of ongoing theta oscillations. This novel model opens new avenues for studying the effects of neurostimulation on the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, our hybrid approach that combines different levels of abstraction could be extended in future work to other neural circuits that produce dynamical brain rhythms.

AB  - Stigma maydis polysaccharide (SMPS) has regulatory effect on the intestinal microflora and promotes gastrointestinal peristalsis. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience gastrointestinal problems and dysbiosis in their gut microbiota. Our previous study revealed that SMPS interventions had an impact on the gut microbiota of valproic acid (VPA)-induced autism model rats. However, the effects of SMPS on the behavior and gut function of autism model rats remain poorly understood. Therefore, we gave different doses of SMPS intervention in the early stage of autism model rats to observe their developmental conditions and behavior performances. Through histological evaluation and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), integrity of the intestinal structure and the expression of tight junction-related gene Zo-1 and Occludin were detected. The results indicated that SMPS intervention improved the physical development, learning and memory impairment, and social performance of autism model rats. Meanwhile, SMPS promoted intestinal peristalsis and restored the integrity of the intestinal structure, reduced the number of inflammatory cells, and increased the expression of the Zo-1 and Occludin genes. Furthermore, the expression levels of neurotransmitters (substance P, enkephalin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and 5-hydroxytryptamine) in the hippocampal tissues were altered after SMPS treatment. In conclusion, SMPS could ameliorate ASD-like phenotypes and gut problems in autism model rats. Collectively, these results provide new evidence for the relationship between the gut-brain axis and ASD and suggest a novel therapeutic target for ASD treatment.

AB  - Ketamine is shown to enhance excitatory synaptic drive in multiple brain areas, which is presumed to underlie its rapid antidepressant effects. Moreover, ketamine's therapeutic actions are likely mediated by enhancing neuronal Ca2+ signaling. However, ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that reduces excitatory synaptic transmission and postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling. Thus, it is a puzzling question how ketamine enhances glutamatergic and Ca2+ activity in neurons to induce rapid antidepressant effects while blocking NMDARs in the hippocampus. Here, we find that ketamine treatment in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons significantly reduces Ca2+ and calcineurin activity to elevate AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation ultimately leads to the expression of Ca2+-Permeable, GluA2-lacking, and GluA1-containing AMPARs (CP-AMPARs). The ketamine-induced expression of CP-AMPARs enhances glutamatergic activity and glutamate receptor plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Moreover, when a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine is given to mice, it increases synaptic GluA1 levels, but not GluA2, and GluA1 phosphorylation in the hippocampus within 1 hr after treatment. These changes are likely mediated by ketamine-induced reduction of calcineurin activity in the hippocampus. Using the open field and tail suspension tests, we demonstrate that a low dose of ketamine rapidly reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in both male and female mice. However, when in vivo treatment of a CP-AMPAR antagonist abolishes the ketamine's effects on animals' behaviors. We thus discover that ketamine at the low dose promotes the expression of CP-AMPARs via reduction of calcineurin activity, which in turn enhances synaptic strength to induce rapid antidepressant actions.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis is a widely spread zoonosis worldwide, considered one of the most important parasitic infections that affect global public health, and usually, it is not correctly diagnosed. Serological tests for the diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection have limitations in differentiating acute from chronic infection, which is important to determine the appropriate clinical management and treatment, mainly in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals infected by this parasite. The present study aimed to characterize immunogenic epitopes from T. gondii immunodominant antigens, as SAG1(SRS29B), SAG2A (SRS34A), GRA1, GRA2, GRA3, GRA5, GRA6, GRA7, MAG1, BSR4, and CCp5A, by investigating if these parasite components might emerge as alternatives to improve the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. A detailed comparative in silico analysis was used for this purpose. Once the protein sequences were retrieved from the ToxoDB database, different parameters were calculated, including physicochemical characteristics, accessibility values, and antigenicity. Multiple sequence alignment, 3D structures modeling, and the validation of 3D structures were also performed among all 11 peptides. Considering the results from the combination of all parameters analyzed, it can be hypothesized that the linear epitopes from SAG1, GRA3, and BSR4 proteins were found to be stable and hydrophilic, with a significant antigenicity score, and accessibility on the protein surface. Also, these three selected peptides were able to detect anti-T. gondii antibodies in serum samples from pigs infected by tachyzoites, when compared with control serum samples, obtained from the same na & iuml;ve animals and tested by ELISA, demonstrating remarkable difference in terms of reactivity. Taken together, as our study addresses a critical challenge in the serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis, particularly in gestational and congenital infections, where false-positive and false-negative results often arise from the use of native or recombinant antigens of T. gondii, our findings highlight the potential of synthetic peptides derived from novel epitopes of this parasite as alternative tools for the development of more accurate immunodiagnostic assays for toxoplasmosis.

AB  - How herbivorous insects adapt to host plants is a key question in ecological and evolutionary biology. The fall armyworm, (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), although polyphagous and a major pest on various crops, has been reported to have a rice and corn (maize) feeding strain in its native range in the Americas. The species is highly invasive and has recently established in China. We compared behavioral changes in larvae and adults of a corn population (Corn) when selected on rice (Rice) and the molecular basis of these adaptational changes in midgut and antennae based on a comparative transcriptome analysis. Larvae of S. frugiperda reared on rice plants continuously for 20 generations exhibited strong feeding preference for with higher larval performance and pupal weight on rice than on maize plants. Similarly, females from the rice selected population laid significantly more eggs on rice as compared to females from maize population. The most highly expressed DEGs were shown in the midgut of Rice vs. Corn. A total of 6430 DEGs were identified between the populations mostly in genes related to digestion and detoxification. These results suggest that potential adaptations for feeding on rice crops, may contribute to the current rapid spread of fall armyworm on rice crops in China and potentially elsewhere. Consistently, highly expressed DEGs were also shown in antennae; a total of 5125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) s were identified related to the expansions of major chemosensory genes family in Rice compared to the Corn feeding population. These results not only provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms in host plants adaptation of S. frugiperda but may provide new gene targets for the management of this pest.</p>

AB  - Netrin-1, a secreted laminin-related protein, was first characterized for its pivotal role in guiding axonal growth during nervous system development. However, recent research has revealed its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis. Understanding the signaling pathways through which Netrin-1 operates in cancer is crucial for elucidating its mechanisms and exploring therapeutic interventions. Netrin-1 protein controls the biological processes of cancer cells, guiding axon pathfinding and transmitting signals that are essential for migration, differentiation and cell survival via UNC5 and DCC-family receptors. To elaborate further, Netrin1 controls YAP signalling through its neogenin receptor, which affects the EMT process in gastric cancer. Researchers have also utilized the Netrin-1 protein with different nanoparticles to explore its way to prevent cancer progression. Moreover, Researchers evaluated the use of nanoparticles as an immunosensor, therapeutic and imaging tools targetting the Netrin-1 protein, which open several ways to combat cancer. This review explores how Netrin-1 influences the AKT signaling cascade impacting hippo signaling, YAP pathways and EMT process with DCC receptor. It also discusses the involvement of UNC5B and Netrin-1 in regulating ERK/MAPK signaling pathways and induction of apoptosis when Netrin-1 is absent. Moreover, it underscores the therapeutic potential of UNC5B-induced cell cycle arrest in specific cancer. Also, it delves into the diverse forms of netrin and its potential role in cancer and the glims of nanoparticles use with it. Underlining the necessity for more research to comprehend their functions in signaling cascades using the nanomaterials.

AB  - Autopsy data indicate that the locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the first sites in the brain to accumulate hyperphosphorylated tau pathology, with the rostral part possibly being more vulnerable in the earlier stages of the disease. Taking advantage of recent developments in ultra-high field (7 T) imaging, we investigated whether imaging measures of the LC also reveal a specific anatomic correlation with tau using novel plasma biomarkers of different species of hyperphosphorylated tau, how early in adulthood these associations can be detected and if are associated with worse cognitive performance. To validate the anatomic correlations, we tested if a rostro-caudal gradient in tau pathology is also detected at autopsy in data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We found that higher plasma measures of phosphorylated tau, in particular ptau(231), correlated negatively with dorso-rostral LC integrity, whereas correlations for neurodegenerative plasma markers (neurofilament light, total tau) were scattered throughout the LC including middle to caudal sections. In contrast, the plasma A beta(42/40) ratio, associated with brain amyloidosis, did not correlate with LC integrity. These findings were specific to the rostral LC and not observed when using the entire LC or the hippocampus. Furthermore, in the MAP data, we observed higher rostral than caudal tangle density in the LC, independent of the disease stage. The in vivo LC-phosphorylated tau correlations became significant from midlife, with the earliest effect for ptau(231), starting at about age 55. Finally, interactions between lower rostral LC integrity and higher ptau(231) concentrations predicted lower cognitive performance. Together, these findings demonstrate a specific rostral vulnerability to early phosphorylated tau species that can be detected with dedicated magnetic resonance imaging measures, highlighting the promise of LC imaging as an early marker of AD-related processes.

AB  - BackgroundRegulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) transport and translation in neurons is essential for dendritic plasticity and learning/memory development. The trafficking of mRNAs along the hippocampal neuron dendrites remains translationally silent until they are selectively transported into the spines upon glutamate-induced receptor activation. However, the molecular mechanism(s) behind the spine entry of dendritic mRNAs under metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated neuroactivation and long-term depression (LTD) as well as the fate of these mRNAs inside the spines are still elusive.MethodDifferent molecular and imaging techniques, e.g., immunoprecipitation (IP), RNA-IP, Immunofluorescence (IF)/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), live cell imaging, live cell tracking of RNA using beacon, and mouse model study are used to elucidate a novel mechanism regulating dendritic spine transport of mRNAs in mammalian neurons.ResultsWe demonstrate here that brief mGluR1 activation-mediated dephosphorylation of pFMRP (S499) results in the dissociation of FMRP from TDP-43 and handover of TDP-43/Rac1 mRNA complex from the dendritic transport track on microtubules to myosin V track on the spine actin filaments. Rac1 mRNA thus enters the spines for translational reactivation and increases the mature spine density. In contrast, during mGluR1-mediated neuronal LTD, FMRP (S499) remains phosphorylated and the TDP-43/Rac1 mRNA complex, being associated with kinesin 1-FMRP/cortactin/drebrin, enters the spines owing to Ca2+-dependent microtubule invasion into spines, but without translational reactivation. In a VPA-ASD mouse model, this regulation become anomalous.ConclusionsThis study, for the first time, highlights the importance of posttranslational modification of RBPs, such as the neurodevelopmental disease-related protein FMRP, as the molecular switch regulating the dendrite-to-spine transport of specific mRNAs under mGluR1-mediated neurotransmissions. The misregulation of this switch could contribute to the pathogenesis of FMRP-related neurodisorders including the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It also could indicate a molecular connection between ASD and neurodegenerative disease-related protein TDP-43 and opens up a new perspective of research to elucidate TDP-43 proteinopathy among patients with ASD.

AB  - Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used antitumor drug. However, it may cause severe cardiotoxicity, apoptosis being a major change. A recent report indicates that miR-147 expression is decreased in the myocardium of a myocardial infarction model, suggesting a potential role of this miRNA in DOX-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity. In this study, freshly isolated neonatal pig cardiomyocytes were used; following transfection of a miR-147-y mimic, the cell death induced by DOX was alleviated, represented by augmented mitophagy [indicated by a decrease in P62, and increases in LC3, PINK1, parkin mRNA, LC3II/I, beclin-1, PINK1, and parkin including p-parkin (Ser65) protein expression], prohibited cell apoptosis as determined by TUNEL staining, and the suppression of caspase-3 transcription and cleaved caspase-3 translation. In cells transfected with an miR-147-y inhibitor, DOX-induced mitophagy was decreased, while apoptosis was increased. Additionally, RAPTOR gene silencing in cardiomyocytes exposed to DOX increased the rate of mitophagy and decreased that of apoptosis as compared with the treatment with DOX alone. Moreover, RAPTOR overexpression downregulated the rate of mitophagy and increased that of apoptosis in cells exposed to DOX. RAPTOR was confirmed as the target gene of miR-147-y based on the results of luciferase reporter gene assays and the opposite effects of the miR-147-y mimic and miR147-y inhibitor on RAPTOR expression. In summary, our study suggests that miR-147-y mediates DOXinduced cardiomyocyte mitophagy while suppresses apoptosis by targeting RAPTOR, thus playing a protective role in DOX-induced cardiomyocyte damage.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is affected by genetic factors. Polymorphisms in the glutathione S-transferase omega-1 (Gsto1) gene have been shown by genetic correlation analyses performed in different ethnic populations to be genetic risk factors for AD. Gene expression profile data from BXD recombinant inbred mice were used in combination with genetic and bioinformatic analyses to characterize the mechanisms underlying regulation of Gsto1 variation regulation and to identify network members that may contribute to AD risk or progression. Allele-specific assays confirmed that variation in Gsto1 expression is controlled by cis-expression quantitative trait loci. We found that Gsto1 mRNA levels were related to several central nervous system traits, such as glial acidic fibrillary protein levels in the caudate putamen, cortical gray matter volume, and hippocampus mossy fiber pathway volume. We identified 2168 genes whose expression was highly correlated with that of Gsto1. Some genes were enriched for the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Some Gsto1-related genes identified in this study had previously been identified as susceptibility genes for AD, such as APP, Grin2b, Ide, and Psenen. To evaluate the relationships between Gsto1 and candidate network members, we transfected astrocytes with Gsto1 siRNA and assessed the effect on putative downstream effectors. We confirmed that knockdown of Gsto1 had a significant influence on Pa2g4 expression, suggesting that Pa2g4 may be a downstream effector of Gsto1, and that both genes interact with other genes in a network during AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Dysregulated brain cholesterol metabolism is one of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is a cholesterol metabolite that plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and it is suggested that it contributes to AD-related cognitive deficits. However, the link between 27-OHC and cholesterol homeostasis, and how this relationship relates to AD pathogenesis, remain elusive. Here, 12-month-old ApoE epsilon 4 transgenic mice were injected with saline, 27-OHC, 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole, ANS), and 27-OHC+ANS for 21 consecutive days. C57BL/6J mice injected with saline were used as wild-type controls. The indicators of cholesterol metabolism, synaptic structure, amyloid beta 1-42 (A beta 1-42), and learning and memory abilities were measured. Compared with the wild-type mice, ApoE epsilon 4 mice had poor memory and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, damaged brain tissue and synaptic structure, cognitive decline, and higher A beta 1-42 levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Moreover, cholesterol transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1) were up-regulated in the cortex after the 27-OHC treatment. The levels of cholesterol metabolism-related indicators in the hippocampus were not consistent with those in the cortex. Additionally, higher serum apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) levels and lower serum ApoE levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Notably, ANS partially reversed the effects of 27-OHC. In conclusion, the altered cholesterol metabolism induced by 27-OHC was involved in A beta 1-42 deposition and abnormalities in both the brain tissue and synaptic structure, ultimately leading to memory loss in the ApoE epsilon 4 transgenic mice.

AB  - Tonic current through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels is influencing neuronal firing properties and channel function is strongly influenced by the brain-specific auxiliary subunit tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b). Since Kv1.2 channels and TRIP8b were also suggested to interact, we assessed brain Kv1.2 mRNA and protein expression as well as the reduction of K+ outward currents by Kv1.2-blocking compounds (Psora-4; tityustoxin-K alpha, TsTX-K alpha) in different brain areas of TRIP8b-deficient (TRIP8b( -/- )) compared to wildtype (WT) mice. We found that transcription levels of Kv1.2 channels were not different between genotypes. Furthermore, Kv1.2 current amplitude was not affected upon co-expression with TRIP8b in oocytes. However, Kv1.2 immunofluorescence was stronger in dendritic areas of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the peak net outward current was increased and the inactivation of the Psora-4-sensitive current component was less pronounced in cortical neurons in TRIP8b( -/- ) mice. In current clamp recordings, application of TsTX increased the excitability of thalamocortical (TC) neurons with increased number of elicited action potentials upon step depolarization. We conclude that TRIP8b may not preferentially influence the amplitude of current through Kv1.2 channels but seems to affect current inactivation and channel localization. In TRIP8b( -/- ) a compensatory upregulation of other Kv channels was observed.

AB  - Synovial sarcoma, a rare malignant soft tissue tumor, is charac-terized by a specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18). The result-ing chimeric SS18-SSX fusion protein drives synovial sarcoma pathogenesis by integrating into the BAF complex and dysregulating gene transcription. Because previous functional analyses revealed a connection between SS18-SSX and the activity of the transcriptional coregulators YAP1/TAZ and 13-catenin, respectively, this study examined a potential interdependence between these essential effec-tor proteins in synovial sarcoma. In a large cohort of synovial sarcoma tissue specimens, IHC analyses revealed a substantial subset of synovial sarcoma with concurrent nuclear accumulation of YAP1/TAZ and 13-catenin. In vitro , small-molecule inhibitor treatment, RNAi-mediated knockdown, and vector-based overex-pression assays demonstrated that YAP1, TAZ, and 13-catenin tran-scriptional activity is not only stimulated by the SS18-SSX fusion protein, but that they also mutually enhance each other's activation. These analyses showed the highest cooperative effect with overex-pression of YAP1 in combination with 13-catenin. Coimmunopreci-pitation experiments detected nuclear interactions between YAP1, 13-catenin, and the SS18-SSX fusion protein, the latter being an integral part of the BAF complex. Disruption of BAF complex assembly affected the coregulation of YAP1 and 13-catenin, indicating that this chromatin remodeling complex plays a crucial role for interdependent YAP1 and 13-catenin activation in synovial sarcoma cells.Implications: This study provides deeper insights into synovial sarcoma tumor biology demonstrating a mutual dependence between YAP1/TAZ and 13-catenin transcriptional activity and a complex interplay with the SS18-SSX fusion protein within the BAF complex.

AB  - Repeated mild traumatic brain injuries (rMTBI) affect mitochondrial homeostasis in the brain. However, mechanisms of long-lasting neurobehavioral effects of rMTBI are largely unknown. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) is a critical component of tethering complexes in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and thereby plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial functions. Herein, we investigated the implications of DNA methylation in the Mfn2 gene regulation, and its consequences on mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus after rMTBI. rMTBI dramatically reduced the mitochondrial mass, which was concomitant with decrease in Mfn2 mRNA and protein levels. DNA hypermethylation at the Mfn2 gene promoter was observed post 30 days of rMTBI. The treatment of 5-Azacytidine, a pan DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, normalized DNA methylation levels at Mfn2 promoter, which further resulted into restoration of Mfn2 function. The normalization of Mfn2 function was well correlated with recovery in memory deficits in rMTBI-exposed rats. Since, glutamate excitotoxicity serves as a primary insult after TBI, we employed in vitro model of glutamate excitotoxicity in human neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y to investigate the causal epigenetic mechanisms of Mfn2 gene regulation. The glutamate excitotoxicity reduced Mfn2 levels via DNA hypermethylation at Mfn2 promoter. Loss of Mfn2 caused significant surge in cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels with lowered mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured SH-SY5Y cells. Like rMTBI, these consequences of glutamate excitotoxicity were also prevented by 5-AzaC pre-treatment. Therefore, DNA methylation serves as a vital epigenetic mechanism involved in Mfn2 expression in the brain; and this Mfn2 gene regulation may play a pivotal role in rMTBI-induced persistent cognitive deficits.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by a gradual impairment in cognitive functions. Recent research have shown that TNF-alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. Besides cognitive deficit, AD patients show alterations in their circadian rhythms. The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of an intracerebroventricular injection of Ass aggregates on temporal patterns of cognitive functions and on daily rhythms of A beta, TNF alpha, BMAL1 and ROR alpha protein levels in the rat prefrontal cortex. Four-month-old males Holtzman rats were used in this study. Groups were defined as: control and A beta-injected rats. Rats were maintained under 12h-light:12h-dark throughout the entire experimental period. Prefrontal cortex samples were isolated every 4 h during a 24h period. Our results demonstrated that an intracerebroventricular injection of Ass aggregates impaired learning and memory in rats at ZT 2 and ZT 14 and modified daily patterns of A beta, TNF alpha, and clock-related factors in the rat prefrontal cortex. Our findings showed that the increase of Ass altered temporal patterns of TNF alpha, and, consequently, induced alterations in daily rhythms of clock-related factors, affecting the cognitive performance of animals with Alzheimer's.

AB  - Functional oligosaccharides induce specific alterations in gut microbiota, potentially providing physiological benefits. However, the effects of laminaripentaose (LPA) on metabolic syndrome and the mechanism underlying it have not been intensively investigated yet. This study aimed to determine the effects of LPA on obesity and obesity-induced cognition impairment in mice. C57BL/6N mice fed with a high-fat diet received an LPA treatment for 12 weeks. An antibiotic intervention was further applied to evaluate the effects of the gut microbiota on cognitive functions. LPA treatment (500 mg/kg) reduced the weight gain by 32.4%. Furthermore, LPA improved memory functions and reduced hippocampal insulin resistance and neuronal injury. LPA markedly reduced systemic low-grade inflammation and intestinal barrier injury. Moreover, LPA increased gut beneficial bacteria, and Butyricimonas and Bifidobacterium were increased by 94.0 and 422.7%, respectively, accompanied by increased fecal short-chain fatty acids. Interestingly, antibiotic cocktail treatment abrogated the beneficial effects of LPA on cognition, which further suggests that LPA may attenuate obesity-induced cognition impairment via the gut-brain axis. Our findings provide the first evidence for the potential of dietary LPA to prevent obesity and obesity-associated complications.

AB  - Content-Based Histopathological Image Retrieval (CBHIR) is a search technique based on the visual content and histopathological features of whole-slide images (WSIs). CBHIR tools assist pathologists to obtain a faster and more accurate cancer diagnosis. Stain variation between hospitals hampers the performance of CBHIR tools. This paper explores the effects of color normalization (CN) in a recently proposed CBHIR approach to tackle this issue. In this paper, three different CN techniques were used on the CAMELYON17 (CAM17) data set, which is a breast cancer data set. CAM17 consists of images taken using different staining protocols and scanners in five hospitals. Our experiments reveal that a proper CN technique, which can transfer the color version into the most similar median values, has a positive impact on the retrieval performance of the proposed CBHIR framework. According to the obtained results, using CN as a pre-processing step can improve the accuracy of the proposed CBHIR framework to 97% (a 14% increase), compared to working with the original images.

AB  - Phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 3-phosphoserine, which is the final step in the de novo biosynthesis of l-serine (l-Ser) via the phosphorylated pathway in human astrocytes. Individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for functionally defective PSP variants exhibit reduced cerebrospinal fluid l-Ser levels and severe neurological symptoms. In the present study, single nucleotide polymorphisms in PSP were identified in hippocampal samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, likely forming a haplotype (chr7:56088825 T>A and chr7:56088811 T>C, encoding R27S and D32G PSP variants, respectively), were detected exclusively in AD patients (three females and one male). Biochemical characterization of the recombinant R27S/D32G PSP enzyme revealed a slight decrease in thermostability, a 38-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency and a two-fold increase in IC50 for l-Ser, with the D32G substitution being the primary contributor to these effects. Despite its reduced enzyme activity, the R27S/D32G variant did not impair l-Ser biosynthesis either in an in vitro reconstructed pathway or in U251 human glioblastoma cells ectopically expressing the variant under heterozygous conditions. In these cells, PSP colocalized extensively with the other two phosphorylated pathway enzymes, namely phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and phosphoserine aminotransferase, suggesting that they assemble into a functional complex, known as the serinosome. Notably, the R27S/D32G PSP variant exhibited increased nuclear localization compared to the wild-type enzyme. This mislocalization raises the intriguing possibility that PSP's moonlighting functions, including its putative role as a protein phosphatase, may be affected, potentially implicating it in pathways beyond l-Ser biosynthesis.

AB  - Hearing, the ability to sense sounds, and the processing of auditory information are important for perception of the world. Mice lacking expression of neuroplastin (Np), a type-1 trans- membrane glycoprotein, display deafness, multiple cognitive deficiencies, and reduced expression of plasma membrane calcium (Ca2+) ATPases (PMCAs) in cochlear hair cells and brain neurons. In this study, we transferred the deafness causing missense mutations pitch (C315S) and audio-1 (I122N) into human Np (hNp) constructs and investigated their effects at the molecular and cellular levels. Computational molecular dynamics show that loss of the disulfide bridge in hNp pitch causes structural destabilization of immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig) III and that the novel asparagine in hNp audio-1 results in steric constraints and an additional N-glycosylation site in IgII. Additional N-glycosylation of hNp audio-1 was confirmed by PNGaseF treatment. In comparison to hNpWT, transfection of hNp pitch and hNp audio-1 into HEK293T cells resulted in normal mRNA levels but reduced the Np protein levels and their cell surface expression due to proteasomal/lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, hNp pitch and hNp audio-1 failed to promote exogenous PMCA levels in HEK293T cells. In hippocampal neurons, expression of additional hNp pitch or hNp audio-1 was less efficient than hNpWT to elevate endogenous PMCA levels and to accelerate the restoration of basal Ca2+ levels after electrically evoked Ca2+ transients. We propose that mutations leading to pathological Np variants, as exemplified here by the deafness causing Np mutants, can affect Np-dependent Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms and may potentially cause intellectual and cognitive deficits in humans.

AB  - Adenosine receptors mainly control synaptic function, and excessive activation of adenosine receptors may worsen the onset of many neurological disorders. Accordingly, the regular intake of moderate doses of caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptors and affords robust neuroprotection. Although caffeine intake alters brain functional connectivity and multi-omics analyses indicate that caffeine intake modifies synaptic and metabolic processes, it is unclear how caffeine intake affects behavior, synaptic plasticity and its modulation by adenosine. We now report that male mice drinking caffeinated water (0.3 g/L) for 2 weeks were behaviorally indistinguishable (locomotion, mood, memory) from control mice (drinking water) and displayed superimposable synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation) in different brain areas (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, amygdala). Moreover, there was a general preservation of the efficiency of adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors to control synaptic transmission and plasticity, although there was a tendency for lower levels of endogenous adenosine ensuring A(1) receptor-mediated inhibition. In spite of similar behavioral and neurophysiological function, caffeine intake increased the energy charge and redox state of cortical synaptosomes. This increased metabolic competence likely involved a putative increase in the glycolytic rate in synapses and a prospective greater astrocyte-synapse lactate shuttling. It was concluded that caffeine intake does not trigger evident alterations of behavior or of synaptic plasticity but increases the metabolic competence of synapses, which might be related with the previously described better ability of animals consuming caffeine to cope with deleterious stimuli triggering brain dysfunction.

AB  - Constipation is a prevalent global health issue that greatly affects human well-being. However, many existing treatments are associated with side effects, necessitating the development of alternative approaches. In this study, a balanced fatty acid red pine seed direct-drinking oil (SFA:MUFA:PUFA = 1.14:1.08:1, n - 6:n - 3 = 4.17:1) was formulated using red pine seed oil as the base oil, blended with coconut oil, rice bran oil, and camellia oil. The study investigated the effects and mechanisms of this red pine seed direct-drinking oil in alleviating constipation in mice. Results showed that, compared to normal mice, constipated mice exhibited symptoms of dry stools, difficulty defecating, abnormal neurotransmitter levels, oxidative stress, and colonic tissue damage. Additionally, the protein expression levels of occludin and claudin-1 were reduced by 86.11% and 25.00%, respectively (p < 0.05), while mRNA expression levels decreased by 70.80% and 59.00% (p < 0.05). Red pine seed direct-drinking oil intake improved defecation, reduced serum levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and nitric oxide (NO), and increased substance P (SP) levels. Furthermore, it also significantly elevated serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (p < 0.05), alleviated colonic tissue damage, and upregulated the protein and mRNA expression levels of occludin and claudin-1 (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that red pine seed direct-drinking oil alleviates constipation in mice by enhancing intestinal motility, regulating serum neurotransmitters, mitigating oxidative stress, repairing intestinal barrier damage, and increasing tight junction protein expression. This study represents the first use of red pine seed direct-drinking oil to alleviate constipation in mice, providing a novel approach to improving symptoms in individuals with constipation.

AB  - The rapidly inactivating potassium current (I-A) is important in controlling neuronal action potentials. Altered I-A function and K+ channel expression have been found in epilepsy, and activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is involved in epilepsy pathogenesis. This study examined whether TRPV4 affects Kv4.2 and K+ channel interacting protein (KCHIP) expression and I-A changes following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE) in mice. Herein, hippocampal protein levels of Kv4.2 and KCHIP2 increased 3 h-3 d and decreased 7-30 d; that of KCHIP1 increased 3-24 h and decreased 3-30 d post-PISE. The TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 attenuated the increased protein levels of Kv4.2 and KCHIP2 but not that of KCHIP1 post-PISE. The TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A increased hippocampal protein levels of Kv4.2 and KCHIP2 but had no effect on KCHIP1 expression. HC-067047 attenuated the increased I-A in hippocampal pyramidal neurons 24 h and 3 d post-PISE. GSK1016790A increased I-A in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, shifting the voltage-dependent inactivation curve toward depolarization. The GSK1016790A-induced increase of I-A was blocked by protein kinase A and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II antagonists but was unaffected by protein kinase C antagonists. We conclude that TRPV4 activation may be responsible for the increases of Kv4.2 and KCHIP2 expression in hippocampi and I-A in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in PISE mice, which are likely compensatory measures for hyperexcitability at the early stage of epilepsy.

AB  - Upon the arrival of repetitive stimulation at the presynaptic terminals of neurons, replenishment of readily releasable synaptic vesicles (SVs) with vesicles in the recycling pool is important for sustained neurotransmitter release. Kinetics of replenishment and the available pool size define synaptic performance. However, whether all SVs in the recycling pool are recruited for release with equal probability and speed is unknown. Here, based on comprehensive optical imaging of various presynaptic endosomal SNARE proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons, all of which are implicated in organellar membrane fusion in non-neuronal cells, we show that part of the recycling pool bearing the endosomal Q-SNARE, syntaxin 7 (Stx7), is preferentially mobilized for release during high-frequency repetitive stimulation. Recruitment of the SV pool marked with an Stx7-reporter requires actin polymerization, as well as activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin signaling pathway, reminiscent of rapidly replenishing SVs characterized previously in calyx of Held synapses. Furthermore, disruption of Stx7 function by overexpressing its N-terminal domain selectively abolished this pool. Thus, our data indicate that endosomal membrane fusion involving Stx7 forms rapidly replenishing vesicles essential for synaptic responses to high-frequency repetitive stimulation, and also highlight functional diversities of endosomal SNAREs in generating distinct exocytic vesicles in the presynaptic terminals.

AB  - Sphingomyelin (SM) is an abundant plasma membrane and plasma lipoprotein sphingolipid. We previously reported that ATP-binding cassette family A protein 1 (ABCA1) deficiency in humans and mice decreases plasma SM levels. However, over -expression, induction, downregulation, inhibition, and knock-down of ABCA1 in human hepatoma Huh7 cells did not decrease SM efflux. Using unbiased siRNA screening, here, we identified that ABCA7 plays a role in the biosynthesis and efflux of SM without affecting cellular uptake and metabolism. Since loss of function mutations in the ABCA7 gene exhibit strong associations with late-onset Alzheimer's disease across racial groups, we also studied the effects of ABCA7 deficiency in the mouse brain. Brains of ABCA7-deficient (KO) mice, compared with WT, had signifi- cantly lower levels of several SM species with long chain fatty acids. In addition, we observed that older KO mice exhibited behavioral deficits in cognitive discrimination in the active place avoidance task. Next, we performed synaptic transmission studies in brain slices obtained from older mice. We found anomalies in synaptic plasticity at the intracortical synapse in layer II/III of the lateral entorhinal cortex but not in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses in KO mice. These synaptic abnormalities in KO brain slices were rescued with extracellular SM supplementation but not by supplementation with phosphatidylcholine. Taken together, these studies identify a role of ABCA7 in brain SM metabolism and the importance of SM in synaptic plasticity and cognition, as well as provide a possible explanation for the asso-ciation between ABCA7 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - BackgroundThe chicken has been a representative model organism to study embryonic development in birds, however important differences exist among this class of species. As a representative of one of oldest existing clades of birds, the African ostrich (Struthio camelus), has the largest body among birds, and has two toes. Our purpose is to establish the corresponding stages in ostrich embryo development that match the well-established HH system of the chicken to facilitate comparative studies between the ostrich and other birds to better understand differences in development. ResultsHere we describe in detail the middle period of embryonic development using microscopic images and skeletal staining. We found that clear morphological differentiation between the ostrich and the chicken begins at stage 26. Bird limb cartilage first form in stage 25, while the development of the limb skeletons differs after stage 31. Calcification of limb skeletons in the chicken was completed faster. The first and second toes of the ostrich disappear at stages 36 and 38, respectively. ConclusionsThis study should greatly aid ostrich-related developmental and morphological research and provide a reference for studying the development and evolution of avian limb skeletons, including molecular research. Questions that can now be addressed include studies into the fusion of tarsometatarsal skeleton, ossification, and digit loss.

AB  - Age-related decrements in the central nervous system (CNS) are thought to result from: (1) increased susceptibility to and accumulating effects of free radicals and inflammation; and (2) dysregulation in Ca2+ homeostasis, which affects numerous signaling pathways. Certain bioactive phytochemicals exhibit potent anti-inflammatory activities which may mitigate these age-related CNS decrements. This study investigated the individual and combination effects of green tea catechin (epigallocatechin gallate, EGCG), curcumin from turmeric, and broccoli sprouts which contain the isothiocyanate sulforaphane on inflammation and dysregulation in Ca2+ homeostasis to determine if the individual compounds were working synergistically and/or through independent mechanisms. Rat hippocampal neurons or highly aggressive proliferating immortalized (HAPI) microglial cells were pre-treated for a week with either the individual components or all in combination before inducing Ca2+ buffering deficits with dopamine (DA, 0.1 mu M for 2 h) or inflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/mL for 18 h), respectively. The EGCG (3 mu M) and combination protected against DA-induced deficits in Ca2+ buffering (both % of cells that recovered and recovery time, p < 0.05). Additionally, the EGCG and combination reduced stress-mediated inflammation in HAPI rat microglial cells by attenuating LPS-induced nitrite release, inducible nitrous oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release (p < 0.05), but not cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Overall, broccoli sprouts (2 mu M) and curcumin (1 mu M) were not as effective as the EGCG or combination. Further research is needed to determine if dietary intervention with a variety of foods containing compounds such as those found in green tea, turmeric, or broccoli sprouts can play a role in reducing age-related CNS inflammation, microglial activation, and downstream signaling pathways that can lead to neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - The disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons accounts for the onset and progression of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Echinacoside (ECH) can facilitate mitochondrial fusion to mediate neuroprotection, but its therapeutic efficacy is greatly limited by inefficient brain accumulation and neuronal delivery. Herein, ECH-encapsulated micelles are constructed from the copolymer containing the poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (PCBMA) block and phenylboronic acid (PBA)-modified poly(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate block, which mediates effective, brain-targeted delivery via intranasal administration. In POCD mice, the micelles efficiently penetrate nasal mucosa via the betaine structure in PCBMA that can be recognized by betaine-GABA transporter 1 (BGT-1) on nasal epithelial cells, followed by the accumulation into the hippocampus through the submucosal olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways. Subsequently, the micelles are efficiently internalized by neurons via BGT-1-mediated endocytosis. The over-produced reactive oxygen species inside neurons trigger micelles dissociation and ECH release, thereby inducing mitochondrial fusion to enhance neuron survival, ameliorate cerebral microenvironment, and restore cognitive and memory functions. This study reports a non-invasive strategy to overcome the physiological barriers against cerebral drug delivery and renders profound implications for POCD treatment.

AB  - Suk-SaiYasna (SSY) is a well-documented traditional Thai herbal formula in the Royal Scripture of King Narai's Traditional Medicine. SSY contains Cannabis sativa leaves as a key ingredient and has traditionally been used to promote sleep, alleviate stress-related symptoms, and stimulate appetite. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of SSY in a mouse model of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-induced cognitive impairment and explore the underlying mechanisms, particularly antioxidant enzyme pathways. Behavioral tests, including the Y-maze test, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze test, demonstrated that UCMS-exposed mice exhibited cognitive impairment compared to non-stress mice. However, SSY treatment significantly improved learning and memory performance in UCMS-exposed mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that SSY reduced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, key brain regions affected by chronic stress. Furthermore, UCMS significantly reduced the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), whereas SSY treatment restored their activity, indicating antioxidative and neuroprotective effects in vivo. Gene expression analysis further revealed that SSY regulates oxidative stress via the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. In vitro studies using 2,2 '-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay confirmed the radical scavenging activities of SSY and its herbal components, demonstrating significant antioxidant potential. Phytochemical analysis identified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A, and cannabinoids as bioactive compounds in SSY, along with potent antioxidants such as gallic acid, myricetin, myristicin, piperine, costunolide, and gingerol. These findings suggest that the SSY formula mitigates UCMS-induced cognitive function through its antioxidant properties via multiple pathways, including radical scavenging activities, modulating the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, inducing the expression of HO-1, NQO1 mRNAs, and other antioxidant enzymes. This work bridges traditional Thai medicine with modern neuropharmacology.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia, and impaired mitophagy is a hallmark of AD. Mitophagy is mitochondrial-specific autophagy. Ginsenosides from Ginseng involve in autophagy in cancer. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1 hereafter), a single compound of Ginseng, has neuroprotective effects on AD. However, few studies have reported whether Rg1 can ameliorate AD pathology by regulating mitophagy. Methods: Human SH-SY5Y cell and a 5XFAD mouse model were used to investigate the effects of Rg1. Rg1 (1 mu M) was added to 13-amyloid oligomer (A13O)-induced or APPswe-overexpressed cell models for 24 hours. 5XFAD mouse models were intraperitoneally injected with Rg1 (10 mg/kg/d) for 30 days. Expression levels of mitophagy-related markers were analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Cognitive function was assessed by Morris water maze. Mitophagic events were observed using transmission electron microscopy, western blot, and immunofluorescent staining from mouse hippocampus. The activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathway was examined using an immunoprecipitation assay. Results: Rg1 could restore mitophagy and ameliorate memory deficits in the AD cellular and/or mouse model through the PINK1-Parkin pathway. Moreover, Rg1 might induce microglial phagocytosis to reduce 13-amyloid (A13) deposits in the hippocampus of AD mice. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate the neuroprotective mechanism of ginsenoside Rg1 in AD models. Rg1 induces PINK-Parkin mediated mitophagy and ameliorates memory deficits in 5XFAD mouse models.

AB  - For small radius curve shield tunneling, over excavation is required on the inner side of the curve to corner the shield machine. Currently, there is no corresponding analytical solution for horizontal displacements. In this paper, using the image method and Mindlin solution and considering four factors: additional thrust on the excavation surface, frictional resistance of the shield shell, ground loss, and grouting pressure at the shield tail, a formula for calculating stratum horizontal displacements caused by small radius curve shield tunneling is derived. Based on the 220 kV Rhinoceros Station cable shield tunnel project in Guangzhou, the stratum horizontal displacement law and influencing factors are analyzed. Through comparison and verification with on-site measured data, the results indicate that the theoretical formula derived is reasonable and reliable, providing a new approach for predicting the stratum horizontal displacements induced by curve shield tunneling. The law of stratum horizontal deformation exhibits that the horizontal displacement caused by the over excavation side of the curve moves toward the tunnel side. The outer side of the curve shifts away from the tunnel. The peak appears near the axis of the shield tunnel. The ground loss has the most significant influence on stratum horizontal displacements. Furthermore, on the same tunnel cross-section, the closer the soil is to the tunnel, the greater the horizontal displacement of the soil, and vice versa. The change in shield shell length profoundly affects horizontal displacements. The friction difference coefficient has a significant impact on the stratum horizontal displacement outside the curve.

AB  - Mounting evidence demonstrates that consumption of high fat diet (HFD) and subsequent development of obesity leads to alterations in cognition and mood. While obesity can affect brain function, consumption of select dietary bioactives may help prevent obesity-related cognitive decline. This study investigated the capacity of the dietary flavonoid (-)-epicatechin (EC) to mitigate HFD-induced obesity-associated alterations in memory and mood. Healthy 8-week old male C57BL/6J mice were maintained on either a control diet (10 kCal% from fat) or a HFD (45 kCal% from fat) and were supplemented with EC at 2 or 20 mg/kg body weight (B.W.) for a 24 week period. Between week 20 and 22, anxiety-related behavior, recognition memory, and spatial memory were measured. Underlying mechanisms were assessed by measuring the expression of selected genes in the hippocampus and by 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis of the gut microbiota. 24 weeks of HFD feeding resulted in obesity, which was not affected by EC supplementation. HFD-associated increase in anxiety-related behavior was mitigated by EC in a dose-response manner and was accompanied by increased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as partial or full restoration of glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1) expression. Higher EC dosage (20 mg/kg B.W.) also restored aberrant Lactobacillus and Enterobacter abundance altered by HFD and/or the associated obesity. Together, these results demonstrate how EC mitigates anxiety-related behaviors, revealing a connection between BDNF-and glucocorticoids-mediated signaling. Our findings link changes in the hippocampus and the gut microbiota in a context of HFD-induced obesity and anxiety.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Saikosaponins B2 (SSB2) is one of the main active components isolated from Radix Bupleuri (Bupleurum chinense DC.), a herb widely used of traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used for the treatment of depression for more than two thousand years. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be determined. Aim of the study: In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect and elucidated underlying molecular mechanisms of SSB2 in LPS-induced primary microglia and CUMS-induced mice model of depression.Method: The effects of SSB2 treatment were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS) procedure was applied to establish the animal model of depression. Behavioural tests were used to evaluate the depressive-like behaviors in CUMS-exposed mice, including sucrose preference test, open field test, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test. The GPX4 gene of microglia was silenced using shRNA, and inflammatory cytokines were determined by Western Blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and ferroptosis-related markers were detected by qPCR, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Result: SSB2 reversed depressive-like behaviours in CUMS-exposed mice and relieved central neuroinflammation and ameliorated hippocampal neural damage. SSB2 alleviated LPS-induced activation of microglia through the TLR4/NF-& kappa;B pathway. LPS-induced ferroptosis, with increased levels of ROS, intracellular Fe2+, mitochondrial membrane potential, lipid peroxidation, GSH, SLC7A11, FTH, GPX4 and Nrf2, and decreased transcription levels of ACSL4 and TFR1, was attenuated with SSB2 treatment in primary microglia cells. GPX4 knockdown activated ferroptosis, induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and abrogated the protective effects of SSB2. Further, SSB2 attenuated ER stress, balanced calcium homeostasis, reduced lipid peroxidation and intracellular Fe2+ content by regulating the level of intracellular Ca2+.Conclusions: Our study suggested that SSB2 treatment can inhibit ferroptosis, maintain calcium homeostasis, relieve endoplasmic reticulum stress and attenuate central neuroinflammation. SSB2 exhibited anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammatory effects through the TLR4/NF-& kappa;B pathway in a GPX4-dependent manner.

AB  - Background: Anshen Dingzhi prescription (ADP) is an important prescription for the treatment of mental diseases in traditional Chinese medicine and is widely used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders.Purpose: To explore the ameliorative effect of ADP on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like behaviors in mice and determine the underlying mechanism.Methods: The constituents of ADP were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The PTSD-like behaviors of mice subjected to single prolonged stress (SPS) were evaluated using behavioral tests. Potential pathological changes in the hippocampus were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed to detect the expression of proteins involved in relevant signaling pathways. Results: Five quality control markers (ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, tenuifolin, poricoic acid B, and alpha-asarone) were detected in the ADP solution. The ginsenoside Rg1 content in ADP was found to be 0.114 mg/g. Mice subjected to SPS showed obvious fear generalization and anxiety-like behaviors. ADP treatment prevented the behavioral changes caused by exposure to SPS. Compared with control animals, the number of normal pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice exposed to SPS was decreased and the number of degenerating pyramidal cells was increased; however, ADP administration could counteract these effects. Furthermore, the protein expression of BDNF, p-TrkB, mu-calpain, PSD95, GluN2A, GluA1, p-AKT, p-mTOR, and ARC was decreased, while that of PTEN and GluN2B was increased in the hippocampus of mice subjected to SPS compared with that in control animals; however, these changes in protein expression were reversed following ADP treatment. Importantly, the ameliorative effect of ADP on PTSD-like behaviors and synaptic protein expression were inhibited by rapamycin administration.Conclusions: ADP administration improves PTSD-like behaviors in mice and this effect may be mediated through an mTOR-dependent improvement in synaptic function in the hippocampus.

TI  - Synchronous activity patterns in the dentate gyrus during immobility
T2  - ELIFE
LA  - English
AB  - The hippocampal dentate gyrus is an important relay conveying sensory information from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus proper. During exploration, the dentate gyrus has been proposed to act as a pattern separator. However, the dentate gyrus also shows structured activity during immobility and sleep. The properties of these activity patterns at cellular resolution, and their role in hippocampal-dependent memory processes have remained unclear. Using dual-color in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we show that in immobile mice dentate granule cells generate sparse, synchronized activity patterns associated with entorhinal cortex activation. These population events are structured and modified by changes in the environment; and they incorporate place- and speed cells. Importantly, they are more similar than expected by chance to population patterns evoked during self-motion. Using optogenetic inhibition, we show that granule cell activity is not only required during exploration, but also during immobility in order to form dentate gyrus-dependent spatial memories.

AB  - The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor is a major target of ethanol, and it is implicated in learning and memory formation, and other cognitive functions. Glycine acts as a co-agonist for this receptor. We examined whether Org24598, a selective inhibitor of glycine transporter1 (GlyT1), affects ethanol withdrawal-induced deficits in recognition memory (Novel Object Recognition (NOR) task) and spatial memory (Barnes Maze (BM) task) in rats, and whether the NMDA receptor glycine site participates in this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats were habituated to NOR or BM tasks, and then received binge-like intragastric ethanol administration (5 days, 5 g/kg). After ethanol withdrawal, Org24598 (0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 mg/kg) was administered 30 min before NOR (day 10 of withdrawal) or the reversal learning phase of BM (day 11-13 of withdrawal) task. The expression of GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors were measured in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and hippocampus (HIP) after termination of NOR. In the BM task, a glycine antagonist, L-701,324 (5 mg/kg), was administered 30 min before Org24598 to confirm the involvement of the NMDA receptor glycine site in the effects of Org24598. Our study showed that binge-like ethanol administration induced recognition and spatial memory impairments after withdrawal in rats. Additionally, an up-regulation of GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor was observed in the HIP and PRC on day 11 of abstinence. Org24598 ameliorated memory loss and normalized the expression of these subunits. L-701,324 reversed the effect of Org24598. Thus, NMDA receptor glycine sites are important in ethanol withdrawal-induced memory impairments.

AB  - Hippocampal place cells are a well-known object in neuroscience, but their place field formation in the first moments of navigating in a novel environment remains an ill-defined process. To address these dynamics, we performed in vivo imaging of neuronal activity in the CA1 field of the mouse hippocampus using genetically encoded green calcium indicators, including the novel NCaMP7 and FGCaMP7, designed specifically for in vivo calcium imaging. Mice were injected with a viral vector encoding calcium sensor, head-mounted with an NVista HD miniscope, and allowed to explore a completely novel environment (circular track surrounded by visual cues) without any reinforcement stimuli, in order to avoid potential interference from reward-related behavior. First, we calculated the average time required for each CA1 cell to acquire its place field. We found that 25% of CA1 place fields were formed at the first arrival in the corresponding place, while the average tuning latency for all place fields in a novel environment equaled 247 s. After 24 h, when the environment was familiar to the animals, place fields formed faster, independent of retention of cognitive maps during this session. No cumulation of selectivity score was observed between these two sessions. Using dimensionality reduction, we demonstrated that the population activity of rapidly tuned CA1 place cells allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated circular maze; the distribution of reconstruction error between the mice was consistent with the distribution of the average place field selectivity score in them. Our data thus show that neuronal activity recorded with genetically encoded calcium sensors revealed fast behavior-dependent plasticity in the mouse hippocampus, resulting in the rapid formation of place fields and population activity that allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated maze.

AB  - Context Sevoflurane (Sev) is a commonly used surgical anaesthetic; it has neurotoxic effects on the brain. Echinatin (Ech) is reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Objective This research confirms the effect of Ech on Sev-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits. Materials and methods Primary rat hippocampal neurons were treated with 4.1% Sev for 6 h in the presence of Ech (5, 10, and 20 mu M) or vehicle, followed by a further 42 h of culture. Male Sprague-Dawley aged rats were divided into 6 groups (n = 6): control, Sev, Sev + Ech (20 mg/kg;), Sev + Ech (40 mg/kg), and Sev + Ech (80 mg/kg). Rats were intraperitoneally injected with Ech or vehicle 1 h before Sev exposure (2% Sev for 5 h). Results We found that Ech (5, 10, and 20 mu M) elevated cell viability (1.29-, 1.51-, 1.68-fold) but mitigated apoptosis (23.87% vs. 16.48%, 12.72%, 9.02%), oxidative stress, and ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons with Sev treatment. Ech activated the Nrf2 expression in Sev-induced in vitro and in vivo models of anaesthetic neurotoxicity. Ech also weakened neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons with Sev treatment by increasing Nrf2 expression level. Moreover, Ech alleviated hippocampus neurons apoptosis (19.38% vs. 16.05%, 11.71%, 8.88%), oxidative stress, and ferroptosis in rats with Sev treatment. Ech improved Sev-induced cognitive deficits in rats. Conclusions Ech alleviates Sev-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits by mitigation of ferroptosis and oxidative stress. Ech may be developed as a new promising therapeutic drug for treatment of cerebral nerve injury caused by surgical anaesthesia.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism was shown to strongly affect BDNF function, but its role in modulating gray matter damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is still not clear. Given BDNF relevance on the hippocampus, we aimed to explore BDNF Val66Met polymorphism effect on hippocampal subfield volumes and its role in cognitive functioning in MS patients. Using a 3T scanner, we obtained dual-echo and 3DT1-weighted sequences from 50 MS patients and 15 healthy controls (HC) consecutively enrolled. MS patients also underwent genotype analysis of BDNF, neurological and neuropsychological evaluation. Hippocampal subfields were segmented by using Freesurfer. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was found in 22 MS patients (44%). Compared to HC, MS patients had lower volume in: bilateral hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA); cornus ammonis (CA)1, granule cell layer of dentate gyrus (GCL-DG), CA4 and CA3 of the left hippocampal head; molecular layer (ML) of the left hippocampal body; presubiculum of right hippocampal body and right fimbria. Compared to BDNF Val66Val, Val66Met MS patients had higher volume in bilateral hippocampal tail; CA1, ML, CA3, CA4, and GCL-DG of left hippocampal head; CA1, ML, and CA3 of the left hippocampal body; left HATA and presubiculum of the right hippocampal head. In MS patients, higher lesion burden was associated with lower volume of presubiculum of right hippocampal body; lower volume of left hippocampal tail was associated with worse visuospatial memory performance; lower volume of left hippocampal head with worse performance in semantic fluency. Our findings suggest the BNDF Val66Met polymorphism may have a protective role in MS patients against both hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment. BDNF genotype might be a potential biomarker for predicting cognitive prognosis, and an interesting target to study for neuroprotective strategies.

AB  - The dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat of African trypanosomes represents the primary host pathogen interface. Antigenic variation prevents clearing of the pathogen by employing a large repertoire of antigenically distinct VSG genes, thus neutralizing the host's antibody response. To explore the epitope space of VSGs, we generate anti-VSG nanobodies and combine high-resolution structural analysis of VSG-nanobody complexes with binding assays on living cells, revealing that these camelid antibodies bind deeply inside the coat. One nanobody causes rapid loss of cellular motility, possibly due to blockage of VSG mobility on the coat, whose rapid endocytosis and exocytosis are mechanistically linked to Trypanosoma brucei propulsion and whose density is required for survival. Electron microscopy studies demonstrate that this loss of motility is accompanied by rapid formation and shedding of nanovesicles and nanotubes, suggesting that increased protein crowding on the dense membrane can be a driving force for membrane fission in living cells.

AB  - Postpartum period being a critical phase affecting women's health recovery, and stressful events during this period are major risk factors for postpartum depression. Pup separation (PS) serves as a natural model of postpartum maternal care. However, the effects of different PS (no separation, NPS; 15 min/day, PS15, brief PS; 180 min/day, PS180, long PS) during lactation on stress-induced behavioral deficits in dams, along with the underlying mechanisms of resilience remain unclear. In this study, we assessed cognitive and emotional behaviors in lactating C57BL/6 J dams subjected to different PS from postnatal day 1 to day 21, along with chronic restraint stress (CRS). Subsequently, hippocampal samples were collected to analyze the expression of NLRP3, IL-18, and IL-1 beta, along with microglial activation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We further modulated AHN using viral and examined the effects of AHN overexpression or inhibition on behavior and hippocampal neuroinflammation. Dams subjected to brief PS exhibited reduced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and improved cognitive function. Additionally, PS15 dams showed decreased hippocampal expression of NLRP3, IL-18, and IL-1 beta, reduced microglia activation, and increased AHN. Overexpression of AHN can significantly improved cognitive function, but no significant changes in emotional behaviors were observed. Besides, AHN-mediated cognitive behavior participates in resilience to anxiety and depression-like behaviors of dams after CRS. Similarly, inhibition of hippocampal NLRP3 expression enhanced AHN-related cognitive behavior and promoted stress resilience in adult female mice. Brief PS resulted in resilience to anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in dams and mitigated memory impairments induced by CRS. This study confirmed AHN-mediated cognitive behavior participates in stress resilience to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in postpartum dams after CRS.

AB  - Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) lies at the interface between sensory and cognitive networks in the brain and mediates between these, although it is not yet known how. It has two distinct subregions, granular (gRSC) and dysgranular (dRSC). The present study investigated how these subregions differ with respect to their electrophysiology and thalamic connectivity, as a step towards understanding their functions. The gRSC is more closely connected to the hippocampal formation, in which theta-band local field potential oscillations are prominent. We, therefore, compared theta-rhythmic single-unit activity between the two RSC subregions and found, mostly in gRSC, a subpopulation of non-directional cells with spiking activity strongly entrained by theta oscillations, suggesting a stronger coupling of gRSC to the hippocampal system. We then used retrograde tracers to test for differential inputs to RSC from the anteroventral thalamus (AV). We found that gRSC and dRSC differ in their afferents from two AV subfields: dorsomedial (AVDM) and ventrolateral (AVVL). Specifically: (1) as a whole AV projects more strongly to gRSC; (2) AVVL targets both gRSC and dRSC, while AVDM provides a selective projection to gRSC, (3) the gRSC projection is layer-specific: AVDM targets specifically gRSC superficial layers. These same AV projections are topographically organized with ventral AV neurons innervating rostral RSC and dorsal AV neurons innervating caudal RSC. These combined results suggest the existence of two distinct but interacting RSC subcircuits: one connecting AVDM to gRSC that may comprise part of the cognitive hippocampal system, and the other connecting AVVL to both RSC regions that may link hippocampal and perceptual regions. We suggest that these subcircuits are distinct to allow for differential weighting during integration of converging sensory and cognitive computations: an integration that may take place in thalamus, RSC, or both.

AB  - Context: Panax japonicus is the dried rhizome of Panax japonicus C.A. Mey. (Araliaceae). Saponins from Panax japonicus (SPJ) exhibit anti-oxidative and anti-aging effects.
   Objective: We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of SPJ on aging rats.
   Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (18-months-old) were randomly divided into aging and SPJ groups (n = 8). Five-month-old rats were taken as the adult control (n = 8). The rats were fed a normal chow diet or the SPJ-containing diet (10 or 30mg/kg) for 4months. An in vitro model was established by D-galactose (D-Gal) in the SH-SY5Y cell line and pretreated with SPJ (25 and 50 mg/mL). The neuroprotection of SPJ was evaluated via Nissl staining, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting in vivo and in vitro.
   Results: SPJ improved the neuronal degeneration and mitochondrial morphology that are associated with aging. Meanwhile, SPJ up-regulated the protein levels of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) and down-regulated the protein level of dynamin-like protein 1 (Drp1) in the hippocampus of aging rats (p< 0.05 or p< 0.01 vs. 22 M). The in vitro studies also demonstrated that SPJ attenuated D-Gal-induced cell senescence concomitant with the improvement in mitochondrial function; SPJ, also upregulated the Mfn2 and Opa1 protein levels, whereas the Drp1 protein level (p< 0.05 or p< 0.01 vs. D-Gal group) was down-regulated.
   Discussion and conclusions: Further research on the elderly population will contribute to the development and utilization of SPJ for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Background N-1-Methyladenosine (m(1)A) is an abundant modification of transcripts regulating mRNA structure and translation efficiency. However, the characteristics and biological functions of mRNA m(1)A modification in adult hippocampal neurogenesis remain enigmatic. Results We found that m(1)A demethylase Alkbh3 was dramatically enriched in neurons and neuronal genesis. Functionally, depletion of Alkbh3 in neural stem cells (NSCs) significantly decreased m(1)A modification, neuronal differentiation and proliferation coupling with increasing gliogenesis, whereas overexpressing Alkbh3 facilitated neuronal differentiation and proliferation. Mechanistically, the m(1)A demethylation of Mmp15 mRNA by Alkbh3 improved its RNA stability and translational efficacy, which promoted neurogenesis. Therapeutically, the silencing of Alkbh3 reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired spatial memory in the adult mice. Conclusions We reveal a novel function of m(1)A demethylation on Mmp15 mRNA in Alkbh3-mediated neurogenesis, which shed light on advancing Alkbh3 regulation of neurogenesis as a novel neurotherapeutic strategy.

AB  - Background DNA methylation is a critical molecular mark involved in cellular differentiation and cell-specific processes. Single-cell whole genome DNA methylation profiling methods hold great potential to resolve the DNA methylation profiles of individual cell-types. Here we present a method that couples single-cell combinatorial indexing (sci) with enzymatic conversion (sciEM) of unmethylated cytosines. Results The sciEM method facilitates DNA methylation profiling of single-cells that is highly correlated with single cell bisulfite-based workflows (r2 > 0.99) whilst improving sequencing alignment rates, reducing adapter contamination and over-estimation of DNA methylation levels (CpG and non-CpG). As proof-of-concept we perform sciEM analysis of the temporal lobe, motor cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of the human brain to resolve single-cell DNA methylation of all major cell-types.Conclusion To our knowledge sciEM represents the first non-bisulfite single-cell DNA methylation sequencing approach with single-base resolution.

AB  - Human rhinovirus is the most frequently isolated virus during severe exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this disease, alveolar macrophages display significantly diminished phagocytic functions that could be associated with bacterial superinfections. However, how human rhinovirus affects the functions of macrophages is largely unknown. Macrophages treated with HRV16 demonstrate deficient bacteria-killing activity, impaired phagolysosome biogenesis, and altered intracellular compartments. Using RNA sequencing, we identify the small GTPase ARL5b to be upregulated by the virus in primary human macrophages. Importantly, depletion of ARL5b rescues bacterial clearance and localization of endosomal markers in macrophages upon HRV16 exposure. In permissive cells, depletion of ARL5b increases the secretion of HRV16 virions. Thus, we identify ARL5b as a novel regulator of intracellular trafficking dynamics and phagolysosomal biogenesis in macrophages and as a restriction factor of HRV16 in permissive cells.
   Human rhinovirus 16 impairs bacteria clearance and phagosome maturation in human macrophages in an ARL5b-dependent manner. In permissive cells, ARL5b is a restriction factor of human rhinovirus 16.Human rhinovirus 16 impairs bacterial clearance and phagosome maturation. ARL5b is upregulated by the human rhinovirus 16. ARL5b is responsible of defective phagolysosome biogenesis and bacterial clearance. ARL5b is a restriction factor of human rhinovirus 16 in permissive cells.

AB  - Devices to perform neural stimulation rely on batteries or permanent power outlet for power supply and delivery of electrical stimulation. Bulky system frame and inflexible component design are the limiting factors to improve portability and compatibility. Here, we report design and use of self-powered neural stimulation that can harvest energy from body motion and perform bidirectional modulation of neural plasticity. The system builds on flexible materials and integrates piezoelectric nanogenerator for energy-harvesting, signal modulation component for dual-modality output of stimulation pulses and implantable electrodes for delivery of stimulation to the neural tissue. When the neural stimulation is delivered in vivo in the mouse hippocampus, two forms of neural plasticity changes, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), have been successfully delivered. The self-powered system demonstrates that integrated neural stimulation design driven by energy harvested from biological motions in the environment is suitable for modulation of neural plasticity, plasticity-based therapy or brain-machine interactions.

AB  - Nasal mucosal epithelial tissue remodeling and persist inflammation are related to the development of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Quercetin possesses multiple biological properties in several inflammatory diseases. However, its roles in CRS remain unclear. In this study, Serumstaphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) increased inflammatory response in human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs), which was reversed by quercetin. Moreover, quercetin inhibited SEB-evoked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hNECs by increasing EMT marker E-cadherin and decreasing N-cadherin expression. Concomitantly, SEB-induced increases in transcripts and release of MMP-9 were reduced by quercetin. Mechanistically, quercetin inhibited SEB-induced activation of the TLR2-NF-kB axis in hNECs. Moreover, restoring TLR2 signaling reversed quercetin-mediated inhibition of SEB-induced inflammation, EMT and MMP-9 expression. In vivo, quercetin attenuated histopathological changes of nasal mucosal tissues in Staphylococcus aureus-constructed CRS mice. Concomitantly, quercetin alleviated inflammatory response and nasal mucosal remodeling by suppressing EMT and MMP-9 levels. Additionally, quercetin ameliorated imbalance of Treg/Th17 proportions. Notably, quercetin suppressed activation of the TLR2-NF-kB axis, while restoring this signaling reversed quercetin-mediated protection against CRS. Thus, quercetin may attenuate pathological progression of CRS by inhibiting nasal mucosal tissue remodeling, inflammation and Treg/Th17 imbalance, which may be associated with inhibition of TLR2-NF-kB axis, supporting a promising therapeutic agent for CRS.

AB  - Deep neural networks have made tremendous gains in emulating human-like intelligence, and have been used increasingly as ways of understanding how the brain may solve the complex computational problems on which this relies. However, these still fall short of, and therefore fail to provide insight into how the brain supports strong forms of generalization of which humans are capable. One such case is out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization - successful performance on test examples that lie outside the distribution of the training set. Here, we identify properties of processing in the brain that may contribute to this ability. We describe a two-part algorithm that draws on specific features of neural computation to achieve OOD generalization, and provide a proof of concept by evaluating performance on two challenging cognitive tasks. First we draw on the fact that the mammalian brain represents metric spaces using grid cell code (e.g., in the entorhinal cortex): abstract representations of relational structure, organized in recurring motifs that cover the representational space. Second, we propose an attentional mechanism that operates over the grid cell code using determinantal point process (DPP), that we call DPP attention (DPP-A) - a transformation that ensures maximum sparseness in the coverage of that space. We show that a loss function that combines standard task-optimized error with DPP-A can exploit the recurring motifs in the grid cell code, and can be integrated with common architectures to achieve strong OOD generalization performance on analogy and arithmetic tasks. This provides both an interpretation of how the grid cell code in the mammalian brain may contribute to generalization performance, and at the same time a potential means for improving such capabilities in artificial neural networks.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Green tea ( Camellia sinensis ) is a popular beverage consumed all over the world due to its health benefits. Many of these beneficial effects of green tea are attributed to polyphenols, particularly catechins. Aim of the study: The present study focuses on underlying anti-platelet aggregation, anti-thrombotic, and antilipidemic molecular mechanisms of green tea in South Indian smokers. Materials and methods : We selected 120 South Indian male volunteers for this study to collect the blood and categorised them into four groups; control group individuals (Controls), smokers, healthy control individuals consuming green tea, and smokers consuming green tea. Smokers group subjects have been smoking an average 16 -18 cigarettes per day for the last 7 years or more. The subjects (green tea consumed groups) consumed 100 mL of green tea each time, thrice a day for a one-year period. Results: LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of multiple phytocompounds along with catechins in green tea extract. Increased plasma lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyls, cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDLcholesterol with decreased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed in smokers compared to the control group and the consumption of green tea showed beneficial effect. Furthermore, docking studies revealed that natural compounds of green tea had high binding capacity with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA) when compared to their positive controls, whereas (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and (-) epicatechingallate (ECG) had high binding capacity with sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1c). Further, our ex vivo studies showed that green tea extract (GTE) significantly inhibited platelet aggregation and increased thrombolytic activity in a dose dependent manner. Conclusion: In conclusion, in smokers, catechins synergistically lowered oxidative stress, platelet aggregation and modified the aberrant lipid profile. Furthermore, molecular docking studies supported green tea catechins ' antihyperlipidemic efficacy through strong inhibitory activity on HMG-CoA reductase and SREBP1c. The mitigating effects of green tea on cardiovascular disease risk factors in smokers that have been reported can be attributed majorly to catechins or to their synergistic effects.

AB  - The aim of the present paper is to investigate the possibility of using the dipole dimer as water model in describing the electrical double layer capacitor capacitance behaviors. Several points are confirmed. First, the use of the dipole dimer water model enables several experimental phenomena of aqueous electrical double layer capacitance to be achievable: suppress the differential capacitance values gravely overestimated by the hard sphere water model and continuum medium water model, respectively; reproduce the negative correlation effect between the differential capacitance and temperature, insensitivity of the differential capacitance to bulk electrolyte concentration, and camel-shaped capacitance-voltage curves; and more quantitatively describe the camel peak position of the capacitance-voltage curve and its dependence on the counter-ion size. Second, we fully illustrate that the electric dipole plays an irreplaceable role in reproducing the above experimentally confirmed capacitance behaviors and the previous hard sphere water model without considering the electric dipole is simply not competent. The novelty of the paper is that it shows the potential of the dipole dimer water model in helping reproduce experimentally verified aqueous electric double layer capacitance behaviors. One can expect to realize this potential by properly selecting parameters such as the dimer site size, neutral interaction, residual dielectric constant, etc.

AB  - It has been well established that Cornu Ammonis-(CA1) and subiculum (SUB) serve as the major output components of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry. Nevertheless, how the neuromodulators regulate the neurocircuitry in hippocampal formation has remained elusive. Cholecystokinin (CCK), is the most abundant neuropeptide in the central nervous system, which broadly regulates the animal's physiological status at multiple levels, including neuroplasticity and its behavioral consequences. Here, we uncover that exogenous CCK potentiates the excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1-SUB projections via CCK-B receptor. Dual-color light theta burst stimulation elicits heterosynaptic long-term potentiation in distal SUB region. Light activation of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) derived CCK-positive neurons triggers the CCK release in the SUB. Neuronal activities of SUB-projecting MECCCK neurons are necessary for conveying and processing of navigation-related information. In conclusion, our findings prove a crucial role of CCK in regulating neurobiological functions in the SUB region.

AB  - There is an unmet need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies to not only restrain seizures but also to alleviate the underlying pathologies and sequelae. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid, has shown promising effect in the kindling model of epileptogenesis, but due to the poor oral bioavailability its clinical application is limited. So, the present study was designed to study the neuroprotective effect of BBR nanoparticles (enhanced bioavailability as compared to BBR) against seizures in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced kindling model of epileptogenesis. Kindling model was established in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of PTZ (30 mg/kg) on every alternate day till the animal became fully kindled or till 6 weeks. Three doses of BBR (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) and nano-BBR (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) were studied for seizure score, percentage of animal kindled, histopathological score, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in PTZ treated rats by conducting cytokines, gene expression and protein expression analysis. BBR nanoparticles showed significant effect on the seizure score and percentage of animal kindled, histopathological score, neurobehavioral parameters (Forced swim test, Rotarod), oxidative (MDA, SOD, GSH, GPx) and inflammatory (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha) parameters, apoptotic parameters (Bax and iNOS), and gene (Nrf2, NQO1, HO1) and protein expression (Nrf2) as compared to both PTZ and BBR. BBR nanoparticles showed neuroprotective effect in PTZ induced kindling model of epileptogenesis and proves to be a promising antiepileptogenic therapy for the patients who are at high risk of developing seizures.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is characterized by the diminished expression of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), a ubiquitously expressed RNA binding protein with numerous functions in cells. Our prior work found significant differences in physiological and behavioral outcomes as a function of FMRP levels and in response to diet in mice. Here, we assess protein biomarker levels as a function of FMRP levels, sex and matched casein and soy protein isolate-based purified ingredient diets in Fmr1KO and littermate mice. Brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) and blood plasma were analyzed by RayBiotech's Quantibody (R) Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array 640 to quantitate the expression of 640 proteins. The main findings were the identification of numerous proteins that were differentially expressed in response to diet, sex and/or genotype. Of note, prolactin (PRL) levels in blood plasma were significantly elevated in Fmr1KO female mice as a function of genotype and sex selectively with the AIN-93G/casein diet. Also, using a moderately stringent significance cutoff, growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) in plasma from mice fed AIN-93G/soy was the only protein studied by Quantibody arrays that was differentially expressed between WT and Fmr1KO male mice. When comparing the results from a pelleted infant formula study with AIN-93G-based diets, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) in plasma was the only protein differentially expressed as a function of soy in the diet. There was no overlap in statistically significant results when comparing tissue analyzed by mass spectrometry versus Quantibody arrays from mice maintained on AIN-93G-based diets. In conclusion, gene-diet interactions affect protein expression in Fmr1KO and littermate mice and need to be considered in study design.

AB  - Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 2 catalyzes the methylation of arginine residues in histones. Depression is associated with histone methylation; however, more comprehensive research is needed on how PRMT2 regulates depression. The present study aimed to investigate the effects and possible mechanism(s) of PRMT2 overexpression on depression-like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats, and whether lentivirus-mediated PRMT2 overexpression in the hippocampus suppresses depression-like behavior. Furthermore, the PRMT2 inhibitor MS023 was administered to the animals to investigate whether the antidepressant effect of PRMT2 overexpression could be reversed. Behavioral experiments were performed to detect depression-like behavior in rats. Western blotting was used to determine protein expression levels of PRMT2, histone H3R8 asymmetric dimethylation (H3R8me2a), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and arginase 1 (Arg1) in rat hippocampal tissues. Hippocampal microglia and PRMT2 were stained using immunofluorescence techniques. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the levels of various inflammatory factors in rat hippocampal tissue. Results of analysis revealed that PRMT2 overexpression in the hippocampus exerted an antidepressant effect. PRMT2 overexpression in the hippocampus reduced the proportion of activated microglia in the hippocampus, upregulated Arg1 and H3R8me2a expression, and downregulated iNOS expression. PRMT2 overexpression in the hippocampus inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory factors and promoted the release of anti-inflammatory factors. In summary, PRMT2 overexpression in the hippocampus promoted the conversion of microglia from the M1 to M2 type, resulting in an antidepressant effect. These results suggest that PRMT2 may be a potential therapeutic target to prevent and treat depression.

AB  - Background: During the initial COVID-19 response, Germany's Federal Government implemented several nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that were instrumental in suppressing early exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2. NPI effect on the transmission of other respiratory viruses has not been examined at the national level thus far.
   Methods: Upper respiratory tract specimens from 3580 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), collected within the nationwide German ARI Sentinel, underwent RT-PCR diagnostics for multiple respiratory viruses. The observation period (weeks 1-38 of 2020) included the time before, during and after a far-reaching contact ban. Detection rates for different viruses were compared to 2017-2019 sentinel data (15350 samples; week 1-38, 11823 samples).
   Findings: The March 2020 contact ban, which was followed by a mask mandate, was associated with an unprecedented and sustained decline of multiple respiratory viruses. Among these, rhinovirus was the single agent that resurged to levels equalling those of previous years. Rhinovirus rebound was first observed in children, after schools and daycares had reopened. By contrast, other nonenveloped viruses (i.e. gastroenteritis viruses reported at the national level) suppressed after the shutdown did not rebound.
   Interpretation: Contact restrictions with a subsequent mask mandate in spring may substantially reduce respiratory virus circulation. This reduction appears sustained for most viruses, indicating that the activity of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the subsequent winter season might be low,whereas rhinovirus resurgence, potentially driven by transmission in educational institutions in a setting of waning population immunity, might signal predominance of rhinovirus-related ARIs.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine (Dex) and oxycodone (Oxy) on neurocognitive and inflammatory response after tourniquet-induced ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. C57/BL6 mice were used to construct the mouse model of tourniquet-induced I/R injury. Mice (n = 48) were randomly divided into sham, I/R, Dex or Oxy group. Morris water maze test was performed to assess the spatial learning and memory function. The expression of NF-kappa B, TLR4, NR2B, M1 (CD68 and TNF-alpha) and M2 (CD206 and IL-10) polarization markers in mice hippocampus were detected by western blot or immunofluorescent staining. Spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded by electrophysiology. Dex treatment alleviated I/R-induced declines in learning and memory (p < 0.05), while Oxy had no significant effect on it. Compared with I/R group, Dex and Oxy treatment down-regulated the expression of NF-kappa B, TLR4, TNF-alpha and CD68 (all p < 0.05), while no significantly different was found in CD206 and IL-10. In addition, Dex treatment down-regulated the expression of NR2B and reduced the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs in I/R model mice (all p < 0.05), while Oxy had no significant effect on them. Tourniquet-induced I/R could impair the neurocognitive function of mice. Dex treatment could alleviate I/R-induced neurocognitive disorder by inhibiting abnormal synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. Both Dex and Oxy could alleviate the inflammatory response likely by inhibiting the polarization of microglia toward M1 phenotype via TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway. Future studies are needed to further examine the effects of Dex on neurocognitive disorder after tourniquet-induced I/R injury and investigate the exact mechanism.

AB  - Simple Summary Research suggests that contagious yawning evolved to synchronize activity and vigilance within groups. To date, yawning has shown to be contagious in a wide range of mammalian species, including humans, great apes, some monkey species, domesticated dogs and pigs, wolves, lions, and rats. However, yawn contagion has only been previously documented in one bird species: budgerigars (Melosittacus undulatus). Here, we sought to examine whether yawning was contagious among juvenile common ravens (Corvus corax). By observing two small and undisturbed captive groups, we also assessed the contagious nature of other frequently observed and potentially contagious behaviors: stretching, scratching, and shaking. Overall, we found no evidence for behavioral contagion. Given the limitations to the observational methods, however, we suggest future experimental research be conducted to support these findings. The overt and reflexive matching of behaviors among conspecifics has been observed in a growing number of social vertebrates, including avian species. In general, behavioral contagion-such as the spread of yawning-may serve important functions in group synchronization and vigilance behavior. Here, we performed an exploratory study to investigate yawn contagion among 10 captive juvenile ravens (Corvus corax), across two groups. Using observational methods, we also examined the contagiousness of three other distinct behaviors: stretching, scratching, and shaking. A total of 44 20 min observations were made across both groups, including 28 in the morning and 16 in the afternoon. The time and occurrence of all the behaviors from each bird were coded, and the temporal pattern of each behavior across both groups was then analyzed to assess the degree of social contagion. Overall, we found no evidence for contagious yawning, stretching, scratching, or shaking. However, yawns were relatively infrequent per observation (0.052 +/- 0.076 yawns/bird) and thus experimental methods should be used to support this finding.

AB  - Somatostatin interneurons exhibited anti-epileptic activity. As a result, somatostatin agonists appear to be a promising target for antiepileptic drug development (AEDs). In this regard, we investigated the effects of octreotide, a somatostatin analog, on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in male Wistar rats. Animals were given octreotide at doses of 50 or 100 & mu;g/kg for seven days. The anxiolytic effects of octreotide were then evaluated using open field and elevated plus-maze tests. Following that, mice were intraperitoneally given a single convulsive dosage of PTZ (60 mg/kg) and then monitored for 30 min for symptoms of seizures. Finally, the antioxidant capacity of brain tissue and histopathological changes in the hippocampus were investigated. Octreotide therapy for seven days at 50 or 100 & mu;g/kg was more effective than diazepam in preventing acute PTZinduced seizures (P < 0.05). Furthermore, both octreotide dosages revealed substantial anxiolytic effects in openfield and elevated plus-maze tests compared to untreated rats. Nonetheless, octreotide's anxiolytic impact was less effective than diazepam's. On the other hand, octreotide also suppressed neuronal apoptosis and attenuated oxidative stress. Our results suggest that chronic administration of octreotide has anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and antioxidant activity in the male Wistar rat model.

AB  - Cisplatin, which is effective for the treatment of solid tumors, also can induce cochlear hair cell damage. Therefore, this study was intended to explore how Hippo/YAP signaling pathway affects the cochlear hair cell injury by regulating ferroptosis. After cisplatin induction, or LAT1-IN-1 (YAP activator) and verteporfin (YAP inhibitor) treatment or transfection, the viability of HEI-OC1 cells was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The iron level and the levels of oxidative stress markers (ROS, MDA and 4-HNE) were analyzed by iron assay kit, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) assay kits, respectively. The expression of ferritin light chain (FTL) in HEI-OC1 cells was detected by immunofluorescence and protein expressions of yes associated protein (YAP,) phosphorylated YAP (p-YAP), transferrin receptor (TFRC), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) in HEI-OC1 cells were detected by western blot. The transcription of FTL and TFRC by YAP1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The transfection efficiency of small interfering RNA (si-RNA) specific to FTL (siRNA-FTL) and TFRC (siRNA-TFRC) was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). As a result, cisplatin inhibited the viability of HEIOC1 cells by increasing free Fe2+ level and decreasing FTL level. LAT1-IN-1 promoted the viability of cisplatininduced HEI-OC1 cells by suppressing oxidative stress level, free Fe2+ level, ferroptosis and increasing FTL level, while the effect of verteporfin was the opposite. YAP1 transcriptionally regulated the expression of FTL and TFRC. Inhibition of FTL suppressed the viability of cisplatin-induced HEI-OC1 cells by increasing oxidative stress level, free Fe2+ level, ferroptosis and decreasing FTL level, while the effect of TFRC inhibition was the opposite. In conclusion, YAP1 ameliorated cochlear hair cell injury by upregulating FTL and TFRC to suppress ferroptosis.

AB  - Background Diabetic complications have been studied extensively in recent years. There are very few biomarkers in body fluids that can pinpoint a distinct diabetic complication due to insufficient known specific biomarkers for ischemia.Objective Identifying microRNA in animal models for each complication could enable early diagnosis of a given complication if verified in humans. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling has been done in rodent models for a number of diabetic complications, like diabetic glomerular injury, atherosclerosis, cognitive impairment, diabetic wound healing, angiopathy and other complications. Due to multiple differences between rodents and humans, the changes in rabbit skin, considered closer to humans than even pigs, may better simulate human diabetic complications of ischemia.Methods To study the miRNA profile of rabbits in which diabetes was induced or ischemia was surgically generated, we studied whether diabetes or ischemia-induced specific miRNA could be detected. MicroRNA from the blood of diabetic rabbits and rabbits with local ischemia was collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes specifically designed for miRNA isolation and extracted using the PAX gene miRNA extraction kit. The isolated RNA was quality controlled using an RNA analyzer, and further, using RNA seq technology, it was analyzed for distinct miRNAs that were detected in diabetic and non-diabetic rabbits induced with ischemia.Results A miRNA that was found to be expressed in diabetic rabbits and ischemic rabbits but not in untreated rabbits was miRNA-183. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed across comparison groups, and several upregulated miRNAs were identified being unique to each comparison. In rabbits with a potential diabetic complication of a long-term ischemic model, there was one distinct microRNA, which was highly significantly upregulated in ischemia rabbit (miRNA-133-3p). One miRNA that was highly significantly upregulated in diabetic rabbit but not in ischemic rabbits was miRNA-3074-5p. Only statistically significant results have been considered and analyzed.Conclusion These findings could lead to a precise and timely diagnosis of a potential single diabetic complication without invasive tissue biopsies and could be a novel tool in the management of diabetic patients developing complications due to the progression of diabetes.

To achieve the maximum efficiency of cell therapy, determining the optimal dose of MSCs is essential. This study was conducted to assess the dose-dependent therapeutic response of MSCs against pathological and behavioral AD-associated alterations.Methods: A beta 1-42 was injected intrahippocampally to establish an AD rat model. The MWM test was utilized to evaluate the animal's behavioral functions after receiving low and high doses of MSCs in the hippocampus region. ELISA and RT-qPCR were also employed to assess the concentration of markers related to antioxidant activity and inflammation and the gene expression related to apoptosis in the hippocampus region, respectively.Results: Low-dose MSC transplantation by increasing the concentrations of the antioxidant GSH, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, as well as by lowering the concentrations of TNF-alpha, and the expression levels of apoptotic factors (Bay and caspase 3), exerted a neuroprotective effect in the hippocampus of AD rats and relatively ameliorated spatial learning and memory impairments. However, increasing the dose of MSCs decreased the therapeutic benefits of these cells and had no significant effect on the recovery of behavioral disorders.Conclusion: Our findings reveal the dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of MSCs in AD. The therapeutic response of MSCs to ameliorate the pathological and behavioral alterations associated with AD is attenuated when the dosage of MSCs is increased.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction caused by excessive ER stress is a crucial mechanism underlying seizures-induced neuronal injury. Studies have shown that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely related to ER stress, and our previous study showed that activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5)-regulated mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) modulated mitochondrial ROS generation in a hippocampal neuronal culture model of seizures. However, the effects of ATF5-regulated mtUPR on ER stress and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain in epilepsy. In this study, ATF5 upregulation by lentivirus infection attenuated seizures-induced neuronal damage and apoptosis in a rat model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy, whereas ATF5 downregulation by lentivirus infection had the opposite effects. ATF5 upregulation potentiated mtUPR by increasing the expression of mitochondrial chaperone heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and caseinolytic protease proteolytic subunit (ClpP) and reducing mitochondrial ROS generation in pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats. Additionally, upregulation of ATF5 reduced the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), suggesting suppression of ER stress; Moreover, ATF5 upregulation attenuated apoptosis-related proteins such as B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) downregulation, BCL2-associated X (BAX) and cleaved-caspase-3 upregulation. However, ATF5 downregulation exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, pretreatment with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-TEMPO attenuated the harmful effects of ATF5 downregulation on ER stress and neuronal apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial ROS generation. Overall, our study suggested that ATF5-regulated mtUPR exerted neuroprotective effects against pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats and the underlying mechanisms might involve mitochondrial ROS-mediated ER stress.

AB  - Background: Despite ample evidence of the potential protective effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on the developing brain, no study has addressed the effects of postnatal EPO on behaviors and brain tissue of animal models of autism. In the present study, we examined the therapeutic effects of postnatal erythropoietin on stereotypic behaviors and astrocyte responses via glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) immunohistochemistry in a valproic acid (VPA) animal model of autism. Also, we compared the effects of EPO with EPO-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (NEPO) because the blood-brain barrier has limited perme-ability to EPO.Methods: Pregnant rats received a single dose of VPA (600 mg/kg) at gestational day 12.5. EPO (2000 U/kg) and EPO-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (NEPO1000 and 2000 U/kg) were injected intraperitoneally from postnatal days 1-5. Repetitive behaviors in male offspring were assessed by a marble burying test. The immune-staining method was performed to evaluate S100B and GFAP-positive cells in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal CA1 region.Results: VPA animal models revealed more repetitive behavior and displayed higher astrogliosis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (CA1) regions. The repetitive behaviors were ameliorated relatively in VPA groups with NEPO2000 treatment, and astrogliosis was reduced even when VPA rats were treated with a lower dosage of NEPO.Conclusion: Our results indicate beneficial effects of postnatal NEPO exposure in the VPA animal model of autism, which proposes it as an early treatment in infants with, or at risk of, autism.

AB  - Aromatherapy is one of the most common safer alternative treatments for psychiatric disorders with fewer side effects than conventional drugs. Here, we investigated the effects of cinnamon essential oil (CIEO) inhalation on mouse behaviors by performing different behavioral tests. CIEO inhalation showed anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus maze test, as inferred from increased time spent in open arms and decreased time spent in closed arms. Moreover, the CIEO treatment enhanced social behavior by increasing the total contact number, time spent in the center, distance traveled in the center, and total distance in the social interaction test. However, CIEO inhalation did not have any effect on performance in the open field test, tail suspension test, forced swimming test, and Y maze tests. The microarray analysis indicated that the CIEO treatment downregulated 17 genes and upregulated 15 genes in the hippocampus. Among them, Dcc, Egr2, and Fos are the most crucial genes that are involved in anxiety-related biological processes and pathways, including the regulation of neuronal death and neuroinflammation. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the main component of CIEO. Cinnamaldehyde recovered MK-801-induced anxiety-related changes in the electroencephalogram power spectrum in zebrafish. Taken together, our findings suggest that CIEO and its main component cinnamaldehyde have an anxiolytic effect through the regulation of the expression of genes related to neuroinflammatory response and neuronal death.

AB  - Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a noninfectious chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa characterized mainly by itching, sneezing, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. It is mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE). AR is one of the most common allergic diseases globally, affecting 10% to 20% of the population worldwide, with some regions even reaching rates as high as 50%, posing a global health issue. The prevalence of AR has been increasing since the 1960s, with a significant increase in recent years. At present, modern medicine-including desensitization therapy, the use of antiallergic drugs, antihistamines, hormones, and other treatments-can improve symptoms or regulate the immune system. However, both short- and long-term efficacy remain limited, as symptoms often recur after treatment cessation, and long-term drug use is associated with toxicity and side effects. Objective: Acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) therapy is widely used to treat AR in China. ACE therapy has been reported to be effective in managing the symptoms of AR, but the evidence faces methodological limitations. Therefore, we designed a parallel-arm, randomized controlled, multicentered, placebo-controlled, and single-blinded trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety Methods: This study will be a parallel-group, patient-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial conducted in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Ningxia Chinese Medicine Research Center, and the Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The trial consists of a 4-week treatment period, along with a 3-month follow-up. After providing written informed consent, eligible participants will be randomized at a ratio of 1: 1 into one of 2 groups: the ACE group receiving treatment and the sham ACE group. Both groups will receive conventional loratadine treatment. Results: The funding began in January 2022. The study was initiated on February 1, 2025, and will end in February 2026. Patient recruitment has already started, and the study results will be released in March 2026. Conclusions: We expect that this research will provide important insights into the efficacy of ACE treatment for AR and generate Trial Registration: Chinese Cl i ni cal Trial Registry Chi CTR 2 5 0 0 0 9 5 6 3 4 ; International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/63933

AB  - ECG (electrocardiogram) identifies and traces targets and is commonly employed in cardiac disease detection. It is necessary for monitoring precise target trajectories. Estimations of ECG are nonlinear as the parameters TDEs (time delays) and Doppler shifts are computed on receipt of echoes where EKFs (extended Kalman filters) and electrocardiogram have not been examined for computations. ECG, certain times, results in poor accuracies and low SNRs (signal-to-noise ratios), especially while encountering complicated environments. This work proposes to track online filter performances while using optimization techniques to enhance outcomes with the removal of noise in the signal. The use of cost functions can assist state corrections while lowering costs. A new parameter is optimized using IMCEHOs (Improved Mutation Chaotic Elephant Herding Optimizations) by linearly approximating system nonlinearity where multi-iterative function (Optimized Iterative UKFs) predicts a target's unknown parameters. To obtain optimal solutions theoretically, multi-iterative function takes less iteration, resulting in shorter execution times. The proposed multi-iterative function provides numerical approximations, which are derivative-free implementations. Signals are updated in the cloud environment; the updates are received by the patients from home. The simulation evaluation results with estimators show better performances in terms of reduced NMSEs (normalized mean square errors), RMSEs (root mean squared errors), SNRs, variances, and better accuracies than current approaches. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the stages of heart disease, which is updated to the patient in the cloud environment. The proposed work has a 91.0% accuracy rate with an error rate of 0.05% by reducing noise levels.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound with strong potential to decrease the psychostimulant's rewarding effect with unclear receptors. Furthermore, as a part of the reward circuit, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in regulating the reward properties of drugs as determined by conditioned place preference (CPP). In the current research, CPP was used to evaluate the role of intra-CA1 microinjection of D1-like dopamine receptor antagonists in CBD's inhibitory effect on the acquisition and expression phases of methamphetamine (METH). Animals were treated by METH (1 mg/kg; sc) in a five-day schedule to induce CPP. To find out the impact of D1-like dopamine receptor antagonist, SCH23390, in the CA1 on the inhibitory influence of CBD on the acquisition of METH, the rats received intra-CA1 administration of SCH23390 (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/0.5 mu l) following ICV treatment of CBD (10 mu g/5 mu l) over conditioning phase of METH. Furthermore, animals were given SCH23390 in the CA1 ensuing ICV microinjection of CBD (50 mu g/5 mu l) in the expression phase of METH to rule out the influence of SCH23390 on the suppressive effect of CBD on the expression of METH CPP. Intra-CA1 microinjection of SCH23390 abolished CBD's suppressive impact on both METH-induced CPP phases without any side effect on the locomotion. The current research disclosed that CBD inhibited the rewarding characteristic of METH via D1-like dopamine receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.

AB  - Gastric motility is coordinated by bioelectric slow waves (SWs) and dysrhythmic SW activity has been linked with motility disorders. Magnetogastrography (MGG) is the non-invasive measurement of the biomagnetic fields generated by SWs. Dysrhythmia identification using MGG is currently challenging because source models are not well developed and the impact of anatomical variation is not well understood. A novel method for the quantitative spatial co-registration of serosal SW potentials, MGG, and geometric models of anatomical structures was developed and performed on two anesthetized pigs to verify feasibility. Electrode arrays were localized using electromagnetic transmitting coils. Coil localization error for the volume where the stomach is normally located under the sensor array was assessed in a benchtop experiment, and mean error was 4.2 & PLUSMN; 2.3 mm and 3.6 & PLUSMN; 3.3 degrees for a coil orientation parallel to the sensor array and 6.2 & PLUSMN; 5.7 mm and 4.5 & PLUSMN; 7.0 degrees for a perpendicular coil orientation. Stomach geometries were reconstructed by fitting a generic stomach to up to 19 localization coils, and SW activation maps were mapped onto the reconstructed geometries using the registered positions of 128 electrodes. Normal proximal-to-distal and ectopic SW propagation patterns were recorded from the serosa and compared against the simultaneous MGG measurements. Correlations between the center-of-gravity of normalized MGG and the mean position of SW activity on the serosa were 0.36 and 0.85 for the ectopic and normal propagation patterns along the proximal-distal stomach axis, respectively. This study presents the first feasible method for the spatial co-registration of MGG, serosal SW measurements, and subject-specific anatomy. This is a significant advancement because these data enable the development and validation of novel non-invasive gastric source characterization methods.

AB  - De novo deleterious and heritable biallelic mutations in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the transcription factor deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (DEAF1) result in a phenotypic spectrum of disorders termed DEAF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (DAND). RNA-sequencing using hippocampal RNA from mice with conditional deletion of Deaf1 in the central nervous system indicate that loss of Deaf1 activity results in the altered expression of genes involved in neuronal function, dendritic spine maintenance, development, and activity, with reduced dendritic spines in hippocampal regions. Since DEAF1 is not a dosage-sensitive gene, we assessed the dominant negative activity of previously identified de novo variants and a heritable recessive DEAF1 variant on selected DEAF1-regulated genes in 2 different cell models. While no altered gene expression was observed in cells over-expressing the recessive heritable variant, the gene expression profiles of cells over-expressing de novo variants resulted in similar gene expression changes as observed in CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DEAF1-deleted cells. Altered expression of DEAF1-regulated genes was rescued by exogenous expression of WT-DEAF1 but not by de novo variants in cells lacking endogenous DEAF1. De novo heterozygous variants within the DBD of DEAF1 were identified in 10 individuals with a phenotypic spectrum including autism spectrum disorder, developmental delays, sleep disturbance, high pain tolerance, and mild dysmorphic features. Functional assays demonstrate these variants alter DEAF1 transcriptional activity. Taken together, this study expands the clinical phenotypic spectrum of individuals with DAND, furthers our understanding of potential roles of DEAF1 on neuronal function, and demonstrates dominant negative activity of identified de novo variants.

AB  - Citrus fruits contain several bioactive components. Among them, one of the major components is 3,5,6,7,8,3 ',4 '-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), which has previously shown protective effects in the brain in some disease models; moreover, HMF has been shown to penetrate the brain. In recent years, inflammation has been identified as a defense response in the body; however, a chronic inflammatory response may trigger several diseases. Inflammation in the peripheral tissues spreads to the brain and is suggested to be closely associated with diseases of the central nervous system. HMF has shown anti-inflammatory effects in the hippocampus following global cerebral ischemia; however, its effects on acute and chronic inflammation in the brain remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of HMF in a mouse model of systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. In this study, HMF suppressed LPS-induced microglial activation in the brains of acute inflammation model mice two days after LPS administration. In addition, 24 days after the administration of LPS in a chronic inflammation model, HMF promoted BDNF production and neurogenesis in the brain, which also tended to suppress tau protein phosphorylation at Ser396. These results suggest that HMF has anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects in the brains of model mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation.

AB  - Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is associated with high extracellular levels of glutamate. Studies support the idea that cannabidiol (CBD) decreases glutamate over-release. This study focused on investigating whether CBD reduces the evoked glutamate release in cortical synaptic terminals obtained from patients with DRE as well as in a preclinical model of epilepsy. Synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) were obtained from the epileptic neocortex of patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (DR-TLE, n = 10) or drug-resistant extratemporal lobe epilepsy (DR-ETLE, n = 10) submitted to epilepsy surgery. Synaptosomes highly purified by Percoll-sucrose density gradient were characterized by confocal microscopy and Western blot. Synaptosomes were used to estimate the high KCl (33 mM)-evoked glutamate release in the presence of CBD at different concentrations. Our results revealed responsive tissue obtained from seven patients with DR-TLE and seven patients with DR-ETLE. Responsive tissue showed lower glutamate release (p < 0.05) when incubated with CBD at low concentrations (less than 100 mu M) but not at higher concentrations. Tissue that was non-responsive to CBD (DR-TLE, n = 3 and DR-ELTE, n = 3) showed high glutamate release despite CBD exposure at different concentrations. Simultaneously, a block of the human epileptic neocortex was used to determine its viability through whole-cell and extracellular electrophysiological recordings. The electrophysiological evaluations supported that the responsive and non-responsive human epileptic neocortices used in the present study exhibited proper neuronal viability and stability to acquire electrophysiological responses. We also investigated whether the subchronic administration of CBD could reduce glutamate over-release in a preclinical model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Administration of CBD (200 mg/kg, p.o. every 24 h for 7 days) to rats with lithium-pilocarpine-evoked spontaneous recurrent seizures reduced glutamate over-release in the hippocampus. The present study revealed that acute exposure to low concentrations of CBD can reduce the glutamate over-release in synaptic terminals obtained from some patients with DRE. This effect is also evident when applied subchronically in rats with spontaneous recurrent seizures. An important finding was the identification of a group of patients that were non-responsive to CBD effects. Future studies are essential to identify biomarkers of responsiveness to CBD to control DRE.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder accompanied by deficits in cognitive and social skills. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a lifelong phenomenon, with new neurons being formed in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Impaired neurogenesis is associated with multiple behavioral disorders including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. PTSD patients often present hippocampal atrophy and animal models clearly present impaired neurogenesis. Previous studies on PTSD patients demonstrated elevated levels of Th17 cells and plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Since IL-17A can impair neurogenesis in mice, we thus hypothesized that decreasing the serum levels of IL-17A will increase hippocampal neurogenesis and alleviate symptoms in a murine model of PTSD. Surprisingly, our results showed that attempting to neutralize IL-17A with an antibody resulted in increased serum levels of IL-17A, while targeting IL-23, the upstream regulator of IL-17, did lower the levels of IL-17A in trauma-exposed mice. As expected, increased levels of serum IL-17A (in anti-IL-17A treated mice) resulted in impaired neurogenesis, reflected by reduced number of proliferating Ki67(+) neural progenitors and newly formed DCX+ neurons, which was correlated with increased expression of Hes1. Nevertheless, increased maturation was noted by the expression of Slit2 and Ache. In contrast, treatment with anti-IL-23 indeed resulted in increased neurogenesis. Behaviorally, both treatments did not affect trauma-related freezing behavior but did affect trauma-related social deficits. Unexpectedly, increased levels of serum IL-17A (in anti-IL-17A treated mice) prevented social deficits in trauma-exposed mice while anti-IL-23 exacerbated these deficits. We thus conclude that IL-17 is involved in regulating neurogenesis following exposure to stress but may be important in maintaining social behavior.

AB  - Antipsychotics are drugs commonly prescribed to treat a variety of psychiatric conditions. They are classified as typical and atypical, depending on their affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. Although neurons have been assumed to be the major mediators of the antipsychotic pharmacological effects, glia, particularly astrocytes, have emerged as important cellular targets for these drugs. In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute treatments with the antipsychotics risperidone and haloperidol of hippocampal slices and astrocyte cultures, focusing on neuron-glia communication and how antipsychotics act in astrocytes. For this, we obtained hippocampal slices and primary astrocyte cultures from 30-day-old Wistar rats and incubated them with risperidone or haloperidol (1 and 10 mu M) for 30 min and 24 h, respectively. We evaluated metabolic and enzymatic activities, the glutathione level, the release of inflammatory and trophic factors, as well as the gene expression of signaling proteins. Haloperidol increased glucose metabolism; however, neither of the tested antipsychotics altered the glutathione content or glutamine synthetase and Na+K+-ATPase activities. Haloperidol induced a pro-inflammatory response and risperidone promoted an anti-inflammatory response, while both antipsychotics seemed to decrease trophic support. Haloperidol and risperidone increased Nrf2 and HO-1 gene expression, but only haloperidol upregulated NF kappa B and AMPK gene expression. Finally, astrocyte cultures confirmed the predominant effect of the tested antipsychotics on glia and their opposite effects on astrocytes. Therefore, antipsychotics cause functional alterations in the hippocampus. This information is important to drive future research for strategies to attenuate antipsychotics-induced neural dysfunction, focusing on glia.

AB  - Identifying circulating metabolites associated with dementia, cognition, and brain volume may improve the understanding of dementia pathogenesis and provide novel insights for preventive and therapeutic interventions. This cohort study included a total of 87 885 participants (median follow-up of 9.1 years, 54% female) without dementia at baseline from the UK Biobank. A total of 249 plasma metabolites were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline. Cox proportional regression was used to examine the associations of each metabolite with incident dementia (cases = 1134), Alzheimer's disease (AD; cases = 488), and vascular dementia (VD; cases = 257) during follow-up. Dementia-associated metabolites were further analyzed for association with cognitive deficits (N = 87 885) and brain volume (N = 7756) using logistic regression and linear regression. We identified 26 metabolites associated with incident dementia, of which 6 were associated with incident AD and 5 were associated with incident VD. These 26 dementia-related metabolites were subfractions of intermediate-density lipoprotein, large low-density lipoprotein (L-LDL), small high-density lipoprotein (S-HDL), very-low-density lipoprotein, fatty acids, ketone bodies, citrate, glucose, and valine. Among them, the cholesterol percentage in L-LDL (L-LDL-C%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.87-0.97], p = 0.002), higher brain cortical (beta = 0.047, p = 3.91 x 10(-6)), and hippocampal (beta = 0.043, p = 1.93 x 10(-4)) volume. Cholesteryl ester-to-total lipid ratio in L-LDL (L-LDL-CE%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI] = 0.93 [0.90-0.96], p = 1.48 x 10(-4)), cognitive deficits (odds ratio = 0.98, p = 0.009), and higher hippocampal volume (beta = 0.027, p = 0.009). Cholesteryl esters in S-HDL (S-HDL-CE) were associated with lower risk of VD (HR [95% CI] = 0.81 [0.71-0.93], p = 0.002), but not AD. Taken together, circulating levels of L-LDL-CE% and L-LDL-C% were robustly associated with risk of AD and AD phenotypes, but not with VD. S-HDL-CE was associated with lower risk of VD, but not with AD or AD phenotypes. These metabolites may play a role in the advancement of future intervention trials. Additional research is necessary to gain a complete comprehension of the molecular mechanisms behind these associations.image

AB  - Due to the extensive genetic and antigenic variation in Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), as well as its rapid mutability and evolution, PRRS prevention and control can be challenging. An expeditious and sensitive neutralization assay for PRRSV is presented to monitor neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in serum during vaccine research. Here, a PRRSV expressing eGFP was successfully rescued with reverse genetics based on the infectious clone HuN4-F112-eGFP which we constructed. The fluorescent protein expressions of the reporter viruses remained stable for at least five passages. Based on this reporter virus, the neutralization assay can be easily used to evaluate the level of NAbs by counting cells with green fluorescence. Compared with the classical CPE assay, the newly developed assay increases sensitivity by one- to four-fold at the early antibody response stage, thus saving 2 days of assay waiting time. By using this assay to unveil the dynamics of neutralizing antibodies against PRRSV, priming immunity through either a single virulent challenge or only vaccination could produce limited NAbs, but re-infection with PRRSV would induce a faster and stronger NAb response. Overall, the novel HuN4-F112-eGFP-based neutralization assay holds the potential to provide a highly efficient platform for evaluating the next generation of PRRS vaccines.

AB  - This study outlines two novel protocols for examining context specific recall in animals prior to embarking on neurobiological studies. The approach is distinct from and contrasts with studies investigating associative fa-miliarity that depend upon procedural variations of the widely used novel object recognition task. It uses an event arena in which animals are trained across numerous sessions to search for, find and dig up reward from sandwells during sample and choice trials - a prominent spatial event for a rodent. The arena could be laid out as either of two highly distinct contexts with which the animals became fully familiar throughout training. In one protocol, the location of the correct sandwell in each context remained stable across days, whereas in the other, the correct digging location varied in a counterbalanced manner across each successive session. Thus, context -specific recall of the spatial location of successful digging during choice trials was either from a stable long-term memory or could reflect context specific spatial recency of the location where reward had been available that session. Both protocols revealed effective memory recall in choice and probe tests which, at the point of test, were procedurally identical in both cases.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe life-long neuropsychiatric disorder. Alterations and imbalance of several neurochemical systems may be involved in ASD pathophysiology, of them, serotonergic neurotransmission dysfunction and deficiency may underlie behavioral abnormalities associated with ASD. However, the functional importance of serotonergic receptors, particularly 5HT7 receptors in ASD pathology remains poorly defined. Serotonin receptor subtype 7 (5-HT7R) plays a direct regulatory role in the development and also for the mature function of the brain, therefore, further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of these receptors in the etiology of autism. To address this issue, we combined here behavioral, electrophysiological methods to further characterize the contribution of 5-HT7Rs in the prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure-induced impairment in synaptic plasticity and their impact on the associated behavioral changes. This may help to unravel the underlying cellular mechanisms involved in ASD and can lead to new treatment and/or prevention therapies based on the role of the serotonergic system for autism. Findings revealed that compared to control, autistic-like offspring showed increased anxiety-like behavior, reduced social interaction, decreased locomotor activity, and impaired identification of the novel object. However, administration of 5-HT7Rs agonist, LP-211, for 7 consecutive days before testing from postnatal day 21 to 27 reversed all behavioral deficits induced by prenatal exposure to VPA in offspring. Also, both short-term depression and long-term potentiation were impaired in the autistic-like pups, but activation of 5-HT7Rs rescued the LTP impairment in the autistic-like group so that there was no significant difference between the two groups. Blockade of 5-HT7Rs caused LTP impairment following HFS in the autistic-like group. Besides, there was a significant difference in LTD induction following SB-269970 application between the control and the autistic-like groups measured at first 10 min following TPS. Moreover, both the number and the size of retrograde fast blue-labelled neurons in the raphe nuclei were reduced. Overall, these results provide for the first time, as far as we know, functional evidence for the restorative role of 5-HT7Rs activation against prenatal VPA exposure induced behavioral deficits and hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairment. Therefore, these receptors could be a potential and promising pharmacotherapy target for the treatment of autism.

AB  - Fourteen azaphilone-type polyketides (1-14), including nine new ones (1-6 and 8-10), were isolated from cultures of Vitex rotundifolia-associated Penicillium sp. JVF17, and their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis together with computational methods and chemical reactions. Neuroprotective effects of the isolated compounds were evaluated against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment with compounds 3, 6, 7, and 11-14 increased cell viabilities of hippocampal neuronal cells damaged by glutamate, with compound 12 being the most potent. Compound 12 markedly decreased intracellular Ca2+ and nuclear condensation levels. Mechanistically, molecular markers of apoptosis induced by treatment with glutamate, i.e., phosphorylation of MAPKs and elevated Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio, were significantly lowered by compound 12. The azaphilones with an isoquinoline core structure were more active than those with pyranoquinones, but N-substitution decreased the activity. This study, including the structure-activity relationship, indicates that the azaphilone scaffold is a promising lead toward the development of novel neuroprotective agents.

AB  - Background: Depression is a prevalent emotion disorder which is thought to be due to neuronal structural alterations and/or functional impairment within specific brain regions. Several studies have shown that microRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. As a Chinese herbal formula, Xiaoyaosan (XYS) could have antidepressive effects, although the mechanisms associated with microRNAs are poorly understood.Purpose: In this study, we investigated whether inhibition of the miR-200a/b-3p/NR3C1 pathway in the prefrontal cortex is involved in the anti-neuronal apoptosis and anti-stress effects of XYS and then further delineated the underlying mechanism.Methods: To evaluate the efficacy of XYS in relieving stress behaviors and altering the expression of miRNAs involved in the regulation of these behaviors in vivo, a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rodent model and RNA-seq were performed. Primary cortical neurons were used to evaluate the molecular function of miR200a/b-3p and detect the in vitro neuroprotective function of paeoniflorin, which is one of the main components of XYS. To investigate the function of miR-200a/b-3p in stress behaviors, stereotactic microinjection of AAV2/9-Syn-miR-200a/b-3p was performed to deliver the treatment to the rat mPFC.Results: XYS reduced the anxiety and depression-like behaviors associated with chronic stress and reduced the expression of miR-200a/b-3p and neuronal apoptosis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The overexpression of miR200a/b-3p in primary cortical neurons reduced the expression of the target gene NR3C1, increased the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and decreased the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. One of the active ingredients of XYS, paeoniflorin, can inhibit miR-200a/b-3p-mediated apoptosis of primary neurons and abnormal expression of apoptosis-related proteins. After overexpressing miR-200a/b-3p in vivo (vmPFC), the rats eventually showed significant anxiety-like behaviors similar to those caused by chronic stress.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that XYS can inhibit the CUMS-induced expression of miR-200a/b-3p, regulate miR-200a/b-3p/NR3C1 signaling in the PFC caused by chronic stress, and reduce neuronal apoptosis and stress related behaviors.

AB  - Pyrethroid pesticides can induce neurotoxicity in target and non-target organisms. We examined the effects of sub-chronic exposure to cypermethrin on anxiety-like behaviors, memory function and molecular changes in the hippocampus of rats. Twenty-four male Wistar rats (weighing 200-250 g) were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8) and received orally corn oil, cypermethrin 2 and cypermethrin 4 mg/kg/day, for 30 days. The elevated plus maze (EPM), open field maze (OFM) and novel object recognition memory (NORM) tests were conducted. At the end, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress markers and inflammatory mediators were evaluated in the hippocampus. The results of OFM and EPM indicated higher level of anxiety and motor activity alterations in the cypermethrin treated rats. NORM test revealed impairment of cognitive memory and decreased discrimination ratio in cypermethrin treated rats. Cypermethrin decreased BDNF and increased GSK-3 beta, oxidative stress and mRNA expression of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B in the hippocampus. The activity of cholinesterase enzyme was not changed. Cypermethrin can impair learning and memory along with provoking oxidative stress and inflammation, and dysregulation of BDNF and GSK-3 beta pathway may be involved in neurocognitive and neurobehavioral disorders due to long-time exposures.

AB  - Background: Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are key features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), offering potential targets for localized therapeutic intervention. Delivering neurotrophic factors specifically to inflamed brain regions could improve treatment efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure. Methods: We developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive hydrogel incorporating oxidation-labile linkers to enable the on-demand release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The hydrogel's porous structure was characterized via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and drug release behavior was evaluated under oxidative and physiological conditions. Cytoprotective efficacy was tested in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. Results: The hydrogel exhibited high porosity and released BDNF rapidly in oxidative environments, with minimal release under normal conditions. It reduced intracellular ROS in stressed PC12 cells. Conclusion: This ROS-responsive hydrogel serves as a biocompatible and intelligent drug delivery system with potential for targeted oxidative stress modulation and neurotrophic support in the treatment of AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tea (Camellia sinensis) has been consumed for centuries as a traditional remedy for various metabolic diseases. The pharmacological mechanisms of many conventional medicines, including tea, often need to be clarified. Chin brick tea is a unique Chinese black tea grown in Hubei, China, rich in tea elements such as tea polyphenols and tea polysaccharides.Aim of the study: We focus on the effects of commercial chin brick tea on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by altering intestinal flora and its metabolite, bile acids.Materials and methods: Targeted UPLC-MS/MS was employed to quantify the tea elements in commercial chin brick tea. In this study, we performed an integrated approach of animal experiments, 16 S rDNA, and ultra -performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to explore the potential mechanism of action of chin brick tea in preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Results: After 14 weeks of administration, CBT extract could signiffcantly decrease the levels of body weight, liver weight, LDL-C, TC, ALT, IL-1 & beta; and IL-18, and slight increase HDL-C levels in NAFLD mice. The results indicated that the interventional impact of CBT with high-fat diet-induced NAFLD might depend on intestinal flora and its metabolites bile acids. Moreover, sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes demonstrated that CBT could signiffcantly improve the intestinal flora disorder of NAFLD mice. Speciffcally, CBT increased the levels of Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella, and Ruminococcaceae, while reducing the levels of Bacteroides in NAFLD mice. Then, a total of 23 bile acids were identified, 17 differential bile acids were obtained by screening, and CBT increase the primary bile acids/secondary bile acids ratio in NAFLD mice. Additionally, correlation analysis revealed that Bacteroides was negatively correlated with DCA and & omega;MCA, Lactobacillus was positively correlated with DCA and & omega;MCA, Bacteroides was positively correlated with NAFLD, Lactobacillus was negatively associated with NAFLD, and DCA and & omega;MCA were negatively correlated with NAFLDConclusion: CBT extract has a good interventional impact on NAFLD mice. The mechanism by which this extract exerts its action is, at least partly, related to its regulation of intestinal flora and its metabolites bile acids.

AB  - Tissue engineering aims to repair, restore, and/or replace tissues in the human body as an alternative to grafts and prostheses. Biomaterial scaffolds can be utilized to provide a three-dimensional microenvironment to facilitate tissue regeneration. Previously, we reported that scaffold pore size influences vascularization and extracellular matrix composition both in vivo and in vitro, to ultimately influence tissue phenotype for regenerating cranial suture and bone tissues, which have markedly different tissue properties despite similar multipotent stem cell populations. To rationally design biomaterials for specific cell and tissue fate specification, it is critical to understand the molecular processes governed by cell-biomaterial interactions, which guide cell fate specification. Building on our previous work, in this report we investigated the hypothesis that scaffold pore curvature, the direct consequence of pore size, modulates the differentiation trajectory of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through alterations in the cytoskeleton. First, we demonstrated that sufficiently small pores facilitate cell clustering in subcutaneous explants cultured in vivo, which we previously reported to demonstrate stem tissue phenotype both in vivo and in vitro. Based on this observation, we cultured cell-scaffold constructs in vitro to assess early time point interactions between cells and the matrix as a function of pore size. We demonstrate that principle curvature directly influences nuclear aspect and cell aggregation in vitro. Scaffold pores with a sufficiently low degree of principle curvature enables cell differentiation; pharmacologic inhibition of actin cytoskeleton polymerization in these scaffolds decreased differentiation, indicating a critical role of the cytoskeleton in transducing cues from the scaffold pore microenvironment to the cell nucleus. We fabricated a macropore model, which allows for three-dimensional confocal imaging and demonstrates that a higher principle curvature facilitates cell aggregation and the formation of a potentially protective niche within scaffold macropores which prevents MSC differentiation and retains their stemness. Sufficiently high principle curvature upregulates yes-associated protein (YAP) phosphorylation while decreased principle curvature downregulates YAP phosphorylation and increases YAP nuclear translocation with subsequent transcriptional activation towards an osteogenic differentiation fate. Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibition of the YAP/TAZ pathway causes a defect in differentiation, while YAP/TAZ activation causes premature differentiation in a curvature-dependent way when modulated by verteporfin (VP) and 1-oleyl-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), respectively, confirming the critical role of biomaterials-mediated YAP/TAZ signaling in cell differentiation and fate specification. Our data support that the principle curvature of scaffold macropores is a critical design criterion which guides the differentiation trajectory of mesenchymal stem cells' scaffolds. Biomaterial-mediated regulation of YAP/TAZ may significantly contribute to influencing the regenerative outcomes of biomaterials-based tissue engineering strategies through their specific pore design.

AB  - Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) infection is responsible for Gl & auml;sser's disease in pigs. G. parasuis could trigger piglet immunosuppression, but the mechanism of inducing immunosuppression by G. parasuis remains unknown. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)/CD74 axis has been shown to participate in inflammation response and immunosuppression, but the function of MIF/CD74 during immunosuppression elicited by G. parasuis has not been fully explored. This experiment explored the efficacy of baicalin on immunosuppression elicited by G. parasuis alleviation through regulating polarization via the MIF/CD74 signaling pathway. Our data indicated that baicalin reduced IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, TNF-alpha, and COX-2 expression, and regulated MIF/CD74 axis expression in the spleen. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that baicalin enhanced CD74 protein levels in the spleen of piglets induced by G. parasuis. Baicalin regulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling activation, modified the expression of the autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1, P62, and LC3B, promoted M2 polarization to M1 polarization, and enhanced CD3, CD4, CD8, and TIM3 levels in the spleen of piglets elicited by G. parasuis. Our study reveals the important functions of the MIF/CD74 axis in G. parasuis-induced immunosuppression and may offer a new therapeutic method to control G. parasuis infection.

AB  - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare benign tumor that affects predominantly males and is known by its highly vascular character. We have performed a 3-year retrospective study of patients with JNA surgically treated within the third ENT Department of Prof. Dr. Dorin Hociota Institute of Phonoaudiology and Functional ENT Surgery, Bucharest, Romania. In all the cases, the patients were investigated both clinically and through medical imaging before surgery and all tumors were embolized. Our study comprised of eight cases, of which seven were solved by endoscopic endonasal approach and one case was treated through a combined endonasal-external approach. JNA should always be managed through a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach in centers with adequate experience, to gain favorable results.

AB  - Although elements such as emotion may serve to enhance or impair memory for images, some images are consistently remembered or forgotten by most people, an intrinsic characteristic of images known as memorability. Memorability explains some of the variability in memory performance, however, the underlying mechanisms of memorability remain unclear. It is known that emotional valence can increase the memorability of an experience, but how these two elements interact is still unknown. Hippocampal pattern separation, a computation that orthogonalizes overlapping experiences as distinct from one another, may be a candidate mechanism underlying memorability. However, these two literatures have remained largely separate. To explore the interaction between image memorability and emotion on pattern separation, we examined performance on an emotional mnemonic discrimination task, a putative behavioral correlate of hippocampal pattern separation, by splitting stimuli into memorable and forgettable categories as determined by a convolutional neural network as well as by emotion, lure similarity, and time of testing (immediately and 24-hour delay). We measured target recognition, which is typically used to determine memorability scores, as well as lure discrimination, which taxes hippocampal pattern separation and has not yet been examined within a memorability framework. Here, we show that more memorable images were better remembered across both target recognition and lure discrimination measures. However, for target recognition, this was only true upon immediate testing, not after a 24-hour delay. For lure discrimination, we found that memorability interacts with lure similarity, but depends on the time of testing, where memorability primarily impacts high similarity lure discrimination when tested immediately but impacts low similarity lure discrimination after a 24-hour delay. Furthermore, only lure discrimination showed an interaction between emotion and memorability, in which forgettable neutral images showed better lure discrimination compared to more memorable images. These results suggest that careful consideration is required of what makes an image memorable and may depend on what aspects of the image are more memorable (e.g., gist vs. detail, emotional vs. neutral).

AB  - In the rich vertebrate fauna of Imanay Cave the abundant material of the small-sized cave bears was originally assigned to the taxon Ursus savini. Teeth and metapodials of statistical amounts were compared with other cave bear faunas and the taxonomic position was determined through morphological and metric analyses. The size of teeth and metapodial bones is significantly smaller in Imanay Cave bears compared to the typical U. deningeri from Mosbach and Hundsheim. Although the teeth are smaller, they reached higher evolutionary level than those from Mosbach or Hundsheim.The bear remains from Imanay Cave show great similarities to the fossils from Kizel Cave in the Ural Mountains described as Ursus rossicus Borissiak, 1930 but also to the remains of small-bodied cave bears of the Alps described as Ursus deningeroides Mottl, 1964. Remarkable are the differences in size of the front dentition: the incisors from Imanay Cave are on average >10% longer and wider than the corresponding teeth from U. deningeroides but also wider than the classic U. deningeri. Preliminary carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses suggest that the small cave bears from Imanay Cave were herbivorous.

AB  - Natural small-molecule drugs have promising potential to promote tissue regeneration in various fields. Therefore, maximizing drug efficiency while minimizing potential side effects is imperative. Peiminine, a natural product extracted from natural Fritillaria, is one of small-molecule drugs in the field of bone regeneration due to its good bone-promoting and anti-inflammatory abilities. However, its application is limited by a lack of biological activity, poor biocompatibility at high concentrations, and difficulty in achieving long-term slow-release and therapeutic effects. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by preconditioned cells are considered to have special biological functions, and their potential to further retain, buffer, and transmit drug effects and expand the therapeutic effect has been widely studied. Thus, our study provides a drug-free bioengineering strategy by preconditioning bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) with Peiminine, then EVs, secreted as Peim-EVs, were extracted and combined with a decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM). The final EVs-dECM system with a spatiotemporally controlled release system was formed. In vitro studies demonstrated that Peim-EVs solved the problem of Peiminine biocompatibility and exhibited osteogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, which may be related to PI3K/AKT, MAPK/NF-kappa B, and Hippo signaling pathways. An in vivo model of rotator cuff injury in rats also showed that EVs-dECM had a good effect on rotator cuff repair. Combined with engineering strategy, this study provides verification and scenario expansion for drug application, especially for drug-free strategies that retain the biological effects of drugs, and has broad significance.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which camel whey protein (CWP) inhibits the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in heat stress (HS)-stimulated rat liver. Administration of CWP by gavage prior to HS inhibited the cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 and consequently reduced the inflammatory response in the rat liver, and downregulated the levels of the NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The use of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, indicated that this downregulation effect may be attributed to the antioxidant activity of CWP. We observed that CWP enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf)2 and heme-oxygenase (HO)-1 expression, which inhibited ROS production, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increased superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content in the HS-treated liver, ultimately increasing the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the liver. Administration of Nrf2 or HO-1 inhibitors before HS abolished the protective effects of CWP against oxidative damage in the liver of HS-treated rats, accompanied by increased levels of HMGB1 in the cytoplasm and IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the serum. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CWP enhanced the TAC of the rat liver after HS by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, which in turn reduced HMGB1 release from hepatocytes and the subsequent inflammatory response and damage. Furthermore, the combination of CWP and NAC abolished the adverse effects of HS in the rat liver. Therefore, dietary CWP could be an effective adjuvant treatment for HS-induced liver damage.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is a common cause of cognitive decline and dementia of vascular origin, but the precise pathological mechanisms are unknown, and so effective clinical treatments have not been established. Tilianin, the principal active compound of total flavonoid extract from Dracocephalum moldavica L., is a candidate therapy for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in China. However, its potential in the treatment of VaD is unclear. The present study is aimed at investigating the protective effects of tilianin on VaD and exploring the underlying mechanism of the action. A model of VaD was established by permanent 2-vessel occlusion (2VO) in rats. Human neurons (hNCs) differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells were used to establish an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model. The therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of tilianin were identified using behavioral tests, histochemistry, and multiple molecular biology techniques such as Western blot analysis and gene silencing. The results demonstrated that tilianin modified spatial cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, oxidation, and apoptosis in rats with VaD and protected hNCs against OGD by increasing cell viability and decreasing apoptosis rates. A study of the mechanism indicated that tilianin restored p-CaMKII/ERK1/2/CREB signaling in the hippocampus, maintaining hippocampus-independent memory. In addition, tilianin inhibited an ox-CaMKII/p38 MAPK/JNK/NF-kappa B associated inflammatory response caused by cerebral oxidative stress imbalance in rats with VaD. Furthermore, specific CaMKII alpha siRNA action revealed that tilianin-exerted neuroprotection involved increase of neuronal viability, inhibition of apoptosis, and suppression of inflammation, which was dependent on CaMKII alpha. In conclusion, the results suggested the neuroprotective effect of tilianin in VaD and the potential mechanism associated with dysfunction in the regulation of p-CaMKII-mediated long-term memory and oxidation and inflammation involved with ox-CaMKII, which may lay the foundation for clinical trials of tilianin for the treatment of VaD in the future.

AB  - Present study aimed to assess the thermal status of lactating dromedary camels (n = 28) from four breeds under aggravating hot-humid conditions. Infrared thermography (IRT) was employed to measure surface temperatures of various regions of interest (ROI). Environmental parameters were recorded, and temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated, ranging from 78.1 to 94.8. Additionally, thermal indices and milk production were recorded in evening and early morning. The results revealed that Bikaneri camels exhibited significantly lower surface temperatures (p < 0.05) across ROIs compared to other breeds, while Jaisalmeri and Kachchhi camels had significantly higher surface temperatures (p < 0.05). All breeds demonstrated a significant ability to dissipate excess heat through overnight equilibration (p < 0.01). However, heat dissipation gradient (HDG) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in Bikaneri camels. Furthermore, significant difference in milk yield between evening and morning milking was observed, with Kachchhi, Jaisalmeri, Mewari and Bikaneri camels showing increases of 44.68%, 39.34%, 37.76% and 44.95%, respectively.

AB  - Arsenic exerts neurotoxicity and immunomodulatory effects. Studies have shown that the nervous system is not considered to be an immune-privileged site. However, the effect of arsenic-induced neuroimmune toxicity has rarely been reported. We aimed to investigate the toxic effects of arsenic on the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg balance in the brain tissue of mice. Mice were exposed to NaAsO2 (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) for 24 h. Our results showed that 10 mg/kg arsenic exposure significantly decreased brain and hippocampal indices (p < 0.05). The mRNA and protein levels of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junction protein occludin were decreased in the 5 and 10 mg/kg arsenic-treated groups. Compared with those in the control group, NLRP3 protein levels in 10 mg/kg arsenic-treated mice, caspase-1 protein levels in 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg arsenic-treated mice, and IL-1 beta protein levels in 5 and 10 mg/kg arsenic-treated mice were increased in the hippocampus (p < 0.05). In addition, arsenic induced a hippocampal inflammatory response by upregulating the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-alpha and downregulating the mRNA level of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. Moreover, arsenic decreased the mRNA levels of the Th1 and Th2 transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 and the cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-4 and increased the mRNA levels of the Th17 transcription factor ROR gamma t and the cytokine IL-22 (p < 0.05). Collectively, our study demonstrated that arsenic could induce immune-inflammatory responses by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and CD4(+) T lymphocyte differentiation. These results provide a novel strategy to block the arsenic-induced impairment of neuroimmune responses.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Recent studies claim that Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) overlap in several common pathological pathways which from neuronal damage to impaired memory performance. It is known that the use of Rosa canina L. (R. canina) as medicine in folk medicine dates back to ancient times and is used in the treatment of nervous diseases in Persian medicine. However, the effect of R. canina on diabetes-related cognitive decline and memory impairment has not yet been studied.
   Aim of the study: We evaluated the impact of T2DM on AD-like alterations and examined the molecular mechanism of a possible effect of R. canina on cognitive alterations in diabetic rats.
   Materials&methods: R. canina ethanol extract was obtained by maceration method. This study was performed with male Sprague-Dawley rats fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, low-dose streptozotocin (STZ; 35 mg/kg IP) injection for 4 weeks, and R. canina (250 mg/kg; per oral) and metformin (400 mg/kg; per oral) administration for 4 weeks. The weight and blood glucose of rats were measured weekly. To evaluate glucose tolerance area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by performing an oral glucose tolerance test. Then the rats were subjected to behavioural tests, and their hippocampus and cortex tissues were obtained for biochemical and morphological analyses.
   Results: R. canina could manage glucose responsiveness by reducing post-prandial blood glucose levels, preventing weight loss, and raising serum insulin levels in T2DM-induced rats. Behavioural tests showed that R. canina significantly improves diabetes-related cognitive decline in recall and long-term memory. Treatment with R. canina significantly reversed HFD/STZ-induced increases in insulin, amyloid-beta, amyloid precursor protein levels, and acetylcholinesterase activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, histological analyzes revealed the protection of R. canina against neuronal disruption in the cortical and hippocampal CA3 region caused by chronic hyperglycemia.
   Conclusion: Analyzed collectively, these results suggest that R. canina can correct T2DM-related cognitive decline may be attributed to insulin pathway modulation, prevention of amyloid deposition, and increased cholinergic transmission.

AB  - Individuals with depression exhibit dysfunctional emotion regulation, general episodic memory deficits, and a negativity bias, where negative experiences are better remembered. Recent work suggests that the negativity bias in depression may be driven by enhanced mnemonic discrimination, a memory measure that relies on hippocampal pattern separation - a computation that processes experiences with overlapping features as unique. Previously, we found that individuals with depressive symptoms show enhanced negative and impaired neutral mnemonic discrimination. The current study aimed to investigate emotion regulation as an approach toward modifying memory encoding of negative and neutral events in individuals with depressive symptoms. Here we show that applying psychological distancing (a cognitive reappraisal strategy characterized by taking a thirdperson perspective toward negative events) during encoding was associated with reduced negative and enhanced neutral mnemonic discrimination during retrieval in individuals with depressive symptoms. These results suggest that applying emotion regulation techniques during encoding may provide an effective approach toward altering dysfunctional memory in those with depressive symptoms. Given that pharmacological treatments often fail to treat depression, emotion regulation provides a powerful and practical approach toward modifying cognitive and emotional processes. Future neuroimaging studies will be important to determine how emotion regulation impacts the neural mechanisms underlying these findings.

AB  - Background: Although solid evidence has indicated that respiratory symptoms are common amongst patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), state-of-the-art cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs do not typically include management strategies to address respiratory symptoms. This study investigated the effect of the addition of breathing exercises (BE) to the CR programs in CHF. Methods: In a two parallel-arm randomized controlled study (RCT), 40 middle-aged patients with CHF and respiratory symptoms were recruited and randomized into two equal groups (n = 20); group (A): standard CR with BE and group (B): standard CR alone. Primary outcomes were respiratory parameters and secondary outcomes included cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary outcomes. All the participants attended a program of aerobic exercise (three sessions/week, 60-75% MHR, 45-55 min) for 12 weeks, plus educational, nutritional, and psychological counseling. Group (A) patients attended the same program together with BE using inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and breathing calisthenics (BC) (six sessions/week, 15-25 min) for the same duration. Results: There was a significant improvement in the respiratory outcomes, and most of the cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary outcomes in both groups with a greater change percentage in group A (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results indicate that the addition of BE to the CR programs in CHF is effective and is a "patient-centered" approach.

AB  - Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone derived from the plant Artemisia annua L., renowned for its antimalarial activity. Based on this compound, various derivatives and analogues have been obtained that exhibit diverse biological activities, including clinically approved drugs. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted the neuroprotective potential of artemisinin. In this study, we evaluated the effects of artemisinin on the viability of neuronal-like cells, including primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. Artemisinin exhibited a stimulating effect on SH-SY5Y and HEK-293 cells and enhanced the survival of primary neurons at low concentrations (1 mu M). In contrast, artemisinin derivatives, such as dihydroartemisinin, anhydrodihydroartemisinin, and artemisitene, did not display similar stimulatory activity, suggesting that the intact lactone ring is crucial for this property. Furthermore, artemisinin demonstrated a protective effect against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in SH-SY5Y cells. However, it did not exhibit protective activity against oxidative stress induced by sodium arsenite. Additionally, artemisinin effectively inhibited the aggregation of mutated TDP-43 protein in transfected SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest that artemisinin exerts neuroprotective effects by targeting key molecular pathways associated with neurodegeneration, offering potential therapeutic insights for related conditions.

AB  - Objectives: The goal of the present study was to identify the role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the detection and later processing of novelty. Methods: Twenty-one epilepsy patients with unilateral MTL resection (10 left-sided; 11 right-sided) and 26 matched healthy controls performed an adapted visual novelty oddball task. In this task two streams of stimuli were presented on the left and right of fixation while the patients' electroencephalogram was measured. The participants had to respond to infrequent target stimuli, while ignoring frequent standard, and infrequent novel stimuli that were presented to the left or right, appearing either contra- or ipsilateral to the patients' resections. Results: Novelty detection, as indexed by the N2 ERP component elicited by novels, was reduced by the MTL resections, as evidenced by a smaller N2 for patients than healthy controls. Later processing of novels, as indexed by the novelty P3 ERP component, was reduced for novels presented contra- versus ipsilateral to the resected side. Moreover, at a frontal electrode site, the N2-P3 complex showed reduced novelty processing in patients with MTL resections compared to healthy controls. The ERP differences were specific for the novel stimuli, as target processing, as indexed by the P3b, was unaffected in the patients: No P3b differences were found between targets presented ipsi- or contralaterally to the resected side, nor between patients and healthy controls. Conclusions: The current results suggest that MTL structures play a role in novelty processing. In contrast, target processing was unaffected by MTL resections.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the carcass trait, meat quality and fatty acid profile of Awassi lambs under cultivated pasture fattening with a concentrated feed (CPF) and intensive fattening (IF) system. A total of 76 male Awassi lambs ( 36 lambs in the CPF group and 40 in the IF group, 85 days average age) were distributed in complete random design into two experimental groups. The final body weight was lower, but the average daily gain was higher for the lambs on the CPF compared to the lambs on the IF system. There were no significant differences (p>0.05) between CPF and IF system for dressing percentage (50.31 and 51.51%) and shrinkage loss (3.45 and 2.50%), pelvic limb (34.9 and 30.3%), thoracic limb (20.8 and 18.3%), flank (9.4 and 7.6%), neck (4.4 and 5.9%), and LTL section area (15.6 and 13.0 cm(2)), except for ribs (25.0 and 33.7%), which were higher in the intensive system. Also, meat pH and color value were not changed by the fattening systems. The fatty acid profile of the longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscles was assessed. The significant differences between groups were noted in margaric (1.00 and 1.80), heptadecenoic (0.51 and 0.99), eicosenoic (80.14 and 0.20), and linolenic fatty acids (0.21 and 0,19). In conclusion, the results of this study imply that carcass traits and meat quality were similar between CPF and IF systems in Awassi male lambs.

AB  - The metalloprotease meprin beta is known for its multifunctional involvement in various physiological processes throughout the body including the brain. However, its broader functions within the brain besides amyloid beta generation remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we utilized a mouse model overexpressing meprin beta in neurons within the cortex and hippocampus, regions crucial for learning and memory. Behavioral assessments, employing the Morris' Water Maze paradigm test, revealed impaired cognitive functions in animals overexpressing meprin beta. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices using multielectrode arrays showed an impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in meprin beta-overexpressing mice compared to wild-type counterparts. Intriguingly, concomitant with the LTP impairment, we observed an increased neuronal excitability. These findings underline the complicated interplay between meprin beta abundance and behavioral manifestations, suggesting a broader impact on neural circuit dynamics. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these observed deficits, western blotting analyses were conducted to address the expression of glutamatergic receptors. Neither the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) nor the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor showed variation relative to each other. The application of N-terminomics identified brevican as a proteolytic substrate of meprin beta and thus a potential key mediator linking meprin beta overexpression to the observed effects. Previous studies have reported that brevican knockout in animal models influences learning and memory. Our data demonstrate that meprin beta modulates brevican expression, likely contributing to the effects we have observed in our mouse model. These results shed light on the broader functional significance of meprin beta in neurological processes.

AB  - Analysis of BOLD signal from parietal and frontal brain regions during a maze exploration task may help decode participants' predictions about the upcoming scenes and confidence in these predictions.
   Prediction ability often involves some degree of uncertainty-a key determinant of confidence. Here, we sought to assess whether predictions are decodable in partially-observable environments where one's state is uncertain, and whether this information is sensitive to confidence produced by such uncertainty. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging-based, partially-observable maze navigation tasks in which subjects predicted upcoming scenes and reported their confidence regarding these predictions. Using a multi-voxel pattern analysis, we successfully decoded both scene predictions and subjective confidence from activities in the localized parietal and prefrontal regions. We also assessed confidence in their beliefs about where they were in the maze. Importantly, prediction decodability varied according to subjective scene confidence in the superior parietal lobule and state confidence estimated by the behavioral model in the inferior parietal lobule. These results demonstrate that prediction in uncertain environments depends on the prefrontal-parietal network within which prediction and confidence interact.

AB  - Twice-exceptional learners face a unique set of challenges arising from the intersection of extraordinary talent and disability. Neurobiology research has the capacity to complement pedagogical research and provide support for twice-exceptional learners. Very few studies have attempted to specifically address the neurobiological un-derpinnings of twice-exceptionality. However, neurobiologists have built a broad base of knowledge in nervous system function spanning from the level of neural circuits to the molecular basis of behavior. It is known that distinct neural circuits mediate different neural functions, which suggests that 2e learning may result from enhancement in one circuit and disruption in another. Neural circuits are known to adapt and change in response to experience, a cellular process known as neuroplasticity. Plasticity is controlled by a bidirectional connection between the synapse, where neural signals are received, and the nucleus, where regulated gene expression can return to alter synaptic function. Complex molecular mechanisms compose this connection in distinct neural circuits, and genetic alterations in these mechanisms are associated with both memory enhancements and psychiatric disorder. Understanding the consequences of these changes at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels will provide critical insights into the neurobiological bases of twice-exceptionality.

AB  - Some studies have demonstrated the effects of particulate matter (PM) on chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) development, as well as the therapeutic role of retinoic acid (RA) in nasal polypogenesis. However, the immunologic effect of PM in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and the exact mechanism of the therapeutic effect of RA remain unclear. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of fine-dust-induced inflammation in CRSwNP and the mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of RA. PM2.5 exposure exacerbated pathological damage in the nasal mucosa of mice with nasal polyps (NP) via upregulation of type 2 inflammation. Additionally, PM2.5 exposure increased the expression of type 2 cytokines and epithelial-cell-derived cytokines (IL-33 and IL-25) significantly, as well as the ILC populations in human-NP-derived epithelial cells (HNECs). Moreover, RA supplementation significantly increased the expression of ILCreg in Lin-CD45+CD127+ cells, which in turn increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The findings suggest that PM2.5 exposures could aggravate the CRSwNP type 2 inflammation, and RA treatment may ameliorate fine-dust-induced inflammation by modulating the innate immune response.

AB  - Retrosplenial cortex contains two principal subdivisions, area 29 (granular) and area 30 (dysgranular). Their respective anatomical connections in the rat brain reveal that area 29 is the primary recipient of hippocampal and parahippocampal spatial and contextual information while area 30 is the primary interactor with current visual information. Lesion studies and measures of neuronal activity in rodents indicate that retrosplenial cortex helps to integrate space from different perspectives, e.g., egocentric and allocentric, providing landmark and heading cues for navigation and spatial learning. It provides a repository of scene information that, over time, becomes increasingly independent of the hippocampus. These processes, reflect the interactive actions between areas 29 and 30, along with their convergent influences on cortical and thalamic targets. Consequently, despite their differences, both areas 29 and 30 are necessary for an array of spatial and learning problems.

AB  - Neurotrophins promote neurite outgrowth of auditory neurons and may help closing the gap to cochlear implant (CI) electrodes to enhance electrical hearing. The best concentrations and mix of neurotrophins for this nerve regrowth are unknown. Whether electrical stimulation (ES) during outgrowth is beneficial or may direct axons is another open question. Auditory neuron explant cultures of distinct cochlear turns of 6-7 days old mice were cultured for four days. We tested different concentrations and combinations of BDNF and NT-3 and quantified the numbers and lengths of neurites with an advanced automated analysis. A custom-made 24-well electrical stimulator based on two bulk CIs served to test different ES strategies. Quantification of receptors trkB, trkC, p75(NTR), and histological analysis helped to analyze effects. We found 25 ng/mL BDNF to perform best, especially in basal neurons, a negative influence of NT-3 in combined BDNF/NT-3 scenarios, and tonotopic changes in trk and p75(NTR) receptor stainings. ES largely impeded neurite outgrowth and glia ensheathment in an amplitude-dependent way. Apical neurons showed slight benefits in neurite numbers and length with ES at 10 and 500 mu A. We recommend BDNF as a potent drug to enhance the man-machine interface, but CIs should be better activated after nerve regrowth.

AB  - The morphology of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic compartment of most excitatory synapses, decisively modulates the function of neuronal circuits as also evident from human brain disorders associated with altered spine density or morphology. Actin filaments (F-actin) form the backbone of spines, and a number of actin-binding proteins (ABP) have been implicated in shaping the cytoskeleton in mature spines. Instead, only little is known about the mechanisms that control the reorganization from unbranched F-actin of immature spines to the complex, highly branched cytoskeleton of mature spines. Here, we demonstrate impaired spine maturation in hippocampal neurons upon genetic inactivation of cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) and CAP2, but not of CAP1 or CAP2 alone. We found a similar spine maturation defect upon overactivation of inverted formin 2 (INF2), a nucleator of unbranched F-actin with hitherto unknown synaptic function. While INF2 overactivation failed in altering spine density or morphology in CAP-deficient neurons, INF2 inactivation largely rescued their spine defects. From our data we conclude that CAPs inhibit INF2 to induce spine maturation. Since we previously showed that CAPs promote cofilin1-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling in mature spines, we identified them as a molecular switch that control transition from filopodia-like to mature spines.

AB  - Animals appear to possess an internal timer during action, based on the passage of time. However, the neural underpinnings of the perception of time, ranging from seconds to minutes, remain unclear. Herein, we consid-ered the neural representation of time based on mounting evidence on the neural correlates of time perception. The passage of time in the brain is represented by two types of neural encoding as follows: (i) the modulation of firing rates in single neurons and (ii) the sequential activity in neural ensembles. Time-dependent neural activity reflects the relative time rather than the absolute time, similar to a clock. They emerge in multiple regions, including the hippocampus, medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal striatum. Moreover, they involve different brain regions, depending on an implicit or explicit event duration. Thus, the two types of internal timers distributed across multiple brain regions simultaneously engage in time perception, in response to implicit or explicit time demands.

AB  - Aversive learning can produce a wide variety of defensive behavioral responses depending on the circumstances, ranging from reactive responses like freezing to proactive avoidance responses. While most of this initial learning is behaviorally supported by an expectancy of an aversive outcome and neurally supported by activity within the basolateral amygdala, activity in other brain regions become necessary for the execution of defensive strategies that emerge in other aversive learning paradigms such as active avoidance. Here, we review the neural circuits that support both reactive and proactive defensive behaviors that are motivated by aversive learning, and identify commonalities between the neural substrates of these distinct (and often exclusive) behavioral strategies.

AB  - Ketotherapeutics is a potential metabolic intervention for mitigating dementias; however, its mechanisms and optimal methods of application are not well understood. Our previous in vitro study showed that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a major ketone body, reverses pathological features of amyloid-beta oligomer (A beta O)-activated microglia. Here we tested the in vivo effects of BHB on microglia and synaptic plasticity in the 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. A short 1-week regimen of daily intraperitoneal injection of BHB (250 mg/kg), which induced brief and mild daily episodic ketosis, was sufficient to mitigate pro-inflammatory microglia activation and reduce brain amyloid-beta deposition by enhancing phagocytosis. Remarkably, it mitigated the deficits of hippocampal long-term depression but not long-term potentiation, and this effect was linked to suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome-generated IL-1 beta. As ketogenic diets are known for poor compliance, our study opens the possibility for alternative approaches such as short-term BHB injections or dietary ketone esters that are less restrictive, potentially safer, and easier for compliance.

AB  - The antinociceptive activity of the flower extracts of Styrax japonicus was confirmed in our previous study. However, the key compound for analgesia has not been distinguished, and the corresponding mechanism is obscure. In this study, the active compound was isolated from the flower by multiple chromatographic techniques and structurally illustrated using spectroscopic methods and referring to the related literature. The antinociceptive activity of the compound and the underlying mechanisms were investigated using animal tests. The active compound was determined to be jegosaponin A (JA), which showed significant antinociceptive responses. JA was also shown to possess sedative and anxiolytic activities but no anti-inflammatory effect, implying the association of the antinociceptive effects with the sedative and anxiolytic activities. Further antagonists and calcium ionophore tests showed that the antinociceptive effect of JA was blocked by flumazenil (FM, antagonist for GABA-A receptor) and reversed by WAY100635 (WAY, antagonist for 5-HT1A receptor). Contents of 5-HT and its metabolite (5-HIAA) increased significantly in the hippocampus and striatum tissues after JA administration. The results indicated that the antinociceptive effect of JA was regulated by the neurotransmitter system, especially GABAergic and serotonergic systems.

AB  - This review provides an integrative overview of the functional roles of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), focusing specifically on its impact on memory processes across the lifespan. A distinguishing feature of this review is its systematic approach, organizing the contributions of adult-born neurons (ABNs) chronologically through the stages of memory-from initial encoding, through sleep-dependent consolidation, retrieval, and finally forgetting. Although the existence and extent of adult neurogenesis in the human DG remain debated, accumulating evidence suggests that ABNs support cognitive functions throughout adulthood. This perspective gains particular importance when considering cognitive decline associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, which are linked to substantial reductions in adult neurogenesis. We compare traditional models of DG function with emerging evidence highlighting both shared and unique contributions of ABNs. For example, the DG is well-established for its role in pattern separation, and as key mediators of this function, ABNs-due to their transiently heightened plasticity and excitability-appear critical for discriminating novel or similar experiences. On the other hand, recent findings underscore the distinct and essential role of ABNs in memory consolidation during REM sleep, suggesting specialized functions of ABNs that are absent in developmentally born granule cells in the DG. Clinically, the potential therapeutic importance of enhancing neurogenesis in memory-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is emphasized, highlighting promising treatments such as memantine. Lastly, we outline key unresolved questions, advocating for future research aimed at understanding ABN-specific mechanisms. Far from being a mere evolutionary vestige, hippocampal ABNs represent dynamic and essential elements of neural plasticity that are critical for memory formation, adaptation, and resilience across the lifespan.

AB  - Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in depression. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like escitalopram are commonly prescribed as first-line treatments, their inconsistent efficacy and delayed onset of action necessitates the exploration of adjunctive therapies. Isorhamnetin, a flavonol, has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that makes exploring its antidepressant effect attractive. This study aims to investigate the adjuvant potential of isorhamnetin in combination with escitalopram to enhance its antidepressant efficacy in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression model using Swiss albino mice. Behavioral paradigms, such as the forced swim test and open field test, were employed to assess depressive symptoms, locomotion, and sedation. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were utilized to measure Nrf2, BDNF, HO-1, NO, and IL-6 levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The results demonstrate that isorhamnetin significantly improves the antidepressant response of escitalopram, as evidenced by reduced floating time in the forced swim test. Moreover, isorhamnetin enhanced antidepressant effects of escitalopram and effectively restored depleted levels of Nrf2, BDNF, and HO-1 in the cortex caused by LPS-induced depression. Isorhamnetin shows promise in enhancing the efficacy of conventional antidepressant therapy through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  - The participation of the hippocampal formation in consolidation and reconsolidation of contextual fear memories has been widely recognized and known to be dependent on the activation of the cAMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) pathway. Recent findings have challenged the prevailing view that over time contextual fear memories migrate to neocortical circuits and no longer require the hippocampus for retrieval of remote fearful memories. It has also recently been found that this brain structure is important for the maintenance and recall of remote fear memories associated with aversive events, a common trait in stress-related disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In view of these findings, here we examined the putative role of CREB in the hippocampus of an animal model of GAD during the retrieval of remote contextual fear memories. Specifically, we evaluated CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus of male Carioca High- and Low-conditioned Freezing rats (CHF and CLF, respectively) upon re-exposure of animals to contextual cues associated to footshocks weeks after fear conditioning. Age-matched male rats from a randomized crossbreeding population served as controls (CTL). Adrenal catecholamine levels were also measured as a biological marker of stress response. Seven weeks after contextual fear conditioning, half of the sample of CHF (n = 9), CLF (n = 10) and CTL (n = 10) rats were randomly assigned to return to the same context chamber where footshocks were previously administrated (Context condition), while the remaining animals were individually placed in standard housing cages (Control condition). Western blot results indicated that pCREB levels were significantly increased in the hippocampus of CHF rats for both Context and Control conditions when compared to the other experimental groups. CHF rats in the Context condition also exhibited significant more freezing than that observed for both CLF and CTL rats. Lastly, CHF animals in the Context condition displayed significantly higher adrenal catecholamine levels than those in the Control condition, whereas no differences in catecholamine levels were observed between Context and Control conditions for CLF and CTL rats. These findings are discussed from a perspective in which the hippocampus plays a role in the maintenance and recall of remote contextual fear memories via the CREB pathway.

AB  - Cerebral malaria (CM) is a deadly complication of P. falciparum infection. Although adults with CM have a higher mortality rate, CM affects mostly children under the age of 5 years. Neurological symptoms and signs include impaired consciousness, coma, seizures, and increased intracranial hypertension. Upon survival of a CM episode, persistent neurologic deficits occur in a subset of surviving children. These sequelae include recurrent seizures, behavioral deficits, loss of developmental milestones, learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which can remain with the survivors. The underlying neuropathology of these post CM neurologic sequelae are unclear. Therefore, we probed the extensive neuronal damage that occurs in an experimental murine model of cerebral malaria (eCM), focusing on the hippocampus. In addition, we explored responses of neuro-progenitor cells (NPC's) and potential repair mechanisms. We report here that Plasmodium infection causes extensive neuronal damage in the hippocampus, characterized by a loss of neuronal NeuN and double cortin (DCX) immunostaining in eCM mice. On day 6 of eCM we also observed increased neurofilament light chain staining, indicative of neuronal fragmentation, which was accompanied by an increase in neurofilament light chain in CSF but not seen in plasma. A concomitant increase in the influx of neuroprogenitor cells in eCM was observed, suggesting ongoing neuronal repair.

AB  - The exact etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains largely unknown, but more and more research suggests the involvement of the gut microbiota. Interestingly, idiopathic PD patients were shown to have at least a 10 times higher prevalence of Helicobacter suis (H. suis) DNA in gastric biopsies compared to control patients. H. suis is a zoonotic Helicobacter species that naturally colonizes the stomach of pigs and non-human primates but can be transmitted to humans. Here, we investigated the influence of a gastric H. suis infection on PD disease progression through a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model. Therefore, mice with either a short- or long-term H. suis infection were stereotactically injected with 6-OHDA in the left striatum and sampled one week later. Remarkably, a reduced loss of dopaminergic neurons was seen in the H. suis/6-OHDA groups compared to the control/6-OHDA groups. Correspondingly, motor function of the H. suis-infected 6-OHDA mice was superior to that in the non-infected 6-OHDA mice. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression levels of antioxidant genes in brain tissue from H. suis-infected 6-OHDA mice, as a potential explanation for the reduced 6-OHDA-induced cell loss. Our data support an unexpected neuroprotective effect of gastric H. suis on PD pathology, mediated through changes in oxidative stress.

AB  - Deregulation of the Hippo pathway is a driver for cancer progression and treatment resistance. In the context of gastric cancer, YAP1 is a biomarker for poor patient prognosis. Although genomic tumor profiling provides information of Hippo pathway activation, the present study demonstrates that inhibition of Yap1 activity has anti-tumor effects in gastric tumors driven by oncogenic mutations and inflammatory cytokines. We show that Yap1 is a key regulator of cell metabolism, proliferation, and immune responses in normal and neoplastic gastric epithelium. We propose that the Hippo pathway is targetable across gastric cancer subtypes and its therapeutic benefits are likely to be mediated by both cancer cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of selected analysis conditions on blood flow values and color maps in canine brain perfusion computed tomography (PCT) and to propose optimal analysis conditions. Dynamic computed tomography imaging was performed on six beagle dogs. Color maps were generated using a combination of analysis algorithms (box-modulation transfer function (Box-MTF) and singular value deconvolution plus (SVD+) methods), slice thicknesses (4.0 and 8.0 mm), analysis matrix sizes (512 x 512, 256 x 256, and 128 x 128), and noise reduction levels (strong and weak). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were calculated for gray matter, white matter, basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum in each map. CBF and CBV values obtained using SVD+ were significantly higher than those obtained using Box-MTF. Noise reduction was more effective with larger matrix sizes; however, excessive noise reduction led to the blurring of anatomical structures in the color map. Across all analysis algorithms, anatomical structures were challenging to visualize at 8.0 mm. For canine brain PCT, it is essential to choose a straightforward algorithm that remains unaffected by circulatory velocity or intracranial bone structure. Given the brain's size, the slice thickness should be minimal, noise reduction level should be suitable for the targeted area, and matrix size should be maximized.

AB  - Studying the brain circuits that control behavior is challenging, since in addition to their structural complexity there are continuous feedback interactions between actions and sensed inputs from the environment. It is therefore important to identify mathematical principles that can be used to develop testable hypotheses. In this study, we use ideas and concepts from systems biology to study the dopamine system, which controls learning, motivation, and movement. Using data from neuronal recordings in behavioral experiments, we developed a mathematical model for dopamine responses and the effect of dopamine on movement. We show that the dopamine system shares core functional analogies with bacterial chemotaxis. Just as chemotaxis robustly climbs chemical attractant gradients, the dopamine circuit performs 'reward-taxis' where the attractant is the expected value of reward. The reward-taxis mechanism provides a simple explanation for scale-invariant dopaminergic responses and for matching in free operant settings, and makes testable quantitative predictions. We propose that reward-taxis is a simple and robust navigation strategy that complements other, more goal-directed navigation mechanisms.
   Author summaryResearch on certain circuits in simple organisms, such as bacterial chemotaxis, has enabled the formulation of mathematical design principles, leading to ever more precise experimental tests, catalyzing quantitative understanding. It would be important to map these principles to the far more complex case of a vertebrate behavioral circuit. Here, we provide such a mapping for the midbrain dopamine system, a key regulator of learning, motivation, and movement. We demonstrate a mathematical analogy between the regulation of dopamine and movement by rewards and the well-characterized bacterial chemotaxis system. We use the analogy to quantitively explain previously puzzling observations on the dopamine circuit, as well as classic empirical observations on operant behavior.

AB  - Long-lasting biological changes reflecting past experience have been studied in and typically attributed to neurons in the brain. Astrocytes, which are also present in large number in the brain, have recently been found to contribute critically to learning and memory processing. In the brain, glycogen is primarily found in astrocytes and is metabolized to lactate, which can be released from astrocytes. Here we report that astrocytes themselves have intrinsic neurochemical plasticity that alters the availability and provision of metabolic substrates long after an experience. Rats were trained to find food on one of two versions of a 4-arm maze: a hippocampus-sensitive place task and a striatum-sensitive response task. Remarkably, hippocampal glycogen content increased while striatal levels decreased during the 30 days after rats were trained to find food in the place version, but not the response version, of the maze tasks. A long-term consequence of the durable changes in glycogen stores was seen in task-by-site differences in extracellular lactate responses activated by testing on a working memory task administered 30 days after initial training, the time when differences in glycogen content were most robust. These results suggest that astrocytic plasticity initiated by a single experience may augment future availability of energy reserves, perhaps priming brain areas to process learning of subsequent experiences more effectively.

AB  - The proliferation-quiescence decision is a dynamic process that remains incompletely understood. Live-cell imaging with fluorescent cell cycle sensors now allows us to visualize the dynamics of cell cycle transitions and has revealed that proliferation-quiescence decisions can be highly heterogeneous, even among clonal cell lines in culture. Under normal culture conditions, cells often spontaneously enter non-cycling G0 states of varying duration and depth. This also occurs in cancer cells and G0 entry in tumors may underlie tumor dormancy and issues with cancer recurrence. Here we show that a cell cycle indicator previously shown to indicate G0 upon serum starvation, mVenus-p27K-, can also be used to monitor spontaneous quiescence in untransformed and cancer cell lines. We find that the duration of spontaneous quiescence in untransformed and cancer cells is heterogeneous and that a portion of this heterogeneity results from asynchronous proliferation-quiescence decisions in pairs of daughters after mitosis, where one daughter cell enters or remains in temporary quiescence while the other does not. We find that cancer dormancy signals influence both entry into quiescence and asynchronous proliferation-quiescence decisions after mitosis. Finally, we show that spontaneously quiescent prostate cancer cells exhibit altered expression of components of the Hippo pathway and are enriched for the stem cell markers CD133 and CD44. This suggests a hypothesis that dormancy signals could promote cancer recurrence by increasing the proportion of quiescent tumor cells poised for cell cycle re-entry with stem cell characteristics in cancer.

AB  - One of the basic questions in the aging field is whether there is a fundamental difference between the aging of lower invertebrates and mammals. A major difference between the lower invertebrates and mammals is the abundancy of noncoding RNAs, most of which are not conserved. We have previously identified a noncoding RNA Terc-53 that is derived from the RNA component of telomerase Terc. To study its physiological functions, we generated two transgenic mouse models overexpressing the RNA in wild-type and early-aging Terc-/- backgrounds. Terc-53 mice showed age-related cognition decline and shortened life span, even though no developmental defects or physiological abnormality at an early age was observed, indicating its involvement in normal aging of mammals. Subsequent mechanistic study identified hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (Hmmr) as the main effector of Terc-53. Terc-53 mediates the degradation of Hmmr, leading to an increase of inflammation in the affected tissues, accelerating organismal aging. adeno-associated virus delivered supplementation of Hmmr in the hippocampus reversed the cognition decline in Terc-53 transgenic mice. Neither Terc-53 nor Hmmr has homologs in C. elegans. Neither do arthropods express hyaluronan. These findings demonstrate the complexity of aging in mammals and open new paths for exploring noncoding RNA and Hmmr as means of treating age-related physical debilities and improving healthspan.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of chronic, progressive, and fibrotic lung disease. While advancing age is recognized as the most significant risk factor for both the development and mortality associated with pulmonary fibrosis, precise mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Here, Nephronectin (NPNT) is identified as an antiaging molecule, a potential major regulator of the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In IPF patients, a marked reduction in NPNT expression is detected in lung tissues, which correlated with a decline in lung function. The study reveals that NPNT deficiency exacerbates bleomycin-induced senescence in alveolar epithelial cells, potentially intensifying fibrosis severity due to diminishes extracellular matrix turnover. Conversely, NPNT overexpression in the alveolar epithelium improves lung respiratory function and enhances resistance to aging and fibrosis. Mechanistically, NPNT inhibits the hyperactivation of LATS1 and MOB1, facilitates YAP1 nuclear translocation, and suppresses YAP1 ubiquitination and degradation, contingent upon the interaction between NPNT and ITGA3. Notably, pharmacological elevation of NPNT protein levels using Escin has been shown to alleviate pulmonary fibrosis and improve lung function in mice. The findings shed light on the key mechanism underlying stress-induced senescence and fibrosis, and offer a promising framework for interventions targeting aging-related diseases.

AB  - Author summary
   Even with exciting advances in recording techniques of neural spiking activity, experiments only provide a comparably short glimpse into the activity of only a tiny subset of all neurons. How can we learn from these experiments about the organization of information processing in the brain? To that end, we exploit that different properties of information processing leave distinct footprints on the firing statistics of individual spiking neurons. In our work, we focus on a particular statistical footprint: We quantify how much a single neuron's spiking depends on its own preceding activity, which we call history dependence. By quantifying history dependence in neural spike recordings, one can, in turn, infer some of the properties of information processing. Because recording lengths are limited in practice, a direct estimation of history dependence from experiments is challenging. The embedding optimization approach that we present in this paper aims at extracting a maximum of history dependence within the limits set by a reliable estimation. The approach is highly adaptive and thereby enables a meaningful comparison of history dependence between neurons with vastly different spiking statistics, which we exemplify on a diversity of spike recordings. In conjunction with recent, highly parallel spike recording techniques, the approach could yield valuable insights on how hierarchical processing is organized in the brain.
   Information processing can leave distinct footprints on the statistics of neural spiking. For example, efficient coding minimizes the statistical dependencies on the spiking history, while temporal integration of information may require the maintenance of information over different timescales. To investigate these footprints, we developed a novel approach to quantify history dependence within the spiking of a single neuron, using the mutual information between the entire past and current spiking. This measure captures how much past information is necessary to predict current spiking. In contrast, classical time-lagged measures of temporal dependence like the autocorrelation capture how long-potentially redundant-past information can still be read out. Strikingly, we find for model neurons that our method disentangles the strength and timescale of history dependence, whereas the two are mixed in classical approaches. When applying the method to experimental data, which are necessarily of limited size, a reliable estimation of mutual information is only possible for a coarse temporal binning of past spiking, a so-called past embedding. To still account for the vastly different spiking statistics and potentially long history dependence of living neurons, we developed an embedding-optimization approach that does not only vary the number and size, but also an exponential stretching of past bins. For extra-cellular spike recordings, we found that the strength and timescale of history dependence indeed can vary independently across experimental preparations. While hippocampus indicated strong and long history dependence, in visual cortex it was weak and short, while in vitro the history dependence was strong but short. This work enables an information-theoretic characterization of history dependence in recorded spike trains, which captures a footprint of information processing that is beyond time-lagged measures of temporal dependence. To facilitate the application of the method, we provide practical guidelines and a toolbox.

AB  - Pathological alterations in the biomechanical properties of the Schlemm's canal (SC) inner wall endothelium and its immediate vicinity are strongly associated with ocular hypertension in glaucoma due to decreased outflow facility. Specifically, the underlying trabecular meshwork is substantially stiffer in glaucomatous eyes compared with that from normal eyes. This raises the possibility of a critical involvement of mechanotransduction processes in driving SC cell dysfunction. Yes-associated protein (YAP) has emerged as a key contributor to glaucoma pathogenesis. However, the molecular underpinnings of SC cell mechanosignaling via YAP and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in response to glaucomatous extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening are not well understood. Using a novel biopolymer hydrogel that facilitates dynamic and reversible stiffness tuning, we investigated how ECM stiffening modulates YAP/TAZ activity in primary human SC cells, and whether disruption of YAP/TAZ mechanosignaling attenuates SC cell pathobiology and increases ex vivo outflow facility. We demonstrated that ECM stiffening drives pathologic YAP/TAZ activation and cytoskeletal reorganization in SC cells, which was fully reversible by matrix softening in a distinct time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that pharmacologic or genetic disruption of YAP/TAZ mechanosignaling abrogates stiffness-induced SC cell dysfunction involving altered cytoskeletal and ECM remodeling. Finally, we found that perfusion of the clinically used, small molecule YAP/TAZ inhibitor verteporfin (without light activation) increases ex vivo outflow facility in normal mouse eyes. Collectively, our data provide new evidence for a pathologic role of aberrant YAP/TAZ mechanosignaling in SC cell dysfunction and suggest that YAP/TAZ inhibition has therapeutic value for treating ocular hypertension in glaucoma.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is a valuable plant rich in biologically active compounds, mainly found in its berries and leaves. The harvesting process, which includes pruning, freezing, and shaking, leaves behind large amounts of biomass and juice-pressing residues, typically composted. The aim of this study is to expand knowledge of the valorization of sea buckthorn secondary raw materials by applying an innovative pressure cyclic solid-liquid (PCSL) extraction method and to develop value-added functional food products. Extraction was performed in 20 and 60 cycles, each lasting from 2 to 10 min. The highest concentrations of proanthocyanidins (5.51 gCE/L) and total phenolics (12.42 gGAE/L) were obtained under prolonged conditions, but the L-4 extract (20 cycles x 2 min) was selected for kombucha production due to its favorable balance between efficiency and sustainability. Microbial safety evaluation showed that kombucha with sea buckthorn leaf extract exhibited significantly stronger antimicrobial activity against tested pathogens compared to green tea kombucha. Additionally, sensory analysis revealed higher consumer acceptability of beverages enriched with sea buckthorn extracts. Shotgun metagenomic analysis identified high microbial diversity in the M. gisevii MI-2 starter culture and fermented kombucha products (227 bacteria and 44 eukaryotes), most of which (92.5% bacteria, 77.8% eukaryotes) remain viable and contribute to fermentation dynamics. New biotechnological strategies and genetic modifications raise concerns about the safe use of microorganisms in food production. To address these issues, these findings provide a foundation for future strategies aimed at the safe application of beneficial microorganisms in food biotechnology and support the long-term goals of the European Green Deal by promoting sustainable biomass valorization and circular economy advancement in the food sector.

AB  - Nanobody molecules, derived from heavy-chain only antibodies in camelids, represent the next generation of biotherapeutics. In addition to low immunogenicity, high stability, and potency, their single-domain format facilitates the construction of multivalent molecules for therapeutic applications. Although predominantly administered using a hypodermic syringe and needle, alternative delivery methods are under investigation. That said, the transdermal route has yet to be explored. Therefore, microarray patch (MAP) technology, offering a potentially high dose, pain-free transdermal system, is employed in this study. Trivalent Nanobody molecules, with and without half-life extension (VHH and VHH[HLE]), are formulated into hydrogel-forming MAPs, with pharmacokinetic parameters assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats. VHH MAPs exhibited a sustained release profile, with a serum concentration of 19 +/- 9 ng mL-1 24 h post-administration. In contrast, a subcutaneous (SC) injection showed faster clearance, with a serum concentration of 1.1 +/- 0.4 ng mL-1 at 24 h. For VHH(HLE), both SC and MAP cohorts achieved a maximum serum concentration (Tmax) at 24 h. The MAP cohort displayed a notable increase in VHH(HLE) serum levels between 6-24 h, dropping after MAP removal. This study has exemplified MAPs potential for delivering advanced biologics, indicating the transdermal route's promise for pain-free, patient-friendly administration of Nanobody molecules.
   Nanobody molecules, derived from cameilds, possess high stability, affinity and potency. Currently, their transdermal delivery remains unexplored and are typically administered via needle and syringe. In this work, a hydrogel-forming microarray patch (MAP) has been developed. Overall, this study has shown that MAPs have the potential to provide high dose delivery of Nanobody molecules across the skin for therapeutic applications. image

AB  - Prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global imperative, but reliable early interventions are currently lacking. Microglia-mediated chronic neuroinflammation is thought to occur in the early stage of AD and plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis. Here, oxytocin (OT)-loaded angiopep-2-modified chitosan nanogels (AOC NGs) were designed for early treatment of AD via inhibiting innate inflammatory response. Through the effective transcytosis of angiopep-2, AOC NGs were driven intravenously to cross the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain, and enrich in brain areas affected by AD. A large amount of OT was then released and specifically bound to the pathological upregulated OT receptor, thus effectively inhibiting microglial activation and reducing inflammatory cytokine levels through blocking the ERK/p38 MAPK and COX-2/iNOS NF-Kappa B signaling pathways. Consecutive weekly intravenous administration of AOC NGs into 12-week-old young APP/PS1 mice, representing the early stage of AD, remarkably slowed the progression of A beta deposition and neuronal apoptosis in the APP/PS1 mice as they aged and ultimately prevented cognitive impairment and delayed hippocampal atrophy. Together, the findings suggest that AOC NGs, which show good biosafety, can serve as a promising therapeutic candidate to combat neuroinflammation for early prevention of AD.

AB  - Background N-7-methylguanosine (m(7)G) is one of the most conserved modifications in nucleosides impacting mRNA export, splicing, and translation. However, the precise function and molecular mechanism of internal mRNA m(7)G methylation in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neurogenesis-related Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unknown.Results We profiled the dynamic Mettl1/Wdr4 expressions and m(7)G modification during neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis and its molecular mechanisms were examined by morphology, biochemical methods and biological sequencing. The translation efficiency of mRNA was detected by polysome profiling. The stability of Sptbn2 mRNA was constructed by RNA stability assay. APPswe/PS1 Delta E9 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice were used as model of AD. Morris water maze was used to detect the cognitive function.Methods We found that m(7)G methyltransferase complex Mettl1/Wdr4 as well as m(7)G was significantly elevated in neurons. Functionally, silencing Mettl1 in neural stem cells (NSCs) markedly decreased m(7)G modification, neuronal genesis and proliferation in addition to increasing gliogenesis, while forced expression of Mettl1 facilitated neuronal differentiation and proliferation. Mechanistically, the m(7)G modification of Sptbn2 mRNA by Mettl1 enhanced its stability and translation, which promoted neurogenesis. Importantly, genetic defciency of Mettl1 reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory in the adult mice. Furthermore, Mettl1 overexpression in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice rescued neurogenesis and behavioral defects.Conclusion Our findings unravel the pivotal role of internal mRNA m(7)G modification in Sptbn2-mediated neurogenesis, and highlight Mettl3 regulation of neurogenesis as a novel therapeutic target in AD treatment.

AB  - Pharyngeal cartilage morphogenesis is crucial for the formation of craniofacial structures. Cranial neural crest cells are specified at the neural plate border, migrate to pharyngeal arches, and differentiate into pharyngeal chondrocytes, which subsequently flatten, elongate, and stack like coins during maturation. Although the developmental processes prior to chondrocyte maturation have been extensively studied, their subsequent changes in morphology and organization remain largely elusive. Here, we show that wnt2bb is expressed in the pharyngeal ectoderm adjacent to the chondrogenic precursor cells in zebrafish. Inactivation of Wnt2bb leads to a reduction in nuclear (3-catenin, which impairs chondrogenic precursor proliferation and disrupts chondrocyte morphogenesis and organization, eventually causing a severe shrinkage of pharyngeal cartilages. Moreover, the decrease of (3-catenin in wnt2bb-/- mutants is accompanied by the reduction of Yap expression. Reactivation of Yap can restore the proliferation of chondrocyte progenitors as well as the proper size, shape, and stacking of pharyngeal chondrocytes. Our findings suggest that Wnt/(3-catenin signaling promotes Yap expression to regulate pharyngeal cartilage formation in zebrafish. Copyright (c) 2024, The Authors.

AB  - Breast ultrasound (BUS) image classification in benign and malignant classes is often based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to cope with small-sized training data. Nevertheless, BUS images are single-channel gray-level images, whereas pre-trained CNNs learned from color images with red, green, and blue (RGB) components. Thus, a gray-to-color conversion method is applied to fit the BUS image to the CNN's input layer size. This paper evaluates 13 gray-to-color conversion methods proposed in the literature that follow three strategies: replicating the gray-level image to all RGB channels, decomposing the image to enhance inherent information like the lesion's texture and morphology, and learning a matching layer. Besides, we introduce an image decomposition method based on the lesion's structural information to describe its inner and outer complexity. These gray-to-color conversion methods are evaluated under the same experimental framework using a pre-trained CNN architecture named ResNet-18 and a BUS dataset with more than 3000 images. In addition, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE) measure the classification performance. The experimental results show that decomposition methods outperform replication and learning-based methods when using information from the lesion's binary mask (obtained from a segmentation method), reaching an MCC value greater than 0.70 and specificity up to 0.92, although the sensitivity is about 0.80. On the other hand, regarding the proposed method, the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is better balanced, obtaining about 0.88 for both indices and an MCC of 0.73. This study contributes to the objective assessment of different gray-to-color conversion approaches in classifying breast lesions, revealing that mask-based decomposition methods improve classification performance. Besides, the proposed method based on structural information improves the sensitivity, obtaining more reliable classification results on malignant cases and potentially benefiting clinical practice.

AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the deadliest cancers because of its robust aggressive phenotype and chemoresistance. TAO kinase belongs to mitogen-activated protein kinases, which mediate drug resistance in multiple cancers. However, the role of TAO kinase in ESCC progression and chemoresistance has never been explored. Here, it is reported that TAOK3 augments cell autophagy and further promotes ESCC progression and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, TAOK3 phosphorylates KMT2C at S4588 and strengthens the interaction between KMT2C and ETV5. Consequently, the nuclear translocation of KMT2C is increased, and the transcription of autophagy-relevant gene IRGM is further upregulated. Additionally, the inhibitor SBI-581 can significantly suppress cell autophagy mediated by TAOK3 and synergizes with cisplatin to treat ESCC in vitro and in vivo.
   TAOK3 can augment autophagy and chemo-resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells mechanically by phosphorylating KMT2C and promoting the interaction between KMT2C and ETV5. Consequently, the nuclear translocation of KMT2C is increased, and IRGM transcription is promoted. Particularly, a specific inhibitor of TAOK3, SBI-581, is identified, which can synergize with cisplatin and subsequently enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy in ESCC.image

AB  - Epidemiological, experimental, and ecological data have indicated the controversial effect of in utero chronic low dose rate (<6 mGy/h) with accumulative low (<= 100 mGy) or high (>100 mGy) dose radiation exposure. Our main goal of this study was to examine if different low dose rates of chronic pre- and/or post-natal radiation exposure with accumulative high doses could induce hippocampal cellular, mRNA, and miRNA changes leading to neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive mouse phenotypic traits, organ weight, pathological, and blood mRNA and miRNA changes were also studied. Using different approaches including SmithKline, Harwell, Imperial College, Royal Hospital, Phenotype Assessment (SHIRPA), neurobehavioral tests, pathological examination, immunohistochemistry, mRNA and miRNA sequencing, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation, we found that in prenatally irradiated (100 mGy/d for 18 days with an accumulative dose of 1.8 Gy) 1-year-old mice, no cellular changes, including immature neurons in the subgranular zone, mature neurons and glial cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and development of cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disorders, occurred. However, a significant reduction in body weight and mass index (BMI) was indicated by the SHIRPA test. A reduced exploratory behavior was shown by an open field test. Organ weights showed significant reductions in the testes, kidneys, heart, liver and epididymides with no abnormal pathology. mRNA and miRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR validation revealed the upregulation of Rubcnl and Abhd14b, and downregulation of Hspa1b, P4ha1, and Banp genes in both the hippocampus and blood of mice prenatally irradiated with 100 mGy/d. Meanwhile, downregulation of miR-448-3p and miR1298-5p in the hippocampus, miR-320-3p, miR-423-5p, miR-486b-5p, miR-486b-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-652-3p, miR-324-3p, miR-181b-5p, miR-let-7b, and miR-6904-5p in the blood was induced. The target scan revealed that Rubcnl is one of the miR-181b-5p targets in the blood. We, therefore, concluded that prenatal chronic irradiation with a low dose rate of 100 mGy/d and accumulative dose of 1.8 Gy or below might not induce significant adverse health effects on the offspring. Further study of different low dose rate radiation exposures with accumulative high doses may provide threshold doses for authorities or regulators to set new radiation safety guidelines to replace those extrapolated from acute high dose/dose rate irradiation to reduce unnecessary emergency evacuation or spending once a nuclear accident or leakage occurs.

AB  - Since ancient times, Banhasasim-tang (BHS) has been used to treat functional dyspepsia in East Asia. Here, we aimed to determine the protective action of BHS on hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress. We investigated the functional effect of BHS on a scopolamine-induced mouse model, and molecular analysis was performed in glutamate-induced HT22 cells. We observed that BHS administration ameliorated memory dysfunction in scopolamine-treated mice. BHS administration also increased neuronal survival and acetylcholine activity and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus of mice. In hippocampal cells, BHS treatment rescued glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. We observed an increase of HO-1 and a decrease of Nrf2 protein expression in glutamate-induced oxidative stress; however, the expression level of these proteins was significantly rescued by BHS treatment. BHS treatment also regulated phosphorylation of p38, p53, ERK, and CREB. Therefore, our data indicated that BHS may reduce oxidative stress through regulation of ERK-CREB and p38-p53 signaling in the hippocampus, resulting in decreased neuronal damage and improved memory in rodent models of neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Due to the global issue of antimicrobial resistance, one of the most significant challenges in microbiological research is to develop a replacement antibiotic with minimal adverse effects. The wild shrub Pulicaria crispa (gethgath) has been traditionally used for camel and ruminant grazing. While prior research has demonstrated its antimicrobial properties against human diseases, no investigations have been conducted on its efficacy against animal pathogens. The objective of this study is to explore the ethnobotanical, phytochemical, antioxidant, anticancer, and antimicrobial activity of Pulicaria crispa aqueous and solvent extracts against a range of standard and animal pathogens. All of the extracts demonstrated antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties, containing bioactive compounds. Notably, the ethyl acetate extract of P. crispa exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity against tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The chloroform fraction displayed the highest antioxidant activity. Additionally, the ethyl acetate fraction showed promising anticancer activity against breast (MCF-7) and lung (A549) cancer cells. These findings confirm that Pulicaria crispa is a valuable shrub with potential applications as a natural alternative for antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer treatments in both human and veterinary medicine.

AB  - In this article, the upgrading process of the structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) protocol targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) previously published in 2017 is presented. The upgraded version of PyPLIF called PyPLIF HIPPOS and the receptor ensemble docking (RED) method using AutoDock Vina were employed to calculate the ensemble protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (ensPLIF) in a retrospective SBVS campaign targeting AChE. A machine learning technique called recursive partitioning and regression trees (RPART) was then used to optimize the prediction accuracy of the protocol by using the ensPLIF values as the descriptors. The best protocol resulting from this research outperformed the previously published SBVS protocol targeting AChE.

AB  - Simple Summary Developing sustainable livestock management requires knowledge and monitoring of which habitats within an enclosure the livestock prefers to stay in and in what way they utilise the available habitats. The technology of virtual fencing provides the ability to both monitor and adapt enclosures, thus adding value to the expense related to fencing for farmers and livestock managers. To this end, the possibilities this new technology offers need to be explored and methods developed. In this paper, we explore the monitoring capabilities of virtual fencing technology on a herd of cattle in a coastal dune landscape. We explore to what extent a herd of cattle prefers some habitats over others, and in what way they utilise each of the available habitats. We find clear differences in the amount of time the herd spends in each habitat and in the ways they utilise each habitat. The herd spend a disproportionately large amount of time in salt meadow, and likely spend most of their time there resting and ruminating. We conclude that the method for monitoring of cattle applied in this study, using existing virtual fencing technology, is a relatively precise method useful in year-round monitoring, with room for improvement.Abstract There has been an increased focus on new technologies to monitor habitat use and behaviour of cattle to develop a more sustainable livestock grazing system without compromising animal welfare. One of the currently used methods for monitoring cattle behaviour is tri-axial accelerometer data from systems such as virtual fencing technology or bespoke monitoring technology. Collection and transmission of high-frequency accelerometer and GNSS data is a major energy cost, and quickly drains the battery in contemporary virtual fencing systems, making it unsuitable for long-term monitoring. In this paper, we explore the possibility of determining habitat preference and habitat utilisation patterns in cattle using low-frequency activity and location data. We achieve this by (1) calculating habitat selection ratios, (2) determining daily activity patterns, and (3) based on those, inferring grazing and resting sites in a group of cattle wearing virtual fencing collars in a coastal setting with grey, wooded, and decalcified dunes, humid dune slacks, and salt meadows. We found that GNSS data, and a measure of activity, combined with accurate mapping of habitats can be an effective tool in assessing habitat preference. The animals preferred salt meadows over the other habitats, with wooded dunes and humid dune slacks being the least preferred. We were able to identify daily patterns in activity. By comparing general trends in activity levels to the existing literature, and using a Gaussian mixture model, it was possible to infer resting and grazing behaviour in the different habitats. According to our inference of behaviour the herd predominantly used the salt meadows for resting and ruminating. The approach used in this study allowed us to use GNSS location data and activity data and combine it with accurate habitat mapping to assess habitat preference and habitat utilisation patterns, which can be an important tool for guiding management decisions.

AB  - The control of socioeconomically important parasitic roundworms (nematodes) of animals has become challenging or ineffective due to problems associated with widespread resistance in these worms to most classes of chemotherapeutic drugs (anthelmintics) currently available. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover and develop novel compounds with unique mechanisms of action to underpin effective parasite control programmes. Here, we evaluated an in silico (computational) approach to accelerate the discovery of new anthelmintics against the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus (barber's pole worm) as a model system. Using a supervised machine learning workflow, we trained and assessed a multi-layer perceptron classifier on a labelled dataset of 15,000 small-molecule compounds, for which extensive bioactivity data were previously obtained for H. contortus via high-throughput screening, as well as evidence-based datasets from the peer-reviewed literature. This model achieved 83% precision and 81% recall on the class of 'active' compounds during testing, despite a high imbalance in the training data, with only 1% of compounds carrying this label. The trained model was then used to infer nematocidal candidates by in silico screening of 14.2 million compounds from the ZINC15 database. An experimental assessment of 10 of these candidates showed significant inhibitory effects on the motility and development of H. contortus larvae and adults in vitro, with two compounds exhibiting high potency for further exploration as lead candidates. These findings indicate that the present machine learning-based approach could accelerate the in silico prediction and prioritisation of anthelmintic small molecules for subsequent in vitro and in vivo validations.

AB  - Allergic rhinitis (AR) is defined allergic disease that is mediated by Th2 cells. Its incidence rate is showing a growing tendency worldwide. Research on traditional medicine for AR is also being increasingly conducted. Thymus quinquecostatus Celakovski (TQ) has been used as an important medicinal and aromatic plant in the world. The purpose of this study was to assess whether TQ can alleviate AR. BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to provoke AR. Mice were treated with ethanol extract of TQ at 10 or 100 mg/kg after the intranasal OVA challenge. Their clinical symptoms such as nasal rubbing and sneezing were significantly reduced in the ethanol extract group (10 or 100 mg/kg) compared to the OVA group. Serum levels of Th1 (TNF-alpha) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6) cytokines and IgE levels (both total and OVA-specific) were significantly reduced by administration of ethanol extract of TQ at 100 mg/kg. The thicknesses of the nasal septum and epithelium were significantly reduced by the administration of ethanol extract of TQ. These results suggest that TQ may inhibit early and late phases of AR reactions.

AB  - The effect of green tea (Camellia sinensis) iron oxide nanoparticles (nano-Fe) on the effectiveness, growth, antioxidant capacity, and immunological response of Trichogaster trichopterus (Blue gourami) fingerlings was investigated. UV-Visible, Fourier Transform Infrared, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray, X-ray diffraction, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Zeta Potential spectroscopy were used to evaluate the biologically synthesized nano-Fe. Characterization revealed the hexagonal and spherical morphology with an average diameter of 114 nm. Six different experimental diets were supplied to the fish in duplicate for 60 days. The first diet served as a control (no nano-Fe supplementation), whereas the remaining five diets contained nano-Fe at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/kg (D1 to D5). The results indicated that fish fed a nano-Fe diet at a concentration of 40 mg/kg had improved growth performance, biochemical constituents, hematological parameters, and antioxidant activity in T. trichopterus, implying that it might be used as a vital feed supplement in ornamental fish culture.

AB  - The fusion of the viral membrane and genome release are hallmark events of enveloped virus infections. However, the related dynamic mechanisms of most viruses remain poorly understood. In this study, we combine single-virus tracking with the in-situ pH quantification of the dual-labeled Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) to label its viral envelope and RNA by using quantum dots and pH-sensitive dyes, respectively. This robust technique allows us to visualize and quantify the process of genome release at the level of a single virus in real time, and to thus collect more information on the dynamics of genome release. The results of our experiments show that the infection pathway of the JEV is dependent on actin and micro tubules, and viral fusion events predominantly occur in maturing endosomes that represent the intermediate stage between early and late endosomes. The kinetic insights gained in this study address longstanding questions regarding where and how the JEV harnesses endosomal compartments and releases its genome for replication, and are expected to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the infection mechanism of JEV.

AB  - Environmental enrichment induces behavioral and structural modifications in rodents and influences the capability of mice to cope with stress. However, little is understood about hippocampal neurogenesis and the appearance of social/agonistic (aggressive) behavior upon activation of different neuronal circuits in FVB/N mice. Thus, in this study we hypothesized that environmental enrichment differentially regulates neurogenesis, neural circuit activation and social/agonistic behavior in male and female FVB/N mice. We explored the (1) neurogenic process as an indicative of neuroplasticity, (2) neuronal activation in the limbic system, and (3) social behavior using the resident-intruder test. On postnatal day 23 (PD23), mice were assigned to one of two groups: Standard Housing or Environmental Enrichment. At PD53, rodents underwent the resident-intruder test to evaluate social behaviors. Results revealed that environmental enrichment increased neurogenesis and social interaction in females. In males, environmental enrichment increased neurogenesis and agonistic behavior. Enriched male mice expressed higher levels of agonistic-related behavior than female mice housed under the same conditions. Neural circuit analysis showed lower activation in the amygdala of enriched males and higher activation in enriched females than their respective controls. Enriched females also showed higher activation in the frontal cortex without differences in male groups. Moreover, the insular cortex was less activated in females than in males. Thus, our results indicate that environmental enrichment has different effects on neuroplasticity and social/agonistic behavior in FVB/N mice, suggesting the relevance of sexual dimorphism in response to environmental stimuli.

AB  - Exendin-4 (Ex-4) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist that protects against brain injury. However, little is known about the effect of Ex-4 on kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures and hippocampal cell death. Therefore, this study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of Ex-4 pretreatment in a mouse model of KA-induced seizures. Three days before KA treatment, mice were intraperitoneally injected with Ex-4. We found that Ex-4 pretreatment reversed KA-induced reduction of GLP-1R expression in the hippocampus and attenuated KA-induced seizure score, hippocampal neuronal death, and neuroinflammation. Ex-4 pretreatment also dramatically reduced hippocampal lipocalin-2 protein in KA-treated mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies showed that Ex-4 pretreatment significantly alleviated blood-brain barrier leakage. Finally, Ex-4 pretreatment stimulated hippocampal expression of phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (p-CREB), a known target of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling. These findings indicate that Ex-4 pretreatment may protect against KA-induced neuronal damage by regulating GLP-1R/CREB-mediated signaling pathways.

AB  - Neurons in the brain are known to encode diverse information through their spiking activity, primarily reflecting external stimuli and internal states. However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuron's anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Computational approximations of anatomy have the potential to support in vivo electrode localization.

AB  - The impact of early developmental experience on neurobiological pathways that may contribute to the association between diet and behavior have not yet been elucidated. The focus of the current study was to determine whether the impact of prenatal stress (PS) could be mitigated by a diet that stimulates the same neuroendocrine systems influenced by early stress, using a mouse model. Behavioral and genetic approaches were used to assess how a Western-pattern diet (WPD) interacts with PS and sex to impact the expression of anxiety-like behavior in an open-field arena, as well as the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus, D1 dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens, and D2 dopamine receptors in the ventral tegmental area. Overall, the results demonstrated that a prenatal WPD mitigates the effects of maternal stress in dams and offspring. These results help to elucidate the relationship between pre- and post-natal nutrition, gene expression, and behaviors that lead to long-term health effects.

AB  - Influenza A viruses (IAVs) present major public health threats from annual seasonal epidemics and pandemics and from viruses adapted to a variety of animals including poultry, pigs, and horses. Vaccines that broadly protect against all such IAVs, so-called "universal" influenza vaccines, do not currently exist but are urgently needed. Here, we demonstrated that an inactivated, multivalent whole-virus vaccine, delivered intramuscularly or intranasally, was broadly protective against challenges with multiple IAV hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes in both mice and ferrets. The vaccine is composed of four beta-propiolactone-inactivated low-pathogenicity avian IAV subtypes of H1N9, H3N8, H5N1, and H7N3. Vaccinated mice and ferrets demonstrated substantial protection against a variety of IAVs, including the 1918 H1N1 strain, the highly pathogenic avian H5N8 strain, and H7N9. We also observed protection against challenge with antigenically variable and heterosubtypic avian, swine, and human viruses. Compared to control animals, vaccinated mice and ferrets demonstrated marked reductions in viral titers, lung pathology, and host inflammatory responses. This vaccine approach indicates the feasibility of eliciting broad, heterosubtypic IAV protection and identifies a promising candidate for influenza vaccine clinical development.

AB  - An approach based on a dendrimer display of B- and T-cell epitopes relevant for antibody induction has been shown to be effective as a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine. B2T dendrimers combining two copies of the major FMD virus (FMDV) type O B-cell epitope (capsid proteinVP1 (140-158)) covalently linked to a heterotypic T-cell epitope from non-structural protein 3A (21-35), henceforth B2T-3A, has previously been shown to elicit high neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers and IFN-gamma-producing cells in both mice and pigs. Here, we provide evidence that the B- and T-cell epitopes need to be tethered to a single molecular platform for successful T-cell help, leading to efficient nAb induction in mice. In addition, mice immunized with a non-covalent mixture of B2T-3A dendrimers containing the B-cell epitopes of FMDV types O and C induced similarly high nAb levels against both serotypes, opening the way for a multivalent vaccine platform against a variety of serologically different FMDVs. These findings are relevant for the design of vaccine strategies based on B- and T-cell epitope combinations.

AB  - Neurogranin (Ng) is a brain-specific postsynaptic protein, whose role in modulating Ca2+/calmodulin signaling in glutamatergic neurons has been linked to enhancement in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. Accordingly, Ng knock-out (Ng-ko) mice display hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairments associated with a deficit in long-term potentiation induction. In the adult olfactory bulb (OB), Ng is expressed by a large population of GABAergic granule cells (GCs) that are continuously generated during adult life, undergo high synaptic remodeling in response to the sensory context, and play a key role in odor processing. However, the possible implication of Ng in OB plasticity and function is yet to be investigated. Here, we show that Ng expression in the OB is associated with the mature state of adult-born GCs, where its active-phosphorylated form is concentrated at post-synaptic sites. Constitutive loss of Ng in Ng-ko mice resulted in defective spine density in adult-born GCs, while their survival remained unaltered. Moreover, Ng-ko mice show an impaired odor-reward associative memory coupled with reduced expression of the activity-dependent transcription factor Zif268 in olfactory GCs. Overall, our data support a role for Ng in the molecular mechanisms underlying GC plasticity and the formation of olfactory associative memory.

AB  - Interferons (IFNs) play a major role in the host's antiviral innate immunity. In response to viral infection, IFNs bind their receptors and initiate a signaling cascade, leading to the accurate transcriptional regulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) belongs to genus Rotavirus of the Reoviridae family; the infection is a global epidemic disease and a major threat to the pig industry. In this study, we found that IFN-lambda 3 inhibited the replication of PoRV in both MA104 cells and IPEC-J2 cells, and this inhibition was dose-dependent. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of IFN-lambda 3 was more potent in IPEC-J2 cells than in MA104 cells. Further research showed that IFN-lambda 3 and IFN-alpha might inhibit PoRV infection by activating ISGs, i.e., MxA, OASL and ISG15, in IPEC-J2 cells. However, the co-treatment of IFN-lambda 3 and IFN-alpha did not enhance the antiviral activity. Our data demonstrated that IFN-lambda 3 had antiviral activity against PoRV and may serve as a useful antiviral candidate against PoRV, as well as other viruses in swine.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by cognitive inflexibility and social deficits, with a notably limited range of brain-targeted medications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine. Herein, we introduce the brain-targeted H2S donor cross-linked nanomicelle, named mannose-PEG600-lipoic acid (Man-LA). Man-LA demonstrates enhanced stability and precise brain delivery by interacting with glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in astrocytes, facilitating a gradual release of H2S that is modulated by glutathione (GSH). In vivo, studies suggest that Man-LA alleviates symptoms of ASD, correlating with increased expression of aerobic glycolysis enzymes, elevated lactate production, and higher H2S levels, while preventing damage to hippocampal neurons. In vitro, Man-LA tightly binds to aldehyde dehydrogenase family 3 member B1 (Aldh3b1) in astrocytes, upregulating its expression. This interaction promotes aerobic glycolysis and enhances lactate production. These findings suggest a connection between ASD deficits and the dysregulation of astrocytic aerobic glycolysis, underscoring the role of H2S. Identifying the Aldh3b1 gene within aerobic glycolysis pathways provides a promising target for ASD treatment.

AB  - Ongoing neural activity, which represents internal brain states, is constantly modulated by the sensory information that is generated by the environment. In this study, we show that the habenular circuits act as a major brain hub integrating the structured ongoing activity of the limbic forebrain circuitry and the olfactory information. We demonstrate that ancestral homologs of amygdala and hippocampus in zebrafish forebrain are the major drivers of ongoing habenular activity. We also reveal that odor stimuli can modulate the activity of specific habenular neurons that are driven by this forebrain circuitry. Our results highlight a major role for the olfactory system in regulating the ongoing activity of the habenula and the forebrain, thereby altering brain's internal states.

AB  - The second-most common cause of dementia is vascular dementia (VaD). The majority of VaD patients experience cognitive impairment, which is brought on by oxidative stress and changes in autophagic function, which ultimately result in neuronal impairment and death. In this study, we examine a novel method for reversing VaD-induced changes brought on by acai berry supplementation in a VaD mouse model. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of acai berries on the molecular mechanisms underlying VaD in a mouse model of the disease that was created by repeated ischemia-reperfusion (IR) of the whole bilateral carotid artery. Here, we found that acai berry was able to reduce VaD-induced behavioral alteration, as well as hippocampal death, in CA1 and CA3 regions. These effects are probably due to the modulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and Beclin-1, suggesting a possible crosstalk between these molecular pathways. In conclusion, the protective effects of acai berry could be a good supplementation in the future for the management of vascular dementia.

AB  - Ethanol exposure during pregnancy alters the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the fetal brain. Hence, in adult rats exposed to ethanol during the neonatal period, we investigated the influence of rapamycin, an mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor, on deficits in spatial memory and reversal learning in the Barnes maze task, as well as the ethanol-induced rewarding effects (1.0 or 1.5 g/kg) using the conditioning place preference (CPP) paradigm. Rapamycin (3 and 10 mg/kg) was given before intragastric ethanol (5 g/kg/day) administration at postnatal day (PND)4-9 (an equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy). Spatial memory/reversal learning and rewarding ethanol effect were evaluated in adult (PND60-70) rats. Additionally, the impact of rapamycin pre-treatment on the expression of the GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptor in the brain was assessed in adult rats. Our results show that neonatal ethanol exposure induced deficits in spatial memory and reversal learning in adulthood, but the reversal learning outcome may have been due to spatial learning impairments rather than cognitive flexibility impairments. Furthermore, in adulthood the ethanol treated rats were also more sensitive to the rewarding effect of ethanol than the control group. Rapamycin prevented the neonatal effect of ethanol and normalized the GluN2B down-regulation in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, as well as normalized this subunit's up-regulation in the striatum of adult rats. Our results suggest that rapamycin and related drugs may hold promise as a preventive therapy for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

KW  - GENES
AB  - Plants encode a large number of proteases in activating intracellular signaling through proteolytic cleavages of various protein substrates. One type of the substrates is proligands, including peptide hormones, which are perceived by cell surface-resident receptors. The peptide hormones are usually first synthesized as propeptides, and then cleaved by specific proteases for activation. Accumulating evidence indicates that the protease-mediated cleavage of proligands can be triggered by environmental stresses and subsequently activates plant stress signaling. In this perspective, we highlight several recent publications and provide an update about stress-induced cleavage of propeptides and receptor-associated components by proteases in the activation of cell surface -resident receptor signaling in plants. We also discuss some questions and future challenges in the research of protease functions in plant stress response.
   Growing in an ever-changing environment, plants are constantly challenged by various environmental stresses, from extreme temperatures to attacks by pathogens, herbivores, and parasitic plants. Sessile plants cannot escape from these abominable conditions but developed sophisticated mechanisms to respond to these environmental cues. Plant cell surface-resident receptors are vital sensors that perceive various environmental and internal stimuli [1,2]. In plants, protease-mediated proteolysis plays a crucial role in plant receptor recognition of molecular signatures of external and internal cues and activation of intracellular signaling pathways (Figure 1A) [3,4]. Plant proteases are usually produced as inactive zymogens. Environmental stimuli can activate the proteases to process various substrates, including peptide ligands and their corresponding receptors, resulting in the activation of ligandreceptor-mediated stress signaling. Since we published a review entitled 'The cloak, dagger, and shield: proteases in plant-pathogen interactions' in 2018 [3], there are quite some exciting developments in this field. Here, we provide an update about how environmental stresses prime protease activation and protease-mediated specific cleavage of protein substrates in activating cell surface-resident receptor sig

AB  - The unique nerve terminal targeting of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is due to its capacity to bind two receptors on the neuronal plasma membrane: polysialoganglioside (PSG) and synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2). Whether and how PSGs and SV2 may coordinate other proteins for BoNT/A recruitment and internalization remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the targeted endocytosis of BoNT/A into synaptic vesicles (SVs) requires a tripartite surface nanocluster. Live-cell super-resolution imaging and electron microscopy of catalytically inactivated BoNT/A wildtype and receptor-binding-deficient mutants in cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrated that BoNT/A must bind coincidentally to a PSG and SV2 to target synaptic vesicles. We reveal that BoNT/A simultaneously interacts with a preassembled PSG-synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) complex and SV2 on the neuronal plasma membrane, facilitating Syt1-SV2 nanoclustering that controls endocytic sorting of the toxin into synaptic vesicles. Syt1 CRISPRi knockdown suppressed BoNT/A- and BoNT/E-induced neurointoxication as quantified by SNAP-25 cleavage, suggesting that this tripartite nanocluster may be a unifying entry point for selected botulinum neurotoxins that hijack this for synaptic vesicle targeting.

AB  - In recent decades, a shift in the nutritional landscape to the Western-style diet has led to an unprecedented rise in the prevalence of obesity and neurodegenerative diseases. Consumption of a healthy diet and engaging in regular physical activity represents safe and affordable approaches known to mitigate the adverse consequences of the Western diet. We examined whether genistein treatment, exercise training, and a combination treatment (genistein and exercise training) mitigated the effects of a Western diet-induced by high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) in brain of female mice. HFHS increased the amyloid-beta (A beta) load and phosphorylation of tau, apoptosis, and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Exercise training and genistein each afforded modest protection on A beta accumulation and apoptosis, and both increased BDNF. The greatest neuroprotective effect occurred with combination treatment. BDNF and all markers of A beta accumulation, phosphorylation of tau, and apoptosis were improved with combined treatment. In a separate series of experiments, PC12 cells were exposed to high glucose (HG) and palmitate (PA) to determine cell viability with genistein as well as in the presence of tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, to assess a mechanism of action of genistein on cell apoptosis. Genistein prevented the neurotoxic effects of HG and PA in PC12 cells and tamoxifen blocked the beneficial effects of genistein on apoptosis. Our results indicate the beneficial effects of genistein and exercise training on HFHS-induced brain damage. The benefits of genistein may occur via estrogen receptor-mediated pathways.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury impairs learning and memory in patients. Studies have shown that synaptic function is involved in the formation and development of memory, and that DNA methylation plays a key role in the regulation of learning and memory. To investigate the role of DNA hypomethylation in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, in this study, we established a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and then treated the rats with intraperitoneal 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methylation. Our results showed that 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine markedly improved the neurological function, and cognitive, social and spatial memory abilities, and dose-dependently increased the synaptic density and the expression of SYP and SHANK2 proteins in the hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner in rats with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine were closely related to its reduction of genomic DNA methylation and DNA methylation at specific sites of the Syp and Shank2 genes in rats with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. These findings suggest that inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine promotes the recovery of learning and memory impairment in a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. These results provide theoretical evidence for stroke treatment using epigenetic methods.

AB  - Oxidative damage in the brain may lead to cognitive impairments. There was considerable debate regarding the beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions because exercise protocols have varied widely across studies. We investigated whether different exercise intensities alter performance on cognitive tasks. The experiment was performed on spontaneously hypertensive rats (6 months at the established phase of hypertension) distributed into 3 groups: sedentary, low-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise. Systolic blood pressure measurements confirmed hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In comparison to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, sedentary spontaneously hypertensive rats had similar escape latencies and a similar preference for the correct quadrant in the probe trial. Compared to the sedentary group, the low-intensity exercise group had significantly better improvements in spatial memory assessed by Morris water maze. Low-intensity exercise was associated with attenuated reactive oxygen species, as measured by dihydroethidine fluorescence and nitrotyrosine staining in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This was coupled with increased numbers of neurons and dendritic spines as well as a significant upregulation of synaptic density. In contrast, the beneficial effects of low-intensity exercise are abolished in high-intensity exercise as shown by increased free radical levels and an impairment in spatial memory. We concluded that exercise is an effective strategy to improve spatial memory in spontaneously hypertensive rats even at an established phase of hypertension. Low-intensity exercise exhibited better improvement on cognitive deficits than high-intensity exercise by attenuating free radical levels and improving downstream synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The order Rodentia comprises nearly 45% of all extant taxa, currently organized into 31 living families, some 450 genera, and roughly 2010 species (Kelt & Patton, 2020). Considering that rodents began evolving at least 66 million years ago, it is not surprising that they have diversified into five distinct suborders. With the advent of molecular biology, this difference can often be seen at the molecular level as well. Previous studies have indicated that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) of guinea pigs, belonging to the suborder Hystricomorpha, have fewer amino acids than have been reported for other suborders of Rodentia. Searching the genomic database for hystricomorph APOE genes, it was found that hystricomorphs were missing residues both in the vicinity of the hinge region and in the lipid-binding region of the apolipoprotein. In the hinge region, missing residues varied between 5 and 3, and in the latter region, seven residues were missing. The search also revealed that castorimorphs, although lacking the smaller of the two deletions, were also missing the same seven residue deletion as found in APOE of the hystricomorphs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and a major contributor to dementia. Although the cause of this condition has been identified long ago as aberrant aggregations of amyloid and tau proteins, effective therapies for it remain elusive. The complexities of drug development for AD treatment are often compounded by the impermeable blood-brain barrier and low-yield brain delivery. In addition, the use of high drug concentrations to overcome this challenge may entail side effects. To address these challenges and enhance the precision of delivery into brain regions affected by amyloid aggregation, we proposed a transferrin-conjugated nanoparticle-based drug delivery system. The transferrin-conjugated melittin-loaded L-arginine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Tf-MeLioNs) developed in this study successfully mitigated melittin-induced cytotoxicity and hemolysis in the cell culture system. In the 5XFAD mouse brain, Tf-MeLioNs remarkably reduced amyloid plaque accumulation, particularly in the hippocampus. This study suggested Tf-LioNs as a potential drug delivery platform and Tf-MeLioNs as a candidate for therapeutic drug targeting of amyloid plaques in AD. These findings provide a foundation for further exploration and advancement in AD therapeutics.

AB  - Simple Summary A simple screening technique for nutritive value of feed and feed additives is used in many countries. This technique measures the gas produced from feed and additives as they ferment in rumen fluid. The technique was proven previously to yield repeatable results within laboratory and was reproducible across laboratories when the same feed was fermented in fluid from different animal species in different countries with different basal diets and feeding conditions. To our knowledge, there are no published results of repeated fermentations in the same lab using the same species of animals for donating the rumen fluid, but using animals in different production stages. The present research investigated the repeatability of results from 17 fermentations using the same feed. The fermentations were undertaken either using rumen fluid from continuously fed lactating cows or heifers that were fasted for 12 h before fluid collection. There were significant differences between the fermentation results when using either rumen fluid from lactating cows or heifers for pH, and gas production before 24 h, suggesting that donor animal production stage may be more important than animal species.Abstract In vitro gas production techniques (IVGPT) are widely used to screen feeds and feed additives to reduce the number of animals needed for experiments, which in turn, reduces costs and increases animal welfare. However, information about repeatability is scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the variation from in vitro gas production fermentations in the same laboratory using the same feed substrate. The source of rumen fluid used in the fermentations was from two different farms with either cannulated lactating dairy cows or cannulated fasting heifers, representing two distinct stages of production (donor types). Seventeen 24 h fermentations, undertaken during a year, were used to evaluate the variation between the following parameters: gas curve parameters, baseline-corrected total gas production (TGP (mL at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP))/g incubated dry matter (DM)), methane concentration (%) and yield (mL gas at STP/g DM), pH and degraded dry matter (dDM). Significant differences between donor types were found for the pH of the rumen fluid from individual animals and pH of fermented fluid. However, no significant differences were observed within donor type. The means for methane concentration and yield, after 24 h of fermentation, were not significantly different between or within donor types. Rate of early gas production was significantly different between donor types, but baseline-corrected TGP was not significantly different at 24 h. No dDM differences after 24 h of fermentation between or within donor types were detected. Gas production curves were different between donor types, being either a monophasic version of the sigmoidal model or an exponential curve for the heifers and the production animals, respectively. No differences were observed within type. Repeatability of rumen fluid (CVRF), calculated as the coefficient of variation, and the associated parameters, which were investigated, was best for methane yield (CVRFALL = 0.3%) and least for TGP at 3 h (CVRFALL = 3%). Repeatability was dependent on donor type.

AB  - Numerous preclinical studies provide evidence that curcumin, a polyphenolic phytochemical extracted from Curcuma longa (turmeric) has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties against various neurological disorders. Curcumin neuroprotective effects have been reported in different animal models of epilepsy, but its potential effect attenuating brain glucose hypometabolism, considered as an early marker of epileptogenesis that occurs during the silent period following status epilepticus (SE), still has not been addressed. To this end, we used the lithium-pilocarpine rat model to induce SE. Curcumin was administered orally (300 mg/kg/day, for 17 days). Brain glucose metabolism was evaluated in vivo by 2-deoxy-2-[ (18) F]Fluoro-D-Glucose ([ (18) F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, hippocampal integrity, neurodegeneration, microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, and reactive astrogliosis were evaluated as markers of brain damage. SE resulted in brain glucose hypometabolism accompanied by body weight (BW) loss, hippocampal neuronal damage, and neuroinflammation. Curcumin did not reduce the latency time to the SE onset, nor the mortality rate associated with SE. Nevertheless, it reduced the number of seizures, and in the surviving rats, curcumin protected BW and attenuated the short-term glucose brain hypometabolism as well as the signs of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation induced by the SE. Overall, our results support the potential adaptogen-like effects of curcumin attenuating key features of SE-induced brain damage.

TI  - Antiepileptic Effects of Cicadae Periostracum on Mice and Its Antiapoptotic Effects in H2O2-Stimulated PC12 Cells via Regulation of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Signaling Pathways

AB  - Cicadae Periostracum (CPM), a commonly used animal traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), possesses antifebrile, spasmolytic, antiasthmatic, and antiphlogistic effects. In our present paper, we aimed to systemically investigate the antiepileptic effects of CPM in epileptic mice and explore the related molecular mechanism. Pentylenetetrazole- (PTZ) and strychnine-induced convulsion mice were established, and the results showed CPM could prolong the latency of convulsion and death and improve the neuronal damage in the hippocampus of PTZ-induced mice. Furthermore, the H2O2-treated PC12 cells were prepared to explore the possible mechanisms for the antiepileptic effects of CPM. CCK-8 results showed that CPM significantly improved the cell viability of H2O2-treated PC12 cells. Results of the acridine orange- (AO-) ethidium bromide (EB) staining, cell mitochondrial membrane potential (MOMP) analysis, and flow cytometry analysis showed that CPM significantly suppressed the H2O2-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. In addition, CPM also downregulated the proapoptosis proteins, including Bax, cleaved- (C-) caspase-3, and C-caspase-9, and upregulated Bcl-2. Furthermore, CPM reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels via increasing antioxidative enzyme activities, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Importantly, CPM could increase the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) in H2O2-induced PC12 cells and can promote the nuclear transfer of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increase the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the cytoplasm. In conclusion, our present study suggested CPM possessed antiepileptic effects through antiapoptosis of neuron cells via regulation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

AB  - Alpaca is a South American camelid, particularly present in Peruvian highlands, where oxygen concentration and atmospheric pressure are very low. Due to this fact, gestational physiology has adapted to preserve the conceptus' and mother's health. In this context, several cellular and molecular features play an essential role during and at the end of gestation. Structural carbohydrates act on maternal-fetal communication, recognize exogenous molecules, and contribute to placental barrier selectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the structural carbohydrate profiles that are present in the term alpaca placenta, kept in their natural habitat of around 4,000m height. For this propose, 12 term alpaca placentas were collected, and the material was obtained at the time of birth from camelids raised naturally in the Peruvian highlands, in the Cusco region. All placenta samples were processed for histological analysis. A lectin histochemical investigation was performed using 13 biotinylated lectins, allowing us to determine the location of carbohydrates and their intensity on a semi-quantitative scale. Our results demonstrated that during term gestation, the epitheliochorial alpaca placenta shows a high presence of carbohydrates, particularly glucose, alinked mannose, N-acetylglucosamine ss (GlcNAc), galactose (aGal), and N-acetylgalactosamine a (GalNAc), present in the trophoblast, amnion epithelium, and mesenchyme, as well as the presence of sialic acid residues and low affinity for fucose. In fetal blood capillaries, the presence of bi- and tri-antennary complex structures and a-linked mannose was predominated. In conclusion, we characterized the glycosylation profile in the term alpaca placenta. Based on our data, compared to those reported in the bibliography, we suggest that these carbohydrates could participate in the labor of these animals that survive in Peruvian extreme environments.

AB  - Adolescence represents a distinctive vulnerable period when exposure to stressful situations including opioid exposure can entail lasting effects on brain and can change neural mechanisms involved in memory formation for drug-associated cues, possibly increasing vulnerability of adolescents to addiction. Herein, the effects of acute adolescent morphine exposure (AAME, two injections of 2.5 mg/kg SC morphine on PND 31) were therefore investigated 6 weeks later (adulthood) on avoidance memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in transvers slices from the ventral hippocampus in adult male rats using field recordings technique. Animal body weight was measured from PND 31 throughout PND 40 and also in four time points with 1 week intervals from adolescence to adulthood (PNDs 48, 55, 62 and 69) to evaluate the effect of AAME on the weight gain. We showed that there were no effects on body weight, anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor activity, even until adulthood. There was an improved dark avoidance memory during adulthood. Finally, AAME had no effects on baseline synaptic responses and resulted in a decrease in the mean values of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential slopes required to evoke the half-maximal population spike amplitude and an enhancement of LTP magnitude (%) in the ventral CA1 during adulthood. Briefly, our results suggest long-lasting effects of acute adolescent morphine exposure on the ventral hippocampus, which begin the enhancing of synaptic plasticity and the improving of emotional memory in adulthood.

AB  - Various natural products (NPs) have been used to treat obesity and related diseases. However, the best way to fight obesity is preventive, with accurate body weight management through exercise, diet, or bioactive NPs to avoid obesity development. We demonstrated that green tea extract (GTE) is an anti-obesity NP using a zebrafish obesity model. Based on a hypothesis that GTE can prevent obesity, the objective of this study was to assess GTE's ability to attenuate obesity development. Juvenile zebrafish were pretreated with GTE for seven days before obesity induction via a high-fat diet; adult zebrafish were pretreated with GTE for two weeks before obesity induction by overfeeding. As a preventive intervention, GTE significantly decreased visceral adipose tissue accumulation in juveniles and ameliorated visceral adiposity and plasma triglyceride levels in adult zebrafish obesity models. RNA sequencing analysis was performed using liver tissues from adult obese zebrafish, with or without GTE administration, to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. Transcriptome analysis revealed that preventive GTE treatment affects several pathways associated with anti-obesity regulation, including activation of STAT and downregulation of CEBP signaling pathways. In conclusion, GTE could be used as a preventive agent against obesity.

AB  - Lichens are classic examples of symbiosis, but some biologists have questioned whether the algal partner benefits from the relationship. Among the diverse lichen symbioses, the carbon transfer systems show remarkable convergences. When a compatible fungus is encountered, the alga proactively releases large amounts of carbohydrate, suggesting active participation rather than victimhood. Some lichen-related fungus-alga symbioses appear obligatory for the algal partner. Within true lichens, algal symbionts can persist at microsites where they might not otherwise be competitive, because of improved stress tolerance, reduced photoinhibition, protection from herbivores, and the more efficient moisture management and positioning for light interception that fungal structures provide. Algal clones continually disperse from the lichen thallus by diverse means, allowing the genotype to pioneer aposymbiotic colonies from a stable refuge. Because lichen-forming fungi conserve rather than consume their algal symbionts, the mutual self-interests of both partners substantially align in the stressful microhabitats where lichens are successful.

AB  - Understanding seizure development requires an integrated knowledge of different scales of organization of epileptic networks. We developed a model of "epilepsy-in-a-dish " based on dissociated primary neuronal cells from neonatal rat hippocampus. We demonstrate how a single application of glutamate stimulated neurons to generate spontaneous synchronous spiking activity with further progression into spontaneous seizure-like events after a distinct latency period. By computational analysis, we compared the observed neuronal activity in vitro with intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from epilepsy patients and identified strong similarities, including a related sequence of events with defined onset, progression, and termination. Next, a link between the neurophysiological changes with network composition and cellular structure down to molecular changes was established. Temporal development of epileptiform network activity correlated with increased neurite outgrowth and altered branching, increased ratio of glutamatergic over GABAergic synapses, and loss of calbindin-positive interneurons, as well as genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation. Differentially methylated genes were engaged in various cellular activities related to cellular structure, intracellular signaling, and regulation of gene expression. Our data provide evidence that a single short-term excess of glutamate is sufficient to induce a cascade of events covering different scales from molecule- to network-level, all of which jointly contribute to seizure development.

AB  - Industrial flour served as a classical filler in wood industry for many years. However, its high -cost and competition for use as food stuff paved the way to a novel substitution tactic by using agriculture and forestry waste residues. Camellia oleifera shell and palm kernel meal are both by-products of oil -refining with advantages such as wide availability, great -reserve, renewability, and low-cost. Herein, a compound filler strategy was proposed by combining Camellia oleifera shell powder (Cosp) and palm kernel meal (PKM) to solve some drawbacks while Cosp as a single filler. The results showed that the bonding performance of plywood incorporating 20% single Cosp modified MUF was inferior with respect to MUF modified by same amount of industrial flour, due to the significantly increased viscosity, leading to a decrease in wet shear strength (1.63 MPa and 1.47 MPa for cold and hot-water soaking pretreatment, respectively). Encouraged, the overall status (including the viscosity, gel time, and solid content) of MUF modified by the compound filler displayed is regarded the best formulation for Coaps to PKM weight ratio of 5:5. Therefore, the wet shear strength for derived plywood samples with the adhesive incorporating 20% filler content, can reach 1.90 MPa and 1.88 MPa for cold and hot-water soaking pretreatment, respectively. Interestingly, this bonding performance is similar to MUF resin modified by industrial flour. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infra -red spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to further confirm the potency of the compound filler modification strategy. Furthermore, the formaldehyde emission of MUF resin modified by the compound filler was effectively reduced by 8.24-14.12%, compared to industrial flour as filler. Cosp and PKM, as agricultural and forestry waste residue, exhibited the cost advantage for this approach based on calculation, which can save the cost of adhesive by over 40% for filler. The strategy for employing this compound filler provides a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach for green application of waste residues obtained from agriculture and forestry.

AB  - The release of drugs in the brain is a challenge due to the blood-brain barrier, but intranasal administration of hydrogels enables the continuous release and quick targeting of drugs into the brain. The aim of this study was to prepare a genipin/hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin inclusion complex thermosensitive hydrogel system (genipin-THS) and evaluate its antidepressant effects. The genipin-THS was constructed using the cold method and was further optimized based on the results of gelation temperature and in vitro drug release. In the in vivo experiment, the genipin-THS significantly reduced the immobility time of mice displaying behavioral despair, decreased the ptosis score and increased the change in the body temperature of mice induced by reserpine, and improved abnormal levels of neurotransmitters (including 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine) in brain. In addition, the intranasally administered genipin-THS increased the bioavailability of the drug in the hippocampus, and the fluorescence distribution also showed that the thermosensitive hydrogel continuously released the drug for a longer time. In summary, the intranasally administered genipin-THS improved the bioavailability of genipin in the brain, increased its brain targeting, and further enhanced its antidepressant effects on depressive disorder.

AB  - Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms may contribute to cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanism by which these single nucleotide polymorphisms modify brain imaging phenotype remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms on brain imaging phenotype in Parkinson's disease. Forty-eight Parkinson's disease patients and 39 matched healthy controls underwent genotyping and 7T magnetic resonance imaging. A cognitive-weighted polygenic risk score model was designed, in which the effect sizes were determined individually for 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The correlations between polygenic risk score, neuroimaging features, and clinical data were analyzed. Furthermore, individual single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was performed to explore the main effects of genotypes and their interactive effects with Parkinson's disease diagnosis. We found that, in Parkinson's disease, the polygenic risk score was correlated with the neural activity of the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and fusiform gyrus, and with hippocampal-prefrontal and fusiform-temporal connectivity, as well as with gray matter alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, we found that single nucleotide polymorphisms in alpha-synuclein (SNCA) were associated with white matter microstructural changes in the superior corona radiata, corpus callosum, and external capsule. A single nucleotide polymorphism in catechol-O-methyltransferase was associated with the neural activities of the lingual, fusiform, and occipital gyri, which are involved in visual cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, DRD3 was associated with frontal and temporal lobe function and structure. In conclusion, imaging genetics is useful for providing a better understanding of the genetic pathways involved in the pathophysiologic processes underlying Parkinson's disease. This study provides evidence of an association between genetic factors, cognitive functions, and multi-modality neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Animals display a rich repertoire of defensive responses adequate to the threat proximity. In social species, these reactions can be additionally influenced by the behavior of fearful conspecifics. However, the majority of neuroscientific studies on socially triggered defensive responses focuses on one type of behavior, freezing. To study a broader range of socially triggered reactions and underlying mechanisms, we directly compared two experimental paradigms, mimicking occurrence of the imminent versus remote threat. Observation of a partner currently experiencing aversive stimulation evokes passive defensive responses in the observer rats. Similar interaction with a partner that has just undergone the aversive stimulation prompts animals to increase active exploration. Although the observers display behaviors similar to those of the aversively stimulated demonstrators, their reactions are not synchronized in time, suggesting that observers' responses are caused by the change in their affective state rather than mimicry. Using opsins targeted to behaviorally activated neurons, we tagged central amygdala (CeA) cells implicated in observers' responses to either imminent or remote threat and reactivated them during the exploration of a novel environment. The manipulation revealed that the two populations of CeA cells promote passive or active defensive responses, respectively. Further experiments confirmed that the two populations of cells at least partially differ in expression of molecular markers (protein kinase C-delta [PKC-delta] and corticotropin-releasing factor [CRF]) and connectivity patterns (receiving input from the basolateral amygdala or from the anterior insula). The results are consistent with the literature on single subjects' fear conditioning, suggesting that similar neuronal circuits control defensive responses in social and non-social contexts.

AB  - We compared the effects of two different high-caloric diets administered to 4-week-old rats for 12 weeks: a diet rich in sugar (30% sucrose) and a cafeteria diet rich in sugar and high-fat foods. We focused on the hippocampus, particularly on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system, including the Ca2+-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), calbindin (CB), and the neuropeptides somatostatin (SST) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). We also analyzed the density of cholinergic varicosities, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reelin (RELN), and cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK-5) mRNA levels, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The cafeteria diet reduced PV-positive neurons in the granular layer, hilus, and CA1, as well as NPY-positive neurons in the hilus, without altering other GABAergic populations or overall GABA levels. The high-sugar diet induced a decrease in the number of PV-positive cells in CA3 and an increase in CB-positive cells in the hilus and CA1. No alterations were observed in the cholinergic varicosities. The cafeteria diet also reduced the relative mRNA expression of RELN without significant changes in BDNF and CDK5 levels. The cafeteria diet increased the number but reduced the length of the astrocyte processes. These data highlight the significance of determining the mechanisms mediating the observed effects of these diets and imply that the cognitive impairments previously found might be related to both the neuroinflammation process and the reduction in PV, NPY, and RELN expression in the hippocampal formation.

AB  - Simple Summary; Virtual fencing is a new way of enclosing livestock without the use of physical barriers. The system relies on GPS technology and works by deterring escapes using auditory warnings and electric impulses. This study examines the effectiveness of one such system in a rotational strip grazing regime with 17 Angus bull calves. This study also aimed to determine which bull calves were more likely to receive electric impulses. The system proved effective at containing the bull calves within the designated enclosure. The bull calves learned to associate the auditory warning with the electric impulse, and as such, received increasingly fewer impulses as time went on. However, in accordance with previous studies, there were clear differences in the number of warnings and impulses received between individuals. The results regarding which bull calves received the most impulses did not show any clear trends. In conclusion, the virtual fencing system proved to be effective and the animals learnt how to interact with the system while receiving very few impulses. Large grazers are essential for nature conservation. In order to prevent grazers from moving to unintended areas, it may be necessary to keep them inside enclosures. Physical fences present a number of problems, such as fragmenting the landscape. Virtual fencing, however, is a possible replacement for physical fencing, making it possible to enclose grazers without physical boundaries. Virtual fencing systems utilise collars with GPS technology to track animals and deliver auditory warnings and electric impulses to keep animals within predefined boundaries. This study examines how effective the virtual fencing system Nofence (c) is at enclosing calves in a holistically managed setting. Holistic management is a rotational grazing technique where an enclosure is grazed in small strips at a time. It is investigated whether the calves become habituated to the virtual fence and whether there is a correlation between the number of warnings received by every two calves in order to explore potential herd behaviour. Finally, this study examines which calves interact the most with the virtual fence by investigating the relationship between physical activity and number of interactions. Seventeen calves were fitted with a GPS collar from the company Nofence (c) and placed in a holistically managed enclosure. Data were gathered from 4 July to 30 September 2022. The study found that virtual fence was able to contain calves inside the designated enclosure, and over time the calves received notably fewer electrical impulses compared to auditory warnings. The results of Pearson's correlation between auditory warnings received by two random calves were inconclusive, but the use of a sliding window analysis should be further explored. Lastly, the most physically active animals were the ones who received the most auditory warnings, but they did not receive more impulses. No significant correlation was found between the number of electric impulses received and the physical activity of the animals.

AB  - This study prioritised positive affective states while modifying the feeding management of five giraffes at Zoo Planckendael and monitored the impact on indicators of both negative and positive welfare. Observations were conducted day and night over a 10-day winter period before and one year after implementing the following feeding management changes: 1) increased fibre and decreased sugar and starch content in the diet; 2) inclusion of five browse species year-round, accounting for a minimum 10% of total dry matter intake, including browse with thorns; 3) increased daily feeding frequency (from two to three times) of pellets, produce and browse, with the highest browse provision in the evening; and 4) all food offered required tongue manipulation. Results indicate improved positive welfare, with significant increases in daytime feeding (from 24.5% to 43.4% of observed time), night-time feeding (from 17.6% to 28.7%) and nocturnal rumination (from 26.7% to 38.7%), and the complete replacement of mouth feeding with tongue feeding. Oral abnormal repetitive behaviours decreased during the day (from 2.9% to 2.0%) and significantly decreased at night (from 1.0% to 0.6%). The absence of recumbency during the day might indicate negative welfare and warrants further investigation. Overall, the Five Domains animal welfare model proved valuable in optimising feeding strategies that promote positive affective states like pleasure, gastrointestinal comfort and engagement, which led to increased positive welfare in giraffes after implementing the new feeding management regime. Round-the-clock observations and positive welfare indicators provide broader insights into giraffe welfare, highlighting potential for future zoo nutrition research.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, dementing, whole-body disorder that presents with decline in cognitive, behavioral, and emotional functions, as well as endocrine dysregulation. The etiology of AD is not fully understood but stress-and anxiety-related hormones may play a role in its development and trajectory. The glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis posits that levels of glucocorticoids increase with age, leading to dysregulated negative feedback, further elevated glucocorticoids, and resulting neuropathology. We examined the impact of age (from 2 to 10 months) and stressor exposure (predator odor) on hormone levels (corticosterone and ghrelin), anxiety-like behavior (open field and light dark tests), and memory-related behavior (novel object recognition; NOR), and whether these various measures correlated with neuropathology (hippocampus and cortex amyloid beta, A beta) in male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Additionally, we performed exploratory analyses to probe if the open field and light dark test as commonly used tasks to assess anxiety levels were correlated. Consistent with the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis, baseline corticosterone increased with age. Predator odor exposure elevated corticosterone at each age, but in contrast to the glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis, the magnitude of stressor-induced elevations in corticosterone levels did not increase with age. Overall, transgenic mice had higher post-stressor, but not baseline, corticosterone than non-transgenic mice, and across both genotypes, females consistently had higher (baseline and post-stressor) corticosterone than males. Behavior in the open field test primarily showed decreased locomotion with age, and this was pronounced in transgenic females. Anxiety-like behaviors in the light dark test were exacerbated following predator odor, and female transgenic mice were the most impacted. Compared to transgenic males, transgenic females had higher A beta concentrations and showed more anxiety-like behavior. Performance on the NOR did not differ significantly between genotypes. Lastly, we did not find robust, statistically significant correlations among corticosterone, ghrelin, recognition memory, anxiety-like behaviors, or A beta, suggesting outcomes are not strongly related on the individual level. Our data suggest that despite A beta accumulation in the hippocampus and cortex, male and female APPswePS1dE9 transgenic mice do not differ robustly from their non-transgenic littermates in physiological, endocrine, and behavioral measures at the range of ages studied here.

AB  - Retrotransposon Gag-like 4 (RTL4), a gene acquired from a retrovirus, is a causative gene in autism spectrum disorder. Its knockout mice exhibit increased impulsivity, impaired short-term spatial memory, failure to adapt to novel environments, and delayed noradrenaline (NA) recovery in the frontal cortex. However, due to its very low expression in the brain, it remains unknown which brain cells express RTL4 and its dynamics in relation to NA. We addressed these issues using knock-in mice carrying endogenous Rtl4 fused to Venus, which encodes a fluorescent protein. The RTL4-Venus fusion protein was detected as a secreted protein in the midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus and amygdala in the postnatal brain. Its signal intensity was high during critical periods of neonatal adaptation to novel environments. It was upregulated by various stimuli, including isoproterenol administration, whereas it was decreased by anesthesia but was maintained by milnacipran administration, suggesting its highly sensitive response to stressors, possible dependence on the arousal state and involvement in the NA reuptake process. In vitro mixed glial culture experiments demonstrated that Rtl4 is a microglial gene and suggested that RTL4 secretion responds rapidly to isoproterenol. Microglial RTL4 plays an important role in the NA response and possibly in the development of the NAergic neuronal network in the brain.

AB  - Despite recent advances in understanding how respiration affects neural signalling to influence perception, cognition, and behaviour, it is yet unclear to what extent breathing modulates brain oscillations at rest. We acquired respiration and resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from human participants to investigate if, where, and how respiration cyclically modulates oscillatory amplitudes (2 to 150 Hz). Using measures of phase-amplitude coupling, we show respiration-modulated brain oscillations (RMBOs) across all major frequency bands. Sources of these modulations spanned a widespread network of cortical and subcortical brain areas with distinct spectrotemporal modulation profiles. Globally, delta and gamma band modulations varied with distance to the head centre, with stronger modulations at distal (versus central) cortical sites. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive mapping of RMBOs across the entire brain, highlighting respiration-brain coupling as a fundamental mechanism to shape neural processing within canonical resting state and respiratory control networks (RCNs).

AB  - Vision provides the most important sensory information for spatial navigation. Recent technical advances allow new options to conduct more naturalistic experiments in virtual reality (VR) while additionally gathering data of the viewing behavior with eye tracking investigations. Here, we propose a method that allows one to quantify characteristics of visual behavior by using graph-theoretical measures to abstract eye tracking data recorded in a 3D virtual urban environment. The analysis is based on eye tracking data of 20 participants, who freely explored the virtual city Seahaven for 90 minutes with an immersive VR headset with an inbuild eye tracker. To extract what participants looked at, we defined "gaze" events, from which we created gaze graphs. On these, we applied graph-theoretical measures to reveal the underlying structure of visual attention. Applying graph partitioning, we found that our virtual environment could be treated as one coherent city. To investigate the importance of houses in the city, we applied the node degree centrality measure. Our results revealed that 10 houses had a node degree that exceeded consistently two-sigma distance from the mean node degree of all other houses. The importance of these houses was supported by the hierarchy index, which showed a clear hierarchical structure of the gaze graphs. As these high node degree houses fulfilled several characteristics of landmarks, we named them "gaze-graph-defined landmarks". Applying the rich club coefficient, we found that these gaze-graph-defined landmarks were preferentially connected to each other and that participants spend the majority of their experiment time in areas where at least two of those houses were visible. Our findings do not only provide new experimental evidence for the development of spatial knowledge, but also establish a new methodology to identify and assess the function of landmarks in spatial navigation based on eye tracking data.
   Author summary
   The ability to navigate and orient ourselves in an unknown environment is important in everyday life. To better understand how we are able to learn about a new environment, it is important to study our behavior during the process of spatial navigation. New technical advances allow us to conduct studies in naturalistic virtual environments with participants wearing immersive VR-headsets. In addition, we can use eye trackers to observe the participant's eye movements. This is interesting, because observing eye movements allows us to observe visual attention and, therefore, important cognitive processes. However, it can be difficult to analyze eye tracking data that was measured in a VR environment, as there is no established algorithm yet. Therefore, we propose a new method to analyze such eye tracking data. In addition, our method allows us to transform the eye tracking data into graphs which we can use to find new patterns in behavior that were not accessible before. Using this methodology, we found that participants who spend 90 min exploring a new virtual town, viewed some houses preferentially and we call them gaze-graph-defined landmarks. Our further analysis reveals also new characteristics of those houses that were not yet associated with landmarks.

AB  - Abuse and maltreatment have been associated with negative effects on the developing brain through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the body's central stress response system. Theoretically, similar pathophysiology occurs when children experience more moderate forms of stress (i.e., changing schools); however, evidence for this association is lacking. Therefore, the current study explored the effects of typical variations in stressful life events on the development of the hippocampus, a brain region susceptible to stress. Data from a 3-year accelerated longitudinal sample of 4- and 6-year-old children were used to assess the links between stressful events and the development of hippocampal subfield volumes (N total = 90) and functional connectivity (N total = 83). In the 4-year-old cohort, stressful experiences were related to an overall slower growth in CA1 and subiculum volume from age 5 to 6. In the 6-year-old cohort, stressful experiences were related to smaller CA2-4/DG volume at age 6 and an overall faster decrease in subiculum volume from age 6 to 7. Small effects were observed regarding the relations between stress and hippocampal functional connectivity; however, they did not survive multiple comparisons. Results from analyses comparing cohorts showed that the relations between stressful events and CA2-4/DG volume and change in subiculum volume significantly differed between the younger and older cohorts. Overall, these findings demonstrate the links between typical variations in stress and hippocampal development and highlight the region- and age-specific nature of the effects of stress. Together, this work emphasizes the importance of understanding how brain development may be influenced by stress in all forms, as stress-related alterations in hippocampal development have been linked to variations in cognitive processes (e.g., memory) and risk for psychopathology (e.g., major depressive disorder).

AB  - Background: Molecular mechanisms of depression remain unclear. The brain metabolome after antidepressant therapy is poorly understood and had not been performed for different routes of drug administration before the present study. Rats were exposed to chronic ultrasound stress and treated with intranasal and intraperitoneal clomipramine. We then analyzed 28 metabolites in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Methods: Rats' behavior was identified in such tests: social interaction, sucrose preference, forced swim, and Morris water maze. Metabolic analysis was performed with liquid chromatography. Results: After ultrasound stress pronounced depressive-like behavior, clomipramine had an equally antidepressant effect after intranasal and intraperitoneal administration on behavior. Ultrasound stress contributed to changes of the metabolomic pathways associated with pathophysiology of depression. Clomipramine affected global metabolome in frontal cortex and hippocampus in a different way that depended on the route of administration. Intranasal route was associated with more significant changes of metabolites composition in the frontal cortex compared to the control and ultrasound groups while the intraperitoneal route corresponded with more profound changes in hippocampal metabolome compared to other groups. Since far metabolic processes in the brain can change in many ways depending on different routes of administration, the antidepressant therapy should also be evaluated from this point of view.

AB  - Place and grid cells provide a neural system for self-location and tend to fire in sequences within each cycle of the hippocampal theta rhythm when rodents run on a linear track. These sequences correspond to the decoded location of the animal sweeping forward from its current location ("theta sweeps"). However, recent findings in open-field environments show alternating left-right theta sweeps and propose a circuit for their generation. Here, we present a computational model of this circuit, comprising theta-modulated head-direction cells, conjunctive grid 3 direction cells, and pure grid cells, based on continuous attractor dynamics, firing rate adaptation, and modulation by the medial-septal theta rhythm. Due to firing rate adaptation, the head-direction ring attractor exhibits left-right sweeps coding for internal direction, providing an input to the grid cell attractor network shifted along the internal direction, via an intermediate layer of conjunctive grid 3 direction cells, producing left-right sweeps of position by grid cells. Our model explains the empirical findings, including the alignment of internal position and direction sweeps and the dependence of sweep length on grid spacing. It makes predictions for theta-modulated head-direction cells, including relationships between theta phase precession during turning, theta skipping, anticipatory firing, and directional tuning width, several of which we verify in experimental data from anteroventral thalamus. The model also predicts relationships between position and direction sweeps, running speed, and dorsal-ventral location within the entorhinal cortex. Overall, a simple intrinsic mechanism explains the complex theta dynamics of an internal direction signal within the hippocampal formation, with testable predictions.

AB  - An analysis of the state of the art has shown how current European policy underpins the importance of assessing the impact of different energy efficiency strategies during the life cycle of buildings. In this study a framework is developed for the identification of the optimal material to be used to achieve the highest level of energy efficiency in building retrofits, taking into account environmental and economic elements and comparing different scenarios. For each of these scenarios the Life Cycle Cost Analysis was applied together with related environmental analysis in terms of the production of CO2. The research was applied to an industrial factory in Italy. Results showed that, among ten material with different origin, namely plant, animal, mineral and fossil origin, the optimal thickness varied between 0.023 m of the line fiber, and 0.082 m of the rock wool. From the economic point of view, saving was between 1.58 (sic)/m(2) with the linen fiber, and 9.63 (sic)/m(2) with the rock wool. Finally, considering the environmental aspect, savings in terms of CO2 was possible only for three of the ten materials, namely cork, sheep wool and fiber glass, respectively equal to 0.14 Kg/m(2), 0.65 Kg/m(2) and 0.34 Kg/m(2). The study has important implications mainly regarding the issue of energy efficiency. Specifically, the opportunity to analyse and compare economic and environmental aspects of a series of alternative materials to improve energy efficiency may provide stakeholders with calculated and objective input for the support of sustainable actions. Sum up, this research has identified a "result oriented" methodology comparing traditional and sustainable materials and measuring the benefits from the correct insulation of a building. These benefits are mainly of an economic and environmental nature and, in this regard, the study helps to strengthen the leadership of the EU for a sustainable use of natural resources within an efficient bioeconomy, essential to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory formation and storage processes. Dysregulated neuronal calcium (Ca2+) has been identified as one of the key pathogenic events in AD, and it has been suggested that pharmacological agents that stabilize Ca2+ neuronal signaling can act as disease-modifying agents in AD. In previous studies, we demonstrated that positive allosteric regulators (PAMs) of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump might act as such Ca2+-stabilizing agents and exhibit neuroprotective properties. In the present study, we evaluated effects of a set of novel SERCA PAM agents on the rate of Ca2+ extraction from the cytoplasm of the HEK293T cell line, on morphometric parameters of dendritic spines of primary hippocampal neurons in normal conditions and in conditions of amyloid toxicity, and on long-term potentiation in slices derived from 5xFAD transgenic mice modeling AD. Several SERCA PAM compounds demonstrated neuroprotective properties, and the compound NDC-9009 showed the best results. The findings in this study support the hypothesis that the SERCA pump is a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment and that NDC-9009 is a promising lead molecule to be used in the development of disease-modifying agents for AD.

AB  - Modic changes (MCs) and low back pain are highly correlated and an economic burden to the society. Previous studies have shown that Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) infection can lead to MCs. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether and how C. acnes contributes to oxidative stress and nerve growth that potentially leads to low back pain. Neurons from the hippocampus or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were cocultured with annulus fibrosus cells (AFCs) with or without the presence of the C. acnes supernatant in vitro. Cell viability, neurite length, oxidative stress, and neuro-related gene expression were examined. Furthermore, samples from the patients with MCs and SD rat model of MCs were used to validate the nerve growth results. Neurons from both the hippocampus and DRG showed neurites when cocultured with AFCs in the environment with/without the C. acnes supernatant. The average neurite length was significantly longer when exposed to the C. acnes supernatant in the hippocampal neuron (217.1 & PLUSMN;90.0 mu m versus 150.1 & PLUSMN;68.1 mu m in the control group) and in the DRG neuron (229.1 & PLUSMN;91.3 mu m versus 149.2 & PLUSMN;64.8 mu m in the control group). Hippocampal neurons showed upregulated expression levels of NeuN, Map2, and Psd95, while upregulation was only seen in Tuj-1 in DRG neurons. Suppressed oxidative stress could be observed using axon growth symbols. Degenerated disc structures and abnormal bone remodelling were found in animal models and clinical samples of MCs, with astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in the disc. Therefore, C. acnes infection was found to cause back pain in the presence of MCs by promoting nerve penetration into the annulus fibrosus by suppressing oxidative stress.

AB  - Effortful learning and practice are integral to academic attainment in areas like reading, language, and mathematics, shaping future career prospects, socioeconomic status, and health outcomes. However, academic learning outcomes often exhibit disparities, with initial cognitive advantages leading to further advantages (the Matthew effect). One of the areas in which learners frequently exhibit difficulties is mathematical learning. Neurobiological research has underscored the involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and the hippocampus in mathematical learning. However, their causal contributions remain unclear. Moreover, recent findings have highlighted the potential role of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in neuroplasticity and learning. To deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving mathematical learning, we employed a novel approach integrating double-blind excitatory neurostimulation-high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)-and examined its effect at the behavioral, functional, and neurochemical levels. During a 5-day mathematical learning paradigm (n = 72) active tRNS was applied over the dlPFC or the PPC, and we compared the effects versus sham tRNS. Individuals exhibiting stronger positive baseline frontoparietal connectivity demonstrated greater improvement in calculation learning. Subsequently, utilizing tRNS to modulate frontoparietal connectivity, we found that participants with weaker positive baseline frontoparietal connectivity, typically associated with poorer learning performance, experienced enhanced learning outcomes following dlPFC-tRNS only. Further analyses revealed that dlPFC-tRNS improved learning outcomes for participants who showed reductions in dlPFC GABA when it was accompanied by a reduced positive frontoparietal connectivity, but this effect was reversed for participants who showed increased positive frontoparietal connectivity. Our multimodal approach elucidates the causal role of the dlPFC and frontoparietal network in a critical academic learning skill, shedding light on the interplay between functional connectivity and GABAergic modulation in the efficacy of brain-based interventions to augment learning outcomes, particularly benefiting individuals who would learn less optimally based on their neurobiological profile.

AB  - This paper reports a comparative study on inks and pigments of nine old manuscripts belonging to the Algerian heritage. The manuscripts are held by Afniq n Ccix Lmuhib, one of the richest and best known private libraries from Kabylia region-Algeria. They date back from the 14th to the 19th century and treat disciplines ranging from astronomy to poetry. To identify the inks and pigments used by the scribes we applied several non-invasive techniques such as X-ray fluorescence, fiber optic reflectance and Raman spectroscopy. While XRF gives information about the elemental composition of pigments and inks, FORS and Raman analyses give the direct identification of the pigment. This synergy gives us a strong confidence in our identification even and allows to individuate critical cases on which deeper investigations should be done, as some results seems to contradict what is generally believed by art historians. In particular, we identified iron gall ink and ivory/bone black, while the black ink used in the Kabylia region is always reported to be made from burned sheep wool. Our work is the first case study that allows positive identification of inks and pigments used in Algerian manuscripts; interesting aspect, we could compare our findings are with manufacturing of pigments reported in a manuscript from the 17th century, held in the same library.

AB  - Cardiac arrest (CA) remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Cognitive deficits are common neurological sequelae among CA survivors. Preclinical and clinical studies have confirmed that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is an effective intervention for mitigating brain injury following CA. Hypothermia induces the expression of specific small proteins, including RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3), which provides neuroprotection under stress conditions. However, the role of RBM3 in TH after CA has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of RBM3 in attenuating cognitive deficits following hypothermic brain resuscitation. We constructed a rat model of CA and resuscitation, and used shRNA transfection to interfere with RBM3 expression to explore the underlying mechanisms of TH's effects on cognitive alterations. Rats were randomly assigned to one of five groups: sham group (Sham), CA group (CA), TH group (TH), adeno-associated virus (AAV)-shRNA-RBM3 transfection group (shRNA-RBM3), and AAV-shRNA-negative control transfection group (shRNA-control). Key synaptic regulatory proteins, dendritic spines, and synaptic ultrastructures were examined. The rats exhibited spatial learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze test and novel object recognition task. Hypothermia increased RBM3 expression in hippocampal neurons, mitigated early brain injury, preserved dendritic spine integrity and synaptic ultrastructure, upregulated key synaptic regulatory proteins, and ameliorated cognitive impairment following resuscitation. When RBM3 expression in the hippocampus was inhibited, the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia were partially reversed. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of hypothermia-induced neuroprotection, demonstrating that neuroplasticity and rehabilitation can be achieved following global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury after CA. Therefore, the RBM3-mediated cold shock pathway represents a potential target for enhancing neuroprotection and neurorehabilitation through hypothermia.

AB  - Physiological responses to inhaled anesthetics vary among species. Therefore, a precise anesthetic technique is important for each individual species. In this study, we focused on the degu (Octodon degus), a small herbivorous rodent. Degus have recently begun to be used as laboratory models for brain research because of certain human-like characteristics, such as spontaneous development of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we evaluated appropriate induction and maintenance anesthesia conditions for isoflurane and sevoflurane in degus by a stimulation test, electroencephalography (EEG), minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), and vital signs. During induction, more rapid time to loss of the righting reflex and deeper anesthesia in degus were observed in isoflurane. The MAC value for degus were 1.75 +/- 0.0% in isoflurane and 2.25 +/- 0.27% in sevoflurane. Whereas some degus were awake during maintenance anesthesia using both anesthetics at concentrations of <= 2%, no rats were awake when using sevoflurane at a concentration of 2%. The duration of the total flat EEG, a measure of the depth of maintenance anesthesia, was longer for isoflurane than for sevoflurane. Furthermore, higher concentrations of both anesthetics suppressed the respiratory rate in degus. These new findings regarding inhalation anesthesia in degus will contribute to future developments in the fields of laboratory animals and veterinary medicine.

AB  - Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are widely used in the biomedical field and can enter the central nervous system through the blood -brain barrier, causing damage to hippocampal neurons. However, the specific mechanism remains unclear. In this experiment, HT22 cells were selected as the experimental model in vitro, and the survival rate of cells under the action of SiNPs was detected by MTT method, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were tested by the kit, the ultrastructure of the cells was observed by transmission electron microscope, membrane potential (MMP), calcium ion (Ca2+) and apoptosis rate were measured by flow cytometry, and the expressions of mitochondrial functional protein, mitochondrial dynein, mitochondrial autophagy protein as well as apoptosis related protein were detected by Western blot. The results showed that cell survival rate, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, ATP and MMP gradually decreased with the increase of SiNPs concentration, while intracellular ROS, Ca2+, LDH and apoptosis rate increased with the increase of SiNPs concentration. In total cellular proteins,the expressions of mitochondrial functional proteins VDAC and UCP2 gradually increased, the expression of mitochondrial dynamic related protein DRP1 increased while the expressions of OPA1 and Mfn2 decreased. The expressions of mitophagy related proteins PINK1, Parkin and LC3II/LC3I increased and P62 gradually decreased, as well as the expressions of apoptosis related proteins Apaf-1, CleavedCaspase-3, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Bax and Cyt-C. In mitochondrial proteins, the expressions of mitochondrial dynamic related proteins DRP1 and p-DRP1 were increased, while the expressions of OPA1 and Mfn2 were decreased. Expressions of mitochondrial autophagy associated proteins PINK1, Parkin, LC3II/LC3I increased, P62 decreased gradually, as well as the expressions of apoptosis related proteins Cleaved-Caspase-3, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 increased, and Cyt-C expressions decreased. To further demonstrate the role of ROS and DRP1 in HT22 cell apoptosis induced by SiNPs, we selected the ROS inhibitor N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and Dynaminrelated protein 1 (DRP1) inhibitor Mdivi-1. The experimental results indicated that the above effects were remarkably improved after the use of inhibitors, further confirming that SiNPs induce the production of ROS in cells, activate DRP1, cause excessive mitochondrial division, induce mitophagy, destroy mitochondrial function and eventually lead to apoptosis.

AB  - Ensuring an adequate supply of feedstock is a key challenge to achieving a significant production volume of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). One promising feedstock for SAFs is intermediate winter oilseeds added to existing crop production as alternatives to the winter fallow period. In this work, three intermediate winter oilseed crops & horbar;camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz.), carinata (Brassica carinata), and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.)& horbar;are evaluated for their life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when harvested and processed into hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ). We evaluate solvent extraction (SE) and mechanical pressing as alternative oil extraction methods and examine the impacts of various allocation methods used in the oil extraction process. The GHG emissions reduction potential of camelina-, carinata-, and pennycress-derived HRJs are 50.4%, 65.2%, and 65.7%, respectively, compared to petroleum jet fuel, with SE as an oil extraction method and under mass-based allocation. Combined with the estimated production potential of camelina, carinata, and pennycress as intermediate winter oilseed, 2.5 billion gallons of HRJ can be produced annually, and the total GHG savings could amount to 19.3 million tons when these HRJs replace petroleum jet fuels. In addition, we collect literature information to assess the impacts of these intermediate winter oilseeds on indirect land use change emissions and soil organic carbon sequestration potentials.

AB  - Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a biological process in which the precise order and timing of neuronal spikes affect the degree of synaptic modification. While there has been numerous research focusing on the role of STDP in neural coding, the functional implications of STDP at the macroscopic level in the brain have not been fully explored yet. In this work, we propose a neurodynamical model based on STDP that renders storage and retrieval of a group of associative memories. We showed that the function of STDP at the macroscopic level is to form a "memory plane" in the neural state space which dynamically encodes high dimensional data. We derived the analytic relation between the input, the memory plane, and the induced macroscopic neural oscillations around the memory plane. Such plane produces a limit cycle in reaction to a similar memory cue, which can be used for retrieval of the original input.

We have recently discovered that GSTM1 promotes the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by astrocytes and enhances microglial activation during acute brain inflammation. Here we report that GSTM1 significantly affects TNF-alpha-dependent transcriptional program in astrocytes and modulates neuronal activities and stress during brain inflammation. We have found that a reduced expression of GSTM1 in astrocytes downregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes while upregulating the expression of genes involved in interferon responses and fatty acid metabolism. Our data also revealed that GSTM1 reduction in astrocytes increased neuronal stress levels, attenuating neuronal activities during LPS-induced brain inflammation. Furthermore, we found that GSTM1 expression increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of aging mice. Thus, this study has further advanced our understanding of the role of Glutathione S-transferases in astrocytes during brain inflammation and paved the way for future studies to determine the critical role of GSTM1 in reactive astrocyte responses in inflammation and aging.

AB  - Galanin neuropeptide is distributed throughout the mammalian nervous system modulating a plethora of diverse physiological functions, including nociception, cognition and neuroendocrine regulation. The regulation of the galaninergic system is an interesting approach for the treatment of different diseases associated to those systems. Nevertheless, the pharmacological selectivity and activities of some galanin receptor (GalR) ligands are still in discussion and seem to depend on the dose, the receptor subtype and the second messengers to which they are coupled at different brain areas. The activity of different GalR ligands on Gi/o proteins, was evaluated by the guanosine 5 '-(gamma-[35S]thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTP gamma S) autoradiography in vitro assay applied to rat brain tissue slices in the presence of galanin, M15, M35, M40, gal(2-11) or galnon. The enhancement of the [35S]GTP gamma S binding induced by the chimerical peptides M15, M35 and M40 was similar to that produced by Gal in those brain areas showing the highest stimulations, such as dorsal part of the olfactory nucleus and ventral subiculum. In contrast to these peptides, using gal(2-11) no effect was measured on Gi/o protein coupling in areas of the rat brain with high GalR1 density such as posterior hypothalamic nucleus and amygdala, indicating low selectivity for GalR1 receptors. The effects evoked by the non-peptide ligand, galnon, were different from those induced by galanin, behaving as agonist or antagonist depending on the brain area, but the stimulations were always blocked by M35. Thus, the activity of most used GalR ligands on Gi/o protein mediated signalling is complex and depends on the brain area. More selective and potent GalR ligands are necessary to develop new treatments aimed to modulate the galaninergic system.

AB  - The thyroid hormones (THs) are proposed as putative regulators of immune system maturation in developing teleost fish. To gain insight into this process the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) that has a well-characterized TH-driven metamorphosis was used. Differential gene expression analysis was performed across developmental stages (n = 3 per stage): pre-metamorphosis, onset of metamorphosis, metamorphosis, early climax, climax, and post-metamorphic juveniles. Metamorphosis is a massive gene-oriented developmental process, involving the differential expression of 8145 genes. Clustering analysis was used to identify immune-related genes with similar expression patterns to hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis-related genes. TH-regulated candidate immune genes were identified (133) and analysis of their promoter region revealed 84 contained putative TH receptor (TR) binding sites (TREs). Two consensus TRE sequences were identified in the candidate genes, 5 '-ntgnGntCacan (exclusive to TR alpha), and 5 '-nnntGgtCannn (common to both TRs). TR alpha-exclusive TREs were less common than those that bound interchangeably TR alpha and TR beta. In the promoter region, TR alpha-exclusive TREs were always accompanied by the pan-TRE consensus sequence, never occurring independently.

AB  - Salivary cortisol assay is an effective method to quantify free cortisol levels, track diurnal patterns and measure acute hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal activation in response to acute stressors. This study examined salivary cortisol and behaviour in three African elephants Loxodonta africana. Salivary cortisol was within normal ranges for this species, declined across the day and responded to a mild social stressor. The relationship between salivary cortisol and stereotypic swaying in two of the elephants was also examined. Swaying was significantly associated with decreased cortisol values in one of the two elephants, indicating this stereotypy may function to reduce arousal, but also emphasising the complicated relationship between physiology and behaviour. This is the first study to demonstrate that swaying reduces salivary cortisol concentrations in some elephants. The opportunities this finding presents for future research and the complex relationship between physiology and behaviour are discussed.

AB  - The abdominal testes of Asian elephants show normal spermatogenesis. Heat shock in cryptorchid testes elevates heat shock factor (HSF) expression, leading to germ cell apoptosis, while increased heat shock proteins (HSPs) levels provide protection. To investigate how heat shock affects elephant spermatogenic cells, focusing on heat shock-related molecules and the cell death mechanism, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining were employed to assess the immunoexpression of several heat shock-related molecules and the status of apoptosis in elephant fibroblasts (EF) induced by heat shock stimulus. Additionally, the immunoexpression of heat shock-related molecules and cell proliferation status in the elephant spermatogenic cells. Our finding indicated that heat shock-induced HSF1 immunoexpression in EF leads to apoptosis mediated by T-cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51) while also upregulating HSP70 to protect damaged cells. In elephant spermatogenic cells, immunostaining revealed a predominance of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells with minimal TDAG51- and TUNEL-positive cells, suggesting active proliferation and apoptosis suppression during normal spermatogenesis in the abdominal testis. Interestingly, spermatogonia co-immunoexpressed HSF1 and HSP90, potentially reducing apoptosis through protective mechanisms different from those observed in other mammals. Spermatogenic cells did not show immunolocalisation of HSP70, and hence, it may not contribute to protecting the spermatogonia from heat shock because the transcriptional activity of HSF1 is suppressed by HSP90A binding. This study provides insight into the specific heat shock response and defence mechanisms in elephant spermatogenic cells and may contribute to our understanding of species-specific adaptation to environmental stresses of the testis.

AB  - The processes that determine the establishment of the complex morphology of neurons during development are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the question how a difference in the length of neurites affects vesicle transport. We performed live imaging experiments and present a lattice-based model to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of intracellular transport in neurons. After a motivation and appropriate scaling of the model we present numerical simulations showing that initial differences in neurite length result in phenomena of biological relevance, i.e. a positive feedback that enhances transport into the longer neurite and oscillation of vesicles concentrations that can be interpreted as cycles of extension and retraction observed in experiments. Thus, our model is a first step towards a better understanding of the interplay between the transport of vesicles and the spatial organization of cells.

AB  - We aimed to explore microRNA (miR)-320's impacts on learning and memory in mice with vascular cognitive impairment induced via cerebral ischemia. After establishment of a cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) cognitive impairment model, application of corresponding treatment methods was in the model mice to inject miR-320 antagomir/agomir and their negative controls to the lateral ventricles: Test of the learning and memory abilities of mice was conducted; Detection of oxidative stress, inflammation, miR-320, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin (ES) was implemented; Taking mouse hippocampal neuron cells was to detect the cell advancement. MiR-320 was elevated in the CSVD model; MiR-320 was negatively linked with the learning and memory abilities of mice; Repressing miR-320 was available to memorably elevate the learning and memory abilities of CSVD mice; Depressing miR-320 clearly drove CSVD mouse neovascular protein VEGF, but reduced inflammation, oxidative stress response and ES; Restraining miR-320 was available to contribute to mouse neuronal cell advancement. MiR-320 mitigates the learning and memory abilities of cerebral ischemia-induced vascular cognitive dysfunction mice to a certain extent. Copyright: (c) 2023 by the C.M.B. Association.

AB  - Deletion of the autism-related gene, Chd8, in mice alters the expression of activity-dependent genes in postmitotic neurons, but does not affect seizure susceptibility or memory formation
   CHD8 encodes chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 and its mutation is a highly penetrant risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). CHD8 serves as a key transcriptional regulator on the basis of its chromatin-remodeling activity and thereby controls the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. However, the function of CHD8 in postmitotic neurons and the adult brain has remained unclear. Here we show that Chd8 homozygous deletion in mouse postmitotic neurons results in downregulation of the expression of neuronal genes as well as alters the expression of activity-dependent genes induced by KCl-mediated neuronal depolarization. Furthermore, homozygous ablation of CHD8 in adult mice was associated with attenuation of activity-dependent transcriptional responses in the hippocampus to kainic acid-induced seizures. Our findings implicate CHD8 in transcriptional regulation in postmitotic neurons and the adult brain, and they suggest that disruption of this function might contribute to ASD pathogenesis associated with CHD8 haploinsufficiency.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has a low antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment response rate, and about 70% of patients eventually progress to refractory epilepsy. Perampanel (PER) is a noncompetitive a-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, which is used clinically for the treatment of partially refractory epilepsy, but its mechanism of action is not completely clear. In this study, kainic acid (KA) was successfully used to induce TLE in 3-week-old C57BL/6 immature mice, and the effects of PER on the cognitive behavior of the epileptic mice were characterized using the Morris water maze paradigm. To determine the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of PER, the morphological evolution of the hippocampus and the expression of AP-1 and GluR1 were systematically evaluated. Compared to control TLE mice, escape latency was reduced and the number of target platform crossings was increased in the Morris water maze by treatment with PER. The therapeutic effects of PER were mediated mainly via inhibition of the expression of AP-1 and GluR1, as the TLE mice showed significantly improved learning and memory and decreased seizure frequency after treatment with PER.

AB  - Melatonin has antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-aging effects in the brain. Sirtuin2 (SIRT2) accumulates in the central nervous system with aging, and its inhibition appears to be protective in aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Forkhead Box-class O3a (FOXO3a) transcription factor is one of the main targets of SIRT2, and SIRT2-mediated FOXO3a deacetylation is closely related to aging, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin on SIRT2 and FOXO3a expressions in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of aged rats. Young (3 months, n = 18) and aged (22 months, n = 18) male Wistar rats were divided into control (4% DMSO-PBS, sc, for 21 days), melatonin (10 mg/kg, sc, for 21 days) and salermide (1 mM; 25 mu l/100 g bw, ip, for 21 days) groups. SIRT2, FOXO3a, Bcl-2, Bax and Bim expressions in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were demonstrated by Western blotting. SIRT2 and FOXO3a protein levels were also measured by a sandwich ELISA method. Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated by measuring total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS). Aging increased SIRT2, FOXO3a, Bim (only in the cerebral cortex), Bax (only in the hippocampus), TOS, and OSI, while decreasing Bcl-2, Bcl-2/Bax and TAS in both brain regions. Melatonin decreased SIRT2, FOXO3a, oxidative stress parameters and pro-apoptotic proteins, while increasing TAS, Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax, more specifically in the hippocampus of the aged brain. Our results indicate that inhibition of SIRT2 and FOXO3a expressions appears to be involved in the protective effects of melatonin in the hippocampus of aged rats.

AB  - Humans and mice have the ability to regenerate the distal digit tip, the terminal phalanx (P3) in response to amputation. What distinguishes P3 regeneration from regenerative failure is formation of the blastema, a proliferative structure that undergoes morphogenesis to regenerate the amputated tissues. P3 regeneration is characterised by the phases of inflammation, tissue histolysis and expansive bone degradation with simultaneous blastema formation, wound closure and finally blastemal differentiation to restore the amputated structures. While each regenerating digit faithfully progresses through all phases of regeneration, phase progression has traditionally been delineated by time, that is, days postamputation (DPA), yet there is widespread variability in the timing of the individual phases. To diminish variability between digits during tissue histolysis and blastema formation, we have established an in-vivo method using microcomputed tomography (micro CT) scanning to identify five distinct stages of the early regeneration response based on anatomical changes of the digit stump. We report that categorising the initial phases of digit regeneration by stage rather than time greatly diminishes the variability between digits with respect to changes in bone volume and length. Also, stages correlate with the levels of cell proliferation, osteoclast recruitment and osteoprogenitor cell recruitment. Importantly, micro CT staging provides a means to estimate open versus closed digit wounds. We demonstrate two spatially distinct and stage specific bone repair/regeneration responses that occur during P3 regeneration. Collectively, these studies showcase the utility of micro CT imaging to infer the composition of radiolucent soft tissues during P3 blastema formation. Specifically, the staging system identifies the onset of cell proliferation, osteoclastogenesis, osteoprogenitor recruitment, the spatial initiation of de novo bone formation and epidermal closure.

AB  - Aging is the most common cause of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The pathological hallmarks of age-dependent neuropathology consist of chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, gliosis, learning disability, and cognitive decline. A novel hydrolyzed bioactive peptide mixture extracted from chicken meat, that is, hydrolyzed chicken extract (HCE) has been previously demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects in rodents and humans. However, the mechanism of HCE on age-related neurological disorders remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to clarify the impact and mechanism of isolated bioactive components (BCs) from HCE on age-dependent neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in middle-aged mice. We found that both BC and HCE supplementation ameliorated age-induced memory loss, alleviated hippocampal neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, followed by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. BC and HCE treatment also ameliorated age-dependent morphological anomalies and alleviated microgliosis and astrogliosis. In parallel, BC and HCE treatment showed a significant decrease in the NF-kappa B p65 and p38 MAPK signaling, which were associated with the enhancement of antioxidative enzymes activities. Furthermore, BC treatment attenuated the neuroinflammatory phenotypes by the decrease in M1-polarized microglia and the increase in M2-polarized microglia in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we found that cyclo(Phe-Phe), one of the cyclopeptides purified from BC, showed notable anti-inflammatory effects in BV2 cells. Taken together, BC might be used as a dietary supplement for alleviating age-dependent neuropathology in middle-aged individuals.

AB  - Background: Huang-Pu-Tong-Qiao formula (HPTQ), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has a variety of pharmacological effects. It has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) for decades. This study aimed to screen differentially expressed proteins in the hippocampus of AD model rats treated with HPTQ. Proteomic studies of the effects of HPTQ on AD are key to understanding the therapeutic mechanisms of HPTQ and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Methods: We hence used the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (ITRAQ) approach to investigate the differentially expressed proteins in the hippocampus of AD model rats before and after HPTQ administration and to identify the potential therapeutic target proteins of HPTQ. In this study, the learning and memory abilities of AD rats were examined by the Morris water maze test. After HPTQ administration, the differentially expressed proteins in the hippocampus of AD rats were quantified and analyzed in silico. Furthermore, western blotting was used to verify the expression of related proteins. Results: The Morris water maze results showed that HPTQ could improve the learning and memory ability of AD model rats. The proteomics analysis results showed that 57 proteins were differentially expressed, of which 35 were up-regulated and 22 were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins with altered expression after HPTQ treatment were involved in several biological processes that have the potential to exert neuroprotective effects. These included promoting the translation of ribosomes, improving the deposition of amyloid-beta (A beta), regulating autophagy, regulating neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, and alleviating oxidative stress. Conclusion: In conclusion, we identified several potential therapeutic target proteins and related mechanistic pathways of HPTQ in the treatment of AD, laying the foundation for further investigation of the therapeutic effects of HPTQ.

AB  - Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations collectively managed by ex-situ facilities accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) face sustainability challenges. Among the priorities to strengthen animal wellbeing and population sustainability is male elephant management. We conducted a survey of AZA facilities currently housing male elephants to assess the status, challenges, and priorities in three areas of male elephant management: musth, socialization, and semen collection. Surveys were administered to elephant care teams at AZA-accredited institutions between November 2022 and February 2023, and we received responses from 34 institutions (91.9% of AZA-accredited facilities holding adult male elephants), housing 32 adult male Asians and 26 adult male Africans. Most facilities prioritized breeding and male socialization over musth management and semen collection (although most facilities acknowledged that all these efforts are important), citing leadership support and staffing as most important to achieve male management goals. Behaviors most commonly accompanying musth included reduced appetite, difficulty training or shifting, human-directed aggression, and interest in females. Musth timing was variable between males and facilities. Most males were well-socialized with females and/or other males, though elephant compatibility and facility design were limiting factors in managing socialization. Although 60.6% of facilities collected semen or were training for semen collection, very few male elephants could reliably provide viable semen samples, challenging assisted reproductive efforts that could bolster population sustainability in both species. Together, our results provide a better understanding of the state of male elephant management, offering specific areas deserving of research and development to enhance wellbeing and sustainability.
   Our survey of male elephant management across AZA-accredited facilities revealed variation in practices related to musth, socialization, and semen collection, indicating areas for further capacity building. image
   We surveyed 34 AZA institutions to measure status, priorities, and challenges of major components of male elephant management (musth, socialization, and semen collection). Musth management and socialization practices widely varied between institutions, and additional research is needed to characterize implications of this variation for wellbeing and sustainability. Further capacity building is needed to enhance semen collection efforts at the population level.

AB  - Oxudercine gobies show not only a full spectrum of habitat transition from water to land, but also varying feeding habits from herbivory to carnivory. In this study, we compared the anatomy of the feeding apparatus of five oxudercine gobies, Boleophthalmus boddarti (moderately terrestrial, herbivorous), Oxuderces nexipinnis (nearly aquatic, herbivorous), Scartelaos histophorus (moderately terrestrial, omnivorous), Periophthalmus chrysospilos (highly terrestrial, carnivorous), and Periophthalmodon schlosseri (highly terrestrial, carnivorous), collected from a mudflat in Vietnam. B. boddarti and O. nexipinnis are characterized by a horizontal disposition of the dentary teeth, more densely spaced gill rakers on the posterior row of the third arch and both rows of the fourth arch, and large, ventrally curved pharyngeal plates bearing numerous fine teeth. Ps. chrysospilos and Pn. schlosseri have oral jaw bones with jaw-levers producing a greater biting force, rudimentary gill rakers, and pharyngeal plates studded with robust canine teeth. On the underside of the ventral plates, prominent ridges occur, onto which strong muscles attach. The jaw adductors are larger in these carnivorous mudskippers. S. histophorus shows an anatomical architecture which may be considered intermediate between these herbivorous and carnivorous species. On the basis of currently accepted relationships of oxudercine genera, their feeding habits, and the morphology of the feeding apparatus, we hypothesize that the oxudercine gobies had been adapted to feeding microalgae in shallow water before expanding their niche onto land, and subsequently diverged to more specialized herbivorous (Boleophthalmus) and carnivorous groups (Periophthalmus and Periophthalmodon) feeding in higher intertidal habitats.

AB  - Background Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is a kidney-specific autoimmune disease. Human embryonic stem cells-derived immunity-and-matrix regulatory cells (hESC-IMRCs) have immunoregulatory functions. We hypothesized that hESC-IMRCs might have therapeutic effects on MN and be a potential treatment in clinical practice. Methods Rats of Heymann nephritis were injected with sheep anti-rat Fx1A serum. hESC-IMRCs were intravenously administrated upon the detection of proteinuria, with 6 x 10(6) cells (high-dose) or 3 x 10(6) cells (low-dose) in 1 ml every other day. Splenocytes and IMRCs were co-cultured at different times and ratios. Cell types and cytokines were detected by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The urinary protein of rats with Heymann nephritis was reduced remarkably to a level comparable to negative controls, in both low-dose (45.6 vs. 282.3 mg/d, P < 0.001) and high-dose (35.2 vs. 282.3 mg/d, P < 0.001) hESC-IMRC treatment groups. IgG and C3 deposit, glomerular basement membrane thickness and foot process effacement were alleviated and the reduced podocin was recovered in the kidneys. The proportions of CD4 + CD25 + T cells in circulation and spleen were increased, and the circulating level of IL-10 was increased, after IMRC interventions. IL-17 and TNF-alpha were reduced after IMRCs treatments. IL-10 increased remarkably in the co-culture supernatant of lymphocytes and IMRCs at 48 h with ratio 10:1. Conclusions The intravenously delivered hESC-IMRCs alleviated proteinuria and kidney injuries of Heymann nephritis, by their immunosuppressive functions through regulatory T cells and IL-10. These pre-clinical results indicate that IMRCs worth careful consideration for human trials in the treatment of MN.

AB  - Background Maturation is a process that allows synapses to acquire full functionality, optimizing their activity to diverse neural circuits, and defects in synaptic maturation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuroligin-1 (NL1) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule essential for synapse maturation, a role typically attributed to binding to pre-synaptic ligands, the neurexins. However, the pathways underlying the action of NL1 in synaptic maturation are incompletely understood, and some of its previously observed effects seem reminiscent of those described for the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we show that maturational increases in active zone stability and synaptic vesicle recycling rely on the joint action of NL1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Results Applying BDNF to hippocampal neurons in primary cultures or organotypical slice cultures mimicked the effects of overexpressing NL1 on both structural and functional maturation. Overexpressing a NL1 mutant deficient in neurexin binding still induced presynaptic maturation. Like NL1, BDNF increased synaptic vesicle recycling and the augmentation of transmitter release by phorbol esters, both hallmarks of presynaptic maturation. Mimicking the effects of NL1, BDNF also increased the half-life of the active zone marker bassoon at synapses, reflecting increased active zone stability. Overexpressing NL1 increased the expression and synaptic accumulation of BDNF. Inhibiting BDNF signaling pharmacologically or genetically prevented the effects of NL1 on presynaptic maturation. Applying BDNF to NL1-knockout mouse cultures rescued defective presynaptic maturation, indicating that BDNF acts downstream of NL1 and can restore presynaptic maturation at late stages of network development. Conclusions Our data introduce BDNF as a novel and essential component in a transsynaptic pathway linking NL1-mediated cell adhesion, neurotrophin action, and presynaptic maturation. Our findings connect synaptic cell adhesion and neurotrophin signaling and may provide a therapeutic approach to neurodevelopmental disorders by targeting synapse maturation.

AB  - The cellular functions of lipids in the neuronal plasma membranes have been increasingly acknowledged, particularly their association to neuronal processes and synaptic plasticity. However, the knowledge of their regulatory mechanisms in neuronal cells remains sparse. To address this, we investigated the lipid organization of the plasma membranes of hippocampal neurons in relation to neuronal activity using secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging. The neurons were treated with drugs, particularly tetrodotoxin (TTX) and bicuculline (BIC), to induce chronic activation and silencing. Distinct lipid organization was found in the plasma membrane of the cell body and the neurites. Moreover, significant alterations of the levels of the membrane lipids, especially ceramides, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidic acids, and triacylglycerols, were observed under the TTX and BIC treatments. We suggest that many types of membrane lipids are affected by, and may be involved in, the regulation of neuronal function.

AB  - Background The impact of acrylamide (ACR) on learning and memory has garnered considerable attention. However, the targets and mechanisms are still unclear. Results Elongation factor 2 (eEF2) was significantly upregulated in the results of serum proteomics. Results from in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated a notable upregulation of Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), the sole kinase responsible for eEF2 phosphorylation, following exposure to ACR (P < 0.05). Subsequent in vitro experiments using eEF2K siRNA and in vivo experiments with eEF2K-knockout mice demonstrated significant improvements in abnormal indicators related to ACR-induced learning and memory deficits (P < 0.05). Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed Lpcat1 as a crucial downstream protein regulated by eEF2K. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses indicated that eEF2K may play a role in the process of ACR-induced learning and memory impairment by affecting ether lipid metabolism. Conclusions In summary, eEF2K as a pivotal treatment target in the mechanisms underlying ACR-induced learning and memory impairment, and studies have shown that it provides robust evidence for potential clinical interventions targeting ACR-induced impairments.

AB  - Cell proliferation is a central process in tissue development, homeostasis, and disease, yet how proliferation is regulated in the tissue context remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a quantitative framework to elucidate how tissue growth dynamics regulate cell proliferation. Using MDCK epithelial monolayers, we show that a limiting rate of tissue expansion creates confinement that suppresses cell growth; however, this confinement does not directly affect the cell cycle. This leads to uncoupling between rates of cell growth and division in epithelia and, thereby, reduces cell volume. Division becomes arrested at a minimal cell volume, which is consistent across diverse epithelia in vivo. Here, the nucleus approaches the minimum volume capable of packaging the genome. Loss of cyclin D1-dependent cell-volume regulation results in an abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio and DNA damage. Overall, we demonstrate how epithelial proliferation is regulated by the interplay between tissue confinement and cell-volume regulation.

AB  - Understanding how genetically encoded rules drive and guide complex neuronal growth processes is essential to comprehending the brain's architecture, and agent-based models (ABMs) offer a powerful simulation approach to further develop this understanding. However, accurately calibrating these models remains a challenge. Here, we present a novel application of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to address this issue. ABMs are based on parametrized stochastic rules that describe the time evolution of small components-the so-called agents-discretizing the system, leading to stochastic simulations that require appropriate treatment. Mathematically, the calibration defines a stochastic inverse problem. We propose to address it in a Bayesian setting using ABC. We facilitate the repeated comparison between data and simulations by quantifying the morphological information of single neurons with so-called morphometrics and resort to statistical distances to measure discrepancies between populations thereof. We conduct experiments on synthetic as well as experimental data. We find that ABC utilizing Sequential Monte Carlo sampling and the Wasserstein distance finds accurate posterior parameter distributions for representative ABMs. We further demonstrate that these ABMs capture specific features of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (CA1). Overall, this work establishes a robust framework for calibrating agent-based neuronal growth models and opens the door for future investigations using Bayesian techniques for model building, verification, and adequacy assessment.

AB  - Enteric methane (CH4) represents about half of the climatic footprint of milk production in Finland. Methane is generated from the surplus hydrogen produced during the anaerobic feed digestion process in the rumen. Methane intensity per liter of energy corrected milk (g CH4 kg-1 ECM) is a function of the number of cows, milk yield (MY), replacement rate (RR), and the diet composition. This study aimed to model and report the inventory of CH4 from milk production in Finland between 1960 and 2020. Furthermore, we report the potential future scenarios of CH4 mitigation strategies based on the further development in MY and feed efficiency with constant or changing BW of cows. The diet composition of cattle was formulated for 5-year periods according to feed consumption statistics and the current metabolizable energy (ME) requirements for dairy cattle. The CH4 production from cattle was simulated using the formulated diets with the Nordic dairy cow model Karoline. The future CH4 mitigation scenarios of increased MY and improved feed efficiency were simulated using Lypsikki?? dairy farm model. During the inventory period, the number of cows (1000) decreased from 1150 to less than 258, and MY increased three-fold. The total milk and CH4 production peaked in 1965 being 3650 and 110 million kg per year and decreased to 2300 and 48 million kg per year in 2020, respectively. Consequently, decreased number of cows and increased MY reduced the total CH4 production by 56%. In addition, CH4 intensity improved by 36% during the inventory period. Of the future scenarios, increased MY and improved feed efficiency had a substantial potential to improve CH4 intensity. In both scenarios maintaining the current BW of cows resulted in higher mitigation potential. We conclude that selecting more efficient animals has a significant CH4 mitigation potential.

Exogenous application of silicon in form of DAE (diatomaceous earth) at 0.5 to 2.5 g kg(-1) and RHA (rice husk ash) at 5.0 to 15.0 g kg(-1) soil significantly improved silicon uptake and reduced borer damage in both susceptible (TN1) and moderately resistant (GNR3) rice cultivars exhibiting the enhanced resistance against S. incertulas with a yield benefit to the tune of 1.91- fold over control. Si addition through DAE at 2.0 g kg(-1) soil registered a maximum of 1.55 and 2.27- fold increased Si uptake by TN1 and GNR3 plants respectively as against a corresponding increase of 2.37 and 2.24-fold by 12.5 g RHA kg(-1) soil. Chlorophyll was highest in plants receiving low dose of silicon and showed a downward trend with increase in dose. Feeding stimuli from S.incertulas larvae led to intense leaf silicificationly with significant increased silica cell deposit per mm row length, increased lobe size, and minimal distance between adjacent silica cells as evidenced from scanning electron microscopic studies. Increased Si content along with biotic stress activated antioxidant enzyme (super oxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidise) defense in rice to mitigate oxidative stress. RHA supplemented plants with YSB infestation showed increased activity of the non-oxidative enzymes like phenylalanine lyase (3.5- fold) and tyrosine ammonia lyase (13.0 -fold) over control conferring a greater defense to paddy through induction of signal transduction process. The study thus, demonstrated the benefit of soil amendment with DAE and RHA in inducing host resistance against S. incertulas, as an eco-holistic approach in pest management in rice. Further, the finding is expected to be helpful in genetic mapping of known YSB resistance gene markers of candidate genes like hexose transporter, amino acid transporter and other genes related to defense signal mechanisms via jasmonic acid pathway.

AB  - Chronic stress is associated with anxiety and cognitive impairment. Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice induces anxiety-like behavior driven by microglia and the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the brain. Nonetheless, it is unclear how microglia communicate with other cells to modulate the physiological and behavioral responses to stress. Using single-cell (sc)RNAseq, we identify novel, to the best of our knowledge, stress-associated microglia in the hippocampus defined by RNA profiles of cytokine/chemokine signaling, cellular stress, and phagocytosis. Microglia depletion with a CSF1R antagonist (PLX5622) attenuates the stress-associated profile of leukocytes, endothelia, and astrocytes. Furthermore, RSD-induced social withdrawal and cognitive impairment are microglia-dependent, but social avoidance is microglia-independent. Furthermore, single-nuclei (sn)RNAseq shows robust responses to RSD in hippocampal neurons that are both microglia-dependent and independent. Notably, stress-induced CREB, oxytocin, and glutamatergic signaling in neurons are microglia-dependent. Collectively, these stress-associated microglia influence transcriptional profiles in the hippocampus related to social and cognitive deficits.
   Single-cell transcriptomics reveal that RSD induces novel stress-associated microglia affects astrocyte and endothelial cell functions, as well as social and short-term spatial memory.

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) pose a significant risk to global health, impacting millions of individuals globally. These infections have increased rates of morbidity and mortality due to the prevalence of widespread antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Graphene-based nanoparticles (GBNs) are known to possess extensive antimicrobial properties by inflicting damage to the cell membrane, suppressing virulence, and inhibiting microbial biofilms. Developing alternative therapies for HAIs and addressing AMR can be made easier and more affordable by combining nanoparticles with medicinal plants harboring antimicrobial properties. Hence, this study was undertaken to develop a novel graphene-silver nanocomposite via green synthesis using Trillium govanianum plant extract as a reducing agent. The resulting nanocomposite comprised silver nanoparticles embedded in graphene sheets. The antibacterial and antifungal properties of graphene-silver nanocomposites were investigated against several nosocomial pathogens, namely, Candida auris, Candida glabrata, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The nanocomposite displayed broad-range antimicrobial potential against the test pathogens, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging between 31.25 and 125.0 mu g/mL, and biofilm inhibition up to 80-96%. Moreover, nanocomposite-functionalized urinary catheters demonstrated hemocompatibility towards sheep erythrocytes and imparted anti-fouling activity to the biomaterial, while also displaying biocompatibility towards HEK 293 cells. Collectively, this investigation highlights the possible application of green-synthesized GBNs as an effective alternative to conventional antibiotics for combating multidrug-resistant pathogens.

AB  - Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) represents the most prevalent complication of stroke and has been reported to be associated with an imbalance in the gut microbiota. Clinically, Xiaoyaosan (XYS) alleviates depressive symptoms in patients with PSD. However, the existing literature does not provide sufficient evidence to ascertain whether XYS can alleviate these symptoms by modulating gut microbiota. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the potential mechanism of XYS to improve depression-like behavior in mice with PSD by regulating intestinal flora and microbial metabolism. Study design: The authors assessed the effect of XYS on the behaviour of PSD mice and evaluated the effects of XYS on structure and metabolism of gut microbiota, the protein expression levels of P2X7 and NLRP3, and associated inflammatory factors in PSD mice. In addition, by performing faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on PSD mice with faecal bacteria treated with XYS, the authors further clarified the relationship between intestinal flora disorder, the onset of PSD, and the intervention effect of XYS. Methods: To investigate the ameliorative effect of XYS on behavioural abnormalities and clarify the important role of intestinal flora regulation in the improvement of PSD by XYS in diseased mice, the authors employed various methodologies, including the PSD model, behavioural tests, haematoxylin and eosin staining, ultrastructural morphology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, 16S rRNA sequencing, metabolomic analyses, and FMT. Results: Oral administration of XYS effectively alleviated depression-like behaviours in PSD mice and repaired the damaged colonic mucosa. XYS inhibited inflammatory factors in serum and hippocampus and regulated the protein expression levels of P2X7 and NLRP3 in the colon and hippocampus of PSD mice. Moreover, XYS restored the gut microbiota and modulated intestinal metabolites in PSD mice. It effectively reduced the abundances of microbes including Ligullacoccus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus, while significantly increased the abundances of microbes including Faecalibaculum, Allobaculum, and Monolobus. Furthermore, XYS effectively regulated in-testinal metabolites such as methylparaben, valproic acid (Depakene), and disulfiram. More importantly, faecal transplants from the PSD models reproduced depression-like behaviours in normal mice, while XYS-FMT effectively alleviated depression-like behaviours in PSD mice. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that XYS improves depression-like behaviours in mice with PSD by modulating the gut microbiota and microbial metabolism, and regulating the P2X7R/NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - Sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, is one of the main insect pests of sugarcane fields, and it has been mainly managed by the use of chemical or biological controls. Considering the benefits of Silicon (Si) fertilization against pests, it was assessed the development of sugarcane borer larvae and sugarcane growth with and without Si. A greenhouse experiment was conducted using a factorial design (2 x 2) with 10 repetitions. Two commercial sugarcane varieties were evaluated: SP80-3280 and IAC91-1099, which have, respectively, susceptibility, and intermediate resistance to D. saccharalis. Si was applied in soil in an equivalent rate of 800 kg of Si ha(-1). Before herbivory, Si increased stalk diameter and plant height in both varieties, and number of leaves and leaf width were only increased in IAC91-1099. After 20 days of herbivory, Si increased stalk diameter in both varieties and plant height in IAC91-1099, but decreased the number of leaves and leaf width in SP80-3280. Larval D. saccharalis showed a reduced weight and a greater index for mandible abrasion after feeding Si-treated plants independently of variety. No influence of Si-treated plants was found in immunological parameters of larvae (total number of hemocytes, cell viability, encapsulation capability, lysozyme active). The activity of phenol oxidase, an immunological and stress marker for insects, was greater in larval D. saccharalis fed with IAC 91-1099, independently of Si. In conclusion, Si application improved sugarcane growth of IAC91-1099 and impaired the development of larval D. saccharalis in both sugarcane varieties.

AB  - Background: Recent developments in metabolomics, transcriptomic and epigenetics open up new horizons regarding the pharmacological understanding of phytocannabinoids as neuromodulators in treating anxiety, depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease and autism. Methods: The present review is an extensive search in public databases, such as Google Scholar, Scopus, the Web of Science, and PubMed, to collect all the literature about the neurobiological roles of cannabis extract, cannabidiol, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol specially focused on metabolomics, transcriptomic, epigenetic, mechanism of action, in different cell lines, induced animal models and clinical trials. We used bioinformatics, network pharmacology and enrichment analysis to understand the effect of phytocannabinoids in neuromodulation. Results: Cannabidomics studies show wide variability of metabolites across different strains and varieties, which determine their medicinal and abusive usage, which is very important for its quality control and regulation. CB receptors interact with other compounds besides cannabidiol and Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, like cannabinol and Delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol. Phytocannabinoids interact with cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid receptors (GPCR, ion channels, and PPAR) to improve various neurodegenerative diseases. However, its abuse because of THC is also a problem found across different epigenetic and transcriptomic studies. Network enrichment analysis shows CNR1 expression in the brain and its interacting genes involve different pathways such as Rap1 signalling, dopaminergic synapse, and relaxin signalling. CBD protects against diseases like epilepsy, depression, and Parkinson's by modifying DNA and mitochondrial DNA in the hippocampus. Network pharmacology analysis of 8 phytocannabinoids revealed an interaction with 10 (out of 60) targets related to neurodegenerative diseases, with enrichment of ErbB and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways which helps in ameliorating neuro-inflammation in various neurodegenerative diseases. The effects of phytocannabinoids vary across sex, disease state, and age which suggests the importance of a personalized medicine approach for better success. Conclusions: Phytocannabinoids present a range of promising neuromodulatory effects. It holds promise if utilized in a strategic way towards personalized neuropsychiatric treatment. However, just like any drug irrational usage may lead to unforeseen negative effects. Exploring neuro-epigenetics and systems pharmacology of major and minor phytocannabinoid combinations can lead to success.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Chandamarutha Chenduram (CC), an Indian traditional Siddha preparation officially recorded in the Siddha formulary of India and its composition are widely used in the Siddha practice of neurological disorders like stroke/paralysis in India. However, the scientific validation and mechanistic evidence is lacking and yet to be elucidated. Aim of the study: To establish the scientific evidences and to explore the possible neuroprotective mechanism of CC in cerebral ischemia. Materials and methods: Chemical standardization of the CC was performed using atomic absorption spectroscopy and gravimetric analysis. Acute toxicity study for CC in mice was performed in accordance with OECD 423 guidelines. CC (5 mg/kg) and CC (10 mg/kg) were investigated in bilateral common carotid occlusion (BCCAo) model in mice. After, behavioral assessments, the brain samples were collected and the hippocampus region was micro-dissected for neurotransmitter, neurobiochemicals and inflammatory cytokines estimation. The excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT-2) expressions was analyzed by RT-PCR to understand the possible molecular mechanism. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining of CA1 hippocampal brain region was performed to support the neuroprotective effect of CC in ischemic condition. Results: Chemical standardization analysis showed that CC has acceptable range of mercury (0.82 ppm) and elemental sulphur (11% w/w). Also, other heavy metal limits were found to be less or not detectable. Toxicity study also evidenced the safety profile of CC. CC has significantly reversed the behavioral dysfunctions (p < 0.001) in global ischemic mice. Treatment with CC has attenuated the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, lipid peroxide, nitric oxide, cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha) (p < 0.001) and increased the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH) and EAAT-2 expression level (p < 0.001) in ischemic brain. The hematoxylin and eosin staining in CA1 region of hippocampus also evidence the neuroprotective effect exhibited by CC. Conclusions: Treatment with CC has exhibited dose dependent effect and CC10 has shown significant protective effect in comparison to CC5 in most of the parameters studied. CC prevented further degeneration of neurons in cerebral ischemic mice through ameliorating inflammatory cytokines and oxy-radicals mediated EAAT-2 dysfunction and subsequent excitotoxicity in neurons.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 led to increased sampling of sarbecoviruses circulating in horseshoe bats. Employing phylogenetic inference while accounting for recombination of bat sarbecoviruses, we find that the closest-inferred bat virus ancestors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 existed less than a decade prior to their emergence in humans. Phylogeographic analyses show bat sarbecoviruses traveled at rates approximating their horseshoe bat hosts and circulated in Asia for millennia. We find that the direct ancestors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to have reached their respective sites of emergence via dispersal in the bat reservoir alone, supporting interactions with intermediate hosts through wildlife trade playing a role in zoonotic spillover. These results can guide future sampling efforts and demonstrate that viral genomic regions extremely closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were circulating in horseshoe bats, confirming their importance as the reservoir species for SARS viruses.

AB  - Recently, RNA editing, as a natural modification process of RNA molecules, has aroused extensive interest in the scientific community. This study elaborated the role and process of A-to-I RNA edited miR-3167 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were employed for the detection of miRNA and gene expressions. The function of miRNA was investigated through Transwell, CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to assess the link between gene and miRNA. The level of A-to-I RNA editing for miR-3167 was declined in LUAD tissues, which was linked to adverse clinical outcomes and prognosis in LUAD patients. In LUAD, ADAR2 enzyme is responsible for mediating the A-to-I RNA editing of miR-3167. Functionally, LUAD cell viability and metastasis were scarcely influenced by wt-miR-3167, while miR-3167 displayed antitumor activity in LUAD post A-to-I RNA editing. Mechanically, SSR2 is directly targeted by ed-miR-3167 in LUAD, but not wt-miR-3167. SSR2 served as a tumor promoter in LUAD progression by inactivating Hippo signaling and hindering immune infiltration. Ed-miR-3167 exerted tumor inhibitory effect in LUAD by weakening the carcinogenesis of SSR2. A-to-I RNA edited miR-3167 curbs malignant behaviors of LUAD by activating Hippo signaling through downregulating SSR2, indicating that edited miR-3167 has the potential as a therapeutic target for LUAD.

AB  - Transcription factors Satb1 and Satb2 are involved in the processes of cortex development and maturation of neurons. Alterations in the expression of their target genes can lead to neurodegenerative processes. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of regulation of neurotransmission by these transcription factors remain poorly understood. In this study, we have shown that transcription factors Satb1 and Satb2 participate in the regulation of genes encoding the NMDA-, AMPA-, and KA- receptor subunits and the inhibitory GABA(A) receptor. Deletion of gene for either Satb1 or Satb2 homologous factors induces the expression of genes encoding the NMDA receptor subunits, thereby leading to higher amplitudes of Ca2+-signals in neurons derived from the Satb1-deficient (Satb1(fl/+) * Nex(Cre/+)) and Satb1-null mice (Satb1(fl/fl) * Nex(Cre/+)) in response to the selective agonist reducing the EC50 for the NMDA receptor. Simultaneously, there is an increase in the expression of the Gria2 gene, encoding the AMPA receptor subunit, thus decreasing the Ca2+-signals of neurons in response to the treatment with a selective agonist (5-Fluorowillardiine (FW)). The Satb1 deletion increases the sensitivity of the KA receptor to the agonist (domoic acid), in the cortical neurons of the Satb1-deficient mice but decreases it in the Satb1-null mice. At the same time, the Satb2 deletion decreases Ca2+-signals and the sensitivity of the KA receptor to the agonist in neurons from the Satb1-null and the Satb1-deficient mice. The Satb1 deletion affects the development of the inhibitory system of neurotransmission resulting in the suppression of the neuron maturation process and switching the GABAergic responses from excitatory to inhibitory, while the Satb2 deletion has a similar effect only in the Satb1-null mice. We show that the Satb1 and Satb2 transcription factors are involved in the regulation of the transmission of excitatory signals and inhibition of the neuronal network in the cortical cell culture.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Zhimu-Huangbai herb-pair (ZB) is one of the most widely accepted prescriptions for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the effective components and mechanism of ZB for treating AD have not been fully understood. Aim of the study: This study aims to reveal the active components of ZB in the treatment of AD through serum pharmacochemistry, identify the potential targets and pathways of ZB in treating AD through metabolomics, and subsequently verify its mechanism through in vivo experiments. Materials and methods: The components of ZB in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid were determined by using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. The efficacy of ZB was assessed in a mouse model of AD induced by D-galactose. Metabolomics methods were used for screening and identification of differential metabolites and enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the activities of enzyme complexes I-IV, as well as the levels of ATP and ROS in hippocampal mitochondria of mice. Additionally, the expression of key genes and proteins in the signaling pathway was examined by utilizing immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot. Results: A total of 27 prototype components were identified from the serum of rats given ZB, of which 8 components were simultaneously detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 20 different metabolites were identified from mouse plasma using a metabolomics technique. The enrichment analysis results revealed that the pathway of ZB treatment for AD mainly involves glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. In vivo experiments have shown that ZB can improve the energy metabolism of the brain and increase the production of ATP by improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, ZB could promote the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increase the density of post-synaptic density protein (PSD95), and enhance the expression of synaptophysin (SYN). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that ZB can improve mitochondrial and synaptic function in AD mice induced by D-gal, providing experimental support for the clinical application and drug development for the prevention and treatment of AD.

AB  - Background. It has been reported that ischemia and ischemic preconditioning (IPC) have different effects on the expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), which may contribute to the tolerance to ischemia/hypoxia with the increase of autophagy. The mechanisms of TSC1 differential expression are still unclear under ischemia/IPC conditions in hippocampal Cornu Ammon 1 (CA1) and Cornu Ammon 3 (CA3) area neuronal cells. While we have shown that 5-Aza-CdR, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, can upregulate TSC1 and increase hypoxic tolerance by autophagy in vivo and in vitro, in this study, we examined whether DNA methylation was involved in the differential expression of TSC1 in the CA1 and CA3 regions induced by hypoxic preconditioning (HPC). Methods. Level of rapamycin (mTOR) autophagy, a downstream molecular pathway of TSC1/TSC2 complex, was detected in HPC mouse hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas as well as in the HPC model of mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. DNA methylation level of TSC1 promoter (-720 bp similar to -360 bp) was determined in CA1 and CA3 areas by bisulfite-modified DNA sequencing (BMDS). At the same time, autophagy was detected in HT22 cells transfected with GFP-LC3 plasmid. The role of TSC1 in neuroprotection was measured by cell viability and apoptosis, and the role of TSC1 in metabolism was checked by ATP assay and ROS assay in HT22 cells that overexpressed/knocked down TSC1. Results. HPC upregulated the expression of TSC1, downregulated the level of P-mTOR (Ser2448) and P-p70S6K (Thr389), and enhanced the activity of autophagy in both in vivo and in vitro. The increased expression of TSC1 in HPC may depend on its DNA hypomethylation in the promoter region in vivo. HPC also could reduce energy consumption in HT22 cells. Overexpression and knockdown of TSC1 can affect cell viability, cell apoptosis, and metabolism in HT22 cells exposed to hypoxia. Conclusion. TSC1 expression induced by HPC may relate to the downregulation of its DNA methylation level with the increase of autophagy and the decrease of energy demand.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate seasonal changes in testes size, serum testosterone (T) levels and sperm production characteristics of 24 adult (2-3 years old) rams of meat breeds: Charollais (n = 6), Ile de France (n = 6), Dorset (Polled) (n = 5) and Dorper (Dorper, n = 7). Semen was collected with artificial vagina using a female in spontaneous oestrus (September-November, breeding season, BS) or a female with induced oestrus (March-July, non-breeding season, NBS). A total of 672 ejaculates were examined. Jugular vein blood was collected to determine testosterone levels during BS and NBS, and serum was extracted. Results of the present study indicate that there was no significant change in parameters such as body weight (kg) and testes length, both right and left, during BS and NBS, irrespective of the breed. The remaining metrics of testes differ in varying degrees between breeds of rams (with the exception of the Dorper breed) between BS and NBS. No significant variation in these parameters was found in Dorper rams. For all breeds, season had a statistically significant effect on important parameters such as total sperm count and progressive sperm motility after thawing. There was also significant seasonal variation in ejaculate volume across the three breeds, excluding il-de-France rams. The most constant was the sperm concentration, which was unchanged in BS and NBS in the three breeds, excluding Dorset rams, which showed a slightly significant decrease in this indicator in the non-breeding season. The serum content of the major male hormone testosterone (T) in rams of all breeds showed significant changes between BS and NBS, decreasing by a highly significant amount in the non-breeding season.

AB  - Eukaryotic DNA clamp is a trimeric protein featuring a toroidal ring structure that binds DNA on the inside of the ring and multiple proteins involved in DNA transactions on the outside. Eukaryotes have two types of DNA clamps: the replication clamp PCNA and the checkpoint clamp RAD9-RAD1HUS1 (9-1-1). 9-1-1 activates the ATR-CHK1 pathway in DNA damage checkpoint, regulating cell cycle progression. Structure of 9-1-1 consists of two moieties: a hetero-trimeric ring formed by PCNA-like domains of three subunits and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region of the RAD9 subunit, called RAD9 C-tail. The RAD9 C-tail interacts with the 91-1 ring and disrupts the interaction between 9-1-1 and DNA, suggesting a negative regulatory role for this intramolecular interaction. In contrast, RHINO, a 9-1-1 binding protein, interacts with both RAD1 and RAD9 subunits, positively regulating checkpoint activation by 9-1-1. This study presents a biochemical and structural analysis of intra- and intermolecular interactions on the 9-1-1 ring. Biochemical analysis indicates that RAD9 C-tail binds to the hydrophobic pocket on the PCNA-like domain of RAD9, implying that the pocket is involved in multiple protein-protein interactions. The crystal structure of the 9-1-1 ring in complex with a RHINO peptide reveals that RHINO binds to the hydrophobic pocket of RAD9, shedding light on the RAD9-binding motif. Additionally, the study proposes a structural model of the 9-1-1-RHINO quaternary complex. Together, these fi ndings provide functional insights into the intra- and inter-molecular interactions on the front side of RAD9, elucidating the roles of RAD9 C-tail and RHINO in checkpoint activation.

AB  - Background. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a common inflammatory disease with high heterogeneity and postoperative recidivation. The IL-33/ST2 axis is known to be involved in Th2 immune responses. This study is aimed at exploring levels of serum IL-33 and soluble ST2 (sST2) in CRSwNP patients and their potential for predicting CRSwNP endotypes and postoperative recurrence. Methods. The present study recruited 149 CRSwNP patients, 80 of whom were noneosinophilic (neCRSwNP) and 69 eosinophilic (eCRSwNP), as well as 60 healthy controls (HCs). Serum samples were collected from all participants, and sST2 and IL-33 concentrations were measured using ELISA. Multivariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the value of serum sST2 and IL-33 levels in distinguishing CRSwNP endotypes and predicting postoperative recurrence. Results. The levels of serum sST2 and IL-33 in CRSwNP patients were significantly higher than those in HCs, especially in the eCRSwNP group. Increased sST2 and IL-33 levels were associated with eosinophil counts and percentages in both tissue and blood. Multivariate regression and ROC curve analysis showed that serum sST2 and IL-33 exhibited potential for distinguishing CRSwNP endotypes, and the combination of serum IL-33 and sST2 showed even more predictive power. Finally, 124 CRSwNP patients completed the entire 3-year follow-up. Multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves showed that serum sST2 and IL-33 levels were associated with recurrence; serum sST2 and IL-33 each exhibited potential for predicting postoperative recurrence, and combining serum sST2 and IL-33 exhibited better accuracy and practicability. Conclusion. Our results suggested that serum sST2 and IL-33 levels were upregulated in CRSwNP patients and related to the degree of mucosal eosinophil infiltration and postoperative recurrence. Serum sST2 and IL-33 might serve as objective biomarkers for distinguishing phenotypes and predicting recurrence in CRSwNP, and their combined use outperformed either marker alone.

AB  - Background: Piperine is a great lead compound, as a phytopharmaceutical with reported neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. HJ105, a piperine derivative with high affinity to Keap1 receptor, attracts increasing attention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment.
   Purpose: This work mainly aimed to study HJ105's therapeutic effects on A beta(1-42)-associated AD and the underpinning mechanisms.
   Methods: In the in vivo part, a rat model of AD was established by bilateral intra-hippocampal administration of aggregated A beta(1-42), followed by a month of intragastric HJ105 or donepezil administration. Spatial and learning memories were detected by the Morris water maze assay, passive avoidance learning as well as Y-maze test. The morphology of hippocampal neurons was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. In addition, the amounts of the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha were obtained with specific ELISA kits. More importantly, apoptosis-related proteins and factors involved in Nrf2/TXNIP/NLPR3 pathways were detected by Western blot, while the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. In the in vitro part, human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were applied to evaluate the role of HJ105 on A beta(1-42)-induced neuronal damage.
   Results: Treatment of HJ105 not only reversed memory impairment, but also protected neurons in the hippocampus by inhibiting Bax/Bcl2 ratio increase. HJ105 decreased TXNIP expression, suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the hippocampus, which in turn counteracted the upregulation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. Notably, HJ105 exerted an inhibitory effect on Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and upregulated nuclear Nrf2, which conversely increased the expression levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and downregulated malondialdehyde. Additionally, neurotoxicity induced by A beta(1-42) in SH-SY5Y cells was alleviated by HJ105.
   Conclusion: Overall, HJ105 exerts neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cells induced by A beta(1-42) as well as in experimental rats with AD by decreasing apoptosis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, partly via suppression of Keap1-Nrf2 complex generation. HJ105 might represent a promising compound for AD treatment.

AB  - Increased fructose over-intake is a global issue. Maternal fructose exposure during gestation and lactation can impair brain development in offspring. However, the effect on synapses is still unknown. For the diversification of RNA and biological functions, alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) are essential. We constructed a maternal high-fructose diet model by administering 13% and 40% fructose water. The student's t-test analyzed the results of RT-qPCR. All other results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. The animal behavior experiment results revealed that conditioning and associative memory had been damaged. The proteins that form synapses were consistently low-expressed. In addition, compared with the control group, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform's full-length RNA-sequencing identified 298 different spliced genes (DSGs) and 51 differentially expressed alternative splicing (DEAS) genes in the 13% fructose group. 313 DSGs and 74 DEAS genes were in the 40% fructose group. Enrichment analysis based on these altered genes revealed some enlightening items and pathways. Our findings demonstrated the transcriptome mechanism underlying maternal fructose exposure during gestation and lactation and impaired synapse function during the transcripts' editing.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Anoectochilus roxburghii (A. roxburghii) is a precious herb and folk medicine in many Asian countries. It has been used traditionally to treat diabetes, etc., and also used as a dietary therapy to delay senescence.Aim of the study: This study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of A. roxburghii flavonoids extract (ARF) and whether its effects were due to the regulation of SIRT1 signaling pathway in senescent mice and in Dgalactose (D-gal) induced aging in SH-SY5Y cells. Materials and methods: 18-month-old mice were randomly divided into senescent model, low-dose ARF, high-dose ARF and vitamin E group. 2-Month-old mice were as a control group. After 8 weeks treatment, Morris water maze (MWM) was performed. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), monoamine oxidase (MAO) and acetylcholinesterase (ACh-E) in the cortex were determined. Hippocampus morphologic changes were observed with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Nissl, senescenceassociated-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Apoptosis-related molecular expressions in the hippocampus were performed by western blotting. Furthermore, after stimulated by EX527 (a SIRT1 inhibitor), the SIRT1-dependent neuroprotective effects of ARF were determined by measuring SRIT1 and p53 expression in SH-SY5Y aging cells induced by D-gal.Results: ARF could significantly ameliorate memory decline in senescent mice and reduce the generations of ROS, MDA and the activities of MAO and ACh-E, while increasing SOD activities in the cortex of aging mice. ARF obviously improved hippocampus pathological alterations, increased the number of Nissl bodies, while reducing senescent and apoptotic cells in senescent mice hippocampus. Further, ARF positively regulated SIRT1 expression, and reduced apoptosis-related molecules p53, p21 and Caspase-3 expression, while increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In D-gal-induced SH-SY5Y cells, the effects of ARF on SIRT1 and p53, and the ability of scavenging ROS were mostly abolished after incubation with the EX527.Conclusions: ARF, in a SIRT1-dependent manner, exerted neuroprotection via modulating SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway against memory decline and apoptosis due to age-induced oxidative stress damage in senescent mice.

AB  - Yogurt acid whey (YAW) is a by-product of Greek strained yogurt production. The disposal of YAW constitutes an environmental problem, and given the increasing demand of Greek yogurt worldwide, its handling is a challenge. However, whey-derived peptides, resulting from microbial fermentation as well as those resulting from further hydrolysis during the digestion process, have been linked to enhanced biological activities. In this study, the antioxidant capacity of 33 samples of YAW obtained from Greek dairy companies of bovine, ovine or caprine origin was investigated using both cell-free and cell-based assays. The YAW samples, their in vitro digestion products (YAW-Ds) and a fraction of the digests (less than 3 kDa; YAW-D-P3) were assessed using four biochemical assays, namely ORAC, ABTS, FRAP and P-FRAP. Our data revealed a higher antioxidant capacity for digested samples compared with undigested samples, with all four methods. ORAC values after in vitro digestion were higher for the ovine samples compared to their bovine (YAW-D and YAW-D-P3) and caprine (YAW-D-P3) counterparts. Furthermore, the YAW-D-P3 fraction derived from samples collected in the summer months exhibited higher ORAC values when compared to the respective fraction from the winter months' samples. The cellular antioxidant activity of ovine YAW-D-P3 was improved in H2O2-treated HT29 cells compared to the control H2O2-treated cells. However, YAW-D-P3 could not trigger either the pathways involving the transcription factors NF-kappa B or NFE2L2 or the gene expression of SOD1, CAT and HMOX1 in LPS-challenged THP-1-derived macrophages. These results suggest that YAW, and particularly YAW from ovine origin, could be used as a natural source for its antioxidant potential in human and animal nutrition.

AB  - Activation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, leading to the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been linked to cardiac remodeling, autonomic disbalance, and cognitive deficits in heart failure (HF). While previous studies emphasized the role of hippocampal Angiotensin II (AngII) signaling in HF-induced microglial activation, unanswered mechanistic questions persist. Evidence suggests significant interactions between microglia and local microvasculature, potentially affecting blood-brain barrier integrity and cerebral blood flow regulation. Still, whether the microglial-vascular interface is affected in the brain during HF remains unknown. Using a well-established ischemic HF rat model, we demonstrate the increased abundance of vessel-associated microglia (VAM) in HF rat hippocampi, along with an increased expression of AngII AT1a receptors. Acute AngII administration to sham rats induced microglia recruitment to brain capillaries, along with increased expression of TNF alpha. Conversely, administering an AT1aR blocker to HF rats prevented the recruitment of microglia to blood vessels, normalizing their levels to those in healthy rats. These results highlight the critical importance of a rather understudied phenomenon (i.e., microglia-vascular interactions in the brain) in the context of the pathophysiology of a highly prevalent cardiovascular disease, and unveil novel potential therapeutic avenues aimed at mitigating neuroinflammation in cardiovascular diseases.
   This study shows changes in microglia-vascular interactions in the context of heart failure, which unveils a novel potential therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation in cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Background: As the most frequently used kidney-yang tonifying herb in traditional Chinese medicine, dried succulent stems of Cistanche tubulosa (Schenk) Wight (CT) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression. However, the antidepressant components and their underlying mechanism remain unclear.
   Purpose: To explore the active components of CT against depression, as well as the potential mechanisms. Study design and methods: Behavioral despair tests were used to assess the antidepressant activities of polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and different glycoside-enriched fractions separated from CT, as well as the typical gut microbiota metabolites including 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (3-HPP) and hydroxytyrosol (HT). Furthermore, the effects of bioactive fractions and metabolites on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model were explored with multiple pharmacodynamics and biochemical analyses. Changes in colonic histology and the intestinal barrier were observed by staining and immunohistochemical analysis. Gut microbial features and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism were explored using 16S rRNA sequencing and western-blotting, respectively.
   Results: Total glycosides (TG) dramatically alleviated depression-like behaviors compared to different separated fractions, reflecting in the synergistic effects of phenylethanoid and iridoid glycosides on the hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, severe neuro-and peripheral inflammation, and deficiencies in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. Moreover, TG mitigated low-grade inflammation in the colon and intestinal barrier disruption, and the abundances of several bacterial genera highly correlated with the HPA axis and inflammation in CUMS rats. Consistently, the expression of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in the colon was significantly reduced after TG administration, accompanied by the suppression of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. On the other hand, HT also exerted a marked antidepressant effect by ameliorating HPA axis function, proinflammatory cytokine release, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, while it was unable to largely adjust the disordered gut microbiota in the same manner as TG. Surprisingly, superior to fluoxetine, TG and HT could further improve dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and abnormal cyclic nucleotide metabolism.
   Conclusion: TG are primarily responsible for the antidepressant activity of CT; its effect might be achieved through the bidirectional interaction of the phytochemicals and gut microbiota, and reflect the advantage of CT in the treatment of depression.

AB  - Neurons are highly polarized cells with morphologically and functionally distinct dendritic and axonal processes. The molecular mechanisms that establish axon-dendrite polarity in vivo are poorly understood. Here, we describe the initial polarization of posterior deirid (PDE), a ciliated mechanosensory neuron, during development in vivo through 4D live imaging with endogenously tagged proteins. PDE inherits and maintains apicobasal polarity from its epithelial precursor. Its apical domain is directly transformed into the ciliated dendritic tip through apical constriction, which is followed by axonal outgrowth from the opposite basal side of the cell. The apical Par complex and junctional proteins persistently localize at the developing dendritic domain throughout this transition. Consistent with their instructive role in axon-dendrite polarization, conditional depletion of the Par complex and junctional proteins results in robust defects in dendrite and axon formation. During apical constriction, a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) containing the microtubule nucleator g-tubulin ring complex (g-TuRC) forms along the apical junction between PDE and its sister cell in a manner dependent on the Par complex and junctional proteins. This junctional MTOC patterns neuronal microtubule polarity and facilitate the dynein-dependent recruitment of the basal body for ciliogenesis. When non-ciliated neurons are genetically manipulated to obtain ciliated neuronal fate, inherited apicobasal polarity is required for generating ciliated dendritic tips. We propose that inherited apicobasal polarity, together with apical cell-cell interactions drive the morphological and cytoskeletal polarity in early neuronal differentiation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), a traditional Tibetan medicinal herb, exhibits protective effects against cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Although Sea buckthorn extract (SBE) has been confirmed to alleviate airway inflammation in mice, its therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires further clarification. Aim of the study: To elucidate the alleviative effect and molecular mechanism of SBE on lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced COPD by blocking ferroptosis. Methods: The anti-ferroptotic effects of SBE were evaluated in human BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells using CCK8, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy. Transwell was employed to detect chemotaxis of neutrophils. COPD model was induced by intranasally administration of LPS/PPE in mice and measured by alterations of histopathology, inflammation, and ferroptosis. RNA-sequencing, western blotting, antioxidant examination, flow cytometry, DARTS, CETSA, and molecular docking were then used to investigate its anti-ferroptotic mechanisms. Results: In vitro, SBE not only suppressed erastin- or RSL3-induced ferroptosis by suppressing lipid peroxides (LPOs) production and glutathione (GSH) depletion, but also suppressed ferroptosis-induced chemotactic migration of neutrophils via reducing mRNA expression of chemokines. In vivo, SBE ameliorated LPS/PPEinduced COPD phenotypes, and inhibited the generation of LPOs, cytokines, and chemokines. RNA-sequencing showed that p53 pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway were implicated in SBEmediated anti-ferroptotic action. SBE repressed erastin- or LPS/PPE-induced overactivation of p53 and MAPK pathway, thereby decreasing expression of diamine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), and increasing expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Mechanistically, erastin-induced elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reduced by SBE through directly scavenging free radicals, thereby contributing to its inhibition of p53 and MAPK pathways. CETSA, DARTS, and molecular docking further showed that ROS-generating enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (NOX4) may be the target of SBE. Overexpression of NOX4 partially impaired the anti-ferroptotic activity of SBE. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that SBE mitigated COPD by suppressing p53 and MAPK pro-ferroptosis pathways via directly scavenging ROS and blocking NOX4. These findings also supported the clinical application of Sea buckthorn in COPD therapy.

AB  - In the Hippo pathway, activation of Hippo and Warts (Wts) kinases results in the phosphorylation of Yorkie (Yki), to prevent its nuclear translocation. Shrimp aquaculture is threatened by Vibrio genus bacteria. In this study, we examine the role of the Hippo pathway in immune defense against Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Pacific white shrimp Penaeus vannamei. We show that V. parahaemolyticus infection promotes the expression of Yki and facilitates the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Yki, indicating the inhibition of Hippo signaling upon bacterial infection. There is a complex regulatory relationship between the Hippo pathway components Hippo, Wts, and Yki and the immune-related transcription factors Dorsal, Relish, and STAT. Silencing of Hippo and Wts weakened hemocyte phagocytosis, while the silencing of Yki enhanced it, suggesting a positive regulation of shrimp cellular immunity by Hippo signaling activation. In vivo silencing of Hippo and Wts decreased the survival rates of V. parahaemolyticus-infected shrimp and elevated the bacterial content in tissues, while the silencing of Yki showed the opposite results. This suggests that the activation of Hippo signaling and the inhibition of Yki enhance antibacterial immunity in shrimp.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that ovarian estrogens are involved in the occurrence and pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through regulation on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory; however, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated at the genomic scale. In this study, we established the postmenopausal estrogen-deficient model by ovariectomy (OVX). Then, we used high-throughput Affymetrix Clariom transcriptomics and found 143 differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of OVX mice with the absolute fold change >= 1.5 and P < 0.05. GO analysis showed that the highest enrichment was seen in long-term memory. Combined with the response to steroid hormone enrichment and GeneMANIA network prediction, the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 gene (Sgk1) was found to be the most potent candidate for ovarian estrogenic regulation. Sgk1 overexpression viral vectors (oSgk1) were then constructed and injected into the hippocampus of OVX mice. Morris water maze test revealed that the impaired spatial learning and memory induced by OVX was rescued by Sgk1 overexpression. Additionally, the altered expression of synaptic proteins and actin remodeling proteins and changes in CA1 spine density and synapse density induced by OVX were also significantly reversed by oSgk1. Moreover, the OVX-induced increase in A beta-producing BACE1 and A beta and the decrease in insulin degrading enzyme were significantly reversed by oSgk1. The above results show that multiple pathways and genes are involved in ovarian estrogenic regulation of the function of the hippocampus, among which Sgk1 may be a novel potent target against estrogen-sensitive hippocampal dysfunctions, such as A beta-initiated AD.

AB  - Esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) is the major subtype of esophageal cancer in China, accounting for 90% of cases. Recent studies revealed that abnormalities in the Hippo/YAP axis are pervasive in ESCC and are recognized as the important driver of ESCC progression. Since the activity of Hippo signaling is controlled by phosphorylation cascade, it is a mystery why the major effector YAP is still over-activated when the cascade is inhibited. Several studies suggested that in addition to phosphorylation, other protein modifications such as ubiquitination also play important roles in manipulating Hippo/YAP signaling activity. Since YAP protein stability is controlled via an appropriate balance between E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases, we performed deubiquitinase siRNA screening and identified USP36 as a deubiquitinase significantly related to Hippo/YAP signaling activity and ESCC progression. USP36 expression was elevated in ESCC samples and correlated with poor differentiation. USP36 expression was correlated with YAP protein levels in ESCC samples. Molecular studies demonstrated that USP36 associated with the YAP protein and enhanced YAP protein stability by blocking the K48-linked polyubiquitination of YAP. In conclusion, our study revealed a novel deubiquitinase in regulating Hippo signaling in ESCC, which could be an encouraging drug target for Hippo-driven ESCC.

AB  - A high percentage of patients with brain metastases frequently develop neurocognitive symptoms; however, understanding how brain metastasis co-opts the function of neuronal circuits beyond a tumor mass effect remains unknown. We report a comprehensive multidimensional modeling of brain functional analyses in the context of brain metastasis. By testing different preclinical models of brain metastasis from various primary sources and oncogenic profiles, we dissociated the heterogeneous impact on local field potential oscillatory activity from cortical and hippocampal areas that we detected from the homogeneous inter-model tumor size or glial response. In contrast, we report a potential underlying molecular program responsible for impairing neuronal crosstalk by scoring the transcriptomic and mutational profiles in a model-specific manner. Additionally, measurement of various brain activity readouts matched with machine learning strategies confirmed model-specific alterations that could help predict the presence and subtype of metastasis.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation that leads to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Ponicidin, a natural diterpenoid, possesses anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, its potential effects on A beta-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. This study investigated whether ponicidin ameliorates A beta(1-42)-induced hippocampal neuronal injury by modulating SIRT1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Methods HT22 cells were exposed to A beta(1-42) to establish an in vitro AD model, followed by treatment with ponicidin. Cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses were assessed using MTT assay, flow cytometry, ROS detection, and ELISA. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to evaluate the expression of SIRT1, the components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and neuroinflammation. Results Ponicidin significantly attenuated A beta(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity, reduced oxidative stress, and suppressed apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Mechanistically, ponicidin upregulated SIRT1 expression and activated PI3K/Akt pathway. The protective effects of ponicidin were reversed by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor EX-527, confirming the involvement of this pathway. Conclusion These findings suggest that ponicidin exerts neuroprotective effects against A beta(1-42)-induced hippocampal injury by enhancing SIRT1 and activating PI3K/Akt signaling, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic candidate for AD.

AB  - Storage pest bruchine is a major production limiting factor in blackgram. The present study was employed in a bi-parental mapping population derived from a cross between susceptible (MDU 1) and resistant (TU68) genotypes. Phenotyping was carried out under an artificial bruchine screening procedure. QTL studies revealed three major QTLs responsible for the total number of adult emergence, percentage of seed damage and developmental time. The validation of identified QTLs was carried out on other mapping populations, namely, VBN 6 x TU 68 and VBN 8 x TU 68 through single marker analysis. It revealed that markers CEDG020 and CEDG302 can be used in the future bruchine resistance breeding programme. Genome mining on the QTL regions harbours several possible candidate genes related to defence response against herbivory insects, namely, serine/threonine protein kinase proteins, zinc finger family proteins, F-box proteins, leucine-rich repeats regions and some transcription factors and enzymes. The outcome of this study will be useful for bruchine resistance breeding programme.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with limited treatment options available in clinical practice. The emergence of stem cell therapy has provided new hope to the field of stroke treatment via the restoration of brain neuron function. Exogenous neural stem cells are beneficial not only in cell replacement but also through the bystander effect. Neural stem cells regulate multiple physiological responses, including nerve repair, endogenous regeneration, immune function, and blood-brain barrier permeability, through the secretion of bioactive substances, including extracellular vesicles/exosomes. However, due to the complex microenvironment of ischemic cerebrovascular events and the low survival rate of neural stem cells following transplantation, limitations in the treatment effect remain unresolved. In this paper, we provide a detailed summary of the potential mechanisms of neural stem cell therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke, review current neural stem cell therapeutic strategies and clinical trial results, and summarize the latest advancements in neural stem cell engineering to improve the survival rate of neural stem cells. We hope that this review could help provide insight into the therapeutic potential of neural stem cells and guide future scientific endeavors on neural stem cells.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON), as a secondary metabolite of fungi, is continually detected in livestock feed and has a high risk to animals and humans. Moreover, pigs are very sensitive to DON. Recently, the role of histone modification has drawn people's attention; however, few studies have elucidated how histone modification participates in the cytotoxicity or genotoxicity induced by mycotoxins. In this study, we used intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cells) as a model to DON exposure in vitro. Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) regulates gene expression by exerting the role of methyltransferase. Our studies demonstrated that H3K4me3 enrichment was enhanced and MLL1 was highly upregulated upon 1 mu g/mL DON exposure in IPEC-J2 cells. We found that the silencing of MLL1 resulted in increasing the apoptosis rate, arresting the cell cycle, and activating the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway. An RNA-sequencing analysis proved that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway between the knockdown of MLL1 and negative control groups, which were associated with cytotoxicity induced by DON. In summary, these current results might provide new insight into how MLL1 regulates cytotoxic effects induced by DON via an epigenetic mechanism.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative illnesses that impair individual life & increase the demand for caregivers with no available curative medication right now. Therefore, there is a growing concern about employing herbal medicine to limit AD progression & improve patients' life quality, thus potentiating its add-on therapy. In addition, herbs are cost-effective & accessible with nearly no side effects. In the same vein, our study aimed to investigate the potency of Echinacea purpurea (EP) flower extracts to ameliorate the neurodegenerative effect of Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in a rat model. Moreover, mechanistic studies, including impact on the cholinesterase activity, redox status, inflammatory mediators, behavior performance, glucose level & histopathology, were carried on. Our results showed that 250 mg/kg of Aqueous (AQ) & Alcoholic (AL) extracts of EP inhibited cholinesterase, restored oxidative balance, down-regulated IL-6 & TNF-alpha cytokines & improved behavior performance in vivo that was reflected in the brain picture by decreasing neuronal degeneration & amyloid plaques in cerebral cortex & hippocampus. The potency of both extracts was compared to reference drugs & AlCl3 positive control group. The AQ extract showed greater potency against COX-1, COX-2 & alpha-amylase in vitro, while the AL extract was more potent against cholinesterase in vitro, inflammatory cytokines, behavior & pathological improvement in vivo. Conclusively EP overcame AlCl3-induced neurobehavioral toxicity in the rat model via different pathways, which support its regular administration to postpone progressive neural damage in AD patients.

AB  - Cocoa is widely known for its health benefits, but its neurocognitive impact remains underexplored. This preclinical study aimed to investigate the effects of cocoa and cocoa polyphenols on hippocampal neuroplasticity, cognitive function and emotional behavior. Seventy young-adult C57BL/6JRj male and female mice were fed either a standard diet (CTR) or a diet enriched with 10% high-phenolic content cocoa (HPC) or low-phenolic content cocoa (LPC) for at least four weeks. In a first experiment, behavioral tests assessing exploratory behavior, emotional responses and hippocampal-dependent memory were conducted four weeks into the diet, followed by animal sacrifice a week later. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and western blot. In a different experiment, hippocampal synaptic response, long-term potentiation and presynaptic-dependent short-term plasticity were studied by electrophysiology. Cocoa-enriched diets had minimal effects on exploratory activity and anxiety-like behavior, except for reduced locomotion in the LPC group. Only the HPC diet enhanced object recognition memory, while place recognition memory and spatial navigation remained unaffected. The HPC diet also increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis, boosting the proliferation, survival and number of young adult-born neurons. However, both cocoa-enriched diets increased immobility in the forced swimming test and hippocampal BDNF expression. Hippocampal electrophysiology revealed no alterations in neuroplasticity among diets. The results were mostly unaffected by sex.

AB  - Polyphenols sourced from Ilex latifolia Thunb. (PIT) contain high levels of phenolic acids, tannic acids, triterpenoids and so on, which play important roles in antioxidant function. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of PIT against intestinal injury in piglets under oxidative stress. Thirty-two weanling piglets were arranged by a 2 x 2 factorial experiment with diets (basal diet vs. PIT diet) and oxidative stress (saline vs. diquat). All piglets were injected with saline or diquat on d 21, respectively. After 7 days, all pigs were slaughtered and intestinal samples were collected. PIT enhanced jejunal villus heights and crypt depth in the piglets under oxidative stress. PIT increased the activities of intestinal mucosal lactase, sucrase and maltase in the challenged piglets. PIT also increased the jejunal ratio of protein to DNA and ileal protein content. PIT increased the jejunal activities of GSH-PX and GSH content and reduced the ileal MDA amounts. Furthermore, PIT regulated the expression of ferroptosis mediators, such as TFR1, HSPB1, SLC7A11 and GPX4. These results indicate that dietary PIT supplementation enhances the histological structure and function of the intestinal mucosa, which is involved in modulating antioxidant capacity and ferroptosis.

AB  - The biomechanical phenotype of soft tissues - i.e., the sum of spatially- and directionally-varying mechanical properties - is a critical marker of tissue health and disease. While biomechanical phenotyping is always challenging, it is particularly difficult with minuscule tissues. For example, tissues from small animal models are often only millimeters in size, which prevents the use of traditional test methods, such as uniaxial tensile testing. To overcome this challenge, our current work describes and tests a novel experimental and numerical pipeline. First, we introduce a micro-bulge test device with which we pressurize and inflate minuscule soft tissues. We combine this microbulge device with an optical coherence tomography device to also image the samples during inflation. Based on pressure data and images we then perform inverse finite element simulations to identify our tissues' unknown material parameters. For validation, we identify the material parameters of a thin sheet of latex rubber via both uniaxial tensile testing and via our novel pipeline. Next, we demonstrate our pipeline against anterior tricuspid valve leaflets from rats. The resulting material parameters for these tissues compare excellently with data collected in sheep via standard planar biaxial testing. Additionally, we show that our device is compatible with other imaging modalities such as 2-Photon microscopy. To this end, we image the in-situ microstructural changes of the leaflets during inflation using second-harmonic generation imaging. In summary, we introduce a novel pipeline to biomechanically phenotype minuscule soft tissues and demonstrate its value by phenotyping the biomechanics of the anterior tricuspid valve leaflets from rats.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies, the pathogenesis of which is well defined but for which safe and effective drugs are still lacking. Shengxian Decoction (SXD) is a classical Chinese herbal formula that has been shown to improve qi deficiency and fatigue syndrome, which is also one of the key pathomechanisms in myasthenia gravis. However, the potential of this formula to treat myasthenia gravis (MG) and its underlying mechanisms remains to be fully elucidated. Aim of the study: To investigate the therapeutic effect of the traditional Chinese medicine formula, Shengxian Decoction (SXD) on MG and its potential mechanism of action. Methods and materials: Employing prednisone (PDN) as a positive control, the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) rat model induced by recombinant acetylcholine receptor (AChR) alpha subunit 97-116 peptide was used to reveal and confirm the therapeutic effect of SXD on MG. Model evaluation was performed based on animal behavioral performance combined with repeated nerve stimulation (RNS) experiments. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay were used to detect the level of inflammatory cytokines. The alterations in T-cell immunity were observed using flow cytometry (FCM). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) experiments were used to detect the molecular expression of TAZ, TEAD, and FOXP3. The ex vivo and in vivo mechanisms were validated by Western blot (WB) and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Results: The results showed that SXD significantly reversed loss of weight and muscle strength in EAMG rats, reducing the inflammation level and repairing the damage of thymic tissues in the model rats. Furthermore, SXD altered the trend observed in EAMG rats by markedly increasing the proportion of pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells and reducing the expression of Regulatory T cells (Treg), which plays a pivotal role in regulating the immune response in EAMG rats. SXD was shown to upregulate the expression of FOXP3 and TEAD, downregulate the expression of TAZ, and inhibit the binding of TAZ and TEAD in this research. This phenomenon was subsequently validated in vitro, which may elucidate the potential mechanism of SXD in the treatment of EAMG. Conclusion: SXD has been demonstrated to possess the capacity to treat EAMG. The underlying mechanism of action may be achieved by promoting the degradation of TAZ through the TAZ/TEAD pathway and inhibiting the binding of TAZ and TEAD, thereby restoring the balance of the body's immune function.

AB  - The development of an effective and green bioinsecticide is a research hotspot. This study demonstrated the possibility of using an arsenic (As) hyperaccumulator as a bioinsecticide. When the As concentration in the Pteris vittata fronds exceeded 138 mg kg(-1), the larva of the hawk moth (Theretra clotho) displayed apparent preference to lower-As-concentration P. vittata fronds. The As concentration in the larva body was as high as 850 mg kg(-1). Such high concentration of As in the larva body might have been the case that T. clotho lacks a process to exclude As. The larval frass showed an As concentration of only 1%-4% of that in the larva body. The predominant As species in the larva body and frass was As(III)-SH. The percentage of As(III)-SH was slightly higher in the frass than that in the larval body. Chelation with thiols may be a universal detoxification mechanism for As in both plants and insects. In general, the adoption of P. vittata as a bioinsecticide should be feasible. However, the exact processes to achieve this goal still need further study. The mechanism of different animals to detoxify As is another interesting research topic. (C) Higher Education Press 2021

AB  - Learning is a crucial basis for biological systems to adapt to environments. Environments include various states or episodes, and episode-dependent learning is essential in adaptation to such complex situations. Here, we developed a model for learning a two-target search task used in primate physiological experiments. In the task, the agent is required to gaze one of the four presented light spots. Two neighboring spots are served as the correct target alternately, and the correct target pair is switched after a certain number of consecutive successes. In order for the agent to obtain rewards with a high probability, it is necessary to make decisions based on the actions and results of the previous two trials. Our previous work achieved this by using a dynamic state space. However, to learn a task that includes events such as fixation to the initial central spot, the model framework should be extended. For this purpose, here we propose a "history-in-episode architecture." Specifically, we divide states into episodes and histories, and actions are selected based on the histories within each episode. When we compared the proposed model including the dynamic state space with the conventional SARSA method in the two-target search task, the former performed close to the theoretical optimum, while the latter never achieved target-pair switch because it had to re-learn each correct target each time. The reinforcement learning model including the proposed history-in-episode architecture and dynamic state scape enables episode-dependent learning and provides a basis for highly adaptable learning systems to complex environments.

AB  - Calcitonin is a 32-amino acid peptide, which causes a decrease in blood calcium levels and bone resorption in the human body. It is produced in different species. Salmon calcitonin is used as a medicine for diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and hypercalcemia. However, the salmon calcitonin peptide used as a medicine, could induce immune responses in humans. Decreasing the antigenicity of salmon calcitonin could improve this molecule for pharmaceutical usage. In this study, improving physicochemical properties and reducing allergenicity and especially the antigenicity of salmon calcitonin were followed. The calcitonin sequences of different species were evaluated, and those with better properties were considered as a guide for peptide engineering. In silico methods were utilized to characterize the properties of the reviewed calcitonin sequences, and the best sequences (the calcitonin of sheep, dog, rat, and human) were used as a template to decrease the antigenicity of salmon calcitonin. The epitopic parts, i.e., amino acids 16 to 29, were identified by different servers. Hot spot residues including Y22, N26, T27, and S29 were characterized based on the main criteria of being a B-cell epitope including convexity index, hydrophilicity, and surface accessibility. These residues were replaced with lower antigenic counterparts. Results showed the final selected mutant (T27V/S29V) had a lower antigenicity and higher solubility and stability than salmon calcitonin. Thus, our suggested mutant could be a potential alternative candidate to salmon calcitonin. However, future in vitro and in vivo evaluations are needed to confirm its suitability for clinical usage.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) is now well-accepted as a complication and comorbidity of diabetes mellitus (DM), becoming a serious medical and social problem. Jiao-tai-wan (JTW), one of noted traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), showed dual therapeutic effects on DM and CI. Nevertheless, the potential mechanism is unclear. Purpose: This study sought to investigate the mechanism how JTW protected against DM and CI and screen the active component in JTW. Methods: Db/db mice were used as mouse models. Mice were treated by gavage with 0.9 % saline (0.1 mL/10g/ d), low dose of JTW (2.4 g/kg/d) or high dose of JTW (4.8 g/kg/d) for 8 weeks separately. To access the effects of JTW, the levels of OGTT, HOMA-IR, blood lipids, inflammatory cytokines in serum and hippocampus were measured, behavioral tests were conducted, and histopathological changes were observed. The mechanism exploration was performed via network pharmacology, RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence staining (IF). The impact and mechanism of coptisine in vitro were investigated using BV2 cells induced by LPS as cellular models. In vitro experiments were conducted in two parts. The first part comprised four groups: Control group, LPS group, LPS+LCOP group and LPS+HCOP group. The second part consisted of four groups: Control group, LPS group, LPS+HCOP group, and LPS+ Fed group. The western blot and RT-qPCR methods were used to examine the changes in biomarkers of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in BV2 cells. Results: The results demonstrated that JTW could improve OGTT and HOMA-IR, reduce the serum levels of LDLC, HDL-C, TG, and TC, restore neuronal dysfunction and synaptic plasticity, and decrease the deposition of A beta in the hippocampus. The findings from ELISA, IF, and RT-qPCR revealed that JTW could alleviate microglial activation and inflammatory status in vivo and coptisine could play the same role in vitro. Moreover, the changes of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in LPS-induced BV2 cells or hippocampus of db/db mice were distinctly reversed by coptisine or JTW, respectively. Conclusion: Our study suggested that JTW and its effective component coptisine could alleviate diabetes mellitusrelated cognitive impairment, closely linked to the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

AB  - Scaffold-guided breast tissue engineering (SGBTE) has the potential to transform reconstructive breast surgery. Currently, there is a deficiency in clinically relevant animal models suitable for studying novel breast tissue engineering concepts. To date, only a small number of large animal studies have been conducted and characterization of these large animal models is poorly described in the literature. Addressing this gap in the literature, this publication comprehensively describes our original porcine model based on the current published literature and the experience gained from previous animal studies conducted by our research group. In a long-term experiment using our model, we investigated our SGBTE approach by implanting 60 additively manufactured bioresorbable scaffolds under the panniculus carnosus muscle along the flanks of 12 pigs over 12 months. Our model has the flexibility to compare multiple treatment modalities where we successfully investigated scaffolds filled with various treatments of immediate and delayed fat graft and augmentation with platelet rich plasma. No wound complications were observed using our animal model. We were able to grow clinically relevant volumes of soft tissue, which validates our model. Our preclinical large animal model is ideally suited to assess different scaffold or hydrogel-driven soft tissue regeneration strategies. Impact statement The ability to regenerate soft tissue through scaffold-guided tissue engineering concepts can transform breast reconstructive surgery. We describe an original preclinical large animal model to study controlled and reproducible scaffold-guided breast tissue engineering (SGBTE) concepts. This model features the flexibility to investigate multiple treatment conditions per animal, making it an efficient model. We have validated our model with a long-term experiment over 12 months, which exceeds other shorter published studies. Our SGBTE concept provides a more clinically relevant approach in terms of breast reconstruction. Future studies using this model will support the translation of SGBTE into clinical practice.

AB  - Telomeres are increasingly recognized for their potential role in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to their involvement in cellular aging and telomerase-shelterin function. Although shorter telomeres have been observed in individuals with ASD, studies linking telomere dynamics in blood cells and brain regions remain limited. Using the valproic acid (VPA, 500 mg/kg) rodent model, this study aimed to assess the impact of three drugs commonly used in ASD treatment (amitriptyline, risperidone, and nooclerin) on telomere length and the expression of telomerase/shelterin-related genes (Dkc1, Gar1, Pot1a, Pot1b, Tep1, Terc, Terf2ip, Tert, Tinf2, Tnks, Tpp1, Trf1, and Trf2) in blood cells, the prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus of VPA-exposed Wistar rats. Telomere length and gene expression were measured using quantitative PCR. Risperidone treatment in VPA males resulted in telomere elongation and increased expression of Tnks in blood cell and Trf1, Trf2 genes in prefrontal cortex. Nooclerin treatment also showed beneficial effects on telomere length of blood cell in males, alongside increased Trf1 expression. Long telomeres in male blood cells were associated with reduced anxiety, while a positive correlation was found between Tpp1 expression and stereotypical behavior in both male and female VPA rats. These findings suggest that nooclerin and risperidone influence telomere length and gene expression related to the telomere-telomerase complex in a sex-dependent manner, offering insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ASD.

AB  - Ciborinia camelliae Kohn is a camellia pathogen belonging to family Sclerotiniaceae, infecting only flowers of camellias. To better understand the virulence mechanism in this species, the draft genome sequence of the Italian strain of C. camelliae was obtained with a hybrid approach, combining Illumina HiSeq paired reads and MinIon Nanopore long-read sequencing. This combination improved significantly the existing National Center for Biotechnology Information reference genome. The assembly contiguity was implemented decreasing the contig number from 2,604 to 49. The N-50 contig size increased from 31,803 to 2,726,972 bp and the completeness of assembly increased from 94.5 to 97.3% according to BUSCO analysis. This work is foundational to allow functional analysis of the infection process in this scarcely known floral pathogen.

AB  - The probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus fermentum ZC529 (L.f ZC529) has been identified from the colon of the Diannan small-ear (DSE) pig, but its intestinal protective function still lacks investigation. Here, we established a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced intestinal oxidative stress model in both Drosophila and porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cell lines to explore the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of L.f ZC529. The data showed that the intestinal colonization of L.f ZC529 counteracted DSS-induced intestinal oxidative stress and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by activation of the CncC pathway, a homology of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in mammalian systems. Moreover, L.f ZC529 supplementation prevented flies from DSS-induced intestinal barrier damage, inflammation, abnormal excretory function, and shortened lifespan. Finally, L.f ZC529 also attenuated DSS-induced intestinal injury in the IPEC-J2 cell line by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and inhibiting the NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Together, this study unraveled the profound intestinal protective function of L.f ZC529 and provides its potential application as a new antioxidant in improving animal intestinal health as well as in developing a new probiotic in the food industry.

AB  - The functional importance of neuronal differentiation of the transmembrane proteins' plasticity-related genes 3 (PRG3) and 5 (PRG5) has been shown. Although their sequence is closely related, they promote different morphological changes in neurons. PRG3 was shown to promote neuritogenesis in primary neurons; PRG5 contributes to spine induction in immature neurons and the regulation of spine density and morphology in mature neurons. Both exhibit intracellularly located C-termini of less than 50 amino acids. Varying C-termini suggested that these domains shape neuronal morphology differently. We generated mutant EGFP-fusion proteins in which the C-termini were either swapped between PRG3 and PRG5, deleted, or fused to another family member, plasticity-related gene 4 (PRG4), that was recently shown to be expressed in different brain regions. We subsequently analyzed the influence of overexpression in immature neurons. Our results point to a critical role of the PRG3 and PRG5 C-termini in shaping early neuronal morphology. However, the results suggest that the C-terminus alone might not be sufficient for promoting the morphological effects induced by PRG3 and PRG5.

AB  - Episodic memory is the ability to recall personally experienced events that are situated within specific spatial contexts. Within a navigation environment, salient objects can function as landmarks, and interactions with them can be encoded as distinct episodic events. However, the nuanced integration of "where" and "what" aspects of objects during episodic memory formation remains poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of neuronal responses along the rat CA1 proximodistal axis to manipulations of environmental cues and object features. Our results demonstrate that the proximal and distal portions of CA1 preferentially represent landmarks and events, respectively. Following object displacement, we identify an event-like population coding within CA1, distinct from the anticipated pattern of landmark representation. These findings elucidate the specific roles that objects may play in spatial navigation and memory encoding, providing novel insights into the selective processing of object-related information within the entorhinal-hippocampal network under varying conditions.

AB  - Background: Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder. Recently, aripiprazole, a novel antipsychotic drug, has been approved as the adjunctive therapy for the Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). However, the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of aripiprazole are not fully known. Besides the involvement of calcium signaling dysregulations in the pathophysiology of depression, there is some evidence of overexpressed CACNA1C (the gene encoding the Cav1.2 channels) following chronic stress in the brain regions, which involved in emotional and stress responses. Based on the data indicating the aripiprazole's effects on intracellular calcium levels, this study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of therapeutic effects of aripiprazole, by a focus on the modulation of CACNA1C expression, in the rat stress-induced model of depression.Methods: Using Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) model of depression, we examined the effects of aripiprazole on depressive and anxiety-like behaviors (by forced swimming test and elevated plus maze), serum IL-6 (Elisa), and cell survival (Nissl staining). In addition, CACNA1C, BDNF, and TrkB expression in the PFC and hippocampus (RT-qPCR), as well as BDNF and GAP-43 protein levels in the hippocampus (Immunohistofluorescence), have been assayed. Results: Our data indicated that aripiprazole could improve anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, decrease the serum levels of IL-6 and hippocampal cell death following CUMS. In addition, we showed the significant modulation on overexpressed CACNA1C, as well as downregulated BDNF and GAP-43 expressionDiscussion: These results demonstrate that aripiprazole may promote synaptic plasticity by improving the expression of BDNF and gap-43. In addition, inflammation reduction and CACNA1C expression downregulation may be some of mechanisms by which aripiprazole alleviates chronic stress-induced hippocampal cell death and play its pivotal antidepressant role.

AB  - Aim Pterygium is a common ocular surface disease, which is affected by a variety of factors. Invasion of the cornea can cause severe vision loss. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common post-transcriptional modification of eukaryotic mRNA, which can regulate mRNA splicing, stability, nuclear transport, and translation. To our best knowledge, there is no current research on the mechanism of m6A in pterygium. Methods We obtained 24 pterygium tissues and 24 conjunctival tissues from each of 24 pterygium patients recruited from Shanghai Yangpu Hospital, and the level of m6A modification was detected using an m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit. Expression and location of METTL3, a key m6A methyltransferase, were identified by immunostaining. Then we used m6A-modified RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and bioinformatics analyses to compare the differential expression of m6A methylation in pterygium and normal conjunctival tissue. Results We identified 2,949 dysregulated m6A peaks in pterygium tissue, of which 2,145 were significantly upregulated and 804 were significantly downregulated. The altered m6A peak of genes were found to play a key role in the Hippo signaling pathway and endocytosis. Joint analyses of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq data identified 72 hypermethylated m6A peaks and 15 hypomethylated m6A peaks in mRNA. After analyzing the differentially methylated m6A peaks and synchronously differentially expressed genes, we searched the Gene Expression Omnibus database and identified five genes related to the development of pterygium (DSP, MXRA5, ARHGAP35, TMEM43, and OLFML2A). Conclusion Our research shows that m6A modification plays an important role in the development of pterygium and can be used as a potential new target for the treatment of pterygium in the future.

AB  - The pandemic and other environmental conditions have increased the use of masks as a precautionary measure. It is an effective way to protect ourselves from viruses/pollution/ and other health-affecting environmental factors. However, for smart devices such as smartphones with face locks, attendance systems, and smart surveillance cameras with enabled face recognition, these masks raised another challenge of masked face recognition. Masked face recognition is an increased subset challenge of the standard face recognition problem as they lack facial features. The masked images are occluded, making the structure and the facial features of the non-occluded region of importance. This paper presents a novel two-fold approach KInsight (K Nearest Neighbor-based Insight Face algorithm) for masked face detection using antelopev2, which uses a RetinaFace detection algorithm and a ResNet100 Convolutional Neural Network for face detection and embedding generation. Further, we propose to use a KNN classifier for masked face recognition. Several experiments have compared the proposed scheme's performance with important research contributions. Experimental results show that the scheme significantly outperforms several benchmark approaches with an accuracy of around 98.5%.

AB  - The hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial navigation and episodic memory. However, research on in vivo hippocampal activity dynamics mostly relies on single modalities, such as electrical recordings or optical im-aging, with respectively limited spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we develop the E-Cannula, integrating fully transparent graphene microelectrodes with imaging cannula, which enables simultaneous electrical recording and two-photon calcium imaging from the exact same neural populations across an anatomically extended region of the mouse hippocampal CA1 stably across several days. The large-scale multimodal re-cordings show that sharp wave ripples (SWRs) exhibit spatiotemporal wave patterns along multiple axes in two-dimensional (2D) space with different spatial extents and temporal propagation modes. Notably, distinct SWR wave patterns are associated with the selective recruitment of orthogonal CA1 cell assemblies. These results demonstrate the utility of the E-Cannula as a versatile neurotechnology with the potential for future integration with other optical components.

AB  - There is substantial evidence that anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants have neuroprotective properties and may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In this regard, the effects of oxaprozin (OXP) (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) on the experimental model of seizure and memory impairment caused by seizures in rats were investigated in the present study. Seizures in male Wistar rats (200-250 g, 8 weeks) were induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 60 mg/kg). The anticonvulsant effects of OXP (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) were evaluated in the seizure model. The effect on memory was assessed using the passive avoidance (PA) test. After behavioral tests, the animals underwent deep anesthesia and were euthanized painlessly. Animal serum was isolated for antioxidant assays (MDA and GPx). The animals' brains (hippocampus) were also isolated to gauge the relative expression of genes in the oxidative stress pathway (Nrf2/HO-1). Intraperitoneal injection of OXP decreased the mean score on the Racine scale compared to the PTZ group. Moreover, in the PA test, OXP caused a significant increase in retention latency (RL) and total time spent in the light compartment (TLC) compared to the PTZ group. Biochemical tests showed that OXP was able to significantly increase GPx serum levels and significantly reduce MDA serum levels compared to the PTZ group. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results also revealed that OXP counteracted the negative effects of PTZ by significantly increasing the expression of the Nrf2 and Hmox1 genes. Overall, this study suggests the potential neuroprotective effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug OXP in a model of memory impairment caused by seizures via inhibition of the oxidative stress pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Jiao-Tai-Wan (JTW) is a very famous traditional Chinese medicine formula for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, especially in anxiety, insomnia and depression. However, its molecular mechanism of treatment remains indistinct. Aim of the study: We aimed to reveal the action mechanism of JTW on anti-depression via inhibiting microglia activation and pro-inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. Material and methods: The corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression mouse model was used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of JTW. Behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, tail suspension and forced swim test) were conducted to evaluate the effect of JTW on depressive-like behaviors. The levels of inflammatory factors and the concentration of neurotransmitters were detected by RT-qPCR or ELISA assays. Then three hippocampal tissue samples per group (Control, CORT, and JTW group) were sent for RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Transcriptomics data analysis was used to screen the key potential therapeutic targets and signaling pathways of JTW. Based on 8 bioactive species of JTW by our previous study using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, molecular docking analyses were used to predict the interaction of JTWderived compounds and depression targets. Finally, the results of transcriptome and molecular docking analyses were combined to verify the targets, key pathways, and efficacy of JTW treatment in vivo and vitro. Results: JTW ameliorated CORT-induced depressive-like behaviors, neuronal damage and enhanced the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the serum of mice. JTW also inhibited CORT-induced inflammatory activation of microglia and decreased the serum levels of interleukin- 6(IL-6) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL-1 beta) in vivo. Transcriptomic data analysis showed there were 10 key driver analysis (KDA) genes with the strongest correlation which JTW regulated in depression mice. Molecular docking analysis displayed bioactive compound Magnoflorine had the strongest binding force to the key gene colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), which is the signaling microglia dependent upon for their survival. Meanwhile, CSF1R staining showed it was consistent with inflammatory activation of microglia. Our vitro experiment also showed JTW and CSF1R inhibitor significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)-induced inflammatory activation response in macrophage cells. Conclusions: Our study suggests that JTW might ameliorate CORT-induced neuronal damage in depression mice by inhibiting CSF1R mediated microglia activation and pro-inflammatory response.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dihuang Yinzi (DHYZ) is a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine. Its therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely validated. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of DHYZ in AD treatment remain unclear and require further research. Aim of the study: Elucidating DHYZ's promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis through the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway improves neuronal loss, mitochondrial damage, and memory deficits in AD. Materials and methods: Administering DHYZ by gavage to SAMP8 mice, after completing behavioral tests, the effects of DHYZ on hippocampal neuron loss and mitochondrial structural damage in AD model mice were assessed using Nissl staining and transmission electron microscopy. Western blot was used to detect the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins PGC-1 alpha, CREB, mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2, and mitochondrial fission proteins DRP1 and FIS1. At the same time, immunofluorescence (IF) was employed to measure the relative fluorescence intensity of mitochondrial fusion protein MFN1. After determining the optimal dose of DYHZ for treating AD, we conducted mechanistic studies. By intraperitoneally injecting SAMP8 mice with the AMPK inhibitor (Compound C) to inhibit AMPK protein expression and subsequently treating them with DHYZ, the impact of DHYZ on hippocampal neurons in AD model mice was evaluated using Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of AMPK, p-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1 alpha, NRF1, and TFAM. In contrast, IF was used to measure the relative fluorescence intensity of PGC-1 alpha, NRF1, and TFAM proteins in the hippocampal CA1 region. Results: DHYZ significantly improved AD model mice's cognitive impairment and memory deficits and mitigated hippocampal neuron loss and degeneration. Additionally, it ameliorated mitochondrial morphological structures. DHYZ upregulated the protein expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins PGC-1 alpha, CREB, and mitochondrial fusion proteins MFN1 and MFN2 while inhibiting the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins DRP1 and FIS1. Further studies revealed that DHYZ could upregulate the expression of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway proteins and their downstream proteins NRF1 and TFAM. Conclusion: DHYZ promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by activating the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway, thereby improving memory deficits, neuronal loss, and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.

AB  - The Lomas formations are ephemeral seasonal oases found along the Pacific arid coast of South America. Whereas fast-growing plants are characteristic in the Lomas, other organisms such as land snails are also conspicuous. In the Lomas, several snails can occur sympatrically and therefore they might have adapted their food requirements to the limited available items while avoiding competing for food (resource partitioning). Since the dietary items and food preferences of Lomas' snails are almost completely unknown, our study aimed to document these in three snails occurring sympatrically, two native (Succinea peruviana and Bostryx conspersus) and one introduced (Cornu aspersum) species in Lomas de Lucumo, a threatened Lomas from Central Peru. We recorded the snails' activity, host, and food items. We also carried out dual-choice bioassays to evaluate the feeding preferences of B. conspersus and C. aspersum when offered leaf disks of the two dominant plant Lomas species, Senecio abadianus and Sicyos baderoa. Whereas we were unable to record any food item used by C. aspersum, we recorded the two native Lomas species (B. conspersus and S. peruviana) having contrasting patterns of feeding as they were on different hosts (plants vs soil) and food items (vascular plants vs. lichens/ organic material/mosses/algae). Although the feeding preferences were similar between B. conspersus and C. aspersum (i.e., both species preferred the leaves of Si. baderoa over Se. abadianus), C. aspersum, after feeding stimulation, consumed significantly less leaf area of Se. abadianus than B. conspersus. Sicyos individuals are fastgrowing plants and might be less herbivore-resistant, while Senecio species are characterized to produce defensive alkaloids which make plants less palatable. Our results indicate that Lomas' snail species have evolved distinct trophic niches by partitioning the limited food resources and native herbivorous species are better adapted to feed on Lomas' native plants given their common evolutionary history.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is a common central nervous system complication that occurs following surgery or organs damage outside the nervous system. Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the molecular mechanisms of cognitive impairment. Dexmedetomidine alleviates neuroinflammation and reduces cognitive dysfunction incidence; however, the mechanism by which dexmedetomidine alleviates cognitive dysfunction remains unclear. This study evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine on attenuation of early cognitive impairment induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion in mice and examined whether the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LCNE) system participates in the anti-inflammatory effect of dexmedetomidine. The superior mesenteric artery was clamped for 45 min to induce intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury. Dexmedetomidine alone or combined with DSP-4, a selective locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurotoxin, was used for pretreatment. Postoperative cognition was assessed using the Morris water maze. Serum and hippocampal levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, norepinephrine (NE), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to evaluate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the locus coeruleus, hippocampal microglia, and intestinal injury. Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine alleviated intestinal injury and decreased the serum and hippocampal levels of NE, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and MDA at 24 h after intestinal ischemia reperfusion, decreased TH-positive neurons in the locus coeruleus, and ameliorated cognitive impairment. Similarly, DSP-4 pre-treatment alleviated neuroinflammation and improved cognitive function. Furthermore, alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist atipamezole or yohimbine administration diminished the neuroprotective effects and improved cognitive function with dexmedetomidine. Therefore, dexmedetomidine attenuated early cognitive dysfunction induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice, which may be related to its anti-inflammatory effects through the LCNE system.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi Decoction(BZYQD) is a traditional formula commonly used in China, known for its effects in tonifying Qi and raising Yang. It can relieve symptoms of cognitive impairment such as forgetfulness and lack of concentration caused by qi deficiency, which is common in aging and debilitating. However, much of the current research on BZYQD has been focused on its impact on the digestive system, leaving its molecular mechanisms in improving cognitive function largely unexplored. Aim of the study: Cognitive decline in the aging central nervous system is intrinsically linked to oxidative damage. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of BZYQD in treating mild cognitive impairment caused by qi deficiency, particularly through repair of mitochondrial oxidative damage. Materials and methods: A rat model of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was established by administering reserpine subcutaneously for two weeks, followed by a two-week treatment with BZYQD/GBE. In vitro experiments were conducted to assess the effects of BZYQD on neuronal cells using a H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damage model in PC12 cells. The open field test and the Morris water maze test evaluated the cognitive and learning memory abilities of the rats. HE staining and TEM were employed to observe morphological changes in the hippocampus and its mitochondria. Mitochondrial activity, ATP levels, and cellular viability were measured using assay kits. Protein expression in the SIRT3/MnSOD/OGG1 pathway was analyzed in tissues and cells through western blotting. Levels of 8-OH-dG in mitochondria extracted from tissues and cells were quantified using ELISA. Mitochondrial morphology in PC12 cells was visualized using Mito Red, and mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the JC-1 kit. Results: BZYQD treatment significantly improved cognitive decline caused by reserpine in rats, as well as enhanced mitochondrial morphology and function in the hippocampus. Our findings indicate that BZYQD mitigates mtDNA oxidative damage in rats by modulating the SIRT3/MnSOD/OGG1 pathway. In PC12 cells, BZYQD reduced oxidative damage to mitochondria and mtDNA in H 2 O 2 -induced conditions and was associated with changes in the SIRT3/MnSOD/OGG1 pathway. Conclusion: BZYQD effectively counteracts reserpine-induced mild cognitive impairment and ameliorates mitochondrial oxidative stress damage through the SIRT3/MnSOD/OGG1 pathway.

AB  - The localization, expression, and physiological role of regulatory proteins in the neurogenic niches of the brain is fundamental to our understanding of adult neurogenesis. This study explores the expression and role of the E3-ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl, in neurogenesis within the subventricular zone (SVZ) of mice. In vitro neurosphere assays and in vivo analyses were performed in specific c-Cbl knock-out lines to unravel c-Cbl's role in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. Our findings suggest that c-Cbl is significantly expressed within EGFR-expressing cells, playing a pivotal role in neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation. However, c-Cbl's function extends beyond EGFR signaling, as its loss upon knock-out stimulated progenitor cell proliferation in neurosphere cultures. Yet, this effect was not detected in hippocampal progenitor cells, reflecting the lack of the EGFR in the hippocampus. In vivo, c-Cbl exerted only a minor proneurogenic influence with no measurable impact on the formation of adult-born neurons. In conclusion, c-Cbl regulates neural stem cells in the subventricular zone via the EGFR pathway but, likely, its loss is compensated by other signaling modules in vivo.

AB  - Aim: This study investigates the effects of ginsenoside Rb1 (GsRb1) on methamphetamine (METH)-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. It also examines whether GsRb1 can regulate these effects through the NR2B/ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways.
   Methods: SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with GsRb1 (20 mu M and 40 mu M) for 1 h, followed by METH treatment (2 mM) for 24 h. Rats were treated with METH (2 mg/kg) or saline on alternating days for 10 days to allow CPP to be examined. GsRb1 (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before METH or saline. Western blot was used to examine the protein expression of NR2B, ERK, P-ERK, CREB, P-CREB, and BDNF in the SH-SY5Y cells and the rats' hippocampus, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and prefrontal cortex (PFC).
   Results: METH dose-dependently reduced the viability of SH-SY5Y cells. Pretreatment of cells with 40 mu M of GsRb1 increased cell viability and reduced the expression of METH-induced NR2B, p-ERK, p-CREB and BDNF. GsRb1 also attenuated the expression of METH CPP in a dose-dependent manner in rats. Further, GsRb1 dose-dependently reduced the expression of METH-induced NR2B, p-ERK, p-CREB, and BDNF in the PFC, hippocampus, and NAc of rats.
   Conclusion: GsRb1 regulated METH-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and METH-induced CPP through the NR2B/ERK/CREB/BDNF regulatory pathway. GsRb1 could be a therapeutic target for treating METH-induced neurotoxicity or METH addiction. (C) 2021 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Context Tanshinone IIA is an extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Labiatae) used to treat cardiovascular disorders. It shows potential anticonvulsant and cognition-protective properties. Objective We investigated the mechanism of tanshinone IIA on antiepileptic and cognition-protective effects in the model of epileptic rats. Materials and methods Lithium chloride (LiCl)-pilocarpine-induced epileptic Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the following groups (n = 12): control (blank), model, sodium valproate (VPA, 189 mg/kg/d, positive control), tanshinone IIA low dose (TS IIA-L, 10 mg/kg/d), medium dose (TS IIA-M, 20 mg/kg/d) and high dose (TS IIA-H, 30 mg/kg/d). Then, epileptic behavioural observations, Morris water maze test, Timm staining, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, western blotting and RT-qPCR were measured. Results Compared with the model group, tanshinone IIA reduced the frequency and severity of seizures, improved cognitive impairment, and inhibited hippocampal mossy fibre sprouting score (TS IIA-M 1.50 +/- 0.22, TS IIA-H 1.17 +/- 0.31 vs. model 2.83 +/- 0.31), as well as improved the ultrastructural disorder. Tanshinone IIA increased levels of synapse-associated proteins synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic dense substance 95 (PSD-95) (SYN: TS IIA 28.82 +/- 2.51, 33.18 +/- 2.89, 37.29 +/- 1.69 vs. model 20.23 +/- 3.96; PSD-95: TS IIA 23.10 +/- 0.91, 26.82 +/- 1.41, 27.00 +/- 0.80 vs. model 18.28 +/- 1.01). Discussion and conclusions Tanshinone IIA shows antiepileptic and cognitive function-improving effects, primarily via regulating synaptic plasticity. This research generates a theoretical foundation for future research on potential clinical applications for tanshinone IIA.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis by promoting proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) and oleanolic acid (OA) are small, bioactive compounds found in ginseng that can promote NSC proliferation and neural differentiation in vitro. However, it is currently unknown whether PPD or OA can attenuate cognitive deficits by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo in a transgenic APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Here, we administered PPD or OA to APP/PS1 mice and monitored the effects on cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis.
   Methods: We used the Morris water maze, Y maze, and open field tests to compare the cognitive capacities of treated and untreated APP/PS1 mice. We investigated hippocampal neurogenesis using Nissl staining and BrdU/NeuN double labeling. NSC proliferation was quantified by Sox2 labeling of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We used western blotting to determine the effects of PPD and OA on Wnt/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathway activation in the hippocampus.
   Results: Both PPD and OA significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairments observed in untreated APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, PPD and OA significantly promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and NSC proliferation. At the mechanistic level, PPD and OA treatments resulted in Wnt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin pathway activation in the hippocampus.
   Conclusion: PPD and OA ameliorate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis, achieved by stimulating the Wnt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin pathway. As such, PPD and OA are promising novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2020 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ginkgo biloba L., a traditional medicinal plant with a long history of use in China, has been widely employed to promote blood circulation, relieve asthma, and enhance memory. It is also used in the management of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions in various traditional practices. Although Ginkgo biloba shows promise in improving cognitive function and vascular health, its specific efficacy and underlying mechanism in cerebral small vessel disease remain unclear. Aim of the study: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), a leading cause of cognitive decline and dementia, currently lacks effective treatment options. As a new generation extract of Ginkgo biloba L., Ginkgo biloba extract 50 (GBE50) was developed to investigate its potential therapeutic effects on CSVD and the underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: The bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model was established in mice using microcoils, followed by therapeutic intervention. Cognitive function was assessed via the Morris water maze and Ymaze tests, while motor activity was evaluated using the open-field test. White matter and neuronal damage were analyzed through MRI, Luxol Fast Blue staining, and Nissl staining. The blood-active ingredients of GBE50 were identified using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Network pharmacology was applied to predict potential therapeutic targets of GBE50 against CSVD, and molecular docking was conducted to evaluate the binding interactions between key compounds and related proteins. The predicted targets and pathways were further validated through reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR, Western blot, and biochemical assays). Results: GBE50 significantly improved cognitive impairment in BCAS mice. MRI and histological analyses confirmed that GBE50 alleviated white matter lesions and hippocampal neuronal loss. Twenty ingredients, including quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin, were identified in GBE50, with 80 potential therapeutic targets. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between key GBE50 compounds and apoptosisrelated proteins such as CASP3, CASP9, BAX, BCL-2, and Cytochrome c. Twenty key genes were also validated by RT-qPCR. BCAS induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial apoptosis-related gene expression, which were mitigated by GBE50. BCAS increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the NADP+/NADPH ratio while decreasing superoxide dismutase (SOD), and these imbalances were reversed by GBE50. Expression of Cytochrome c, BAX, and CASP3 was elevated, whereas BCL-2 was reduced in BCAS mice, effects counteracted by GBE50. Conclusions: GBE50 alleviates cognitive impairment, white matter lesions, and neuronal loss in CSVD, potentially by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis.

AB  - Context Lantana camara Linn. (Verbenaceae) is used for improving memory in certain African societies. Objective This study investigated the effect of prophylactic treatment with hydroethanolic leaf extract of Lantana camara (LCE) on short-term memory deficit and neuroinflammation induced with scopolamine in zebrafish and mice. Materials and methods Zebrafish (AB strain) and mice (ICR) were given donepezil (0.65 mg/kg, oral) and LCE (10, 30, 100 mg/kg, oral) for 7, and 10 days, respectively, before induction of cognitive impairment with scopolamine immersion (200 mu M) and intraperitoneal injection (2 mg/kg), respectively. Spatial short-term memory was assessed in zebrafish using both Y- and T-mazes, whereas Y-maze was used in mice. Mice hippocampal and cortical tissues were analyzed for mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX-2) using qRT-PCR. Results In the zebrafish Y-maze, LCE (10 and 100 mg/kg) increased time spent in the novel arm by 55.89 +/- 5.70%, and 68.21 +/- 2.75%, respectively, but not at 30 mg/kg. In the zebrafish T-maze, there was an increase in time spent in the food-containing arm at 30 (44.23 +/- 2.13) and 100 mg/kg (52.30 +/- 1.94). In the mouse Y-maze, spontaneous alternation increased by 52.89 +/- 4.98% at only 10 mg/kg. LCE (10, 30, 100 mg/kg) inhibited proinflammatory gene (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX-2) mRNA expression, with the highest inhibitory effect on IL-6 in both the hippocampus (83.27 +/- 2.49%; 100 mg/kg) and the cortex (98.74 +/- 0.11%; 10 mg/kg). Discussion and conclusion LCE ameliorated scopolamine-induced AD in both zebrafish and mice.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of hatching enzymes on the egg envelope digestion during the hatching period in the male brooding seahorse. The complementary DNAs encoding two hatching-enzyme genes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), were cloned and functionally characterized from the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus). The genomic-synteny analysis confirmed that teleosts shared LCE gene synteny. In contrast, the genomic location of HCE was found to be conserved with pipefish, but not other teleosts, suggesting that translocation into a novel genomic location occurred. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that HCE and LCE mRNAs were expressed in hatching gland cells. To determine the digestion mechanisms of HCE and LCE in hatching, recombinant HCE and LCE were generated and their enzyme activities were examined using fertilized egg envelopes and synthetic peptides. Seahorse HCE and LCE independently digested and softened the egg envelopes of the lined seahorse. Although the egg envelope was digested more following HCE and LCE co-treatment, envelope solubilization was not observed. Indeed, both HCE and LCE showed similar substrate specificities toward four different synthetic peptides designed from the cleavage sites of egg envelope proteins. HCE and LCE proteins from other euteleostean fishes showed different specificities, and the egg envelope was solubilized by the cooperative action of HCE and LCE. These results suggest that the function of LCE was degenerated in the lined seahorse. Our results imply a digestion mechanism for evolutionary adaptation in ovoviviparous fish with male pregnancy.

AB  - In this work, based on Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce3+) transparent ceramic and (Sr, Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphors, novel green-light-emitting materials were systematically studied. YAG:Ce3+ transparent ceramics with different doping-concentrations, from 0% to 1% (Sr, Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphors, were fabricated by dry pressing and vacuum sintering. The serial phosphor ceramics had 533 nm green-light emission when excited by 460 nm blue light. The PL, PLE, and chromaticity performances were measured, indicating that more of the green-light component was emitted with the increase in doping concentration. The addition of (Sr, Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor increased the green-light wavelength area and improved the quantum yield (QY) of the YAG:Ce3+ ceramic matrix. The phase composition, microstructure, crystal-field structure and phosphor distribution of (Sr, Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor-doped YAG:Ce3+ transparent ceramics were investigated, to explore the microscopic causes of the spectral changes. Impressively, (Sr, Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphors were distributed homogeneously, and the pinning effect of phosphor caused the suppression of grain growth. The novel materials could provide an effective strategy for full-spectrum white lighting and displaying applications in the future.

AB  - Author summary Place cells are hippocampal cells that have spatially constrained receptive fields, the place field. These cells have been widely studied in the context of navigation, more recently using virtual reality environments in combination with optical methods of recording neuronal activity. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding how to identify place cells in these data. In this study we tested the sensitivity and specificity of four methods of identifying place cells. By comparing these methods and quantifying the populations of place cells they identify, we aimed to increase our understanding of exactly the populations that are currently being studied under the name "place cells". Although the appropriate method may depend on the experimental design, we generally recommend a single method going forward, which will increase consensus within the field about what should be included in a place cell population, and allow us to better compare results between studies.
   Place cells, spatially responsive hippocampal cells, provide the neural substrate supporting navigation and spatial memory. Historically most studies of these neurons have used electrophysiological recordings from implanted electrodes but optical methods, measuring intracellular calcium, are becoming increasingly common. Several methods have been proposed as a means to identify place cells based on their calcium activity but there is no common standard and it is unclear how reliable different approaches are. Here we tested four methods that have previously been applied to two-photon hippocampal imaging or electrophysiological data, using both model datasets and real imaging data. These methods use different parameters to identify place cells, including the peak activity in the place field, compared to other locations (the Peak method); the stability of cells' activity over repeated traversals of an environment (Stability method); a combination of these parameters with the size of the place field (Combination method); and the spatial information held by the cells (Information method). The methods performed differently from each other on both model and real data. In real datasets, vastly different numbers of place cells were identified using the four methods, with little overlap between the populations identified as place cells. Therefore, choice of place cell detection method dramatically affects the number and properties of identified cells. Ultimately, we recommend the Peak method be used in future studies to identify place cell populations, as this method is robust to moderate variations in place field within a session, and makes no inherent assumptions about the spatial information in place fields, unless there is an explicit theoretical reason for detecting cells with more narrowly defined properties.

AB  - Depression is a disorder caused by various reasons, with low mood as the main symptom, and it has a serious impact on mental health. Liraglutide (Lir) has been confirmed to alleviate neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviours induced by chronic stress, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the regulation of Lir for microglia-associated inflammation in depression through network pharmacology. In vivo experiments demonstrate that Lir reduces depressive-like behaviours by activating Nrf2 and subsequently downregulating HMGB1 expression, while also reducing the generation of pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress damage. In vitro studies confirmed that the downregulation of HMGB1 depends on Nrf2 activation, and Lir activates Nrf2 via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, indirect co-culture of BV2 and HT22 cells demonstrated Lir's neuroprotective effects against neuronal apoptosis, consistent with findings from in vivo experiments. The study results first demonstrate that Lir exerts antidepressant effects through the PI3K/Nrf2/HMGB1 pathway, which reveals a novel mechanism of action for the antidepressant effects of Lir.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to explore the effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in aging mice and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which aerobic exercise ameliorates cognitive decline through the regulation of gut microbiota-metabolite network. By providing novel insights into the interplay between exercise, gut microbiota, and cognitive health, this research seeks to offer a robust theoretical foundation for developing anti-aging strategies and personalized exercise interventions targeting aging-related cognitive dysfunction. Methods Using naturally aged C57BL/6 mice as the experimental model, this study employed a multi-omics approach combining 16S rRNA sequencing and wide-targeted metabolomics analysis. A total of 18 mice were divided into 3 groups: young control (YC, 4-month-old), old control (OC, 21-month-old), and old+exercise (OE, 21-month-old with 12 weeks of moderate-intensity treadmill training) groups. Behavioral assessments, including the Morris water maze (MWM) test, were conducted to evaluate cognitive function. Histopathological examinations of brain tissue sections provided morphological evidence of neuronal changes. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota and metabolite profiling via 16S rRNA sequencing and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). Data were analyzed using a combination of statistical and bioinformatics tools to identify differentially abundant microbial taxa and metabolites and to construct interaction networks between them. Results Behavioral tests revealed that 12 weeks of aerobic exercise significantly improved spatial learning and memory capacity of aged mice, as evidenced by reduced escape latency and increased target area exploration and platform crossings in the MWM. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that exercise mitigated aging-related neuronal damage in the hippocampus, enhancing neuronal density and morphology. 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that exercise increased gut microbiota alpha-diversity and enriched beneficial bacterial genera, including Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, and Rikenella. Metabolomics analysis identified 32 differentially regulated metabolites between OC and OE groups, with 94 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated in the OE group when compared with OC group. These metabolites were primarily involved in energy metabolism reprogramming (e. g., L-homocitrulline), antioxidant defense (e. g., L-carnosine), neuroprotection (e. g., lithocholic acid), and DNA repair (e. g., ADP-ribose). Network analysis further revealed strong positive correlations between specific bacteria and metabolites, such as Parabacteroides with ADP-ribose and Bifidobacterium with lithocholic acid, suggesting potential neuroprotective pathways mediated by the gut microbiota-metabolite axis. Conclusion This study provides comprehensive evidence that aerobic exercise elicits cognitive benefits in aging mice by modulating the gut microbiota-metabolite network. These findings highlight three key mechanisms: (1) the proliferation of beneficial gut bacteria enhances metabolic reprogramming to boost DNA repair pathways; (2) elevated neuroinflammationinhibiting factors reduce neurodegenerative changes; and (3) enhanced antioxidant defenses maintain neuronal homeostasis. These results underscore the critical role of the "microbiota-metabolite-brain" axis in mediating the cognitive benefits of aerobic exercise.
   This study not only advances our understanding of the gut-brain axis in aging but also offers a scientific basis for developing personalized exercise and probiotic-based interventions targeting aging-related cognitive decline. Future research should further validate these mechanisms in non-human primates and human clinical trials to establish the translational potential of exercise-induced gut microbiotametabolite modulation for combating neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Our brain is continuously challenged by daily experiences. Thus, how to avoid systematic erasing of previously encoded memories? While it has been proposed that a dual-learning system with 'slow' learning in the cortex and 'fast' learning in the hippocampus could protect previous knowledge from interference, this has never been observed in the living organism. Here, we report that increasing plasticity via the viral-induced overexpression of RGS14414 in the prelimbic cortex leads to better one-trial memory, but that this comes at the price of increased interference in semantic-like memory. Indeed, electrophysiological recordings showed that this manipulation also resulted in shorter NonREM-sleep bouts, smaller delta-waves and decreased neuronal firing rates. In contrast, hippocampal-cortical interactions in form of theta coherence during wake and REM-sleep as well as oscillatory coupling during NonREM-sleep were enhanced. Thus, we provide the first experimental evidence for the long-standing and unproven fundamental idea that high thresholds for plasticity in the cortex protect preexisting memories and modulating these thresholds affects both memory encoding and consolidation mechanisms.

AB  - Brain fuel (specifically, glucose) supply and metabolism are well-established to be limiting factors for cognitive performance, with the largest body of data being for hippocampally mediated tasks. Consistent with this, disease states such as Alzheimer's disease and insulin-resistant diabetes, that impair cognitive metabolism, impair cognition with this being shown again most prominently for hippocampally mediated processes. In addition to glucose supplied from the blood, brain oxidative metabolism can use local glycogen stores (within astrocytes) as a fuel source via conversion to lactate; both lactate and glycogen have been shown to be important contributors to regulation of cognitive metabolism. Insulin has been shown to be a key regulator of hippocampal cognitive and metabolic processes; in the periphery, insulin facilitates glycogen synthesis and storage, but the impact on brain glycogen is unclear. Furthermore, the impact of diet-induced diabetes on hippocampal glycogen levels and/or metabolism is unknown. Here, we show that in rats with high-fat diet-induced diabetes, hippocampal glycogen is reduced and is less responsive to acute intrahippocampal administration of insulin, which significantly reduces glycogen in the hippocampi of control animals: Our data suggest that impaired fuel availability from glycogen may be a contributing factor to the cognitive impairment seen in disease states that include central insulin resistance.image

AB  - The presence of neurofibrillary tangles containing hyper-phosphorylated tau is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand sensitive to tau neurofibrillary tangles (F-18-AV1451) also binds with iron. This off-target binding effect may be enhanced in older adults on the AD spectrum, particularly those with amyloid-positive biomarkers. Here, we examined group differences in F-18-AV1451 PET after controlling for iron-sensitive measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its relationships to tissue microstructure and cognition in 40 amyloid beta positive (A beta+) individuals, 20 amyloid beta negative (A beta-) with MCI and 31 A beta- control participants. After controlling for iron, increased F-18-AV1451 PET uptake was found in the temporal lobe and hippocampus of A beta+ participants compared to A beta- MCI and control participants. Within the A beta+ group, significant correlations were seen between F-18-AV1451 PET uptake and tissue microstructure and these correlations remained significant after controlling for iron. These findings indicate that off-target binding of iron to the F-18-AV1451 ligand may not affect its sensitivity to A beta status or cognition in early-stage AD.

AB  - Introduction Gastrointestinal (GI) in vitro models have received lasting attention as an effective tool to model drug and nutrient absorption, study GI diseases, and design new drug delivery vehicles. A complete model of the GI epithelium should at a minimum include the two key functional components of the GI tract: mucus and the underlying epithelium. Mucus plays a key role in protecting and lubricating the GI tract, poses a barrier to orally administered therapies and pathogens, and serves as the microenvironment for the GI microbiome. These functions are reliant on the biophysical material properties of the mucus produced, including viscosity and pore size. Methods In this study, we generated in vitro models containing Caco-2 enterocyte-like cells and HT29-MTX goblet-like cells and determined the effects of coculture and mucus layer on epithelial permeability and biophysical properties of mucus using multiple particle tracking (MPT). Results We found that mucus height increased as the amount of HT29-MTX goblet-like cells increased. Additionally, we found that increasing the amount of HT29-MTX goblet-like cells within culture corresponded to an increase in mucus pore size and mucus microviscosity, measured using MPT. When compared to ex vivo mucus samples from mice and pigs, we found that a 90:10 ratio of Caco-2:HT29-MTX coculture displayed similar mucus pore size to porcine jejunum and that the mucus produced from 90:10 and 80:20 ratios of cells shared mechanical properties to porcine jejunum and ileum mucus. Conclusions GI coculture models are valuable tools in simulating the mucus barrier and can be utilized for a variety of applications including the study of GI diseases, food absorption, or therapeutic development.

AB  - Sauropods were a successful group of herbivorous dinosaurs that colonised all continents throughout the Mesozoic. At first glance, the organisms in this group present a conservative shape of quadrupedal animals with elongated necks and tails. However, there was great diversification in the morphology of sauropods, which is still poorly understood in detail, especially during the Early Cretaceous. In this study, we describe a new ichnosite dated from the earliest stages of the Cretaceous of Brazil. The site includes a well-preserved trackway of a large sauropod dinosaur, with manus and pes prints, as well as tracks of theropods and indeterminate tetrapods. The sauropod trackway shows a unique set of characteristics that allowed the erection of a new ichnogenus and ichnospecies, Sousatitanosauripus robsoni igen. nov. et isp. nov. The probable trackmaker was a Titanosauriformes with a mosaic of basal and advanced features, bringing new insights into the diversity and evolution of the group.

AB  - BackgroundPostoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a prevalent complication following anesthesia and surgery, particularly in the elderly, leading to increased mortality and reduced quality of life. Despite its prevalence, there are no effective clinical treatments. Exercise has shown cognitive benefits in aging and various diseases, which can be transferred to sedentary animals through plasma. However, it is unclear if exercise-conditioned plasma can replicate these benefits in the context of POCD.MethodsSixteen-month-old male C57BL/6J mice underwent 30 days of voluntary running wheel training or received systemic administration of exercise-conditioned plasma, followed by tibial fracture surgery under general anesthesia at 17 months of age. Cognitive performance, hippocampal synaptic deficits, neuroinflammation, BDNF/TrkB signaling, and medial septum (MS)-hippocampal cholinergic activity were evaluated through immunohistochemical staining, transmission electron microscopy, Western blotting, and biochemical assays. To investigate the role of hippocampal BDNF signaling and cholinergic activity in the therapeutic effects, the TrkB antagonist ANA-12 and the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) antagonist trihexyphenidyl (THP) were administered via intraperitoneal injection, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing Chrm1 shRNA were delivered via intrahippocampal stereotaxic microinjection.ResultsExercise-conditioned plasma mimicked the benefits of exercise, alleviating cognitive decline induced by anesthesia/surgery, restoring hippocampal synapse formation and levels of regulators for synaptic plasticity, inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses to surgery by microglia and astrocytes, augmenting BDNF production and TrkB phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, upregulating MS expression of choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) and hippocampal expression of CHRM1 in neurons and astrocytes, and enhancing hippocampal cholinergic innervation and acetylcholine release. Conversely, ANA-12 administration blocked TrkB activation and reduced the protective effects on cognition, synaptic deficits, and neuroinflammatory reactivity of glial cells post-surgery. Similarly, THP administration or intrahippocampal delivery of AAV-Chrm1 shRNA inhibited the activation of the hippocampal cholinergic circuit by exercise plasma, negating the cognitive and neuropathological benefits and reducing BDNF/TrkB signaling enhancements.ConclusionExercise-conditioned plasma can replicate the protective effects of exercise against anesthesia/surgery-induced neuroinflammation, synaptic, and cognitive impairments, at least partly, through CHRM1-dependent regulation of hippocampal cholinergic activity and BDNF/TrkB signaling.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is the second most consumed beverage worldwide, playing a key role in the human diet. Tea is considered a healthy drink, as its consumption has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease-related events and death, stroke, metabolic syndrome and obesity. However, several studies have shown that C. sinensis is a hyperaccumulator of Al and other elements that are considered potentially toxic. In the present study, the contents of 15 elements (both essential and toxic) were determined for the first time in tea leaves collected in tea gardens located in six different European countries and processed to provide black and green tea. The results showed that Al was the major toxic element detected, followed by Ni, Cr, Pb, As, Cd, Ag, and Hg. Essential elements were detected in the order of Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Co, and Se. Statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05) were found in the distribution of some elements, highlighting mechanisms of synergic or antagonist interaction. Multivariate analysis revealed that geographical origin was the main driver in clustering the samples, while the different treatment processes (black or green) did not significantly affect the contents of elements in the leaves. The estimation of potential non-carcinogenic risk revealed no risk for the consumption of European teas for consumers in terms of potentially toxic elements.

AB  - The two species of the Old World Camelini tribe, dromedary and Bactrian camels, show superior adaptability to the different environmental conditions they populate, e.g. desert, mountains and coastal areas, which might be associated with adaptive variations on their mitochondrial DNA. Here, we investigate signatures of natural selection in the 13-mitochondrial protein-coding genes of different dromedary camel populations from the Arabian Peninsula, Africa and southwest Asia. The full mitogenome sequences of 42 dromedaries, 38 domestic Bactrian, 29 wild Bactrian camels and 31 samples representing the New World Lamini tribe reveal species-wise genetic distinction among Camelidae family species, with no evidence of geographic distinction among dromedary camels. We observe gene-wide signals of adaptive divergence between the Old World and New World camels, with evidence of purifying selection among Old World camel species. Upon comparing the different Camelidae tribes, 27 amino acid substitutions across ten mtDNA protein-coding genes were found to be under positive selection, in which, 24 codons were defined to be under positive adaptive divergence between Old World and New World camels. Seven codons belonging to three genes demonstrated positive selection in dromedary lineage. A total of 89 codons were found to be under positive selection in Camelidae family based on investigating the impact of amino acid replacement on the physiochemical properties of proteins, including equilibrium constant and surrounding hydrophobicity. These mtDNA variants under positive selection in the Camelidae family might be associated with their adaptation to their contrasting environments.

AB  - Repeated anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (RA-tDCS) is a neuromodulatory technique consisting of stimulating the cerebral cortex with a weak electric anodal current in a non-invasive manner. RA-tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has antidepressant-like properties and improves memory both in humans and laboratory animals. However, the mechanisms of action of RA-tDCS remain poorly understood. Since adult hippocampal neurogenesis is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and memory functioning, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the impact of RA-tDCS on hippocampal neurogenesis levels in mice. RA-tDCS was applied for 20 min per day for five consecutive days over the left frontal cortex of young adult (2-month-old, high basal level of neurogenesis) and middle-aged (10-month-old, low basal level of neurogenesis) female mice. Mice received three intraperitoneal injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on the final day of RA-tDCS. The brains were collected either 1 day or 3 weeks after the BrdU injections to quantify cell proliferation and cell survival, respectively. RA-tDCS increased hippocampal cell proliferation in young adult female mice, preferentially (but not exclusively) in the dorsal part of the dentate gyrus. However, the number of cells that survived after 3 weeks was the same in both the Sham and the tDCS groups. This was due to a lower survival rate in the tDCS group, which suppressed the beneficial effects of tDCS on cell proliferation. No modulation of cell proliferation or survival was observed in middle-aged animals. Our RA-tDCS protocol may, therefore, influence the behavior of naive female mice, as we previously described, but its effect on the hippocampus is only transient in young adult animals. Future studies using animal models for depression in male and female mice should provide further insights into RA-tDCS detailed age- and sex-dependent effects on hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Background: A crosstalk exists between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and diabetic encephalopathy displays AD-like disorders. Sarsasapogenin (Sar) has strong anti-inflammatory efficacy, showing neuroprotection and memory-enhancement effects.
   Purpose: This study aims to verify the ameliorative effects of Sar on diabetic encephalopathy in vivo and in vitro, and to clarify the mechanisms from attenuation of AD-like pathology.
   Methods: Streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats and high glucose-cultured SH-SY5Y cells were used in this study. After Sar treatment (20 and 60 mg/kg) for consecutive 9 weeks, Morris water maze and novel object recognition tasks were performed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for examining loss of neurons in CA1 area and ki67 expression for reflecting neurogenesis in DG area of hippocampus. A beta production pathway and tau phosphorylation kinase cascade were examined in these two models.
   Results: Sar improved learning and memory ability, loss of neurons and reduction of neurogenesis in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Moreover, Sar suppressed A beta overproduction due to up-regulation of BACE1 in protein and mRNA and tau hyperphosphorylation from inactivation of AKT/GSK-3 beta cascade in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of diabetic rats and high glucose-cultured SH-SY5Y cells, and PPAR gamma antagonism abolished the effects of Sar on key molecules in the two pathways. Additionally, it was found that high glucose-stimulated A beta overproduction was prior to tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons.
   Conclusion: Sar alleviated diabetic encephalopathy, which was obtained through inhibitions of A beta overproduction and tau hyperphosphorylation mediated by the activation of PPAR gamma signaling. Hence, Sar is a good candidate compound for AD-like disorders.

AB  - Neonatal jaundice is one of the most common disorders in the first 2 wk after birth. Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is neurotoxic and can cause neurological dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neurogenesis, neuronal growth, and synaptogenesis are exuberant in the early postnatal stage. In this study, the impact of UCB on neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis in the early postnatal stage was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Primary culture neuronal stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) were treated with UCB during differentiation, and then the neurite length and synapse puncta were measured. In the bilirubin encephalopathy (BE) animal model, DCX+-marked developing neurons were used to detect apical length and dendritic arborization. According to the data, UCB significantly reduced neurite length and synapse density, as well as decreased the apical dendrite length and dendritic arborization. Furthermore, the NMDAR subunit NR2B was downregulated in NSPCs, while pCREB expression in the hippocampus progressively decreased during disease progression in the BE model. Next, we tested the expression of NR2B, pCREB, mBDNF, and p-mTOR in NSPCs in vitro, and found that UCB treatment reduced the expression of these proteins. In summary, this suggests that UCB causes chronic neurological impairment and is related to the inhibition of NMDAR-CREB-BDNF signaling in NSPCs, which is associated with reduced neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis. This finding may inspire the development of novel pharmaceuticals and treatments.

AB  - Physical dependence is associated with the formation of neuroadaptive changes in the central nervous system (CNS), both at the molecular and cellular levels. Various studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory and proinflammatory properties of morphine. The resulting neuroinflammation in drug dependence exacerbates substance abuse-related behaviors and increases morphine tolerance. Studies prove that fluoride exposure may also contribute to the development of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative changes. Morphine addiction is a major social problem. Neuroinflammation increases tolerance to morphine, and neurodegenerative effects caused by fluoride in structures related to the development of dependence may impair the functioning of neuronal pathways, change the concentration of neurotransmitters, and cause memory and learning disorders, which implies this element influences the development of dependence. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the inflammatory state of selected brain structures in morphine-dependent rats pre-exposed to fluoride, including changes in cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression as well as microglial and astroglial activity via the evaluation of Iba1 and GFAP expression. We provide evidence that both morphine administration and fluoride exposure have an impact on the inflammatory response by altering the expression of COX-1, COX-2, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule (Iba1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in brain structures involved in dependence development, such as the prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. We observed that the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in morphine-dependent rats is influenced by prior fluoride exposure, and these changes vary depending on the specific brain region. Additionally, we observed active astrogliosis, as indicated by increased GFAP expression, in all brain structures of morphine-dependent rats, regardless of fluoride exposure. Furthermore, the effect of morphine on Iba1 expression varied across different brain regions, and fluoride pre-exposure may influence microglial activation. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are a result of the direct or indirect actions of morphine and fluoride on the factors analyzed.

AB  - The hippocampus is a complex area of the mammalian brain and is responsible for learning and memory. The trisynaptic circuit engages with explicit memory. Hippocampal neurons express two types of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) comprising N and P/Q-types. These VGCCs play a vital role in the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic neurons. The chief excitatory neurotransmitter at these synapses is glutamate. Glutamate has an essential function in learning and memory under normal conditions. The release of neurotransmitters depends on the activity of presynaptic VGCCs. Excessive glutamate activity, due to either excessive release or insufficient uptake from the synapse, leads to a condition called excitotoxicity. This pathological state is common among all neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Under these conditions, glutamate adversely affects the trisynaptic circuitry, leading to synaptic destruction and loss of memory and learning performance. This study attempts to clarify the role of presynaptic VGCCs in memory performance and reveals that modulating the activity of presynaptic calcium channels in the trisynaptic pathway can regulate the excitotoxic state and consequently prevent the elimination of neurons and synaptic degradation. All of these can lead to an improvement in learning and memory function. In the current study, two calcium channel blockers-omega-agatoxin-Aa2a and omega-Lsp-IA-were extracted, purified, and identified from spiders (Agelena orientalis and Hogna radiata) and used to modulate N and P/Q VGCCs. The effect of omega-agatoxin-Aa2a and omega-Lsp-IA on glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in rats was evaluated using the Morris water maze task as a behavioral test. The local expression of synaptophysin (SYN) was visualized for synaptic quantification using an immunofluorescence assay. The electrophysiological amplitudes of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the input-output and LTP curves of the mossy fiber and Schaffer collateral circuits were recorded. The results of our study demonstrated that N and P/Q VGCC modulation in the hippocampus trisynaptic circuit of rats with glutamate-induced excitotoxicity dysfunction could prevent the destructive consequences of excitotoxicity in synapses and improve memory function and performance.

AB  - miR-92a-3p (microRNA-92a-3p) has been reported to be dysregulated in several cancers, and as such, it is considered to be a cancer-related microRNA. However, the influence of miR-92a-3p on biological behaviors in cervical cancer (CC) still remains unclear. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect miR-92a-3p levels in CC stem cells. Here, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, Transwell cell invasion assay and flow cytometry assay were used to characterize the effects that miR-92a-3p and large tumor suppressor l (LATS1) had on proliferation, invasion and cell cycle transition. The luciferase reporter gene assay was used to verify the targeting relationship between miR-92a-3p and LATS1. Western Blotting was used to investigate the related signaling pathways and proteins. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that miR-92a-3p was upregulated in CC tissues and closely associated with overall survival. miR-92a-3p promoted proliferation, invasion and cell cycle transition in CC stem cells. The luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-92a-3p bound to the 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR) of the LATS1 promoter. LATS1 inhibited proliferation, invasion and cell cycle transition. Results measured by Western Blotting showed that LATS1 downregulated expressions of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), vimentin and cyclin E, but upregulated the expression of E-cadherin. Re-expression of LATS1 partly reversed the effects of miR-92a-3p on proliferation, invasion and cell cycle transition, as well as on TAZ, E-cadherin, vimentin, and cyclin E. miR-92a-3p promoted the malignant behavior of CC stem cells by targeting LATS1, which regulated TAZ and E-cadherin.

AB  - Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIa) is a key regulator of neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. Synaptic activity and neurotransmitter homeostasis are closely coupled to the energy metabolism of both neurons and astrocytes. However, whether CaMKIIa function is implicated in brain energy and neurotransmitter metabolism remains unclear. Here, we explored the metabolic consequences of CaMKIIa deletion in the cerebral cortex using a genetic CaMKIIa knockout (KO) mouse. Energy and neurotransmitter metabolism was functionally investigated in acutely isolated cerebral cortical slices using stable C-13 isotope tracing, whereas the metabolic function of synaptosomes was assessed by the rates of glycolytic activity and mitochondrial respiration. The oxidative metabolism of [U-C-13]glucose was extensively reduced in cerebral cortical slices of the CaMKIIa KO mice. In contrast, metabolism of [1,2-C-13]acetate, primarily reflecting astrocyte metabolism, was unaffected. Cellular uptake, and subsequent metabolism, of [U-C-13]glutamate was decreased in cerebral cortical slices of CaMKIIa KO mice, whereas uptake and metabolism of [U-C-13]GABA were unaffected, suggesting selective metabolic impairments of the excitatory system. Synaptic metabolic function was maintained during resting conditions in isolated synaptosomes from CaMKIIa KO mice, but both the glycolytic and mitochondrial capacities became insufficient when the synaptosomes were metabolically challenged. Collectively, this study shows that global deletion of CaMKIIa significantly impairs cellular energy and neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly of neurons, suggesting a metabolic role of CaMKIIa signaling in the brain.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of allergic diseases has been increasing in developing areas but has reached a plateau in many developed areas. Regular surveys are imperative to assess the disease burden for the prioritization of resource allocation. Objectives: We examined the change in the prevalence of wheezing, allergic rhinitis (AR), and eczema in school-aged children with possible associative factors and possible health effects of school air quality. Methods: This was the third repeated cross-sectional study conducted in 2015-2016 using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) protocol. Our first and second surveys were conducted in 1994-1995 and 2000-2001, respectively. Regarding the third survey, we recruited 3698 children aged 6-7 from 33 local schools in 18 districts. Air quality, temperature, and humidity were also measured. The changes in prevalence, multiple regression, and GLIMMIX procedure were analyzed. Results: From our first survey to our third survey, the increased prevalences for lifetime wheeze, current wheeze, lifetime rhinitis, current rhinitis, current rhinoconjunctivitis, lifetime chronic rash, and current chronic rash were 4.2%, 2.1%, 12.5%, 12.6%, 14.2%, 3.9%, and 4.1%, respectively. Increased prevalence of parental atopy had the strongest association with an increased prevalence of each of these seven health outcomes. There was no significant association between school air pollutant levels and the prevalence of health outcomes. Conclusions: There was an increase in the prevalence of wheezing, allergic rhinitis, and eczema across the surveys. The most important associated risk factor identified was the increased prevalence of a parental history of atopy.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the United States as several million people visit the emergency department every year due to TBI exposures. Unfortunately, there is still no consensus on the pathology underlying mild TBI, the most common severity sub-type of TBI. Previous preclinical and post-mortem human studies have detailed the presence of diffuse axonal injury following TBI, suggesting that white matter pathology is the predominant pathology of diffuse brain injury. However, the inertial loading produced by TBI results in strain fields in both gray and white matter. In order to further characterize gray matter pathology in mild TBI, our lab used a pig model (n = 25) of closed-head rotational acceleration-induced TBI to evaluate blood-brain barrier disruptions, neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, and microglial reactivity in the cerebral cortex out to 1 year post-injury. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of a hyper-ramified microglial phenotype-more branches, junctions, endpoints, and longer summed process length-at 30 days post injury (DPI) out to 1 year post injury in the cingulate gyrus (p < 0.05), and at acute and subacute timepoints in the inferior temporal gyrus (p < 0.05). Interestingly, we did not find neuronal loss or astroglial reactivity paired with these chronic microglia changes. However, we observed an increase in fibrinogen reactivity-a measure of blood-brain barrier disruption-predominately in the gray matter at 3 DPI (p = 0.0003) which resolved to sham levels by 7 DPI out to chronic timepoints. Future studies should employ gene expression assays, neuroimaging, and behavioral assays to elucidate the effects of these hyper-ramified microglia, particularly related to neuroplasticity and responses to potential subsequent insults. Further understanding of the brain's inflammatory activity after mild TBI will hopefully provide understanding of pathophysiology that translates to clinical treatment for TBI.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a persistent mental illness caused by severe traumatic events, and its pathogenesis is still unclear. Recent studies indicate that p75 neurotrophic factor receptor (p75NTR) plays a crucial role in neurological diseases, but the role of p75NTR in PTSD is currently unknown. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of p75NTR in PTSD, in this study, a functional p75NTR-deficient mouse was used to establish a PTSD model by single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm, then the behavioral effects and underlying mechanisms were further investigated. The results demonstrated that p75NTR deletion alleviated anxiety-like behavior and spatial learning and memory impairment in SPS-induced PTSD mice. Further study indicated that deletion of p75NTR downregulated the expression of apoptosis (Bax) and autophagy (Beclin-1) related proteins in the hippocampus of PTSD mice, protected against hippocampal neuronal damage, upregulated the expression of synaptic-related proteins (PSD95 and Synapsin I), increased dendritic complexity and dendritic spine density, and improved synaptic plasticity through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, deletion of p75NTR rescues behavioral and cognitive dysfunction through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway mediated regulation of hippocampal autophagy, apoptosis and synaptic plasticity in SPS-induced PTSD mice, which provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PTSD.

AB  - Lindera erythrocarpa, a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, has been reported to have neuroprotective activity. However, reports on the specific bioactive compounds in L. erythrocarpa are finite. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects of the compounds isolated from L. erythrocarpa. Dihydropashanone, a compound isolated from L. erythrocarpa extract, was found to have protected mouse hippocampus HT22 cells from glutamate-induced cell death. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of dihydropashanone in mouse microglial BV2 and HT22 cells were explored in this study. The results reveal that dihydropashanone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response and suppresses the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B in BV2 cells. In addition, dihydropashanone reduced the buildup of reactive oxygen species in HT22 cells and induced activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase (HO)-1 signaling pathway in BV2 and HT22 cells. Our results suggest that dihydropashanone reduces neuroinflammation by decreasing NF-kappa B activation in microglia cells and protects neurons from oxidative stress via the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Thus, our data suggest that dihydropashanone offers a broad range of applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative illnesses.

AB  - Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignant tumor of digestive tract, accounting for 90% of all pathological types of esophageal cancer. Despite the rapid development of multi-disciplinary treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, the prognosis of patients with ESCC is still poor. Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGSs) are involved in the processes of various cancers. The expression levels of its family member RGS16 are abnormally elevated in a variety of tumors, but its role in ESCC is still unclear. We found that RGS16 expression is aberrantly increased in ESCC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis of ESCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and our collected ESCC tissues. Moreover, knockdown of RGS16 in two ESCC cells could indeed inhibit their proliferation and migration. We further explored the molecular mechanism of RGS16 in ESCC, and the correlation analysis from TCGA database showed that the mRNA levels of RGS16 was positively correlated with that of CTGF and CYR61, two target genes of Hippo-YAP signaling. Consistently, RGS16-knockdown significantly inhibited the expression of CTGF and CYR61 in ESCC cells. We found that the phosphorylation levels of LATS1 and YAP were significantly increased and YAP translocated into the cytoplasm after depletion of RGS16 in ESCC cells. Also, RGS16-knockdown promoted the interaction between LATS1 and upstream kinase MST1. In addition, reintroduction of a constitutive active YAP5A mutant significantly rescued CTGF expression and cell proliferation in RGS16-knockdown cells. Together, our work revealed that RGS16 promoted YAP activity through disrupting the interaction between LATS1 and MST1, thus promoting the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells.

AB  - Insect development requires genes to be expressed in strict spatiotemporal order. The dynamic regulation of genes involved in insect development is partly orchestrated by the histone acetylation-deacetylation via histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Although histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is required for mice during early embryonic development, its functions in Helicoverpa armigera (H. armigera) and its potential to be used as a target of insecticides remain unclear. We treated H. armigera with HDAC3 siRNA and RGFP966, a specific inhibitor, examining how the HDAC3 loss-of-function affects growth and development. HDAC3 siRNA and RGFP966 treatment increased mortality at each growth stage and altered metamorphosis, hampering pupation and causing abnormal wing development, reduced egg production, and reduced hatching rate. We believe that the misregulation of key hormone-related genes leads to abnormal pupa development in HDAC3 knockout insects. RNA-seq analysis identified 2788 differentially expressed genes (>= two-fold change; p <= 0.05) between siHDAC3- and siNC-treated larvae. Kruppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), was differentially expressed in HDAC3 knockdown larvae. Pathway-enrichment analysis revealed the significant enrichment of genes involved in the Hippo, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathways following HDAC3 knockdown. Histone H3K9 acetylation was increased in H. armigera after siHDAC3 treatment. In conclusion, HDAC3 knockdown dysregulated juvenile hormone (JH)-related and apoptosis-related genes in H. armigera. The results showed that the HDAC3 gene is a potential target for fighting H. armigera.

AB  - New precautions have become part of our daily life since COVID-19 pandemic such as wearing masks, maintaining distance and disinfecting products bought from markets before using them which is exhausting. We aimed to test the inhibitory effect of Camellia sinensis (black tea) water extracts on respiratory viruses and the inhibition of viruses accumulated over different surface types after being soaked in water supplemented with the extracts. Two water extraction methods (extract A: maceration at 80 degrees C for 30 min and extract B: boiling for 40 min) were applied; extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to detect polyphenolic compounds. Results showed that 200 mu g/ml of extract A and 50 mu g/ml of extract B in water caused 100% inhibition of influenza A (enveloped virus) virus after 1.5 h and similar results were obtained for adenovirus (non-enveloped virus) but at the same concentration of extract A and at 100 mu g/ml of extract B. Different surfaces (aluminum, glass, plastic or carton, vegetables of smooth (tomato) or rough (lemon) surfaces and green leaves) were inoculated with both viruses for 20 min and then soaked in the water supplemented with 200 mu g/ml of extract A or 100 mu g/ml of extract B for 1.5 h, and this resulted in complete inhibition of both viruses.

AB  - Animals process temporal information in an ever-changing environment, but the neuronal mechanisms of this process, especially on timescales longer than seconds, remain unresolved. Here, we designed a hippocampus-dependent task in which rats prospectively increased their reward-seeking behavior over a duration of minutes. During this timing behavior, hippocampal and striatal neurons represented successive time points on the order of minutes by gradually changing their firing rates and transiently increasing their firing rates at specific time points. These minute-encoding patterns progressively developed as the rats learned a time-reward relationship, and the patterns underwent flexible scaling in parallel with timing behavior. These observations suggest a neuronal basis in the hippocampal-striatal circuits that enables temporal processing and formation of episodic memory on a timescale of minutes.

AB  - Neurogenesis is significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a potential therapeutic target. Contrary to humans, a zebrafish can regenerate its diseased brain, and thus is ideal for studying neurogenesis. To compare the AD-related molecular pathways between humans and zebrafish, we compared single cell or nuclear transcriptomic data from a zebrafish amyloid toxicity model and its controls (N = 12) with the datasets of two human adult brains (N = 10 and N = 48 (Microglia)), and one fetal brain (N = 10). Approximately 95.4% of the human and zebrafish cells co-clustered. Within each cell type, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched KEGG pathways, and gene ontology terms. We studied synergistic and non-synergistic DEGs to point at either common or uniquely altered mechanisms across species. Using the top DEGs, a high concordance in gene expression changes between species was observed in neuronal clusters. On the other hand, the molecular pathways affected by AD in zebrafish astroglia differed from humans in favor of the neurogenic pathways. The integration of zebrafish and human transcriptomes shows that the zebrafish can be used as a tool to study the cellular response to amyloid proteinopathies. Uniquely altered pathways in zebrafish could highlight the specific mechanisms underlying neurogenesis, which are absent in humans, and could serve as potential candidates for therapeutic developments.

AB  - During the planned missions to Mars, astronauts will be faced with many potential health hazards including prolonged exposure to space radiation. Ground-based studies have shown that exposure to space radiation impairs the performance of male rats in cognitive flexibility tasks which involve processes that are essential to rapidly and efficiently adapting to different situations. However, there is presently a paucity of information on the effects of space radiation on cognitive flexibility in female rodents. This study has determined the impact that exposure to a low (10 cGy) dose of ions from the simplified 5-ion galactic cosmic ray simulation [https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/SimGCRSim.php (07/2023)] (GCRSim) beam or 250 MeV/n He-4 ions has on the ability of female Wistar rats to perform in constrained [attentional set shifting (ATSET)] and unconstrained cognitive flexibility (UCFlex) tasks. Female rats exposed to GCRSim exhibited multiple decrements in ATSET performance. Firstly, GCRSim exposure impaired performance in the compound discrimination (CD) stage of the ATSET task. While the ability of rats to identify the rewarded cue was not compromised, the time the rats required to do so significantly increased. Secondly, both He-4 and GCRSim exposure reduced the ability of rats to reach criterion in the compound discrimination reversal (CDR) stage. Approximately 20% of the irradiated rats were unable to complete the CDR task; furthermore, the irradiated rats that did reach criterion took more attempts to do so than did the sham-treated animals. Radiation exposure also altered the magnitude and/or nature of practice effects. A comparison of performance metrics from the pre-screen and post-exposure ATSET task revealed that while the sham-treated rats completed the post-exposure CD stage of the ATSET task in 30% less time than for completion of the pre-screen ATSET task, the irradiated rats took 30-50% longer to do so. Similarly, while sham-treated rats completed the CDR stage in similar to 10% fewer attempts in the post-exposure task compared to the pre-screen task, in contrast, the He-4- and GCRSim-exposed cohorts took more (similar to 2-fold) attempts to reach criterion in the post-exposure task than in the pre-screen task. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that female rats are susceptible to radiation-induced loss of performance in the constrained ATSET cognitive flexibility task. Moreover, exposure to radiation leads to multiple performance decrements, including loss of practice effects, an increase in anterograde interference and reduced ability or unwillingness to switch attention. Should similar effects occur in humans, astronauts may have a compromised ability to perform complex tasks. (c) 2023 by Radiation Research Society

AB  - Marine mammals have been described as sentinels of the health of marine ecosystems. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate (i) the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales, which comprise several bacterial families important to the healthcare sector, as well as (ii) the presence of Salmonella in these coastal animals. The antimicrobial resistance pheno- and genotypes, as well as biocide susceptibility of Enterobacterales isolated from stranded marine mammals, were determined prior to their rehabilitation. All E. coli isolates (n = 27) were screened for virulence genes via DNA-based microarray, and twelve selected E. coli isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. Seventy-one percent of the Enterobacterales isolates exhibited a multidrug-resistant (MDR) pheno- and genotype. The gene bla(CMY) (n = 51) was the predominant beta-lactamase gene. In addition, bla(TEM-1) (n = 38), bla(SHV-33) (n = 8), bla(CTX-M-15) (n = 7), bla(OXA-1) (n = 7), bla(SHV-11) (n = 3), and bla(DHA-1) (n = 2) were detected. The most prevalent non-beta-lactamase genes were sul2 (n = 38), strA (n = 34), strB (n = 34), and tet(A) (n = 34). Escherichia coli isolates belonging to the pandemic sequence types (STs) ST38, ST167, and ST648 were identified. Among Salmonella isolates (n = 18), S. Havana was the most prevalent serotype. The present study revealed a high prevalence of MDR bacteria and the presence of pandemic high-risk clones, both of which are indicators of anthropogenic antimicrobial pollution, in marine mammals.

AB  - The therapeutic outcomes of patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) remain unsatisfactory, largely because the underlying mechanisms of eosinophilic inflammation are uncertain. Here, it is shown that the nasal secretions of ECRS patients have high eosinophil extracellular trap (EET) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels. Moreover, the cfDNA induced EET formation by activating toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling. After demonstrating that DNase I reduced eosinophilic inflammation by modulating EET formation, linear polyglycerol-amine (LPGA)-coated TiS2 nanosheets (TLPGA) as functional 2D nanoplatforms with low cytotoxicity, mild protein adsorption, and increased degradation rate is developed. Due to the more flexible linear architecture, TLPGA exhibited higher cfDNA affinity than the TiS2 nanosheets coated with dendritic polyglycerol-amine (TDPGA). TLPGA reduced cfDNA levels in the nasal secretions of ECRS patients while suppressing cfDNA-induced TLR9 activation and EET formation in vitro. TLPGA displayed exceptional biocompatibility, preferential nasal localization, and potent inflammation modulation in mice with eosinophilic inflammation. These results highlight the pivotal feature of the linear molecular architecture and 2D sheet-like nanostructure in the development of anti-inflammation nanoplatforms, which can be exploited for ECRS treatment.
   The current therapeutic outcomes of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) remain unsatisfactory. Here, linear polyglycerol-amine (LPGA)-covered TiS2 nanosheets, which showed low cytotoxicity, mild protein adsorption and robust anti-inflammation efficacy is developed. These functionalized nanosheets can suppress the eosinophilic extracellular trap (EET) formation and modulate eosinophilic inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. image

AB  - Prion proteins constitute a major public health concern, which has partly overshadowed their physiological roles in several scenarios. Indeed, these proteins were implicated in male fertility but their role in female fertility is relatively less explored. This study was designed to evaluate the role of SPRN and PRNP prion family genes in bovine follicular steroidogenesis pathways. Post-transcriptional SPRN and PRNP silencing with siRNAs was established in bovine granulosa cell (GC) in vitro culture, and gene expression and progesterone and estradiol concentrations were evaluated. SPRN knockdown, led to a down regulation of CYP11A1 mRNA levels (2.1-fold), and PRNP knockdown led to an upregulation of SPRN mRNA levels (2.3-fold). CYP19A1 expression and estradiol synthesis was not detected in any experimental group. Finally, SPRN knockdown led to a mild reduction in progesterone production in GCs and this was the only experimental group that did not exhibit an increment in progesterone levels after 48 h of culture. As a conclusion, it was possible to detect the expression of the SPRN gene in bovine GCs, a potential interaction between SPRN and PRNP regulation, and the impact of SPRN expression on CYP11A1 and progesterone levels. These findings bring new insights into the role of these genes in ovarian steroidogenesis and female reproductive physiology. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is an acute phase protein able to bind iron when complexed with bacterial siderophores. The recent identification of a mammalian siderophore also suggested a physiological role for LCN2 in the regulation of iron levels and redox state. In the central nervous system, the deletion of LCN2 induces deficits in neural stem cells proliferation and commitment, with an impact on the hippocampal-dependent contextual fear discriminative task. Additionally, stress is a well-known regulator of cell genesis and is known to decrease adult hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Although voluntary running, another well-known regulator of neurogenesis, is sufficient to rescue the defective hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior in LCN2-null mice by promoting stem cells' cell cycle progression and maturation, the relevance of LCN2-regulated hippocampal neurogenesis in response to stress has never been explored. Here, we show a lack of response by LCN2-null mice to the effects of chronic stress exposure at the cellular and behavioral levels. Together, these findings implicate LCN2 as a relevant mediator of neuronal plasticity and brain function in the adult mammalian brain.

AB  - Lanthanum can affect the growth and development of the tea plant. Tieguanyin (TGY) and Shuixian (SX) cultivars of Camellia sinensis were selected to explore the mechanism underlying the accumulation of lanthanum (tea plants' most accumulated rare earth element) through proteomics. Roots and fresh leaves of TGY and SX with low- and high-accumulation potential for lanthanum, respectively, were studied; 845 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified. Gene ontology analysis showed that DEPs were involved in redox processes and related to molecular functions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes metabolic pathway analysis showed that DEPs were associated with glutathione (GSH) and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, plant pathogen interaction, and oxidative phosphorylation. Thirty-seven proteins in the GSH metabolism pathway showed significant differences, wherein 18 GSH S-transferases showed differential expression patterns in the root system. Compared with the control, expression ratios of GST (TEA004130.1) and GST (TEA032216.1) in TGY leaves were 6.84 and 4.06, respectively, after lanthanum treatment; these were significantly higher than those in SX leaves. The LOX2.1 (TEA011765.1) and LOX2.1 (TEA011776.1) expression ratios in the alpha-linolenic acid metabolic pathway were 2.44 and 6.43, respectively, in TGY roots, which were significantly higher than those in SX roots. The synthesis of specific substances induces lanthanum-associated defense responses in TGY, which is of great significance for plant yield stability.

AB  - BackgroundRecent studies have identified hearing loss (HL) as a primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset. However, the mechanisms linking HL to AD are not fully understood. This study explored the effects of drug-induced hearing loss (DIHL) on the expression of proteins associated with AD progression in mouse models.MethodsDIHL was induced in 5xFAD and Tg2576 mice aged 3 to 3.5 weeks using kanamycin (700 mg/kg, subcutaneous) and furosemide (600 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The accumulation and expression of beta-amyloid (A beta), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured through immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Additionally, the expression of proteins involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, including downstream effectors p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and S6, as well as proinflammatory cytokines, was analyzed.ResultsCompared to control conditions, HL led to a significant increase in the accumulation of A beta in the hippocampus and cortex. Elevated levels of neuroinflammatory markers, including Iba1 and GFAP, as well as proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), were observed. Moreover, DIHL enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and S6, indicating activation of the mTOR pathway.ConclusionsHL significantly increases A beta accumulation in the brain. Furthermore, HL activates astrocytes and microglia, leading to increased neuroinflammation and thereby accelerating AD progression. These findings strongly suggest that HL contributes autonomously to neuroinflammation, highlighting the potential for early intervention in HL to reduce AD risk.

AB  - The brain's response to external events depends on its internal arousal states, which are dynamically governed by neuromodulatory systems and have recently been linked to coordinated spike timing cascades in widespread brain networks. At rest, both arousal fluctuations and spiking cascades are evident throughout the forebrain and play out over multisecond time scales. Here, by analyzing large-scale neural recording data collected by the Allen Institute, it is demonstrated that these intrinsic processes persist across the mouse brain even during periods of continuous visual stimulation. In the stationary animal, each quasi-periodic cascade cycle systematically influenced 1) the efficacy of encoding in visually responsive brain areas and 2) the incidence of memory-related hippocampal ripples. During this cycle, the phase of high arousal is marked by high efficiency in visual encoding whereas the phase of low arousal is marked by the occurrence of hippocampal ripples. However, during bouts of active locomotion, this cycle is abolished and brain maintained a state of elevated visual coding efficiency, with ripples being nearly absent. It is hypothesized that the infra-slow cascade dynamics reflect an adaptive cycle of alternating exteroceptive sensory sampling and internal mnemonic function that persistently pervades the forebrain, only stopping during active exploration of the environment.

AB  - BackgroundSignal transduction via the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway is indispensable for mediating the intracellular effects of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and other cytokines in the brain and, thereby, crucial for antiviral and antibacterial responses during potential life-threatening CNS infections. However, the role of STAT1 signaling beyond the known IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma effects in immediate antimicrobial defense is highly context-dependent, and studies in the existing literature using STAT1-targeted mouse models under normal physiological conditions remain scarce.MethodsHere, we characterized a STAT1 targeted-disruption mouse model in the absence of infectious stimuli by employing established behavioral testing paradigms and immunohistochemical stainings, as well as bulk hippocampal transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.ResultsWhile we found neither overt behavioral alterations nor immunohistochemical changes with respect to microglial phagocytosis or proliferation, significant alterations were detected in gene and protein expression profiles implicated in neuroinflammatory processes and neuroprotection.ConclusionIn summary, this study highlights the complex and context-dependent role of STAT1-mediated signaling even in the absence of any detectable behavioral and neuropathological changes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational lead (Pb) exposure can adversely affect offspring health through multiple mechanisms, including epigenomic alterations via DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC), an intermediate in oxidative demethylation. Most current methods do not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC, limiting insights into their individual roles.
   OBJECTIVE: Our study sought to identify the association of trimester-specific (T1, T2, T3) prenatal Pb exposure with 5mC and 5hmC levels at multiple cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites within gene regions previously associated with prenatal Pb (HCN2, NINJ2, RAB5A, TPPP) in whole blood leu-kocytes of children ages 11-18 years of age.
   METHODS: Participants from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohorts were selected (n = 144) for pyrosequencing analysis following oxidative or standard sodium bisulfite treatment. This workflow directly quantifies total methylation (5mC+5hmC) and 5mC only; 5hmC is estimated by subtraction.
   RESULTS: Participants were 51% male, and mean maternal blood lead levels (BLL) were 6.43 +/- 5.16 mu g/dL in Trimester 1 (T1), 5.66 +/- 5.21 mu g/dL in Trimester 2 (T2), and 5.86 +/- 4.34 mu g/dL in Trimester 3 (T3). In addition, 5hmC levels were calculated for HCN2 (mean +/- standard deviation(SD), 2.08 +/- 4.18%), NINJ2 (G/C: 2.01 +/- 5.95; GG: 0.90 +/- 3.97), RAB5A (0.66 +/- 0.80%), and TPPP (1.11 +/- 6.67%). Furthermore, 5mC levels were meas-ured in HCN2 (81.3 +/- 9.63%), NINJ2 (heterozygotes: 38.6 +/- 7.39%; GG homozygotes: 67.3 +/- 9.83%), RAB5A (1.41 +/- 1.21%), and TPPP (92.5 +/- 8.03%). Several significant associations between BLLs and 5mC/5hmC were identified: T1 BLLs with 5mC in HCN2 (beta = +/- 0.37, p = 0.03) and 5hmC in NINJ2 (beta = 0.49, p = 0.003); T2 BLLs with 5mC in HCN2 (beta = 0.37, p = 0.03) and 5hmC in NINJ2 (beta= 0.27, p = 0.008); and T3 BLLs with 5mC in HCN2 (beta= 0.50, p = 0.01) and NINJ2 (beta= +/- 0.35, p = 0.004) and 5hmC in NINJ2 (beta = 0.45, p < 0.001). NINJ2 5mC was negatively cor-related with gene expression (Pearson r = +/- 0.5, p-value = 0.005), whereas 5hmC was positively correlated (r = 0.4, p-value = 0.04).
   DISCUSSION: These findings suggest there is variable 5hmC in human whole blood and that prenatal Pb exposure is associated with gene-specific 5mC and 5hmC levels at adolescence, providing evidence to consider 5hmC as a regulatory mechanism that is responsive to environmental exposures.

AB  - Allergy and rhinovirus (RV) infections are major triggers for rhinitis and asthma, causing a socioeconomic burden. As RVs and allergens may act synergistically to promote airway inflammation, simultaneous treatment strategies for both causative agents would be innovative. We have previously identified the transmembrane glycoprotein intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) as an anchor for antibody conjugates bispecific for ICAM-1 and Phleum pratense (Phl p) 2, a major grass pollen allergen, to block allergen transmigration through the epithelial barrier. Since ICAM-1 is a receptor for the major group RVs, we speculated that our bispecific antibody conjugates may protect against RV infection. Therefore, we created antibody conjugates bispecific for ICAM-1 and the major grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 and analyzed their capacity to affect allergen penetration and RV infection. Bispecific antibody conjugates significantly reduced the trans-epithelial migration of Phl p 5 and thus the basolateral Phl p 5 concentration and allergenic activity as determined by humanized rat basophilic leukemia cells and inhibited RV infection of cultured epithelial cells. A reduction in allergenic activity was obtained only through the prevention of allergen transmigration because the Phl p 5-specific IgG antibody did not block the allergen-IgE interaction. Our results indicate the potential of allergen/ICAM-1-specific antibody conjugates as a topical treatment strategy for allergy and RV infections.

AB  - Epilepsy is a disease which affects between 1 and 2% of the population, and a large proportion of these people do not react to currently available anticonvulsant medications, indicating the need for further research into novel pharmacological therapies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress and inflammation occur during epilepsy and may contribute to its development and progression, indicating higher levels of oxidative and inflammatory parameters in experimental models and clinical patients. This research aimed to assess the impact of diclofenac sodium, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, on seizure and levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in a rat model of epilepsy triggered by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). 60 rats were randomly allocated to one of two groups: electroencephalography (EEG) recordings or behavioral evaluation. Rats received diclofenac sodium at three various doses (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (IP) or a placebo, followed by intraperitoneal (IP) pentylenetetrazole, a powerful seizure-inducing medication. To investigate if diclofenac sodium had antiseizure properties, seizure activity in rats was evaluated using EEG recordings, the Racine convulsion scale (RCS) behaviour score, the duration of the first myoclonic jerk (FMJ), and the levels of MDA, TNF-alpha, and SOD. The average percentage of EEG spike waves decreased from 76.8% (placebo) to 64.1% (25 mg/kg diclofenac), 55.9% (50 mg/kg diclofenac), and 37.8% (75 mg/kg diclofenac). FMJ had increased from a mean of 58.8 s (placebo), to 93.6 s (25 mg/kg diclofenac), 185.8 s (50 mg/kg diclofenac) and 231.7 s (75 mg/kg diclofenac). RCS scores decreased from a mean score of 5.6 (placebo), to 3.75 (25 mg/kg diclofenac), 2.8 (50 mg/kg diclofenac) and 1.75 (75 mg/kg diclofenac). MDA levels reduced from 14.2 ng/gr (placebo) to 9.6 ng/gr (25 mg/kg diclofenac), 8.4 ng/gr (50 mg/kg diclofenac) and 5.1 ng/gr (75 mg/kg diclofenac). Likely, TNF-alpha levels decreased from 67.9 ng/gr (placebo) to 48.1 ng/gr (25 mg/kg diclofenac), 33.5 ng/gr (50 mg/kg diclofenac) and 21.3 ng/gr (75 mg/kg diclofenac). SOD levels, however, enhanced from 0.048 U/mg (placebo) to 0.055 U/mg (25 mg/kg diclofenac), 0.14 U/mg (50 mg/kg diclofenac), and 0.18 U/mg (75 mg/kg diclofenac). Diclofenac sodium (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg i.p.) effectively lowered the spike percentages and RCS scores linked with PTZ-induced epilepsy in rats, as well as significantly decreased MDA, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, PGE2 and increased SOD levels. Probably as a result of its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, diclofenac sodium dramatically lowered seizure activity at both doses compared to placebo control. Each of these results were significant, with p-values of < 0.01, < 0.05. Therefore, the therapeutic application diclofenac sodium as a potential anticonvulsant should be investigated further.

AB  - Puberty onset is a complex physiological process, which enables the capacity for reproduction through increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone and subsequently luteinizing hormone secretion. While cells that coexpress kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus are believed to govern the timing of puberty, the degree to which kisspeptin/NKB/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons exist and are regulated by pubertal status remains to be determined in the gilt. Hypothalamic tissue from prepubertal and postpubertal, early follicular phase gilts was used to determine the expression of kisspeptin, NKB, and dynorphin within the arcuate nucleus. Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that the majority (>74%) of arcuate nucleus neurons that express mRNA for kisspeptin coexpressed mRNA for NKB and dynorphin. There were fewer arcuate nucleus cells that expressed mRNA for dynorphin in postpubertal gilts compared to prepubertal gilts (P < 0.05), but the number of arcuate nucleus cells expressing mRNA for kisspeptin or NKB was not different between groups. Within KNDy neurons, mRNA abundance for kisspeptin, NKB, and dynorphin of postpubertal gilts was the same as, less than, and greater than, respectively, prepubertal gilts. Immunostaining for kisspeptin did not differ between prepubertal and postpubertal gilts, but there were fewer NKB immunoreactive fibers in postpubertal gilts compared to prepubertal gilts (P < 0.05). Together, these data reveal novel information about KNDy neurons in gilts and support the idea that NKB and dynorphin play a role in puberty onset in the female pig.
   The degree to which KNDy neurons exist in the gilt is characterized for the first time, and the impact of pubertal status on kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin in the arcuate nucleus of gilts is examined.

AB  - Brain pathological changes impair cognition early in disease etiology. There is an urgent need to understand aging-linked mechanisms of early memory loss to develop therapeutic strategies and prevent the development of cognitive impairment. Tusc2 is a mitochondrial-resident protein regulating Ca2+ fluxes to and from mitochondria impacting overall health. We previously reported that Tusc2-/- female mice develop chronic inflammation and age prematurely, causing age- and sex-dependent spatial memory deficits at 5 months old. Therefore, we investigated Tusc2-dependent mechanisms of memory impairment in 4-month-old mice, comparing changes in resident and brain-infiltrating immune cells. Interestingly, Tusc2-/- female mice demonstrated a pro-inflammatory increase in astrocytes, expression of IFN-gamma in CD4+ T cells and Granzyme-B in CD8+T cells. We also found fewer FOXP3+ T-regulatory cells and Ly49G+ NK and Ly49G+ NKT cells in female Tusc2-/- brains, suggesting a dampened anti-inflammatory response. Moreover, Tusc2-/- hippocampi exhibited Tusc2- and sex-specific protein changes associated with brain plasticity, including mTOR activation, and Calbindin and CamKII dysregulation affecting intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. Overall, the data suggest that dysregulation of Ca2+-dependent processes and a heightened pro-inflammatory brain microenvironment in Tusc2-/- mice could underlie cognitive impairment. Thus, strategies to modulate the mitochondrial Tusc2- and Ca2+- signaling pathways in the brain should be explored to improve cognitive health.

AB  - Recent human behavioral and neuroimaging results suggest that people are selective in when they encode and retrieve episodic memories. To explain these findings, we trained a memory-augmented neural network to use its episodic memory to support prediction of upcoming states in an environment where past situations sometimes reoccur. We found that the network learned to retrieve selectively as a function of several factors, including its uncertainty about the upcoming state. Additionally, we found that selectively encoding episodic memories at the end of an event (but not mid-event) led to better subsequent prediction performance. In all of these cases, the benefits of selective retrieval and encoding can be explained in terms of reducing the risk of retrieving irrelevant memories. Overall, these modeling results provide a resource-rational account of why episodic retrieval and encoding should be selective and lead to several testable predictions.

AB  - Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjuvant neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. However, the mechanisms behind its effectiveness are not fully understood. Our aim was to develop a VNS protocol for the Genetic Audiogenic Seizure Hamster from Salamanca (GASH/Sal) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of action of the therapy. The rodents were subject to VNS for 14 days using clinical stimulation parameters by implanting a clinically available neurostimulation device or our own prototype for laboratory animals. The neuroethological assessment of seizures and general behavior were performed before surgery, and after 7, 10, and 14 days of VNS. Moreover, potential side effects were examined. Finally, the expression of 23 inflammatory markers in plasma and the left-brain hemisphere was evaluated. VNS significantly reduced seizure severity in GASH/Sal without side effects. No differences were observed between the neurostimulation devices. GASH/Sal treated with VNS showed statistically significant reduced levels of interleukin IL-1 beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP-1, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3), and tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha in the brain. The described experimental design allows for the study of VNS effects and mechanisms of action using an implantable device. This was achieved in a model of convulsive seizures in which VNS is effective and shows an anti-inflammatory effect.

AB  - As the global population continues to age, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, continues to rise significantly. As the disease progresses, the patient's daily living abilities gradually decline, potentially leading to a complete loss of self-care abilities. According to estimates by the Alzheimer's Association and the World Health Organization, AD accounts for 60%-70% of all other dementia cases, affecting over 55 million people worldwide. The case number is estimated to double by 2050. Despite extensive research, the precise etiology and pathogenesis of AD remain elusive. Researchers have a profound understanding of the disease's pathological hallmarks, which include amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles resulting from the abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein. However, the exact causes and mechanisms of the disease are still not fully understood, leaving a vital gap in our knowledge and understanding of this debilitating disease. A crucial player that has recently emerged in the field of AD research is the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR). alpha 7nAChR is composed of five identical alpha 7 subunits that form a homopentamer. This receptor is a significant subtype of acetylcholine receptor in the central nervous system and is widely distributed in various regions of the brain. It is particularly prevalent in the hippocampus and cortical areas, which are regions associated with learning and memory. alpha 7nAChR plays a pivotal role in several neurological processes, including neurotransmitter release, neuronal plasticity, cell signal transduction, and inflammatory response, suggesting its potential involvement in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. In recent years, the role of alpha 7nAChR in AD has been the focus of extensive research. Emerging evidence suggests that alpha 7nAChR is involved in several critical steps in the disease progression of AD. These include involvement in the metabolism of amyloid beta-protein (A beta), the phosphorylation of Tau protein, neuroinflammatory response, and oxidative stress. Each of these processes contributes to the development and progression of AD, and the involvement of alpha 7nAChR in these processes suggests that it may play a crucial role in the disease's pathogenesis. The potential significance of alpha 7nAChR in AD is further reinforced by the observation that alterations in its function or expression can have significant effects on cognitive abilities. These findings suggest that alpha 7nAChR could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in AD. At present, the results of drug clinical studies targeting alpha 7nAChR show that these compounds have improvement and therapeutic effects in AD patients, but they have not reached the degree of being widely used in clinical practice, and their drug development still faces many challenges. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand its role and to develop effective treatments based on this understanding. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the association between alpha 7nAChR and AD pathogenesis. We provide an overview of the latest research developments and insights, and highlight potential avenues for future research. As we deepen our understanding of the role of alpha 7nAChR in AD, it is hoped that this will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.
   By targeting alpha 7nAChR, we may be able to develop more effective treatments for AD, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients and their families.

AB  - Glutathione reductase (GSR) plays a critical role in the prevention of oxidative damage within the cell. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (LRP8) participates in a pathway that modulates synaptic plasticity events crucial for learning and memory. The above aspects are very important when homing pigeons participate in sports competitions. The aim of the study was to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GSR and LRP8 genes in homing pigeons and to evaluate the potential impact of these genotypes on racing performance, as well as their structural consequences for the encoded proteins. The research included a total of 311 young individuals. DNA was extracted from the blood. Genotypes were determined by the ACRS-PCR test designed. Statistical analysis revealed that the c.606G > T polymorphism in LRP8 gene significantly influenced racing performance, was associated with race performance heterozygous GT pigeons achieving higher mean values of ace points (AP) than homozygous individuals. Therefore, the GT genotype may serve as a selection criterion in pigeon breeding. Further research is necessary to confirm the functionality of the GSR KB376299.1:62398C > T SNP in shaping the racing phenotype of pigeons.

AB  - Epilepsy is a challenging brain disorder that is often difficult to treat with conventional therapies. The gut microbiota has been shown to play an important role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy. In this study, the effects of Bifidobacterium longum, a probiotic, on inflammation, neuronal degeneration, and behavior are evaluated in a lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) induced in young adult rats. B. longum was administered orally at a dose of 10(9) CFU/rat for 30 days after pilocarpine injection. The results show that B. longum treatment has beneficial effects on the TLE-induced changes in anxiety levels, neuronal death in the amygdala, and body weight recovery. In addition, B. longum increased the expression of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective genes, such as Il1rn and Pparg. However, the probiotic had little effect on TLE-induced astrogliosis and microgliosis and did not reduce neuronal death in the hippocampus and temporal cortex. The study suggests that B. longum may have a beneficial effect on TLE and may provide valuable insights into the role of gut bacteria in epileptogenesis. In addition, the results show that B. longum may be a promising drug for the comprehensive treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Single-cell MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids and metabolites >200 Da has recently come to the forefront of biomedical research and chemical biology. However, cell-targeting and metabolome-preserving methods for analysis of low mass, hydrophilic metabolites (<200 Da) in large cell populations are lacking. Here, the PRISM-MS (PRescan Imaging for Small Molecule - Mass Spectrometry) mass-guided MSI workflow is presented, which enables space-efficient single cell lipid and metabolite analysis. In conjunction with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as MSI ground truth for cell-sized objects and Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering for data-dependent identification of cell subpopulations, PRISM-MS enables MSI and on-cell MS2-based identification of low-mass metabolites like amino acids or Krebs cycle intermediates involved in stimulus-dependent cell activation. The utility of PRISM-MS is demonstrated through the characterization of complex metabolome changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. Translation of single cell results to endogenous microglia in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures indicates that LPS-activation involves changes of the itaconate-to-taurine ratio and alterations in neuron-to-glia glutamine-glutamate shuttling. The data suggests that PRISM-MS can serve as a standard method in single cell metabolomics, given its capability to characterize larger cell populations and low-mass metabolites.

AB  - The hippocampal subfields, pivotal to episodic memory, are distinct both in terms of cyto- and myeloarchitectony. Studying the structure of hippocampal subfields in vivo is crucial to understand volumetric trajectories across the lifespan, from the emergence of episodic memory during early childhood to memory impairments found in older adults. However, segmenting hippocampal subfields on conventional MRI sequences is challenging because of their small size. Furthermore, there is to date no unified segmentation protocol for the hippocampal subfields, which limits comparisons between studies. Therefore, we introduced a novel segmentation tool called HSF short for hippocampal segmentation factory, which leverages an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. First, we validated HSF against currently used tools (ASHS, HIPS, and HippUnfold). Then, we used HSF on 3,750 subjects from the HCP development, young adults, and aging datasets to study the effect of age and sex on hippocampal subfields volumes. Firstly, we showed HSF to be closer to manual segmentation than other currently used tools (p < 0.001), regarding the Dice Coefficient, Hausdorff Distance, and Volumetric Similarity. Then, we showed differential maturation and aging across subfields, with the dentate gyrus being the most affected by age. We also found faster growth and decay in men than in women for most hippocampal subfields. Thus, while we introduced a new, fast and robust end-to-end segmentation tool, our neuroanatomical results concerning the lifespan trajectories of the hippocampal subfields reconcile previous conflicting results.

AB  - Simple Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern worldwide in both human and veterinary medicine. Biosecurity and the ability to limit bacterial contamination on farms are crucial in the fight against disease, including AMR bacteria. This study aimed to investigate whether the recommended concentrations of five commercial disinfectants (A to E) were sufficient to inhibit growth and inactivate a panel of bacterial strains, including some that carry multidrug resistance to selected antimicrobials. The effectiveness of each disinfectant was expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The results indicate that the type of disinfectant and its concentration influence the inhibitory and bactericidal efficacy. The glutaraldehyde/quaternary ammonium-compound-based (disinfectant D) and chlorocresol-based products (disinfectant B) were the most effective in this study. Varying results were observed for the other compounds, depending on the bacterial species tested. The iodine-based (disinfectant C) and potassium-peroxymonosulfate-based (disinfectant A) products were less able to inhibit or inactivate the bacteria. The disinfectant products were less effective against the strains of E. coli with different phenotypic profiles of antimicrobial resistance compared to sensitive strains. The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance worldwide has led to an increasing concern in the human, veterinary, and environmental fields, highlighting the need for strategies to effectively control bacterial contamination. Correct biosecurity practices, including the appropriate use of disinfectants, play a crucial role in controlling bacterial contamination. This study aimed to verify whether the recommended concentrations defined according to the Defra General Orders concentration (GO, published by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' disinfectant-approval scheme) of five commercial disinfectant preparations (peroxygen-based, phenol-based, two halogen-releasing agents, and glutaraldehyde/quaternary ammonium compound-based; disinfectants A to E, respectively) were sufficient to inhibit growth and inactivate selected bacterial strains, including some that carry known phenotypic patterns of multidrug resistance. The effectiveness of each disinfectant was expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values, determined by the broth-microdilution method. The results indicate that the type of disinfectant and its concentration influence the inhibitory and bactericidal efficacy. The glutaraldehyde/quaternary ammonium compound-based (disinfectant D) and chlorocresol-based products (disinfectant B) were the most effective, and the GO concentration was bactericidal in all the strains tested. The efficacy of the other compounds varied, depending on the bacterial species tested. The GO concentrations were at least able to inhibit the bacterial growth in all the products and bacterial strains tested. A greater tolerance to the compounds was observed in the strains of E. coli with multidrug-resistance profiles compared to the strains that were sensitive to the same antimicrobials.

AB  - Aversive Geofencing Devices (AGDs) are designed to emit audible warning signals followed by electric shocks when animals reach virtual fences (VFs) with the intent that animals will learn to turn away at audio warnings and thereby avoid receiving shocks. AGDs are a potentially useful tool for mitigating human-elephant conflict, but a greater understanding of captive elephant responses to AGDs is required before they might be confidently used on wild elephants. We conducted experiments with eight, female captive Asian elephants using a modified dog-training collar to deliver mild electric shocks (4 kV) of varying strength (pulse frequencies) to determine the ideal location on the neck to deliver the stimuli and the optimum strength of the shock required to generate desired aversive responses. Ten shocks (<1 s duration) of different strengths were delivered during a 10 min session (i.e., one shock per minute) at two positions on one side of the elephant's neck. Results indicated that elephants were more likely to display desirable aversive behaviours at the upper position tested on the neck (odds ratio=0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.87, P = 0.018) and at higher stimuli strengths (odds ratio=1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P <= 0.001). A conditioning experiment was then conducted several months later with five of the same elephants. These were individually trained to walk along a similar to 100 m path to a food reward on three consecutive days, wearing a dummy collar. On the next three days and on one other day few months later, the elephants were fitted with a similar shock collar (positioned at the upper neck location, and with the highest strength tested earlier) to determine if the AGD could prevent the elephants from accessing the food reward. Three VFs were established at similar to 30 m, similar to 50 m and similar to 60 m points along the path. As the elephant approached the food, a mild audio warning, a more aggressive audio warning, and an electric shock was administered at the first, second and third VFs respectively. Warnings and shocks were not delivered if elephants heeded earlier warnings. A maximum of five such trials were attempted. The VFs successfully kept elephants from reaching the food 77.8% of the time, with elephants responding to the audio warnings and avoiding electric stimulation 47.2% of the trials. These findings suggest that AGDs are a promising method to manage elephant movement, but further research is needed to develop a reliable approach for wild elephants.

AB  - The formation of customized neural networks as the basis of brain functions such as receptive field selectivity, learning or memory depends heavily on the long-term plasticity of synaptic connections. However, the current mean-field population models commonly used to simulate large-scale neural network dynamics lack explicit links to the underlying cellular mechanisms of long-term plasticity. In this study, we developed a new mean-field population model, the plastic density-based neural mass model (pdNMM), by incorporating a newly devel-oped rate-based plasticity model based on the calcium control hypothesis into an existing density-based neural mass model. Derivation of the plasticity model was carried out using population density methods. Our results showed that the synaptic plasticity represented by the resulting rate-based plasticity model exhibited Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro-like learning rules. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the pdNMM accurately reproduced previous experimental observations of long-term plasticity, including characteristics of Hebbian plasticity such as longevity, associativity and input specificity, on hippocampal slices, and the formation of receptive field selectivity in the visual cortex. In conclusion, the pdNMM is a novel approach that can confer long-term plasticity to conventional mean-field neuronal population models.

AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI), contribute substantially to healthcare burden. Diabetes predispose to UTI with high glycosuria being fertile medium for bacterial growth. With changing bacterial drug resistance patterns; the problem needs to be studied periodically to ensure a rational therapy, minimize adverse effects, and cost. Therefore, it is of interest to compare the profile and susceptibility pattern of uropathogens isolated from diabetic and non-diabetic patients with UTI. Mid-stream urine samples of 1100 patients (diabetic and non -diabetic), presenting with UTI symptoms were aseptically collected and inoculated into CLED medium. Colony counts of 10(5)cfu/ml or 10(4)cfu/ml and > 5 pus cells per high power microscopic field were regarded as significant bacteriuria. Colonies from CLED were sub-cultured onto sheep blood agar and MacConkey agar. Bacterial identification was performed on the basis of colony morphology, gram staining, and series of biochemical tests though Analytical Profile Index (API) test strips. Drug susceptibility was done by standard Kirby -Bauer disk diffusion. Data was analyzed by SPSS ver. 25.Clinically significant bacteriuria was 32.8% and 19.2% in diabetics and non -diabetics respectively. The frequency of male and female patients was 153 and 208 in diabetic group; and 69 and 142 respectively in non -diabetic group. Diabetics were twice at risk of UTI; [Odds ratio; 2.04 (CI: 1.68-2.48, p < 0.05)]. .Escherichia coli and klebsiella were most common gram-negative, while Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were most common gram-positive bacteria in both the groups. Most effective antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria were carbapenems, amikacin, colistin, and piperacillin/tazobactam; while ampicillin/amoxicillin, fluoroquinolones and cephalexin were least effective. For gram-positives, vancomycin, linezolid and tigecycline were most effective. No significant difference in bacterial profile and susceptibility pattern was found between diabetics and non-diabetics. However, diabetics were twice at risk of UTI compared to non-diabetics.

AB  - Methionine, as an essential amino acid, play roles in antioxidant defense and the regulation of immune responses. This study was designed to determine the effects and mechanisms of increased consumption of methionine by sows and piglets on the capacity of the progeny to counteract lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge-induced injury in the liver and spleen of piglets. Primiparous sows (n = 10/diet) and their progeny were fed a diet that was adequate in sulfur amino acids (CON) or CON + 25% total sulfur amino acids as methionine from gestation day 85 to postnatal day 35. A total of ten male piglets were selected from each treatment and divided into 2 groups (n = 5/treatment) for a 2 x 2 factorial design [diets (CON, Methionine) and challenge (saline or LPS)] at 35 d old. After 24 h challenge, the piglets were euthanized to collect the liver and spleen for the histopathology, redox status, and gene expression analysis. The histopathological results showed that LPS challenge induced liver and spleen injury, while dietary methionine supplementation alleviated these damages that were induced by the LPS challenge. Furthermore, the LPS challenge also decreased the activities of GPX, SOD, and CAT and upregulated the mRNA and(or) protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, NOD1, NOD2, NF-kB, TNF-alpha, IL-8, p53, BCL2, and COX2 in the liver and (or) spleen. The alterations of GPX and SOD activities and the former nine genes were prevented or alleviated by the methionine supplementation. In conclusion, the maternal and neonatal dietary supplementation of methionine improved the ability of piglets to resist LPS challenge-induced liver and spleen injury, potentially through the increased antioxidant capacity and inhibition of TLR4 and NOD signaling pathway.

AB  - Faecal stanols in lake sediments have been used as a proxy for human populations in the past in a variety of contexts, with the assumption that variability in faecal stanol concentration or ratios is a reliable proxy for relative catchment-scale human populations. Despite that, the specific controls on faecal stanol concentrations and ratios in lake sediments remain poorly understood. In this study we analyse faecal stanol concentrations in lake surface sediments across Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in order to constrain geographical and biogeochemical variables controlling stanol concentrations and ratios in lake sediments in this region. We propose and test the hypothesis that the stanol ratios coprostanol:(coprostanol + stigmastanol) and coprostanol:(coprostanol + cholestanol) scale according to the proximity to and size of nearby population centres. The key controls on stanol concentrations that we identify are the proximity to human population centres and the human population within 5 km of the sampling point. Based on a transect across Lake Peten Itza, the ratio coprostanol:(coprostanol + cholestanol) does not appear to be an accurate proxy for proximity to human population centres, nor does it correlate with catchment human population. We suggest that normalising stanol concentrations to TOC is an appropriate way to take into account the effects of mineral dilution as well as the potential effects of organic matter deposition and preservation, and that the ratio coprostanol:(coprostanol + stigmastanol) does not scale with human population but may be an effective approach to determine the relative contribution of coprostanol-producing mammals and herbivores. Further, we discuss the current limitations of the proxy as well as its future directions, including the implications of our results for sediment core siting, the use of stanol ratios in palaeolimnology, as well as the storage, transport, and diagenesis of stanols.

AB  - Green tea catechins are associated with a delay in aging. We have designed the current study to investigate the impact and to unveil the target of the most abundant green tea catechins, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG).
   Experiments were performed in Caenorhabditis elegans to analyze cellular metabolism, ROS homeostasis, stress resistance, physical exercise capacity, health- and lifespan, and the underlying signaling pathways. Besides, we examined the impact of EGCG and ECG in isolated murine mitochondria.
   A concentration of 2.5 mu M EGCG and ECG enhanced health- and lifespan as well as stress resistance in C. elegans. Catechins hampered mitochondrial respiration in C. elegans after 6-12 h and the activity of complex I in isolated rodent mitochondria. The impaired mitochondrial respiration was accompanied by a transient drop in ATP production and a temporary increase in ROS levels in C. elegans. After 24 h, mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels got restored, and ROS levels even dropped below control conditions. The lifespan increases induced by EGCG and ECG were dependent on AAK-2/AMPK and SIR-2.1/SIRT1, as well as on PMK-1/p38 MAPK, SKN-1/NRF2, and DAF-16/FOXO. Long-term effects included significantly diminished fat content and enhanced SOD and CAT activities, required for the positive impact of catechins on lifespan.
   In summary, complex I inhibition by EGCG and ECG induced a transient drop in cellular ATP levels and a temporary ROS burst, resulting in SKN-1 and DAF-16 activation. Through adaptative responses, catechins reduced fat content, enhanced ROS defense, and improved healthspan in the long term.

AB  - Active conductances tune the kinetics of axonal action potentials (APs) to support specialized functions of neuron types. However, the temporal characteristics of voltage signals strongly depend on the size of neuronal structures, as capacitive and resistive effects slow down voltage discharges in the membranes of small elements. Axonal action potentials are particularly sensitive to these inherent biophysical effects because of the large diameter variabilities within individual axons, potentially implying bouton size-dependent synaptic effects. However, using direct patch-clamp recordings and voltage imaging in small hippocampal axons in acute slices from rat brains, we demonstrate that AP shapes remain uniform within the same axons, even across an order of magnitude difference in caliber. Our results show that smaller axonal structures have more Kv1 potassium channels that locally re-accelerate AP repolarization and contribute to size-independent APs, while they do not preclude the plasticity of AP shapes. Thus, size-independent axonal APs ensure consistent digital signals for each synapse within axons of same types.

AB  - Evidence has shown that consuming trans fatty acids (TFA) during development leads to their incorporation into the nervous tissue, resulting in neurological changes in flies. In this study, Drosophila melanogaster was exposed to different concentrations of hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF) during development: substitute hydrogenated vegetable fat (SHVF), HVF 10 %, and HVF 20 %. The objective was to evaluate the effects of early trans fat exposure on cognition and associated pathways in flies. The results showed that early TFA exposure provoked a cerebral redox imbalance, as confirmed by increased reactive species (HVF 10 and 20 %) and lipid peroxidation (SHVF, HVF 10, and 20 %), reduced nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 immunoreactivity (HVF 10 and 20 %), and increased heat shock protein 70 (HVF 20 %), which was possibly responsible for decreasing superoxide dismutase (SHVF, HVF 10, and 20 %) and catalase (HVF 20 %) activities. Furthermore, the presence of TFA in nervous tissue impaired learning (HVF 10 and 20 %) and memory at 6 and 24 h (SHVF, HVF 10, and 20 %). These cognitive impairments may be linked to reduced Shank levels (HVF 20 %) and increased acetylcholinesterase activity (SHVF, HVF 10 and 20 %) observed. Our findings demonstrate that early exposure to trans fat leads to cerebral redox imbalance, altering proteins associated with stress, synaptic plasticity, and the cholinergic system, consequently leading to cognitive impairment in flies.

AB  - Chronic stress is associated with increased anxiety, cognitive deficits, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice causes long-term stress-sensitization associated with increased microglia activation, monocyte accumulation, and enhanced interleukin (IL)-1 signaling in endothelia and neurons. With stress-sensitization, mice have amplified neuronal, immune, and behavioral responses to acute stress 24 days later. This is clinically relevant as it shares key aspects with post-traumatic stress disorder. The mechanisms underlying stress-sensitization are unclear, but enhanced fear memory may be critical. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of microglia and IL-1R1 signaling in neurons in the development of sensitization and increased fear memory after RSD. Here, RSD accelerated fear acquisition, delayed fear extinction, and increased cued-based freezing at 0.5 day. The enhancement in contextual fear memory after RSD persisted 24 days later. Next, microglia were depleted with a CSF1R antagonist prior to RSD and several parameters were assessed. Microglia depletion blocked monocyte recruitment to the brain. Nonetheless, neuronal reactivity (pCREB) and IL-1 beta RNA expression in the hippocampus and enhanced fear memory after RSD were microglial-independent. Because IL-1 beta RNA was prominent in the hippocampus after RSD even with microglia depletion, IL-1R1 mediated signaling in glutamatergic neurons was assessed using neuronal Vglut2+/IL-1R1-/- mice. RSD-induced neuronal reactivity (pCREB) in the hippocampus and enhancement in fear memory were dependent on neuronal IL-1R1 signaling. Furthermore, single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) showed that RSD influenced transcription in specific hippocampal neurons (DG neurons, CA2/3, CA1 neurons) associated with glutamate signaling, inflammation and synaptic plasticity, which were neuronal IL-1R1-dependent. Furthermore, snRNAseq data provided evidence that RSD increased CREB, BDNF, and calcium signaling in DG neurons in an IL-1R1-dependent manner. Collectively, increased IL-1R1-mediated signaling (monocytes/microglia independent) in glutamatergic neurons after RSD enhanced neuronal reactivity and fear memory.

AB  - The preservation of ovaries beyond 7 h dramatically decreases the developmental potential of oocytes to reach the blastocyst stage during in vitro embryo production. Here we investigated the protective effects of melatonin in the ovarian preservation solution after prolonged storage (7 h) in ovine as an animal model. Slaughterhouse adult sheep ovaries were preserved in saline solution for 2 h (Control) and 7 h (Control stress), and with melatonin for 7 h and at different concentrations (Melatonin 10(-3), 10(-5), 10(-7), 10(-9), and 10(-11) M). First, the fertilizing ability, embryo development rates, and blastocyst quality were investigated. Notably, a concentration of 10 -9 M melatonin showed the greatest number (p < 0.05) of blastocysts produced after 7 h of ovary storage (24.75 +/- 1.57%) and was comparable (p > 0.05) to that obtained after just 2 h of storage in the untreated Control (30.77 +/- 1.57%). Then, oocyte quality parameters showed that, compared to Control stress, Melatonin actively reduced intracellular ROS content, caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation, and the abundance of pro-apoptotic transcripts BAX and CASP3, while increasing that of GDF9 and GPX1. In cumulus cells, flow cytometry results showed that melatonin decreased apoptosis and increased mitochondrial activity (p < 0.05). In addition, there was a greater (p < 0.05) abundance of HAS2, STAR, and PTGS mRNA transcripts in Melatonin compared to Control stress. These findings reveal a melatonin-mediated developmental rescue of oocytes against ischemic damage during ovary preservation which represents a promising strategy for successfully producing embryos when prolonged ovarian transport times are required.

AB  - In recent years, scholars have developed and enhanced optimization algorithms to tackle high-dimensional optimization and engineering challenges. The primary challenge of high-dimensional optimization lies in striking a balance between exploring a wide search space and focusing on specific regions. Meanwhile, engineering design problems are intricate and come with various constraints. This research introduces a novel approach called Hippo Swarm Optimization (HSO), inspired by the behavior of hippos, designed to address high-dimensional optimization problems and real-world engineering challenges. HSO encompasses four distinct search strategies based on the behavior of hippos in different scenarios: starvation search, alpha search, margination, and competition. To assess the effectiveness of HSO, we conducted experiments using the CEC2017 test set, featuring the highest dimensional problems, CEC2022 and four constrained engineering problems. In parallel, we employed 14 established optimization algorithms as a control group. The experimental outcomes reveal that HSO outperforms the 14 well-known optimization algorithms, achieving first average ranking out of them in CEC2017 and CEC2022. Across the four classical engineering design problems, HSO consistently delivers the best results. These results substantiate HSO as a highly effective optimization algorithm for both high-dimensional optimization and engineering challenges.

AB  - Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathogenic event leading to cognitive decline in Huntington's disease (HD). We previously reported that the active ADAM10 level is increased in the HD cortex and striatum, causing excessive proteolysis of the synaptic cell adhesion protein N-Cadherin. Conversely, ADAM10 inhibition is neuroprotective and prevents cognitive decline in HD mice. Although the breakdown of cortico-striatal connection has been historically linked to cognitive deterioration in HD, dendritic spine loss and long-term potentiation (LTP) defects identified in the HD hippocampus are also thought to contribute to the cognitive symptoms of the disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the contribution of ADAM10 to spine pathology and LTP defects of the HD hippocampus. We provide evidence that active ADAM10 is increased in the hippocampus of two mouse models of HD, leading to extensive proteolysis of N-Cadherin, which has a widely recognized role in spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. Importantly, the conditional heterozygous deletion of ADAM10 in the forebrain of HD mice resulted in the recovery of spine loss and ultrastructural synaptic defects in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Meanwhile, normalization of the active ADAM10 level increased the pool of synaptic BDNF protein and activated ERK neuroprotective signaling in the HD hippocampus. We also show that the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X restored LTP defects and increased the density of mushroom spines enriched with GluA1-AMPA receptors in HD hippocampal neurons. Notably, we report that administration of the TrkB antagonist ANA12 to HD hippocampal neurons reduced the beneficial effect of GI254023X, indicating that the BDNF receptor TrkB contributes to mediate the neuroprotective activity exerted by ADAM10 inhibition in HD. Collectively, these findings indicate that ADAM10 inhibition coupled with TrkB signaling represents an efficacious strategy to prevent hippocampal synaptic plasticity defects and cognitive dysfunction in HD.

AB  - The present experiment employed time-lapse (TL) imaging to assess the effects of vitrification on the development of ovine blastocysts and to see if the timing of blastocyst formation and expansion was correlated with the numbers of embryo- and trophoblasts determined through differential staining of the expanded blastocysts. Ovaries were obtained after slaughter from cycling (October-March) Polish Longwool ewes aged 1-3 years and cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected by ovarian scarification. In vitro maturation was performed in TCM 199 medium supplemented with Earle's Salt, 10% of FBS, and 5 mu g/mL of LH/FSH at 38 degrees C for 24 h. After maturation, the oocytes were incubated with thawed ram semen (IVF) for 19 h and all presumptive zygotes were transferred to a 16-well dish containing Cult medium for monitoring with the Primo Vision TL system. A portion of ovine embryos were vitrified (Cryotop system) at the early cavitation stage and TL observations of warmed (n = 30) and non-vitrified (n = 32) blastocysts continued until the attainment of the expanded blastocyst stage, at which point they were differentially stained with bisbenzimide and propidium iodide for microscopic enumeration of embryoblasts (inner cell mass blastomeres) and trophoblast-cells. There were no statistically significant differences in the timing of blastulation (tB) and formation of expanded blastocysts (tEB) between vitrified and non-vitrified ovine embryos, but non-vitrified blastocysts exceeded (P < 0.05) their vitrified and warmed counterparts in the mean number of embryo- and trophoblasts. In addition, the number of trophoblasts was negatively and moderately correlated with tB and tEB, for both vitrified and non-vitrified embryos. It can be concluded that even though vitrification of ovine embryos is associated with a significant reduction in the number of blastomeres, the rate of blastocyst development remains closely linked to the numbers of trophoblastic cells.

AB  - The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is diverse and multi-factorial, yet treatment strategies remain limited. While women are twice as likely to develop the disorder as men, many animal model studies of antidepressant response rely solely on male subjects. The endocannabinoid system has been linked to depression in clinical and pre-clinical studies. Cannabidiolic Acid-Methyl Ester (CBDA-ME, EPM-301) demonstrated anti-depressive-like effects in male rats. Here, we explored acute effects of CBDA-ME and some possible mediating mechanisms, using a depressive-like genetic animal model, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. In Experiment 1, Female WKY rats underwent the Forced swim test (FST) following acute CBDA-ME oral ingestion (1/5/10 mg/kg). In Experiment 2, Male and female WKY rats underwent the FST after injection of CB1 (AM-251) and CB2 (AM-630) receptor antagonists 30 min before acute CBDA-ME ingestion (1 mg/kg, males; 5 mg/kg, females). Serum levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), numerous endocannabinoids and hippocampal Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) levels were assessed. Results indicate that females required higher doses of CBDA-ME (5 and 10 mg/kg) to induce an anti-depressive-like effect in the FST. AM-630 blocked the antidepressant-like effect in females, but not in males. The effect of CBDA-ME in females was accompanied by elevated serum BDNF and some endocannabinoids and low hippocampal expression of FAAH. This study shows a sexually diverse behavioral anti-depressive response to CBDA-ME and possible underlying mechanisms in females, supporting its potential use for treating MDD and related disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Epidemiological studies indicated that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as its two main types, is associated with dementia. However, little is known about how adolescents with IBD will affect their cognitive ability as adults. The hippocampus, which is crucial for memory and adult neurogenesis, is closely associated with modulation of cognitive processes. Using a low kDa dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 5 kDa)-induced chronic colitis (mild chronic colitis) mice model in adolescent mice, we investigated the effects of mild chronic colitis on cognitive functions and hippocampal neurogenesis from adolescent mice to adult mice. Methods: We induced DSS-induced mild chronic colitis in C57BL/6J male mice by multiple-cycle administration of 1%-2% DSS in autoclaved drinking water. Mice were subjected to novel-object recognition and Y-maze tests. Neurogenesis markers and neuroinflammation-related proteins in the hippocampus of mice were measured. Tight junction proteins in the colon of mice were measured. Results: Mild chronic colitis induced cognitive impairment and decreased adult neurogenesis. Notably, we found a positive correlation with the protein levels between tight junction protein, ZO-1, in the colon and mature neuron marker, NeuN, in the hippocampus. Moreover, mild chronic colitis leads to hippo-campal neuroinflammation in adolescent mice. Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence of the association between IBD and dementia risk.

AB  - The developing entorhinal-hippocampal system is embedded within a large-scale bottom-up network, where spontaneous myoclonic movements, presumably via somatosensory feedback, trigger hippocampal early sharp waves (eSPWs). The hypothesis, that somatosensory feedback links myoclonic movements with eSPWs, implies that direct somatosensory stimulation should also be capable of evoking eSPWs. In this study, we examined hippocampal responses to electrical stimulation of the somatosensory periphery in urethane-anesthetized, immobilized neonatal rat pups using silicone probe recordings. We found that somatosensory stimulation in similar to 33% of the trials evoked local field potential (LFP) and multiple unit activity (MUA) responses identical to spontaneous eSPWs. The somatosensory-evoked eSPWs were delayed from the stimulus, on average, by 188 ms. Both spontaneous and somatosensory-evoked eSPWs (i) had similar amplitude of similar to 0.5 mV and half-duration of similar to 40 ms, (ii) had similar current-source density (CSD) profiles, with current sinks in CA1 strata radiatum, lacunosum-moleculare and DG molecular layer and (iii) were associated with MUA increase in CA1 and DG. Our results indicate that eSPWs can be triggered by direct somatosensory stimulations and support the hypothesis that sensory feedback from movements is involved in the association of eSPWs with myoclonic movements in neonatal rats.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulated cell death that is triggered primarily by lipid peroxidation. A growing body of evidence has implicated ferroptosis in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, none of these studies focused its role on TBI-induced hippocampal injury. Here, we demonstrated that the distinct ferroptotic signature was detected in the injured hippocampus at the early stage of TBI. Besides, a prominent pro-ferroptosis environment was detected in the ipsilateral hippocampus after TBI, including elevated levels of arachidonic acid (AA), ACLS4, and ALXO15, and deficiency of GPX4. Subsequently, we used AAVmediated Gpx4 overexpression to counteract ferroptosis in the hippocampus, and found that TBI-induced cognitive deficits were significantly alleviated after Gpx4 overexpression. Biochemical results also confirmed that TBI-induced hippocampal ferroptosis and synaptic damage were partially reversed by Gpx4 overexpression. In addition, Gpx4 overexpression inhibited TBI-induced neuroinflammation and peripheral macrophage infiltration. Interestingly, the results of transwell migration assay showed that ferroptotic neurons increased CCL2 expression and promoted iBMDM cell migration. However, this effect was inhibited by CCL2 antagonist, RS102895. These data suggested that inhibition of ferroptosis may be as a potential strategy to ameliorate TBIinduced cognitive deficits through blockade of hippocampal ferroptosis and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the primary cause of child mortality and disability worldwide. It can result in severe complications that significantly impact children's quality of life, including post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). An increasing number of studies suggest that TBI-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory sequelae (especially, inflammation in the hippocampus region) may lead to the development of PTE. Due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), typical systemic pharmacological therapy for TBI cannot deliver berberine (BBR) to the targeted location in the early stages of the injury, although BBR has strong anti-inflammatory properties. To break through this limitation, a microenvironment-responsive gelatin methacrylate (GM) hydrogel to deliver poly(propylene sulfide)60 (PPS60) and BBR (GM/PB) is developed for regulating neuroinflammatory reactions and removing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain trauma microenvironment through PPS60. In situ injection of the GM/PB hydrogel efficiently bypasses the BBB and is administered directly to the surface of brain tissue. In post-traumatic brain injury models, GM/PB has the potential to mitigate oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory responses, facilitate functional recovery, and lessen seizing. These findings can lead to a new treatment for brain injuries, which minimizes complications and improves the quality of life.
   An injectable gelatin methacrylate hydrogel for delivering poly(propylene sulfide)60 (PPS60) and berberine (BBR) (GM/PB) is developed for sustained treatment of juvenile traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. It scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduces neuroinflammation, ultimately reducing post-traumatic epilepsy. This new TBI treatment could minimize complications and improve quality of life. image

AB  - Substantial evidence suggest that chronic consumption of high -fat diets (HFDs) can lead to obesity, abnormal metabolism, as well as cognitive impairment. Molecular and cellular changes regarding hippocampal dysfunctions have been identified in multiple HFD animal models. Therefore, in-depth identification of expression changes of hippocampal proteins is critical for understanding the mechanism of HFD-induced cognitive deficits. In this study, we fed 3-week-old male mice with HFD for 3 months to generate obese mice who exhibit systemic metabolic abnormality and learning and memory decline. Using an iTRAQ-labeled proteomic analysis, we identified a total of 82 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the hippocampus upon HFD with 35 up-regulated proteins and 47 down-regulated proteins. Functional enrichment indicated that these DEPs were predominantly enriched in regulation of catabolic process, dendritic shaft, neuron projection morphogenesis and GTPase regulator activity. Protein -protein interaction enrichment showed that the DEPs are mostly enriched in postsynaptic functions; and of them, six proteins (i.e., DLG3, SYNGAP1, DCLK1, GRIA4, GRIP1, and ARHGAP32) were involved in several functional assemblies of the postsynaptic density including G-protein signaling, scaffolding and adaptor, kinase and AMPA signaling, respectively. Collectively, our findings suggest that these DEPs upon HFD might contribute to memory decline by disturbing neuronal and postsynaptic functions in the hippocampus. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused significant economic losses to the pig farming industry in various countries for a long time. Currently, there are no highly effective preventive or control measures available. Research into the pathogenic mechanism of PEDV has shown that it primarily causes infection by binding the S protein to the CD13 (APN) receptor on the membrane of porcine intestinal epithelial cells. The S1 region contains three neutralization epitopes and multiple receptor-binding domains, which are closely related to viral antigenicity and ad-sorption invasion. Nanobodies are a type of single-domain antibody that have been discovered in recent years. They can be expressed on a large scale through prokaryotic expression systems, which makes them cost-effective, stable, and less immunogenic. This study used a phage display library of nanobodies against the PEDV S1 protein. After three rounds of selection and enrichment, the DNA sequence of the highly specific nanobody S1Nb1 was successfully obtained. To obtain soluble nanobody S1Nb1, its DNA sequence was inserted into the vector Pcold and a solubility-enhancing SUMO tag was added. The resulting recombinant vector, Pcold-SUMO-S1Nb1, was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to determine the optimal expression conditions for the nanobody. Following purification using Ni-column affinity chromatography, Western blot analysis confirmed the successful purification of S1Nb1 carrying the solubility-enhancing tag. ELISA results demonstrated a strong affinity between the S1Nb1 nanobody and PEDV S1 protein.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate anti-Helicobacter pylori effects of Limosilactobacillus reuteri 2892 (L. reuteri 2892) isolated from camel milk in GC cell lines (AGS and MKN). From 15 camel milk samples, 132 microbial strains were isolated. Based on microbial and biochemical analysis, 11 potential probiotic candidates were selected. The potential probiotic candidates were assayed for anti-H. pylori activity, and the strain with the highest anti-H. pylori activity was identified genotypically. Based on 16S rDNA sequencing, the selected strain with the best activity against H. pylori (inhibition zone = 15.5 & PLUSMN; 0.8) belonged to the Lactobacillus reuteri strain 2892. Cell treatment with H. pylori HC-113 inhibits gene expression of Claudin-4, ZO-1, MUC5AC, and MUC2 in gastric cells, which are attenuated by L. reuteri 2892. The simulative effects of H. pylori HC-113 on the cell migration and invasion of gastric cells were lost when cells were cotreated with L. reuteri 2892. Cell treatment with H. pylori HC-113 promoted cell death, whereas cotreatment with L. reuteri 2892 markedly decreased necrotic and late apoptotic cells. The present study demonstrates that L. reuteri 2892 has potent anti-H. pylori effects and thus can be considered as an alternative protective agent against inflammatory effects of H. pylori in gastric cells.

AB  - Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is a promising agent for Parkinson's disease treatment. However, its role in regulation of non-motor behavior including various psychopathologies remains unclear. In this regard, the aim of the present work was to study effect of CDNF overexpression in hippocampus on behavior of the ASC mice (Antidepressant Sensitive Cataleptics) with genetic predisposition to depressive-like behavior. CDNF overexpression in the mouse hippocampal neurons was induced using an adeno-associated viral vector. Four weeks after stereotaxic injection of the AAV-CDNF construct into the dorsal hippocampus home cage activity, exploratory, anxious and depressive-like types of behavior, as well as spatial and associative learning were assessed. We found significant improvements in the dynamics of spatial learning in the Morris water maze in the CDNF-overexpressing animals. At the same time, no effect of CDNF was found on other types of behavior under study. Behavior of the experimental animals under home cage conditions did not differ from that in the control group, except for the decrease in the total amount of food eaten and slight increase in the number of sleep episodes during the light phase of the day. In the present study we also attempted to determine molecular basis for the above-mentioned changes through assessment of the gene expression pattern. We did not find significant changes in the mRNA level of key kinases genes involved in neuroplasticity and neuronal survival, as well as genes encoding receptors for the main neurotransmitter systems. However, the CDNF-overexpressing animals showed increased level of the spliced Xbp indicating activation of the Ire1 & alpha;/Xbp-1 pathway traditionally associated with ER stress. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CDNF was co-localized with the ER marker calreticulin. Thus, the effects of endogenous CDNF on behavior that we have found could be mediated by a specific molecular cascade, which emphasizes its difference from the classical neurotrophic factors.

AB  - Communication between the nervous and immune systems serves a key role in host-protective immunity at mucosal barrier sites including the respiratory tract. In these tissues, neuroimmune interactions operate in bidirectional circuits that can sense and respond to mechanical, chemical, and biologic stimuli. Allergen- or helminth-induced products can produce airway inflammation by direct action on nociceptive afferents and adjacent tissues. The activity of nociceptive afferents can regulate innate and adaptive immune responses via neuropeptides and neurotransmitter signaling. This review will summarize recent work investigating the role of neuropeptides CGRP, VIP, neuromedins, substance P, and neurotransmitters dopamine and the B2-adrenoceptor agonists epinepherine/norepinepherine, each of which influence type 2 immunity by instructing mast cell, innate lymphoid cell type 2, dendritic cell, and T cell responses, both in the airway and the draining lymph node. Afferents in the airway also contain receptors for alarmins and cytokines, allowing their activity to be modulated by immune cell secreted products, particularly those secreted by mast cells. Taken together, we propose that further investigation of how immunoregulatory neuropeptides shape respiratory inflammation in experimental systems may reveal novel therapeutic targets for addressing the increasing prevalence of chronic airway disease in humans.

AB  - : Epilepsy is a relatively complicated neurological disorder that results in seizures. The use of resveratrol in treating seizures has been reported in recent studies. However, the low bioavailability of resveratrol and the difficulty of reaching the targeted location in the brain reduce its efficacy considerably. The side effects due to the higher concentration of drugs are another matter of concern. The purpose of the present study is to enhance the antiepileptic potential of resveratrol by delivering it to the brain's targeted location by encapsulating it in glutathione-coated collagen nanoparticles. The collagen nanoparticles increase the bioavailability of resveratrol, while the transport of resveratrol to its target location in the brain is facilitated by glutathione. By encapsulating resveratrol in glutathione-coated collagen nanoparticles, the concentration also substantially decreases. Resveratrol encapsulated in synthesized nanoparticles is referred to as nanoresveratrol. In the present study, nanoresveratrol effectiveness was studied through PTZ-induced seizures (PTZ-IS) and the increasing current electroshock (ICES) test. The efficacy of nanoresveratrol was further established using biochemical analysis, histopathological examinations, ELISA and real-time-PCR tests, and immunohistochemistry examination of the hippocampus of mice. Hence, this study is unique in the sense that it synthesized nanoresveratrol by using glutathione-coated collagen nanoparticles, followed by its application to treating seizures. On the basis of the study results, nanoresveratrol was found to be effective in preventing cognitive impairment in the mice and controlling epilepsy seizures to a greater extent than resveratrol. The proposed nanoformulation also reduces the concentration of resveratrol considerably. The present study results show that even 0.4 mg/kg of nanoresveratrol outperforms 40 mg/kg of resveratrol.

AB  - Background: Placenta plays a vital role in preeclampsia. The present study investigated the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its receptors in preeclampsia placenta. Method: Placenta samples were collected from normal and preeclampsia pregnancies, with one single fetus. Placental chorionic plate vessel tone was measured with DMT using vasoactive agents with or without antagonists. Role of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (CaV1.2) in single smooth muscle cell was detected using whole-cell patch clamp. PCR, Western blot, and ELISA was used to detect molecule expressions. Placental vessel explants and human umbilical vein smooth muscle cell (HUVSMC) were exposed to ET-1 treatment with or without antagonists. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and pregnant sheep was exposed to hypoxic condition, simulating preeclampsia. Results: ET-1 and IRL1620 mediated stronger contractions in preeclampsia placental veins, despite unchanged ETAR and decreased ETBR expression. Comparing with control, there was higher ET-1 in umbilical plasma, maternal plasma, and placental vessels from preeclampsia. In utero hypoxia increased plasma ET-1 in fetal lambs and ewes. Hypoxia promoted ET-1 production in HUVEC. Role and expression of CaV1.2 was decreased in preeclampsia placental vessels, while high-molecular-weight caldesmon (CALD1), the marker of contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells, was significantly increased. ET-1 treatment increased CALD1 in placental explants and in HUVSMC via ETAR/ETBR. Conclusion: The present study firstly demonstrated ET-1 induced greater contraction in preeclampsia placental chorionic plate veins via ETAR/ETBR, instead of via weaker CaV1.2. In utero hypoxia promoted plasma ET-1 in fetal lambs and ewe, similar to that in preeclampsia. ET-1, binding with ETAR/ETBR increased CALD1, which was associated with stronger contraction in preeclampsia. The data provided important information in preeclampsia onset.

TI  - Resurrection of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) from the ancestor of modern horseshoe bats blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication

AB  - The prenylated form of the human 2 '-5 '-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) protein has been shown to potently inhibit the replication of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the OAS1 orthologue in the horseshoe bats (superfamily Rhinolophoidea), the reservoir host of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), has lost the prenylation signal required for this antiviral activity. Herein, we used an ancestral state reconstruction approach to predict and reconstitute in vitro, the most likely OAS1 protein sequence expressed by the Rhinolophoidea common ancestor prior to its prenylation loss (RhinoCA OAS1). We exogenously expressed the ancient bat protein in vitro to show that, unlike its non-prenylated horseshoe bat descendants, RhinoCA OAS1 successfully blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. Using protein structure predictions in combination with evolutionary hypothesis testing methods, we highlight sites under unique diversifying selection specific to OAS1's evolution in the Rhinolophoidea. These sites are located near the RNA-binding region and the C-terminal end of the protein where the prenylation signal would have been. Our results confirm that OAS1 prenylation loss at the base of the Rhinolophoidea clade ablated the ability of OAS1 to restrict SARSr-CoV replication and that subsequent evolution of the gene in these bats likely favoured an alternative function. These findings can advance our understanding of the tightly linked association between SARSr-CoVs and horseshoe bats.
   The human OAS1 protein restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication, but the horseshoe bat OAS1 has lost this ability. This study reconstructs the functional 60-million-year-old OAS1 protein ancestral to all horseshoe bats, and reveals how this ancient antiviral mechanism was lost in the bats.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) translocation to the nucleus is a known phenomenon in patients with breast cancer. There is no evidence of this phenomenon in domestic animals (like pigs) at this time. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving PRLR nuclear translocation remains elusive. In this study, a cell model consisting of porcine mammary epithelial cells (PMECs) was developed. The induction of nuclear localization of porcine PRLR in PMECs was observed in response to porcine prolactin (pPRL). Afterwards, an analysis was conducted on the dynamics of pPRL-induced nuclear localization of pPRLR, which revealed that this process is time-dependent. After that, we utilized several pPRLR ligands to investigate how pPRLR localizes to the nucleus, and we showed that the nuclear translocation of pPRLR is PRL(s)-dependent. Additionally, we discovered that the nuclear translocation of the pPRL-PRLR complex is influenced by importin beta 1 (IMP beta 1), and EEA1 was involved in the nuclear translocation of pPRL-PRLR complex. In cell nuclei, the pPRL-PRLR complex has the potential to form a pPRL-PRLR-JAK2 multimer complex, suggesting that the nuclear-localized pPRL-PRLR complex may remain capable of transmitting signals, analogous to its function in the cell membrane.

AB  - Shank3, a key molecule related to the development and deterioration of autism, has recently been found to downregulate in the murine brain after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Despite this discovery, however, its effects on neuronal injury and the mechanism underlying the effects remain to be clarified. To address this, in this study, based on genetically modified mice models, we revealed that the expression of Shank3 showed a time-dependent change in murine hippocampal neurons after I/R, and that conditional knockout (cko) of Shank3 in neurons resulted in aggravated neuronal injuries. The protective effects of Shank3 against oxidative stress and inflam-mation after I/R were achieved through direct binding STIM1 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of STIM1. The STIM1 downregulation induced the phosphorylation of downstream Nrf2 Ser40, which subse-quently translocated to the nucleus, and further increased the expression of antioxidant genes such as NQO1 and HO-1 in HT22 cells. In vivo, the study has further confirmed that double knockout of Shank3 and Stim1 alleviated oxidative stress and inflammation after I/R in Shank3cko mice. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that Shank3 interacts with STIM1 and inhibits post-I/R neuronal oxidative stress and inflammatory response via the Nrf2 pathway. This interaction can potentially contribute to the development of a promising method for I/R treatment.

AB  - Background The ketogenic diet (KD)has been considered an effective treatment for epilepsy, whereas its underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We have previously reported that the KD feeding increased Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) expression in the hippocampus; disruption of NRG1 signaling by genetically deleting its receptor-ErbB4 abolished KD's effects on inhibitory synaptic activity and seizures. However, it is still unclear about the mechanisms underlying the effect of KD on NRG1 expression and whether the effects of KD require ErbB4 kinase activity. Methods The effects of the KD on NRG1 expression were assessed via western blotting and real-time PCR. Acetylation level at the Nrg1 promoter locus was examined using the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique. Kainic acid (KA)-induced acute seizure model was utilized to examine the effects of KD and histone deacetylase inhibitor-TSA on seizures. Synaptic activities in the hippocampus were recorded with the technique of electrophysiology. The obligatory role of ErbB4 kinase activity in KD's effects on seizures and inhibitory synaptic activity was evaluated by using ErbB kinase antagonist and transgenic mouse-T796G. Results We report that KD specifically increases Type I NRG1 expression in the hippocampus. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique, we observe increased acetylated-histone occupancy at the Nrg1 promoter locus of KD-fed mice. Treatment of TSA dramatically elevates NRG1 expression and diminishes the difference between the effects of the control diet (CD) and KD. These data indicate that KD increases NRG1 expression via up-regulating histone acetylation. Moreover, both pharmacological and genetic inhibitions of ErbB4 kinase activity significantly block the KD's effects on inhibitory synaptic activity and seizure, suggesting an essential role of ErbB4 kinase activity. Conclusion These results strengthen our understanding of the role of NRG1/ErbB4 signaling in KD and shed light on novel therapeutic interventions for epilepsy.

AB  - The Arabian camel, specifically the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), has garnered considerable economic interest owing to its remarkable adaptation to desert climates, its valuable byproducts, engagement in racing, and participation in beauty contests. Various phenotypes exhibit distinct economic traits with the tyrosinase gene playing a pivotal role in determining camel coat colors. This study delves into a comprehensive analysis of the complete sequencing of the tyrosinase gene across 16 diverse dromedary camel phenotypes. These phenotypes encompass a spectrum of eumelanin and pheomelanin coat colors, including white (4), black (3), and dark brown (4) diluted including creamy, light brown, and fawn (5). Through sequencing analyses, this study uncovered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and deletions within the tyrosinase gene. Notably, white phenotypes exhibited a higher frequency of A <-> G (109) nucleotide substitutions, while C <-> T (312) mutations were more prevalent across all observed phenotypes. These findings draw valuable insights when higher sample size is analyzed derive the genetic variations associated with coat colors in dromedary camels, shedding light on potential implications for selective breeding programs and furthering our understanding of the intricate genetic mechanisms governing these economically significant traits.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Since ancient times, herbal medicines have been applied in the treat-ment of cancer. Tea, derivative from the dried leaves of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze plant is the most popular beverage globally after water and is available in various forms. Green tea has been expansively investigated for its beneficial properties of cancer prevention and therapy. The goal of the research: The current study was conducted to evaluate the hepaprotective character of methanolic green tea extract and its mechanism of action contrary to thioacetamide (TAA)-produced liver fibrosis of Sprague Dawley rats. Materials and Methods: Thirty rodents were equally placed in 5 clusters including normal control, TAA group as a positive control, silymarin as standard drug control, and treatment groups consisting of high dose and a low dose Camellia sinensis. Rats in experimental clusters by mouth fed with C. sinensis at 250 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg daily for 2 months. After 60 days, all rats were sacrificed. Blood specimens were gathered for liver biochemical examination. Livers of all groups were dissected out and subjected to histopathological examination through the Hematoxylin and Eosin stain, Masson trichrome, and immunohistochemistry stains (PCNA). Liver tissue homogenate was also analyzed for antioxidant activity parameters. Results: Gross morphological examination showed a regular liver architecture in C. sinensis fed collec-tions compared to the TAA sets. Histology of rat's liver fed with C. sinensis showed an important decrease in the liver index with hepatic cells propagation, mild cellular injury, and immunostaining showed sig-nificant down-expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). TAA produced liver fibrosis through a significant increase in serum alanine transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phos-phatase, and bilirubin. Total protein and albumin also decreased in the TAA group. Moreover, the reduc-tion of antioxidant enzyme activity including superoxide dismutase and catalase as well as the increase in malondialdehyde was detected in the TAA control group. Meanwhile, an abnormal level of liver bio-chemical parameters was restored closer to the normal levels in serum of the C. sinensis-fed clusters. In addition, C. sinensis fed assemblies showed elevated antioxidative enzymes activity with a reduction in malondialdehyde level comparable to the levels in silymarin-treated rats. Conclusions: Green tea potentially inhibited the progression of liver cirrhosis, down-regulation of PCNA proliferation, prevented oxidation of hepatocytes, recovered SOD and CAT enzymes, condensed MDA and reduced cellular inflammation.

AB  - Preterm births accounted for over 10% of all U.S. live births in 2019 and the rate is rising. Neonatal stressors, especially procedural pain, experienced by preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have been associated with neurodevelopmental impairments. Parental care can alleviate stress during stressful or painful procedures; however, infants in the NICU often receive reduced parental care compared with their peers. Animal studies suggest that decreased maternal care similarly impairs neurodevelopment but also influences the effects of neonatal pain. It is important to mimic both stressors in animal models of neonatal stress exposure. In this study, researchers investigated the individual and combined impact of neonatal pain and maternal isolation on reelin protein levels and cellular proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of 8 days old and adult rats. Exposure to either stressor individually, but not both, increased reelin levels in the dentate gyrus of adult females without significantly altering reelin levels in adult males. However, cell proliferation levels at either age were unaffected by the early-life stressors. These results suggest that each early-life stressor has a unique effect on markers of brain development and more research is needed to further investigate their distinct influences.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) has one of the highest incidences and mortality rates of all malignancies worldwide. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be involved in many biological processes of diseases. MiR-22-3p is considered to be involved in cancer progression, but its role in CRC remains unclear. In this study, we detected that in CRC, the level of miR-22-3p is downregulated. MiR-22-3p has antitumor effects in CRC. miR-22-3p can reduce the proliferative, invasive and migrative capacity of CRC cells. Luciferase reporter analyses confirmed that KDM3A was a target of miR-22-3p, which can directly target the 3'UTR of KDM3A and decrease the expression of KDM3A in CRC cells. Our study also confirmed that KDM3A plays a role as an oncogene in CRC. KDM3A overexpression attenuated the tumor suppressor effects of miR-22-3p in CRC cells, demonstrating that miR-22-3p exerts antitumor effects by targeting KDM3A. Overexpression of miR-22-3p in CRC reduced YAP1 expression, whereas overexpression of KDM3A restored the expression of YAP 1. In summary, miR-22-3p might inhibit the progression of CRC by targeting KDM3A to regulate the HIPPO signaling pathway, which may provide an opportunity for the treatment of CRC.

AB  - Herbivores harbor gut microbes that affect their development and contribute to their nutrition, reproduction, and survival. Plant defenses could target the herbivore's beneficial gut microbes, but this has not been well studied in rice. In this context, we identified a rice terpene synthase gene, Os04g0341500. It was strongly induced after feeding by rice striped stem borers (SSB, Chilo suppressalis), and it can catalyze the (E)-beta-farnesene (E beta f) synthesis. When added to artificial diets, E beta f impaired the development and survival of SSB larvae. High-throughput amplicon sequencing revealed that SSB fed on E beta f were decreased in beneficial gut microbes, compared to those feeding on the corresponding control feed. In vitro feeding of E beta f suggested that this antimicrobial sesquiterpene directly inhibited the growth of SSB gut microbes. The present study suggested that the E beta f-induced decrease of relative abundance of gut microbes potentially impairs larval development and survival in SSB.

AB  - With the increasing public attention to the health benefit of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and demand for linolenic acid (C18:3), it is of great significance to increase the C18:3 content in our meal. As an oil crop with high content of C18:3, Camelina sativa has three homologous copies of FAD2 and three homologous copies FAD3. In this study, we seed-specifically overexpressed two Camelina sativa fatty acid desaturase genes, CsFAD2 and CsFAD3, in rapeseed cultivar Zhongshuang 9. The results show that C18:3 content in CsFAD2 and CsFAD3 overexpressed seeds is increased from 8.62% in wild-type (WT) to 10.62-12.95% and 14.54-26.16%, respectively. We crossed CsFAD2 and CsFAD3 overexpression lines, and stable homozygous digenic crossed lines were obtained. The C18:3 content was increased from 8.62% in WT to 28.46-53.57% in crossed overexpression lines. In addition, we found that the overexpression of CsFAD2 and CsFAD3 had no effect on rapeseed growth, development, and other agronomic traits. In conclusion, we successfully generated rapeseed germplasms with high C18:3 content by simultaneously overexpressing CsFAD2 and CsFAD3, which provides a feasible way for breeding high C18:3 rapeseed cultivars.

AB  - Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, affects approximately 50 million individuals worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level by interacting with specific sequences of the target genes in a complementary manner, thus affecting a variety of biological processes. miR-34a-5p has been shown to be involved in the regulation of cellular ferroptosis, and we aimed to explore its expression in epilepsy and its mechanism of action in epileptic ferroptosis. Techniques such as Hoechst and eosin staining, Nissl staining, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, dualluciferase reporter assays, and Lipid peroxidation-related assays were used to explore epilepsy pathogenesis. Markedly elevated miR-34a-5p expression levels were observed in the hippocampal regions of epileptic rats and magnesium-free hippocampal neuronal cultures. SIRT1 was identified as a direct target of miR-34a-5p. miR-34a-5p suppression reduced ACSL4, wnt3a, beta-catenin, cyclin D1, iron ion, MDA and reactive oxygen species levels, while upregulating SIRT1, GPX4, Ferritin, and GSH expression levels. miR-34a-5p might modulate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, implicated in neuronal ferroptosis by directly targeting SIRT1. Our findings offer a potential therapeutic target to inhibit epilepsy progression.

AB  - Moraxella ovis is a Gram-negative bacterium isolated from sheep conjunctivitis cases and is a rare isolate of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK). This species is closely related to M. bovoculi, another species which can also be isolated from IBK, or cattle upper respiratory tract (URT). Prior to molecular identification techniques, M. bovoculi was frequently misclassified as M. ovis. We previously described the structure of two oligosaccharides (lipooligosaccharide-derived, minor and major glycoforms) from M. bovoculi 237T (type strain, also ATCC BAA-1259T). Here, we have identified the genetic loci for lipooligosaccharide synthesis in M. ovis 354T (NCTC11227) and compared it with M. bovoculi 237T. We identified genes encoding the known glycosyltransferases Lgt6 and Lgt3 in M. ovis. These genes are conserved in Moraxella spp., including M bovoculi. We identified three further putative OS biosynthesis genes that are restricted to M. ovis and M. bovoculi. These encode enzymes predicted to function as GDP-mannose synthases, namely a mannosyltransferase and a glycosyltransferase. Adding insight into the genetic relatedness of M. ovis and M. bovoculi, the M. ovis genes have higher similarity to those in M. bovoculi genotype 2 (nasopharyngeal isolates from asymptomatic cattle), than to M. bovoculi genotype 1 (isolates from eyes of IBK-affected cattle). Sequence analysis confirmed that the predicted mannosyltransferase in M. bovoculi 237T is interrupted by a C>T polymorphism. This mutation is not present in other M. bovoculi strains sequenced to date. We isolated and characterised LOS-derived oligosaccharide from M. ovis 354T. GLC-MS and NMR spectroscopy data revealed a heptasaccharide structure with three beta-D-Glcp residues attached as branches to the central 3,4,6 alpha-D-Glcp, with subsequent attachment to Kdo. This inner core arrangement is consistent with the action of Lgt6 and Lgt3 glycosyltransferases. Two alpha-D-Manp residues are linearly attached to the 4-linked beta-D-Glcp, consistent with the presence of the two identified glycosyltransferases. This oligosaccharide structure is consistent with the previously reported minor glycoform isolated from M. bovoculi 237T.

AB  - In classical computational neuroscience, analytical model descriptions are derived from neuronal recordings to mimic the underlying biological system. These neuronal models are typically slow to compute and cannot be integrated within large-scale neuronal simulation frameworks. We present a hybrid, machine-learning and computational-neuroscience approach that transforms analytical models of sensory neurons and synapses into deep-neural-network (DNN) neuronal units with the same biophysical properties. Our DNN-model architecture comprises parallel and differentiable equations that can be used for backpropagation in neuro-engineering applications, and offers a simulation run-time improvement factor of 70 and 280 on CPU or GPU systems respectively. We focussed our development on auditory neurons and synapses, and show that our DNN-model architecture can be extended to a variety of existing analytical models. We describe how our approach for auditory models can be applied to other neuron and synapse types to help accelerate the development of large-scale brain networks and DNN-based treatments of the pathological system. Drakopoulos et al developed a machine-learning and computational-neuroscience approach that transforms analytical models of sensory neurons and synapses into deep-neural-network (DNN) neuronal units with the same biophysical properties. Focusing on auditory neurons and synapses, they showed that their DNN-model architecture could be extended to a variety of existing analytical models and to other neuron and synapse types, thus potentially assisting the development of large-scale brain networks and DNN-based treatments.

AB  - Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 is a key enzyme in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which plays an important role in the regulation of behavior and various physiological functions. We studied the effect of acute ethanol administration on the expression of the early response c-fos gene and metabolism of serotonin and catecholamines in the brain structures of B6-1473C and B6-1473G congenic mouse strains differing in the single-nucleotide substitution C1473G in the Tph2 gene and activity of the encoded enzyme. Acute alcoholization led to a significant upregulation of the c-fos gene expression in the frontal cortex and striatum of B6-1473G mice and in the hippocampus of B6-1473C mice and caused a decrease in the index of serotonin metabolism in the nucleus accumbens in B6-1473C mice and in the hippocampus and striatum of B6-1473G mice, as well as to the decrease in the norepinephrine level in the hypothalamus of B6-1473C mice. Therefore, the C1473G polymorphism in the Tph2 gene has a significant effect of acute ethanol administration on the c-fos expression pattern and metabolism of biogenic amines in the mouse brain.

AB  - Macroautophagy/autophagy plays a critical role in antiviral immunity through targeting viruses and initiating host immune responses. The receptor protein, SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), plays a vital role in selective autophagy. It serves as a receptor targeting ubiquitinated proteins or pathogens to phagophores for degradation. In this study, we explored the reciprocal regulation between selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1 and Seneca Valley virus (SVV). SVV infection induced autophagy. Autophagy promoted SVV infection in pig cells but played opposite functions in human cells. Overexpression of SQSTM1 decreased viral protein production and reduced viral titers. Further study showed that SQSTM1 interacted with SVV VP1 and VP3 independent of its UBA domain. SQSTM1 targeted SVV VP1 and VP3 to phagophores for degradation to inhibit viral replication. To counteract this, SVV evolved strategies to circumvent the host autophagic machinery to promote viral replication. SVV 3C(pro) targeted the receptor SQSTM1 for cleavage at glutamic acid 355, glutamine 392, and glutamine 395 and abolished its capacity to mediate selective autophagy. At the same time, the 3C(pro)-mediated SQSTM1 cleavage products lost the ability to inhibit viral propagation. Collectively, our results provide evidence for selective autophagy in host against viruses and reveal potential viral strategies to evade autophagic machinery for successful pathogenesis.

AB  - BackgroundFor women of childbearing age, the biggest problem caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is infertility, which is mainly caused by anovulation, abnormal follicular development, proliferation of small antral follicles, and cystic follicles. The mechanism underlying its occurrence is not clear. The abnormal proliferation and development of follicles in PCOS patients is a complex process, which is affected by many factors. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the Hippo pathway and follicular development in PCOS, and to further explore this relationship by using the YAP inhibitor verteporfin (VP).Method30 3-week-old BALB/C female rats were randomly divided into control group (n = 10), DHEA group (n = 10) and DHEA + VP group (n = 10). The morphology of ovary and the degree of follicular development were observed by HE staining, and the expression and location of AMH in ovarian follicles were observed by immunofluorescence. The ovarian reserve function index AMH, cell proliferation index PCNA and the ratio of Hippo pathway related proteins MST, LATS, YAP, P-YAP and P-YAP/YAP were detected by Western blot.ResultsAfter dividing 30 3-week-old female mice into control, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; model of PCOS), and DHEA + VP groups, we found that the number of small follicles increased in the DHEA group compared to the control group. Additionally, in the DHEA group compared to the control group, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH; ovarian reserve index) increased, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; cell proliferation index) decreased, and upstream (MST and LATS) and downstream (YAP and p-YAP) proteins in the Hippo pathway increased, though the p-YAP/YAP ratio decreased. VP ameliorated the increases in AMH, MST, LATS, YAP and p-YAP, but did not ameliorate the decrease in the p-YAP/YAP ratio.ConclusionsThis study indicates that the increased small follicles in the ovaries and changes in ovarian reserve and cell proliferation may be closely related to Hippo pathway activation. This suggests that the Hippo pathway may be an important pathway affecting the proliferation and development of follicles and the occurrence of PCOS.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Pre-operative radiation (Pre-RT) decreases local recurrence following soft tissue sarcoma (STS) resection but carries the risk of wound healing complications (WHCs). This study evaluated skin specimens and clinical characteristics of STS patients to (1) compare patients with and without Pre-RT, (2) compare Pre-RT patients with and without WHCs, and (3) explore associations between clinical characteristics and WHCs. Methods: This retrospective study included 54 adults who underwent STS resection with primary closure (Pre-RT n = 30). A pathologist who was blinded to the clinical outcomes evaluated the skin specimens microscopically. Results: Irradiated skin had lower vessel density and was more likely to lack hair follicles and sebaceous glands, consistent with the effects of radiation. Irradiated skin was also more likely to include plasma cells. Irradiated skin demonstrated higher mean TAZ H-scores; however, within the Pre-RT subset, those patients who developed WHCs demonstrated comparatively lower TAZ. Conclusions: This novel finding may suggest that higher TAZ in irradiated skin reflects a response to injury but that comparatively lower TAZ in irradiated skin might contribute to WHCs. Future studies should consider more focused evaluation of TAZ in STS resections with Pre-RT as they may help to predict WHCs when used in combination with other histologic factors and could suggest a therapeutic target.

AB  - Body weight is a critical component for monitoring animal body mass, body condition, nutritional status, and health. However, traditional methods of collecting body weight are stressful, costly, and logistically impractical with cattle on extensive landscapes. Remote systems capable of collecting individual animal body weight provide a potential solution, but automatic systems may collect spurious weight measurements. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the utility of using a remote weight capture system, (2) develop methods for identifying and removing spurious measurements, and (3) cross-validate automatically collected weights with static chute collected weights. Beef steers (n = 10) were tagged with electronic Radio Frequency Identification tags and grazed for 286 days in an improved pasture (& PLUSMN;11.54 ha) containing Bermuda (Cynodon dactylon) and Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and inter-seeded with Annual Ryegrass (Secale cereale). A walk-over-weigh (WOW) system was designed from a platform scale connected to a TruTest & REG; scale head and paired with a computer to save data files. In total, 5,466 raw weights associated with individuals were collected (0 kg < weight < 1,000 kg). We assessed the use of whole herd and individual means & PLUSMN; 1 standard deviation calculated either daily or over the entire trial to identify potential outliers. Additionally, 3 data smoothing methods were tested: a linear quadratic model, cubic splines, and polynomial regression. Each method was evaluated for total weight events recorded, event frequency, measured body mass and average daily gain. Further, accuracy and precision were calculated using cross-validation with paired chute weights (n = 8). Whole herd means & PLUSMN; 1 SD identified the fewest spurious data points and showed a stronger relationship with paired chute weights (R2 = 0.90) whereas individual daily means & PLUSMN; 1 SD identified the most and exhibited a weaker relationship (R2 = 0.68). Repeated quadratic regression models provided the best results, identifying 3,759 clean weight points and providing an R2 = 0.96 between paired chute and WOW measurements. A real-time simulation analysis found that both individual and the herd means & PLUSMN; 1 SD performed similarly with an average of 30% of data classified as spurious and removed from the analysis, resulting in agreement (R2 = 0.93 for both individual and herd means) between chute and WOW weight measurements. These results indicate the utility of using a simple WOW system to collect data for measuring individual animal body mass and associated metrics, which has implications on making management and marketing decisions in near real-time.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lamb abomasum is used as an edible medicinal source in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Lamb abomasum sourced biochemical drug Lamb's trip extract and Vitamin B12 capsule used for the clinical treatment of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, and reversal of intestinal metaplasia. Therefore, claimed to have prevention of gastric cancer activity. Aim of the study: In this study, we aim to assess whether the glycoprotein has biological activity in the cure of gastric disorder and conduct a structure-activity relationship. Materials and methods: Glycoproteins' extraction conditions were optimized by the response surface method and purified with DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-50 chromatography. Two homogenous glycoproteins' physi-ochemical structures were studied with electrophoresis, HPLC analysis, peroxide oxidation, and beta-elimination, FT-IR, CD, LC-MS/MS, and EDS analysis. The antiinflammation activity of the glycoprotein was determined against COX-2 and LOX-15 enzyme inhibitory ability in vitro, and antitumor activity against HT-29 and HGC-25, and cytotoxicity on L-02 cells was determined in vivo with the MTT method. Results: The abomasum was abundant in glycoprotein and the extraction yield of glycoprotein was up to 24.6 +/- 2.1% under optimized conditions. Two homogeneous glycoproteins SAGP-I and SAGP-II determined to be ribose -conjugated and sulfated glycoproteins with a molecular weight of 15.6 kDa and 6.4 kDa. And according to the structural analysis, SAGP-I was a mucin-type ribose-conjugated glycoprotein with 14 O-glycosylation and one N-glycosylation site. SAGP-I and SAGP-II have remarkable anti-inflammatory activity against COX-2 enzyme with the IC50 of 17.64 +/- 1.25 mu g/mL and 16.14 +/- 1.11 mu g/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, the two glycoproteins showed strong antitumor activity against HT-29 with the EC50 of 19.19 +/- 1.46 mu g/mL and 184.9 +/- 5.6 mu g/mL, respectively. Conclusion: The Highly purified glycoprotein SAGP-1 and SAGP-II showed anti-inflammatory activity against the COX-2 enzyme, and antitumor activity against HT-29 human colon cancer cells and noun-inhibitory activity against LOX-15 enzyme and HGC-25. Both glycoproteins are ribose conjugated and sulfated whose characters are related to their anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity. Such results suggest the possibility of anti-inflammatory and pre-cancer activity. And in some degree explains the pharmacy of abomasum's traditional use in gastric disorder and clinical use of lamb abomasum APIs drugs' in gastric disorders and gastric cancer development. This study provides a preliminary basis for the further study of the per-cancer mechanism of lamb abomasum glyco-protein. And, would be the material basis of the clinical use of Lamb's trip extract and Vitamin B12 capsule.

AB  - Tissue sections, which are widely used in research and diagnostic laboratories and have already been examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), may subsequently provide a resource for proteomic studies, even though only small amount of protein is available. Therefore, we established a workflow for tandem mass spectrometry-based protein profiling of IHC specimens and characterized defined brain area sections. We investigated the CA1 region of the hippocampus dissected from brain slices of adult C57BL/6J mice. The workflow contains detailed information on sample preparation from brain slices, including removal of antibodies and cover matrices, dissection of region(s) of interest, protein extraction and digestion, mass spectrometry measurement, and data analysis. The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledge base was used for further annotation. Literature searches and Gene Ontology annotation of the detected proteins verify the applicability of this method for global protein profiling using formalin-fixed and embedded material and previously used IHC slides.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Significantly activated uridine nucleotide and fatty acid metabolism in HCC cells promote malignant proliferation and immune evasion. Herein, it is demonstrated that the tripartite motif 65 (TRIM65) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, O-GlcNAcylated via O-GlcNAcylation transferase, is highly expressed in HCC and facilitated metabolic remodeling to promote the accumulation of products related to uracil metabolism and palmitic acid, driving the progression of HCC. Mechanistically, it is showed that TRIM65 mediates ubiquitylation at the K44 residue of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), the key protein upstream of classical Hippo signaling. Accelerated NF2 degradation inhibits yes-associated protein 1 phosphorylation, inducing aberrant activation of related metabolic enzyme transcription, and orchestrating metabolic and immune advantages. In conclusion, these results reveal a critical role for the TRIM family molecule TRIM65 in supporting HCC cell survival and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting its E3 ligase activity to alter the regulation of proteasomal degradation.

AB  - Increasing evidence has confirmed that the nervous system shows innate and adaptive immunity, which also participates in nerve damage. This study aimed to explore the neuroimmune imbalance induced by arsenic and its possible mechanism. Mice were exposed to NaAsO2 (0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg/L) for 1 month by drinking water. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests revealed that arsenic impaired learning and memory. The optical density of Evans blue showed a marked dose-dependent increase in the brain, and the mRNA and protein levels of the BBB tight junctions (TJs), occludin at 25 and 50 mg/L arsenic, and claudin-5 at 50 mg/L arsenic, were markedly decreased in the cerebral cortex. Arsenic downregulated occludin and claudin-5 mRNA expression at 50 mg/L and protein expression at 25 and 50 mg/L in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical staining showed that 50 mg/L arsenic increased corticocerebral and hippocampal CD3(+) T, CD4(+) T, and CD8(+) T cells; CD4 and CD8 proteins were increased with 25 and 50 mg/L arsenic. Arsenic decreased the corticocerebral and hippocampal Th1, Th17, and regulatory Treg transcription factors T-bet, Ror gamma t, and Foxp3 and the cytokine IFN-gamma, IL-17, and TGF-beta mRNA levels and increased the Th2 transcription factor GATA3 and cytokine IL-4 mRNA levels. Moreover, arsenic enhanced the expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) and its downstream enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that arsenic exposure induces BBB dysfunction and T lymphocyte infiltration and affects CD4(+) T lymphocyte differentiation, which may be associated with Nrf2 activation.

AB  - Traditional histological analysis is conducted on thin tissue sections, limiting the data capture from large tissue volumes to 2D profiles, and requiring stereological methods for 3D assessment. Recent advances in microscopical and tissue clearing methods have facilitated 3D reconstructions of tissue structure. However, staining of large tissue blocks remains a challenge, often requiring specialised and expensive equipment to clear and immunolabel tissue. Here, we present the Affordable Brain Slice Optical Clearing (ABSOC) method: a modified iDISCO protocol which enables clearing and immunolabeling of mouse brain slices up to 1 mm thick using inexpensive reagents and equipment, with no intensive expert training required. We illustrate the use of ABSOC in 1 mm C57BL/6J mouse coronal brain slices sectioned through the dorsal hippocampus and immunolabelled with an anti-calretinin antibody. The ABSOC method can be readily used for histological studies of mouse brain in order to move from the use of very thin tissue sections to large volumes of tissue - giving more representative analysis of biological samples, without the need for sampling of small regions only.

AB  - WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1, referred to here as TAZ) and Yes-associated protein (YAP, also known as YAP1) are transcriptional co-activators traditionally studied together as a part of the Hippo pathway, and are best known for their roles in stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Despite their similarities, TAZ and YAP can exert divergent cellular effects by differentially interacting with other signaling pathways that regulate stem cell maintenance or differentiation. In this study, we show in mouse neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) that TAZ regulates astrocytic differentiation and maturation, and that TAZ mediates some, but not all, of the effects of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling on astrocytic development. By contrast, both TAZ and YAP mediate the effects on NPC fate of beta 1-integrin (ITGB1) and integrin-linked kinase signaling, and these effects are dependent on extracellular matrix cues. These findings demonstrate that TAZ and YAP perform divergent functions in the regulation of astrocyte differentiation, where YAP regulates cell cycle states of astrocytic progenitors and TAZ regulates differentiation and maturation from astrocytic progenitors into astrocytes.

AB  - In tauopathy conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), highly soluble and natively unfolded tau polymerizes into an insoluble filament; however, the mechanistic details of this process remain unclear. In the brains of AD patients, only a minor segment of tau forms & beta;-helix-stacked protofilaments, while its flanking regions form disordered fuzzy coats. Here, it is demonstrated that the tau AD nucleation core (tau-AC) sufficiently induced self-aggregation and recruited full-length tau to filaments. Unexpectedly, phospho-mimetic forms of tau-AC (at Ser324 or Ser356) show markedly reduced oligomerization and seeding propensities. Biophysical analysis reveal that the N-terminus of tau-AC facilitates the fibrillization kinetics as a nucleation motif, which becomes sterically shielded through phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in tau-AC. Tau-AC oligomers are efficiently internalized into cells via endocytosis and induced endogenous tau aggregation. In primary hippocampal neurons, tau-AC impaired axon initial segment plasticity upon chronic depolarization and is mislocalized to the somatodendritic compartments. Furthermore, it is observed significantly impaired memory retrieval in mice intrahippocampally injected with tau-AC fibrils, which corresponds to the neuropathological staining and neuronal loss in the brain. These findings identify tau-AC species as a key neuropathological driver in AD, suggesting novel strategies for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Recently, continuous-fluid catalysis technology has been widely used in biocatalysis. However, the poor stability of the reactor-supported enzyme and expensive manufacturing cost of the reactor restrict its use. Herein, a wood-based bioreactor, (3-glucosidase@ zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@delignified wood ((3-Glu@ZIF-8@DW), with attractive features was developed. The naturally oriented channels of the xylem-based reactor enable high throughput. The interference of the fluids through the porous inner walls in the directional channels of the xylem-based reactor considerably increased the probability of contact between the substrate and enzyme. Resveratrol with multifaceted biological activities exists in many plants, including Mulberry (Morus spp., Moraceae) and Camellia sinensis and Polygonum cuspidatum (P. cuspidatum). However, it mainly presents in its glycosylated form (polydatin) rather than as free resveratrol in plant. To improve the acquisition of resveratrol, continuous convert polydatin into resveratrol by a bioreactor is a good strategy. The conversion rate of polydatin using the as-prepared reactor reached 98.98% in 2 h. The uniform distribution of (3-Glu@ZIF-8 in the channel increased the stability of the bioreactor with an 80.28% conversion rate after seven cycles. The reactor provided an excellent strategy for continuous catalysis, which can be used for industrial production with low synthesis costs and high mass transfer efficiency. Therefore, it has great potential for commercial applications.

AB  - Rivastigmine is a clinical drug for patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exerting its inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase activity however, its effect on other disease-related pathological mechanisms are not yet known. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of rivastigmine on protein aggregation and degradation related mechanisms employing streptozotocin (STZ) induced experimental rat model. The known inhibitory effect of rivastigmine on cognition and acetylcholinesterase activity was observed in both cortex and hippocampus and further its effect on tau level, amyloid aggregation, biochemical alterations, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, calcium homeostasis, proteasome activity and apoptosis was estimated. STZ administration in rat brain caused significant cognitive impairment, augmented acetylcholinesterase activity, tau phosphorylation and amyloid aggregation which were significantly inhibited with rivastigmine treatment. STZ also caused significant biochemical alterations which were attenuated with rivastigmine treatment. Since AD pathology is related to protein aggregation and we have found disease-related amyloid aggregation, further the investigation was done to decipher the ER functionality and apoptotic signalling. STZ caused significantly altered level of ER stress related markers (GRP78, GADD153 and caspase-12) which were significantly inhibited with rivastigmine treatment. Furthermore, the effect of rivastigmine was estimated on proteasome activity in both regions. Rivastigmine treatment significantly enhances the proteasome activity and may contributes in removal of amyloid aggregation. In conclusion, findings suggested that along with inhibitory effect of rivastigmine on acetylcholinesterase activity and up to some extent on cognition, it has significant effect on disease-related biochemical alterations, ER functionality, protein degradation machinery and neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by its incurable nature and undefined etiology, which is often accompanied by a high prevalence of comorbid depression. The gut-brain axis has emerged as a promising treatment target in recent years. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate how vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis (VSC) enhances therapeutic effects on depressive behavior in chronic UC mice. Methods: A chronic UC model was induced in mice using dextran sulfate sodium. The therapeutic effects of both raw and vinegar-processed Schisandra Chinensis on UC and associated depressive symptoms were assessed. Colonic mucosal damage was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue staining. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and synaptic structures was visualized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to quantify inflammatory cytokine levels in the colon, serum, and brain, while western blotting was performed for protein expression analysis. Additionally, metagenomic analysis was conducted to investigate gut microbiota composition. Nissl staining and immunofluorescence were used to assess hippocampal neuronal damage, and behavioral assessments including the morris water maze, open field test, forced swimming test and tail suspension test, were implemented to evaluate depressive states. Serum metabolites were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. Results: Both raw and vinegarprocessed Schisandra Chinensis significantly upregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), inhibited NF-kappa B p-p65 activation, and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine. These treatments also enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins, restored colonic mucosal and BBB integrity, alleviated damage to hippocampal neurons, and improved synaptic structure. Behavioral assessments indicated that VSC was particularly effective in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors in chronic UC mice. In the gut, both treatments reshaped the gut microbial composition, restoring the relative abundance of Duncaniella, Candidatus_Amulumruptor, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Lachnospiraceae_bacterium, uncultured_Bacteroides_sp., Candidatus_Amulumruptor_caecigallinarius, with VSC showing more pronounced effects. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in tryptophan levels and a decrease in kynurenine and xanthurenic acid levels with VSC, indicating that tryptophan metabolism shifted from the kynurenine pathway to the 5-HT or indole pathway. However, this phenomenon did not occur with Schisandra Chinensis (SC). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the disruption of tryptophan metabolic balance served as a biological mechanism underlying the occurrence of depressive behaviors induced by UC. The

AB  - Cooperative reactivation of hippocampal and prefrontal neurons is considered crucial for mnemonic processes. To directly record synaptic substances supporting the interregional interactions, we develop concurrent spike recordings of hippocampal neuronal ensembles and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of medial prefrontal neurons in awake rats. We find that medial prefrontal neurons depolarize when hippocampal neurons synchronize. The depolarization in medial prefrontal neurons is larger when hippocampal place cells that encoded overlapping place fields and place cells that encoded a novel environment are synchronously reactivated. Our results suggest a functional circuit-synapse association that enables prefrontal neurons to read out specific memory traces from the hippocampus.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes vomiting, dehydration, and diarrhea in piglets, seriously threatening their survival and development and causing huge economic losses to the global pig industry. Current PEDV control relies on vaccines, however, the high mutation rate of PEDV limits vaccine effectiveness, highlighting the need for new antiviral drugs. This study investigated the pharmacological effects of ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) on PEDV using network pharmacology, as well as GO and KEGG analyses, to predict its role in modulating the MAPK/ERK pathway. GRb1 downregulated the MAPK/ERK pathway activated by PEDV infection and reduced levels of the apoptotic protein cleaved-caspase-3, thus inhibiting PEDV-induced apoptosis and demonstrating antiviral properties. Further screening showed that the PEDV S1 protein promotes AP-1 nuclear entry and upregulates the MAPK/ERK pathway to induce apoptosis, a process reversed by GRb1. Further in vivo studies revealed that GRb1 treatment significantly reduced viral load in piglet intestinal tissues and anal swabs. GRb1 also alleviated clinical symptoms and intestinal damage in infected piglets, improving their survival rate while also downregulating the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1(3, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha). This study is the first to demonstrate that GRb1 effectively inhibits PEDV, uncovering its potential mechanism of action and providing a promising new approach for antiviral treatment in veterinary medicine.

AB  - Transcranial ultrasound stimulation is an emerging technique for the development of a non-invasive neuromodulation device for the treatment of various types of neurodegenerations and brain damages. However, there are very few studies that have quantified the optimal ultrasound dosage and the longterm associated effects of transcranial ultrasound treatments of brain diseases. In this study, we used a simple ex vivo hippocampal tissues stimulated by different dosages of ultrasound in combination with different chemical treatments to quantify the required energy for a measurable effect. After determining the most desirable ex vivo stimulation conditions, it was then replicated for the in vivo mouse brains. It was discovered that transcranial ultrasound promoted the increase of Tbr2-expressing neural progenitors in an ASIC1a-dependent manner. Furthermore, such effect was observable at least a week after the initial ultrasound treatments and was not abolished by auditory toxicity. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Codonopsis pilosula (C. pilosula), also called "Dangshen" in Chinese, is derived from the roots of Codonopsis pilosula (Franch.) Nannf. (C. pilosula), Codonopsis pilosula var. Modesta (Nannf.) L.D. Shen (C. pilosula var. modesta) or Codonopsis pilosula subsp. Tangshen (Oliv.) D.Y.Hong (C. pilosula subsp. tangshen), is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine. It has been regularly used for anti-aging, strengthening the spleen and tonifying the lungs, regulating blood sugar, lowering blood pressure, strengthening the body's immune system, etc. However, the mechanism, by which, C. pilosula exerts its therapeutic effects on brain aging remains unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the protective effects of C. pilosula water extract (CPWE) on the hippocampal tissue of D-galactose-induced aging mice. Materials and methods: In this research, plant taxonomy has been confirmed in the "The Plant List" database (www.theplantlist.org). First, an aging mouse model was established through the intraperitoneal injections of Dgalactose solution, and low-, medium-, and high-dose CPWE were administered to mice by gavage for 42 days. Then, the learning and memory abilities of the mice were examined using the Morris water maze tests and stepdown test. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to visualize histopathological damage in the hippocampus. A transmission electron microscope was used to observe the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to examine the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the marker protein of astrocyte activation, and autophagy-related proteins, including microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)/p62, in the hippocampal tissues of mice. Moreover, targeted metabolomic analysis was performed to assess the changes in polar metabolites and short-chain fatty acids in the hippocampus. Results: First, CPWE alleviated cognitive impairment and ameliorated hippocampal tissue damage in aging mice. Furthermore, CPWE markedly alleviated mitochondrial damage, restored the number of autophagosomes, and activated autophagy in the hippocampal tissue of aging mice by increasing the expression of LC3 protein and reducing the expression of p62 protein. Meanwhile, the expression levels of the brain injury marker protein GFAP decreased. Moreover, quantitative targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that CPWE intervention reversed the abnormal levels of L-asparagine, L-glutamic acid, L-glutamine, serotonin hydrochloride, succinic acid, and acetic acid in the hippocampal tissue of aging mice. CPWE also significantly regulated pathways associated with Dglutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolisms, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg (T. hemsleyanum, Sanyeqing) has been used in the prevention and treatment of repetitive Febrile seizures (FS) over the centuries in China.
   Aim of the study: T. hemsleyanum exerts wide pharmacological action, which has been widely used for treating various diseases, including infantile febrile seizure. However, the systematic study on this herb's material basis and the functional mechanism is lacking. This study intended to systematically elucidate the mechanism of T. hemsleyanum against febrile seizures.
   Materials and methods: The efficacy of T. hemsleyanum was estimated by using a hot bath as a model of FS, the onset and duration of seizure, morphological structure changes of hippocampal neurons as well as magnetoencephalography were applied to evaluate the effects. Meanwhile, the bioactive components of T. hemsleyanum responsible for the therapeutic effect of T. hemsleyanum on FS were identified by UPLC-MS/MS. Then we systematically elucidated the mechanism of T. hemsleyanum based on metabonomics, transcriptomics, network pharmacological and experimental validation.
   Results: In a hyperthermia-induced FS model of rats, T. hemsleyanum significantly increased the seizure latency and decreased seizure duration, alleviating the abnormal delta and gamma band activity during epileptic discharge. Furthermore, ten chemical components of ethanol extracts from T. hemsleyanum were identified by UPLC-MS/MS, including quercetin, kaempferol, and procyanidin B1 and so on, which was consistent with the network pharmacology prediction. The serum metabolomics indicated that T. hemsleyanum mainly acts on inflammation regulation and neuroprotection by the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. Ninety-two potential targets of T. hemsleyanum on FS were identified by network pharmacology, and TNF, IL-6, and IL-1 beta were considered the pivotal targets. In the hippocampus transcriptomics, 17 KEGG pathways were identified after T. hemsleyanum treatment compared with the FS model group, among which 15 pathways overlapped with those identified by network pharmacology, and the PKC-delta/caspase-1 signaling pathway was a critical node. Finally, in vivo experiments also verified T. hemsleyanum inhibited the activation of microglia and resulted in a significant reduction in the level of PKCd, NLRC4, caspase-1, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF- a in hippocampus of FS rats.
   Conclusions: Our study suggested that the therapeutic effect of T. hemsleyanum on FS might be regulated by inhibiting the neuroinflammation, thus exerting an anticonvulsant effect in vivo, and the mechanism might be related to regulating the PKC-d/caspase-1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models. However, the effects of MCS on neuronal hyperexcitability in AD are unknown. We investigated the effects of MCS in a well-established mouse model of AD with hyperexcitability, the Tg2576 mouse. The most common type of hyperexcitability in Tg2576 mice are generalized EEG spikes (interictal spikes [IIS]). IIS also are common in other mouse models and occur in AD patients. In mouse models, hyperexcitability is also reflected by elevated expression of the transcription factor triangle FosB in the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG), which are the principal cell type. Therefore, we studied Delta FosB expression in GCs. We also studied the neuronal marker NeuN within hilar neurons of the DG because reduced NeuN protein expression is a sign of oxidative stress or other pathology. This is potentially important because hilar neurons regulate GC excitability. Tg2576 breeding pairs received a diet with a relatively low, intermediate, or high concentration of choline. After weaning, all mice received the intermediate diet. In offspring of mice fed the high choline diet, IIS frequency declined, GC triangle FosB expression was reduced, and hilar NeuN expression was restored. Using the novel object location task, spatial memory improved. In contrast, offspring exposed to the relatively low choline diet had several adverse effects, such as increased mortality. They had the weakest hilar NeuN immunoreactivity and greatest GC Delta FosB protein expression. However, their IIS frequency was low, which was surprising. The results provide new evidence that a diet high in choline in early life can improve outcomes in a mouse model of AD, and relatively low choline can have mixed effects. This is the first study showing that dietary choline can regulate hyperexcitability, hilar neurons, Delta FosB, and spatial memory in an animal model of AD.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms in repetitive TBI remain poorly defined. This study investigates proteomic and behavioral changes following single and repetitive mild TBI in a mouse model, focusing on molecular alterations in the cortex and hippocampus across acute (48 h) and subacute (1 week) stages. Using shotgun proteomics and bioinformatics approaches, including weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning, we analyzed the proteomic landscapes of TBI-affected brain regions including the hippocampus and the cortex. We assessed motor and cognitive outcomes at 2-, 7-, and 30-days post-injury to explore functional impairments associated with observed molecular changes. Our findings reveal spatio-temporal injury- and time-specific proteomic changes, with a single TBI promoting neuroprotective and repair mechanisms, while repetitive TBI exacerbating neuronal damage and synaptic deficits in the hippocampus. Key deregulated proteins, including Apoa1, ApoE, Cox6a1, and Snca, were linked to neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting molecular connections between TBI and diseases like AD and PD. Behavioral assessments indicated that repetitive TBI significantly impaired motor and cognitive functions, with recovery in motor function by day 30, whereas cognitive deficits persisted. This study provides a detailed analysis of the proteomic and behavioral consequences of TBI, identifying molecular networks as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for mitigating long-term cognitive decline associated with repetitive head trauma. These findings underscore the importance of mitochondrial and synaptic integrity in TBI response and suggest that targeting these pathways could reduce neurodegenerative risk following repetitive TBI.

AB  - Inflammation and synapse loss have been associated with deficits in social behavior and are involved in pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Synapse loss, characterized by reduction in dendritic spines can significantly disrupt synaptic connectivity and neural circuitry underlying social behavior. Chronic stress is known to induce loss of spines and dendrites in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region implicated in social behavior. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of type I Interferon (IFN-I) signaling in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced synapse loss and behavior deficits in mice. We found increased expression of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) in microglia following CUS. Conditional knockout of microglial IFNAR in adult mice rescued CUS-induced social behavior deficits and synapse loss. Bulk RNA sequencing data show that microglial IFNAR deletion attenuated CUS-mediated changes in the expression of genes such as Keratin 20 (Krt20), Claudin-5 (Cldn5) and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 1 (Nr4a1) in the PFC. Cldn5 and Nr4a1 are known for their roles in synaptic plasticity. Krt20 is an intermediate filament protein responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells. The reduction in Krt20 following CUS presents a novel insight into the potential contribution of cytokeratin in stress-induced alterations in neuroplasticity. Overall, these results suggest that microglial IFNAR plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity and social behavior deficits associated with chronic stress conditions.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effects of acute paraquat (PQ) exposure on the phenotypic polarization of hippocampal microglia and its mechanism.
   Methods: An acute PQ exposure rat model was established. Male SD rats were exposed to 0, 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg PQ, and brain hippocampal tissue was collected after 1, 3, and 7 days of exposure, respectively. Hippocampal pathological changes were examined by H&E staining, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect changes in the number of Iba-1-positive cells, the average number of endpoints, and the average process length. The protein expression of Iba-1 was detected by western blotting. BV-2 microglia were treated with 0, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 mu mol/L PQ for 24 h. ELISA and western blotting assays were performed to detect the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in vivo and in vitro. The M1 microglia marker iNOS, the M2 microglia marker Arg-1, and the p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 protein were detected by western blotting. JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation role in regulating microglia phenotypic polarization was further validated in vivo and in vitro by JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 administration.
   Results: After acute PQ exposure, hippocampal neurons showed pathological changes such as loose arrangement and nuclear pyknosis, the number of Iba-1 positive cells and the expression of Iba-1 protein increased, and the average number of endpoints and average process length of microglia decreased. Histological examination revealed that compared with the control group, in the 50 mg/kg PQ group on the 3rd and 7th day, the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and iNOS significantly increased, while that of Arg-1 significantly decreased. p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 expression significantly increased in the 50 mg/kg PQ group on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th day. In vitro, compared with the control group, the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, iNOS, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 significantly increased, while Arg-1 expression was significantly reduced in the 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mu mol/L PQ groups. After AG490 administration, the expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, iNOS, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in the AG490 +PQ group were significantly inhibited in vivo and in vitro compared with the PQ-only group. On the contrary, Arg-1 expression was significantly increased.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that acute PQ exposure may induce M1-type polarization of hippocampal microglia by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which in turn releases pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, leading to hippocampal inflammatory damage.

AB  - Background: Activation of blood stasis is a crucial aspect of stroke treatment, and the Tong-Qiao-Huo-Xue-Decoction (TQHXD) formula is commonly utilized for this purpose. However, the mechanism underlying the protective effects of TQHXD against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is unclear.
   Purpose: Identification of the TQHXD components responsible for its protective effects and determination of their mode of action against cerebral I/R injury.
   Methods: Gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were carried out to determine the active aspects of TQHXD. The active components and targets of TQHXD were looked up in the TCMSP and HERB databases; the Genecards, OMIM, TTD, and DrugBank databases were used to identify targets related to cerebral infarction; and the intersecting targets were obtained. The drug-ingredient-target-disease network and PPI network were subsequently built using Cytoscape 3.7.1 and STRING websites. Autodock VINA was used to perform molecular docking between the core target ASK1 and the active components of TQHXD detected by HPLC and GC. After successfully creating a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the therapeutic effect of TQHXD was observed using triphenyltetrazolium and hematoxylin-eosin staining. We used Tunel-NeuN staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to quantify hippocampal apoptosis. RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to detect protein and mRNA expression, respectively.
   Results: HPLC and GC identified six active ingredients. Network pharmacology analyses were performed to test 66 intersection targets, including ASK1, MKK4, and JNK. Ferulic acid, HSYA, ligustilide, paeoniflorin, and muscone all displayed high binding affinity with ASK1 in molecular docking studies. The neuroprotective effects of TQHXD in I/R rats were demonstrated in the experimental models. In comparison with the model group, TQHXD decreased the apoptosis rate and reduced the protein levels of p-ASK1, caspase 3, p-MKK4, CytC, p-c-Jun, Bax/Bcl-2, and p-JNK, while considerably increasing the mRNA levels of Bcl-2 and decreasing those of Bax.
   Conclusion: By controlling the ASK1/MKK4/JNK pathway, TQHXD protects neurons from I/R damage and prevents apoptosis. Thus, TQHXD may be effective for the treatment of ischemic stroke. And the mechanism behind these therapeutic actions of TQHXD is supported by this research.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Gastrodia elata Blume (GE) is a Chinese medicinal herb commonly used to treat central nervous system-related diseases, including headaches, dizziness, epilepsy, numbness of the limbs and depression.Aim of the study: Microbial-based fermentation has been successfully used to increase the extract efficiency of medicinal herbs in recent years. However, no study has hitherto explored the anti-depressant-like effect of GE processed by microorganisms. Herein, this subject aimed to clarify the anti-depressant-like effect of fermented Gastrodia elata Bl. (FGE) and its active chemical constituents.Materials and methods: The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model, a well-established animal model of depression, was induced in Kunming (KM) mice. The mice were administrated with FGE for 3 weeks. The sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT) and tail suspension test (TST) were conducted. Moreover, the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in brain tissue homogenates, the concentration of Ca2+ and the activity of MAO in serum, H&E and Nissl staining in the hippocampus, and the hippocampus protein expressions of BDNF, NMDAR1, NMDAR2A and NMDAR2B relevant to depression were detected. Furthermore, chemical constituents of FGE were further isolated, and the protective activity of the obtained compounds against NMDA-induced PC -12 cell damage was assessed.Results: FGE could alleviate the depression state in CUMS-induced mice and reduce apoptosis of neuronal cells in the hippocampus. Furthermore, FGE could improve the contents of 5-HT, DA and decrease the concentration of Ca2+ and MAO activity in brain tissue and serum compared with the control group. It could reverse the decreased expression of BDNF, NMDAR2A and NMDAR2B and increase NMDAR1 protein expression. Investigation of the active constituents from FGE yielded two new compounds, (4-(((4-ethoxybenzyl) oxy)methyl)-phenol 1 and 3-((4-hydroxy benzyl)oxy)propane-1,2-diol) 2, with twelve known compounds (3-14). The compounds (3-((4-hydroxybenzyl)oxy)propane-1,2-diol 2, 4, 4 '-dihydroxyd iphenyl methane 3, and bungein A 4) protected against NMDA-induced PC-12 cells damage.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that FGE could improve the depressive behavior of CUMS-induced mice and exert a protective effect on nerve cells in the brain. Importantly, compounds 2-4 are the active components of FGE. Overall, the above findings suggest that FGE has huge prospects for application in treating depression-related diseases.

AB  - Downregulation of astrocytic connexin43 (Cx43) has been observed in several brain regions in rodents and patients with depression. However, its specific role in this effect remains unknown. Moreover, chronic pain can induce depressive disorders. Therefore, the current study examined the relationship between Cx43 expression and depressive-like behavior in a neuropathic pain model. Neuropathic pain was induced by spared nerve injury (SNI) in mice. Depressive-like behavior was evaluated using the forced swim test. Expression of Cx43 in the hippocampus was evaluated using Western blotting and realtime PCR. SNI downregulated Cx43 protein in the contralateral hippocampus of mice, whereas expression of hippocampal Cx43 mRNA was not altered following SNI. Although SNI mice showed longer immobility time compared with sham mice during the forced swim test, duration of depressive-like behavior was not correlated with the expression of Cx43 in the hippocampus of SNI mice. Repeated intraperitoneal administration of amitriptyline ameliorated SNI-induced depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, the antidepressant effect of amitriptyline was correlated with decreased hippocampal Cx43 expression in SNI mice. The current findings suggest that the alteration of Cx43 expression in the hippocampus may not be involved in the induction of depressive disorder but may influence the efficacy of antidepressants. Therefore, the level of Cx43 expression in the hippocampus could be a key parameter to evaluate individual differences in antidepressant effects in patients with depressive disorder.

AB  - Due to widespread multi-drug resistance in parasitic nematodes of livestock animals, there is an urgent need to discover new anthelmintics with distinct mechanisms of action. Extending previous work, here we screened a panel of 245 chemically-diverse small molecules for anti-parasitic activity against Haemonchus contortus-an economically important parasitic nematode of livestock. This panel was screened in vitro against exsheathed third-stage larvae (xL3) of H. contortus using an established phenotypic assay, and the potency of select compounds to inhibit larval motility and development assessed in dose-response assays. Of the 245 compounds screened, three-designated MPK18, MPK334 and YAK308-induced non-wildtype larval phenotypes and repeatedly inhibited xL3-motility, with IC50 values of 45.2 mu M, 17.1 mu M and 52.7 mu M, respectively; two also inhibited larval development, with IC50 values of 12.3 mu M (MPK334) and 6.5 mu M (YAK308), and none of the three was toxic to human liver cells (HepG2). These findings suggest that these compounds deserve further evaluation as nematocidal candidates. Future work should focus on structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of these chemical scaffolds, and assess the in vitro and in vivo efficacies and safety of optimised compounds against adults of H. contortus.

AB  - BackgroundSchizophrenia (SZ) is a complex multifactorial disorder that affects 1% of the population worldwide with no available effective treatment. Although proteomic alterations are reported in SZ however proteomic expression aberrations among different brain regions are not fully determined. Therefore, the present study aimed spatial differential protein expression profiling of three distinct regions of SZ brain and identification of associated affected biological pathways in SZ progression.Methods and resultsComparative protein expression profiling of three distinct autopsied human brain regions (i.e., substantia nigra, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of SZ was performed with respective healthy controls. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE)-based nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Nano-LC MS /MS) analysis, 1443 proteins were identified out of which 58 connote to be significantly dysregulated, representing 26 of substantia nigra,14 of hippocampus and 18 of prefrontal cortex. The 58 differentially expressed proteins were further analyzed using Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). The IPA analysis provided protein-protein interaction networks of several proteins including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kb), extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), alpha serine / Threonine-protein kinase (AKT1), cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), holding prime positions in networks and interacts with most of the identified proteins and their closely interacting partners.ConclusionThese findings provide conceptual insights of novel SZ related pathways and the cross talk of co and contra regulated proteins. This spatial proteomic analysis will further broaden the conceptual framework for schizophrenia research in future.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an intricate endocrine disorder that targets millions of women globally. Recent research has drawn attention to its association with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, yet the exact mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the potential role of PCOS-associated insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation in linking PCOS to AD pathogenesis. It additionally investigated the therapeutic merits of pterostilbene (PTS) in ameliorating PCOS and associated cognitive deficits in comparison to metformin (MET). Rats were divided into five groups; vehicle group, PTS group [30 mg/kg, per os (p.o.) for 13 days], and the remaining three groups received letrozole (1 mg/kg, p.o. for 21 days) to represent the PCOS, PCOS + MET (300 mg/kg, p.o. for 13 days), and PCOS + PTS groups, respectively. Behavioral tests were conducted, along with a histopathological investigation of brains and ovaries. Assessment of serum hormonal profile and hippocampal IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta insulin signaling pathway components were performed. PTS rats exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and hormonal profile, besides enhanced neurobehavioral tests performance and histopathological findings. These effects may be attributed to modulation of the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathway, reducing GSK-3 beta activity, and mitigating Tau hyperphosphorylation and A beta accumulation in the brain. Likewise, PTS attenuated nuclear factor kappa B-mediated inflammation and reversed AChE elevation, suggesting multifaceted neuroprotective effects. Comparatively, PTS showed outcomes similar to those of MET in most parameters. The obtained findings validated that dysregulated insulin signaling in PCOS rats detrimentally affects cognitive function, which is halted by PTS, unveiling the potential of PTS as a novel therapy for PCOS and related cognitive deficits.

AB  - The clinical indications reveal that traumatic brain injury (TBI) accelerates the process of limb bone regeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain ambiguous. In this inquiry, the activation of endogenous neural stem cells in the hippocampus post TBI led to the secretion of extracellular vesicles (NSC-EV) that targeted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, ultimately promoting bone healing. The enrichment of miR-9-5p in NSC-EV facilitated osteogenesis through the activation of the MAP3K3 pathway. We also present a novel hydrogel formulation for clinical application of NSC-EVs by means of ROS-responsive EV delivery. The hydrogel was cross-linked with EVs to create a water-based gel encapsulation, which was applied to a 3D-printed beta-TCP scaffold for controlled long-term release that corresponded to those of physiological bone tissue. Our investigation represents the inaugural usage of EVs derived from neural stem cells in bone tissue engineering. These EVs were found to encourage information exchange between the central nervous system and bone tissue regeneration. Our composite scaffold demonstrated impressive bone regeneration qualities in rats with cranial defects, highlighting its potential for pioneering approaches in bone tissue engineering and innovative medical technologies for clinical applications.

AB  - Numerous experimental studies suggest the potential for resveratrol (RVT) to be useful in the Alzheimer's disease treatment, but its low bioavailability limits its application. This study aimed to assess the potential of resveratrol-loaded micelles as a neuronal delivery platform to protect rats from scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Resveratrol was incorporated into Pluronic micelles, and the effects of micellar (mRVT) and pure resveratrol (RVT) were compared in the model of scopolamine-induced dementia in male Wistar rats. Memory performance was assessed by a T maze test. The effect of the treatment on specific neurotransmitter levels and protein expression in the cortex and the hippocampus were evaluated biochemically. Our results revealed that the polymeric micelles were in nanoscale (approximately 33 nm) and reached 79% encapsulation efficiency. The treatment with mRVT demonstrated better spatial memory protective effect. The biochemical assays showed that mRVT in a dose of 10 mg/kg enhanced the effects of the pure drug in regard to noradrenalin neurotransmission and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity in the hippocampus. Furthermore, micellar resveratrol increased the cAMP-response element-binding protein expression in the cortex and hippocampus of rats as well as the Bcl2/BAX ratio, which indicated an anti-apoptotic effect in the experimental dementia model. In conclusion, our results indicated the potential of a micellar system loaded with resveratrol for neurodegenerative diseases treatment.

AB  - Signaling by neurotrophins such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to modulate development of interneurons, but the circuit effects of this modulation remain unclear. Here, we examined the impact of deleting TrkB, a BDNF receptor, in parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons on the balance of excitation and inhibition (E-I) in cortical circuits. In the mouse olfactory cortex, TrkB deletion impairs multiple aspects of PV neuronal function including synaptic excitation, intrinsic excitability, and the innervation pattern of principal neurons. Impaired PV cell function resulted in aberrant spiking patterns in principal neurons in response to stimulation of sensory inputs. Surprisingly, dampened PV neuronal function leads to a paradoxical decrease in overall excitability in cortical circuits. Our study demonstrates that, by modulating PV circuit plasticity and development, TrkB plays a critical role in shaping the evoked pattern of activity in a cortical network.

AB  - Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder estimated to effect 1-3% of the population. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is essential for brain development and functioning, shown to be protective in fetal alcohol syndrome and to regulate alcohol consumption in adult mice. The goal of this study was to characterize the role of ADNP, and its active peptide NAP (NAPVSIPQ), which is also known as davunetide (investigational drug) in mediating cocaine-induced neuroadaptations. Real time PCR was used to test levels of Adnp and Adnp2 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and dorsal hippocampus (DH) of cocaine-treated mice (15 mg/kg). Adnp heterozygous (Adnp+/-)and wild-type (Adnp+/-) mice were further tagged with excitatory neuronal membrane-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) that allowed for in vivo synaptic quantification. The mice were treated with cocaine (5 injections; 15 mg/kg once every other day) with or without NAP daily injections (0.4 mu g/0.1 ml) and sacrificed following the last treatment. We analyzed hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from 3D confocal images using the Imaris x64.8.1.2 (Oxford Instruments) software to measure changes in dendritic spine density and morphology. In silico ADNP/NAP/cocaine structural modeling was performed as before. Cocaine decreased Adnp and Adnp2 expression 2 h after injection in the NAc and VTA of male mice, with mRNA levels returning to baseline levels after 24 h. Cocaine further reduced hippocampal spine density, particularly synaptically weaker immature thin and stubby spines, in male Adnp+/+) mice while increasing synaptically stronger mature (mushroom) spines in Adnp+/-) male mice and thin and stubby spines in females. Lastly, we showed that cocaine interacts with ADNP on a zinc finger domain identical to ketamine and adjacent to a NAP-zinc finger interaction site. Our results implicate ADNP in cocaine abuse, further placing the ADNP gene as a key regulator in neuropsychiatric disorders. Ketamine/cocaine and NAP treatment may be interchangeable to some degree, implicating an interaction with adjacent zinc finger motifs on ADNP and suggestive of a potential sex-dependent, non-addictive NAP treatment for CUD.

AB  - This study aims to explore the potential use of low-cost ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to quantify adulteration content of soybean, rapeseed, corn and peanut oils in Camellia oil. To attain this aim, test oil samples were firstly prepared with different adulterant ratios ranging from 1% to 90% at varying intervals, and their spectra were collected by an in-house built experimental platform. Next, the spectra were preprocessed using Savitzky-Golay (SG)-Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and the feature wavelengths were extracted using four different algorithms. Finally, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) models were developed to rapidly predict adulteration content. The results indicated that SG-CWT with decomposition scale of 2(5) and the Iterative Variable Subset Optimization (IVSO) algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of the models. Furthermore, the SVR model performed best for predicting adulteration of camellia oil with soybean oil, while the RF models were optimal for camellia oil adulterated with rapeseed, corn, or peanut oil. Additionally, we verified the models' robustness by examining the correlation between the absorbance and adulteration content at certain feature wavelengths screened by IVSO. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using low-cost UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy for the authentication of Camellia oil.

AB  - The decline in cognitive function associated with aging significantly impacts the well-being of elderly individuals and their families. This decline is a major recognized risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease. Animal models of aging provide a platform for evaluating drugs concerning aspects like memory and oxidative stress. JM-20 has demonstrated protective effects on short-term memory acquisition and consolidation, along with antioxidant properties and modulation of Acetylcholinesterase activity. This study assesses the potential protective JM-20 against cognitive decline and age-related memory loss. For the study, aged mice exhibiting aging-associated damage were initially selected. Experimental groups were then formed, and the effect of 8 mg/kg of JM-20 was evaluated for 40 days on aging-related behavior, such as spatial memory, novelty recognition memory, ambulatory activity, and anxiety. Subsequently, animals were sacrificed, and the hippocampal region was extracted for redox studies and to assess acetylcholinesterase activity. Results indicated that JM-20 at 8 mg/kg reversed damage to spatial working and reference memory, exhibiting performance comparable to untreated young adult animals. Furthermore, JM-20 preserved the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and total sulfhydryl levels in age-related cognitive impairment in mice, indicating a potent protective effect against oxidative events at the brain level. However, only young, healthy animals showed decreased acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity. These findings provide preclinical pharmacological evidence supporting the neuroprotective activity of JM-20, positioning it as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating memory disorders associated with aging.

AB  - Two experiments were performed to evaluate the use of an intravaginal device (IVD) impregnated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to avoid early parturition and synchronize farrowing in sows. In both experiments with IVDs, the gestation length, stillbirth rate, birth weight, colostrum yield, lactational litter performance, and subsequent reproductive performance of sows were assessed. In Experiment 1 (Exp. 1; n = 91), sows were assigned to four treatments to evaluate the minimum required MPA dose: without IVD (CONT; control), 400 mg (MPA400), 600 mg (MPA600), and 800 mg ( MPA800) of MPA in the IVD. The IVD was inserted on day 110 of gestation and removed on day 115. No sows farrowed during IVD treatment. Gestation length was increased in treatments with MPA (116.4 days) compared to the control (CONT; 114.9 days; P < 0.01), without effects on piglet birth weight (P = 0.98). A lower percentage of deaths around the farrow (P = 0.02) was observed in the CONT (1.8%) compared to MPA treatments (6.8%). The dose of 400 mg of MPA, validated in Exp. 1, was used in Experiment 2 (Exp. 2; n = 84) to evaluate the performance of sows and piglets in a sow farrowing synchronization protocol. Sows were treated with MPA from days 110-114 of gestation with or without 0.168 mg of cloprostenol sodium (PGF2 alpha), for luteolysis induction, at IVD removal. Thus, four treatments were considered: CONT - without MPA or luteolysis induction (no interventions); PGF2 alpha - luteolysis induction on day 114 of gestation without MPA; MPA114 - MPA treatment till 114 days of gestation without luteolysis induction; MPA114 thorn PGF2 alpha e MPA treatment and luteolysis induction on day 114 of gestation. The gestation length in treatments with IVDs was longer (P < 0.01) than CONT without a difference for PGF2 alpha treatment (P = 0.46). No impact of IVD use on piglet birth weight (P = 0.67) and deaths around the farrow (P = 0.50) were observed. The colostrum yield (P = 0.65), immunocrit (P = 0.72), piglet performance during lactation (P = 0.81), and weaning-to-estrus interval (P = 0.21) were similar among treatments. In conclusion, the use of IVDs impregnated with 400 mg of MPA between days 110 and 114 of gestation prevented early parturition with no implications for piglet survival at birth, colostrum yield, or litter performance.

AB  - Amantadine hydrochloride (AMH) is a repurposed moiety of anti-viral category having significant response against Parkinsonism. Nasal route is linked with the direct delivery of drugs to brain through olfactory and trigeminal nerves. The mucociliary clearance is the major obstacle for effective delivery of drugs. The optimized formulation was coated with chitosan (CH) to enhance the residence time of formulation in the nasal cavity. The optimized NLCs exhibited particle size of 174.2 f 1.5 nm, PDI of 0.131 f 0.019, zeta potential of -27.52 f 3.29 mV, EE of 74.06 f 2.3 %, and nasal flux of 66.03 f 0.9 mu g/cm2/h. FTIR analysis revealed AMH-excipient compatibility and encapsulation of AMH into NLCs. XRD analysis confirmed no polymorphic transition in the developed NLCs. Drug release exhibited sustained release of AMH (71.01 f 2.19 %) up to 24 h. Ex vivo study (goat nasal mucosa) showed 3.22 folds enhanced permeability of AMH from AMH-NLCs in comparison to AMHSol. The recommended storage condition for AMH-NLCs was found to be 25 degrees C/60 % RH. AMH-NLCs showed high cell viability (88.23 f 7.49 %) in comparison to AMH-Sol (62.14 f 6.81 %) on H2O2 induced PC12 cells at a concentration level of 100 mu g/ml. In vivo studies exhibited effectiveness of CH-AMH-NLCs and AMH-NLCs and showed increased response when compared with amantadine solution (pure form) and marketed formulation.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are promising molecules to address the global antibiotic resistance problem, however, optimization to achieve favorable potency and safety is required. Here, a peptide-template modification approach was employed to design physicochemical variants based on net charge, hydrophobicity, enantiomer, and terminal group. All variants of the scorpion venom peptide BmKn-2 with amphipathic alpha-helical cationic structure exhibited an increased antibacterial potency when evaluated against multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates at a MIC range of 4-8 mu M. They revealed antibiofilm activity in a dose-dependent manner. Sheep red blood cells were used to evaluate hemolytic and cell selectivity properties. Peptide Kn2-5R-NH2, dKn2-5R-NH2, and 2F-Kn2-5R-NH2 (variants with +6 charges carrying amidated C-terminus) showed stronger antibacterial activity than Kn2-5R (a variant with +5 charges bearing free-carboxyl group at C-terminus). Peptide dKn2-5R-NH2 (d-enantiomer) exhibited slightly weaker antibacterial activity with much less hemolytic activity (higher hemolytic concentration 50) than Kn2-5R-NH2 (l-enantiomer). Furthermore, peptide Kn2-5R with the least hydrophobicity had the lowest hemolytic activity and showed the highest specificity to Salmonella (the highest selectivity index). This study also explained the relationship of peptide physicochemical properties and bioactivities that would fulfill and accelerate progress in peptide antibiotic research and development.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a minority population of cancer cells with stemness and multiple differentiation potentials, leading to cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. However, the concrete mechanism of CSCs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains obscure. We found that in advanced HCC tissues, collagen I was upregulated, which is consistent with the expression of its receptor DDR1. Accordingly, high collagen I levels accompanied by high DDR1 expression are associated with poor prognoses in patients with HCC. Collagen I-induced DDR1 activation enhanced HCC cell stemness in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DDR1 interacts with CD44, which acts as a co-receptor that amplifies collagen I-induced DDR1 signaling, and collagen I-DDR1 signaling antagonized Hippo signaling by facilitating the recruitment of PP2AA to MST1, leading to exaggerated YAP activation. The combined inhibition of DDR1 and YAP synergistically abrogated HCC cell stemness in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. A radiomic model based on T2 weighted images can noninvasively predict collagen I expression. These findings reveal the molecular basis of collagen I-DDR1 signaling inhibiting Hippo signaling and highlight the role of CD44/DDR1/YAP axis in promoting cancer cell stemness, suggesting that DDR1 and YAP may serve as novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC.

AB  - 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol (PPD) is one of the bioactive ingredients in ginseng and possesses neuroprotective properties. Brain-type creatine kinase (CK-BB) is an enzyme involved in brain energy homeostasis via the phosphocreatine-creatine kinase system. We previously identified PPD as directly bound to CK-BB and activated its activity in vitro. In this study, we explored the antidepressive effects of PPD that target CK-BB. First, we conducted time course studies on brain CK-BB, behaviors, and hippocampal structural plasticity responses to corticosterone (CORT) administration. Five weeks of CORT injection reduced CK-BB activity and protein levels and induced depression-like behaviors and hippocampal structural plasticity impairment. Next, a CK inhibitor and an adeno-associated virus-targeting CKB were used to diminish CK-BB activity or its expression in the brain. The loss of CK-BB in the brain led to depressive behaviors and morphological damage to spines in the hippocampus. Then, a polyclonal antibody against PPD was used to determine the distribution of PPD in the brain tissues. PPD was detected in the hippocampus and cortex and observed in astrocytes, neurons, and vascular endotheliocytes. Finally, different PPD doses were used in the chronic CORT-induced depression model. Treatment with a high dose of PPD significantly increased the activity and expression of CK-BB after long-term CORT injection. In addition, PPD alleviated the damage to depressive-like behaviors and structural plasticity induced by repeated CORT injection. Overall, our study revealed the critical role of CK-BB in mediating structural plasticity in CORT-induced depression and identified CK-BB as a therapeutic target for PPD, allowing us to treat stress-related mood disorders.

AB  - The secreted protein collagen and calcium-binding EGF domain 1 (CCBE1) is critical for embryonic lymphatic devel-opment through its role in the proteolytic activation of mature vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC). We previously reported that CCBE1 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and that its transcription is negatively regulated by the TGF beta-SMAD pathway, but the transcriptional activation mechanism of CCBE1 in CRC remains unknown. Recent studies have revealed the vital role of the hippo effectors YAP/ TAZ in lymphatic development; however, the role of YAP/TAZ in tumor lymphangiogenesis has not been clarified. In this study, we found that high nuclear expression of transcription factor TEAD4 is associated with lymph node metastasis and high lymphatic vessel density in patients with CRC. YAP/TAZ- TEAD4 complexes transcriptionally upregulated the expression of CCBE1 by directly binding to the enhancer region of CCBE1 in both CRC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, which resulted in enhanced VEGFC proteolysis and induced tube formation and migration of human lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro and lymphangiogenesis in a CRC cell-derived xenograft model in vivo. In addition, the bromodomain and extra -terminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1 significantly inhibited the transcription of CCBE1, suppressed VEGFC proteolysis, and inhibited tumor lymphangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals a new positive transcriptional regulatory mechanism of CCBE1 via YAP/TAZ-TEAD4-BRD4 complexes in CRC, which exposes the protumor lymphangio-genic role of YAP/TAZ and the potential inhibitory effect of BET inhibitors on tumor lymphangiogenesis.

TI  - YAP1 inhibits the senescence of alveolar epithelial cells by targeting Prdx3 to alleviate pulmonary fibrosis

KW  - HIPPO PATHWAY
KW  - MITOCHONDRIA
AB  - The senescence of alveolar type II (AT2) cells impedes self-repair of the lung epithelium and contributes to lung injury in the setting of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is essential for cell growth and organ development; however, the role of YAP1 in AT2 cells during pulmonary fibrosis is still unclear. YAP1 expression was found to be downregulated in the AT2 cells of PF patients. Deletion of YAP1 in AT2 cells resulted in lung injury, exacerbated extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and worsened lung function. In contrast, overexpression of YAP1 in AT2 cells promoted alveolar regeneration, mitigated pulmonary fibrosis, and improved lung function. In addition, overexpression of YAP1 alleviated bleomycin (BLM) -induced senescence of alveolar epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, YAP1 promoted the expression of peroxiredoxin 3 (Prdx3) by directly interacting with TEAD1. Forced expression of Prdx3 inhibited senescence and improved mitochondrial dysfunction in BLM-treated MLE-12 cells, whereas depletion of Prdx3 partially abrogated the protective effect of YAP1. Furthermore, overexpression of Prdx3 facilitated self-repair of the injured lung and reduced ECM deposition, while silencing Prdx3 attenuated the antifibrotic effect of YAP1. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that YAP1 alleviates lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis by regulating Prdx3 expression to improve mitochondrial dysfunction and block senescence in AT2 cells, revealing a potential novel therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis.
   Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is still not fully understood, and effective treatments are scarce. This study investigates the role of a protein, YAP1, in lung fibrosis. Researchers used mice and human lung samples to study how YAP1 influences lung cell aging and lung structure. The findings showed that increasing YAP1 levels in alveolar type II cells reduced lung fibrosis by improving the function of mitochondria and decreasing cell aging. Specifically, YAP1 worked through a pathway involving a molecule, Prdx3. However, reducing YAP1 levels worsened lung fibrosis. The researchers suggest that enhancing YAP1 activity in lung cells could be a potential treatment for lung fibrosis. This method targets lung cell aging and promotes healthy lung tissue repair. The results pave the way for developing treatments for IPF and possibly other similar lung diseases. This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.

AB  - GPR43 (also known as FFAR2 or FFA2) is a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in immune cells, enteroendocrine cells and adipocytes that recognizes short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, likely to be implicated in innate immunity and host energy homeostasis. Activated GPR43 suppresses the cAMP level and induces Ca2+. flux via coupling to G alpha, and G alpha(q), families, respectively. Additionally, GPR43 is reported to facilitate phosphorylation of ERK through G-protein-dependent pathways and interacts with 11-arrestin 2 to inhibit NF-kappa B signaling. However, other G-protein-dependent and independent signaling pathways involving GPR43 remain to be established. Here, we have demonstrated that GPR43 augments Rho GTPase signaling. Acetate and a synthetic agonist effectively activated RhoA and stabilized YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators through interactions of GPR43 with G alpha(q/11) and G alpha(12/13). Acetate-induced nuclear accumulation of YAP was blocked by a GPR43-specific inverse agonist. The target genes induced by YAP/TAZ were further regulated by GPR43. Moreover, in THP-1-derived M1-like macrophage cells, the Rho-YAP/TAZ pathway was activated by acetate and a synthetic agonist. Our collective findings suggest that GPR43 acts as a mediator of the Rho-YAP/TAZ pathway.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop protocols for contraception in both sexes of giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) by using the GnRH vaccine Improvac (R). We evaluated the success of immunization by analyzing fecal reproductive hormone metabolites in female (n = 20) and male (n = 9) giraffes. Endocrine analysis provided the basis for the successful immunization protocol, as well as for assessing long-term effects. Reliable reduction of fecal steroid metabolites to baseline levels in female giraffes was achieved with three, and in males with four or five injections at 4-week intervals. Effective booster injections were administered at 2-month intervals in the first year of treatment and at three to 4-month intervals in the following years. In addition to endocrine analysis, we determined vaccination efficacy in bulls by assessing testicular atrophy. Long-term (>2 years) use in females was often accompanied by prolonged periods of persistent corpus luteum activity, although normal cycles were not observed. Problems might occur with reversibility, because in a few males and females, even after more than 2 years since treatment had been stopped, fecal hormone metabolites have not returned to pretreatment levels. The results are somewhat ambiguous, as reproduction can be suppressed by use of Improvac (R), but the question of reversibility remains unsolved.

AB  - Chamber maturation is a significant process in cardiac development. Disorders of this crucial process lead to a range of congenital heart defects. Foxc1a is a critical transcription factor reported to regulate the specification of cardiac progenitor cells. However, little is known about the role of Foxc1a in modulating chamber maturation. Previously, we reported that foxc1a-null zebrafish embryos exhibit disrupted heart structures and functions. In this study, we observe that ventricle structure and cardiomyocyte proliferation are abolished during chamber maturation in foxc1a-null zebrafish embryos. To observe the endogenous localization of Foxc1a in the hearts of living embryos, we insert eyfp at the foxc1a genomic locus using TALEN. Analysis of the knockin zebrafish show that foxc1a is widely expressed in ventricular cardiomyocytes during chamber development. Cardiac RNA sequencing analysis reveals the downregulated expression of the Hippo signaling effector wwtr1. Dual-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that Foxc1a can bind directly to three sites in the wwtr1 promoter region. Furthermore, wwtr1 mRNA overexpression is sufficient to reverse the ventricle defects during chamber maturation. Conditional overexpression of nkx2.5 also partially rescues the ventricular defects during chamber development. These findings demonstrate that wwtr1 and nkx2.5 are direct targets of Foxc1a during ventricular chamber maturation. Copyright (C) 2021, The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a role in innate immunity and is used in animal models of maternal immune activation. The current study attempted to clarify the effect of LPS exposure on the dentate gyrus progenitors in ferret neonates. Methods: LPS was administered subcutaneously at 500 mu g/g of body weight to ferrets on postnatal days 6 and 7. Animals were injected intraperitonially with BrdU simultaneously with a second LPS injection to label the proliferating cells following LPS exposure. Results: Two hours after BrdU injection, a significantly greater density of BrdU-labeled cells was observed in the hilus of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in LPS-exposed ferrets than in that of the controls. The majority of BrdU-labeled cells were Sox2 immunopositive in either the granular/subgranular layers or hilus in both groups. The percentages of BLBP (a marker of adult-type dentate gyrus progenitors), S100 (a marker of glial cells), and cleaved caspase 3 (a marker of apoptosis) were significantly lower in the granular/subgranular layers and/or hilus of LPS-exposed ferrets than in those of the controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest that LPS promotes the proliferation of dentate gyrus progenitors. LPS may further act on the post-proliferative dentate gyrus progenitors to sustain their embryonic-type characteristics by preventing their transitions into the BLBP-expressing adult-type and/or S100-expressing glial cell lineages and by inhibiting programmed cell death.

AB  - Rhinogobius virgigena is a fish species of the family Gobiidae, order Perciformes. This study aims to better understand the phylogenetic status of R. virgigena within Gobiidae and the phylogenetic relations in this family. Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited and does not recombine; therefore, mitochondrial genomes simplify genealogical tracing and reveal phylogenetic relationships among species more clearly than nuclear genomes. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain a complete mitochondrial genome sequence of R. virgigena and conducted phylogenetic analyses. The R. virgigena mitochondrial genome is 16,491 bp long and its base composition shows AT preference. It comprises 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and a D loop. Protein-coding genes account for 69.3% of the complete genome. Leucine is the most abundant amino acid, whereas cysteine is the least abundant. tRNA genes account for 9.4% of the genome. Twenty-one tRNAs have a typical cloverleaf secondary structure, whereas tRNA-Ser1 lacks the dihydrouracil arm. The two rRNA genes are separated by tRNA-Val. A mitochondrial genome contains seven overlaps and 11 gaps, indicating a tight arrangement. Two phylogenetic trees constructed based on the nucleotide sequences of 13 protein-coding genes from 54 Gobiidae species using the maximum likelihood method and Bayesian inference revealed that R. virgigena is the most closely related to Rhinogobius duospilus.

AB  - Background In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the activation of senescent microglia is closely related to energy dysmetabolism. However, the mechanism underlying the interaction between the energy metabolism of aging microglia and neuroinflammation remains unclear. Methods We used biochemical methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, and western blot to determine the effects and mechanism of CD38 knockdown on energy metabolism and neuroinflammation in A beta 1-40 injured BV2 cells. Using AD model mice, we detected CD38 enzyme activity, energy metabolism factors (ATP, NAD +, and NAD + /NADH), and neuroinflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) following the addition of CD38 inhibitor. Using a combination of biochemical analysis and behavioral testing, we analyzed the effects of the CD38 inhibitor on energy metabolism disorder, the neuroinflammatory response, and the cognition of AD mice. Results Following A beta 1-40 injury, SA-beta-Gal positive cells and senescence-related proteins P16 and P21 increased in BV2 cells, while energy-related molecules (ATP, NAD +, and NAD + /NADH) and mitochondrial function (mitochondrial ROS and MMP) decreased. Further studies showed that CD38 knockdown could improve A beta 1-40-induced BV2 cells energy dysmetabolism and reduce the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. In vivo results showed an increase in senile plaque deposition and microglial activation in the hippocampus and cortex of 34-week-old APP/PS1 mice. Following treatment with the CD38 inhibitor, senile plaque deposition decreased, the number of Iba1 + BV2 cells increased, the energy metabolism disorder was improved, the proinflammatory cytokines were reduced, and the spatial learning ability was improved. Conclusions Our results confirm that senescent microglia appeared in the brain of 34-week-old APP/PS1 mice, and that A beta 1-40 can induce senescence of BV2 cells. The expression of CD38 increases in senescent BV2 cells, resulting in energy metabolism disorder. Therefore, reducing CD38 expression can effectively improve energy metabolism disorder and reduce proinflammatory cytokines. Following intervention with the CD38 inhibitor in APP/PS1 mice, the energy metabolism disorder was improved in the hippocampus and cortex, the level of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced, and cognitive impairment was improved.

AB  - Oxidative DNA damage in the brain has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. DNA glycosylases initiate base excision repair (BER), the main pathway for oxidative DNA base lesion repair. NEIL1 and NEIL3 DNA glycosylases affect cognition in mice, while the role of NEIL2 remains unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of NEIL2 and its potential overlap with NEIL1 on behavior in knockout mouse models. Neil1(-/-)Neil2(-/-) mice display hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and improved learning. Hippocampal oxidative DNA base lesion levels are comparable between genotypes and no mutator phenotype is found. Thus, impaired canonical repair is not likely to explain the altered behavior. Electrophysiology suggests reduced axonal activation in the hippocampal CA1 region in Neil1(-/-)Neil2(-/-) mice and lack of NEIL1 and NEIL2 causes dysregulation of genes in CA1 relevant for synaptic function. We postulate a cooperative function of NEIL1 and NEIL2 in genome regulation, beyond canonical BER, modulating behavior in mice.
   Gunn Hildrestrand, Veslemoy Rolseth, and Nicolas Kunath et al. examine mice lacking the NEIL1 and NEIL2 DNA glycosylases involved in base excision repair. Their results suggest that loss of both NEIL1 and NEIL2 dysregulates genes relevant to synaptic function and modulates behavior in mice.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic airway disease whose exacerbations are often triggered by rhinovirus infection. TGF-beta 1 induces rhinovirus replication in infected cells. Moreover, TGF-beta 1 is a pleiotropic mediator that is produced by many immune cells in the latent, inactive form bound to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) and to the transmembrane protein glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP). In this study we wanted to investigate the effect of rhinovirus infection on the TGF-beta secretion and the downstream signaling via TGF-beta RI/RII in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from control and asthmatic patients after rhinovirus infection ex vivo. Here, we found a significant upregulation of TGF-beta RII in untouched PBMCs of asthmatics as well as a suppression of TGF-beta release in the rhinovirus-infected PBMC condition. Moreover, consistent with an effect of TGF-beta on Tregs, PBMCs infected with RV induced Tregs, and TGF-beta RII directly correlated with RV1b mRNA. Finally, we found via flow cytometry that NK cells expressed less GARP surface-bound TGF-beta, while cytokine-producing NKbright cells were induced. In summary, we show that rhinovirus infection inhibits TGF-beta release in PBMCs, which results in the activation of both Treg and NK cells.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying neuronal development and synaptic formation in the brain depend on intricate cellular and molecular processes. The neuronal membrane glycoprotein GPM6a promotes neurite elongation, filopodia/spine formation, and synapse development, yet its molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Since the extracellular domains of GPM6a (ECs) command its function, we investigated the interaction between ICAM5, the neuronal member of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) family, and GPM6a's ECs. Our study aimed to explore the functional relationship between GPM6a and ICAM5 in hippocampal culture neurons and cell lines. Immunostaining of 15 days in vitro (DIV) neurons revealed significant co-localization between endogenous GPM6a clusters and ICAM5 clusters in the dendritic shaft. These results were further corroborated by overexpressing GPM6a and ICAM5 in N2a cells and hippocampal neurons at 5 DIV. Moreover, results from the co-immunoprecipitations and cell aggregation assays prove the cis and trans interaction between both proteins in GPM6a/ICAM5 overexpressing HEK293 cells. Additionally, GPM6a and ICAM5 overexpression additively enhanced neurite length, the number of neurites in N2a cells, and filopodia formation in 5 DIV neurons, indicating their cooperative role. These findings highlight the dynamic association between GPM6a and ICAM5 during neuronal development, offering insights into their contributions to neurite outgrowth, filopodia formation, and cell-cell interactions.

AB  - Pyramidal neurons are a major cell type of the forebrain, consisting of a pyramidally shaped soma with axonal and apicobasal dendritic processes. It is poorly understood how the neuronal soma develops its pyramidal morphology, while generating neurites of the proper shape and orientation. Here, we discovered that the spherical somata of immature neurite-less neurons possess a circumferential wreath-like network of septin filaments, which promotes neuritogenesis by balancing the protrusive activity of lamellipodia and filopodia. In embryonic rat hippocampal and mouse cortical neurons, the septin wreath network consists of curvilinear filaments that contain septins 5, 7, and 11 (Sept5/7/11). The Sept5/7/11 wreath network demarcates a zone of myosin II enrichment and Arp2/3 diminution at the base of filopodial actin bundles. In Sept7-depleted neu-rons, cell bodies are enlarged with hyperextended lamellae and abnormally shaped neurites that originate from lamellipodia. This phenotype is accompanied by diminished myosin II and filopodia lifetimes and increased Arp2/3 and lamellipodial activity. Inhibition of Arp2/3 rescues soma and neurite phenotypes, indi-cating that the septin wreath network suppresses the extension of lamellipodia, facilitating the formation of neurites from the filopodia of a consolidated soma. We show that this septin function is critical for developing a pyramidally shaped soma with properly distributed and oriented dendrites in cultured rat hippocampal neu-rons and in vivo in mouse perinatal cortical neurons. Therefore, the somatic septin cytoskeleton provides a key morphogenetic mechanism for neuritogenesis and the development of pyramidal neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUNDCamellia oleifera is a woody oil-bearing crop, and the quality of its seeds and pressed oil is affected by the postharvest drying. In order to find a suitable drying method for camellia seeds maintaining their good qualities, effects of three drying methods, including room temperature (RT) drying, 60 degrees C hot-air (HA) drying, as well as 600-800 W infrared pre-drying and sequential 60 degrees C hot-air (IR-HA) drying, on the drying efficiency, qualities and storage stabilities of camellia seeds were compared.RESULTSCompared with HA drying, IR-HA drying shortened the drying time of fresh camellia seeds by 42-47%. The IR-HA dried seeds showed brighter color, higher contents of alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, beta-sterol and squalene, and better oxidation stability than the RT dried and the HA dried seeds. Heat treatments with HA and IR-HA slightly destroyed the microstructure of camellia kernels, changed the compositions and contents of the free phenolics, decreased the activities of lipoxygenases, polyphenol oxidase and lipase, increased the sulfhydryl contents of the enzyme proteins while reduced the alpha-helix contents of enzyme proteins. However, except for arachidonic acid, the fatty acid profiles of the HA and IR-HA dried camellia seeds were similar to that of the RT dried ones. The obvious decrease of enzyme activities in IR-HA dried seeds could be related to the changed secondary structures of enzyme proteins and the increase of sulfhydryl groups.CONCLUSIONThe results indicate that IR-HA drying is suitable for obtaining camellia seeds with better quality and higher storage stability.

AB  - Early adverse diet exposures are known to be associated with increased risk of learning and memory injury in offspring, yet whether oxidized milk is involved in such an effect has been largely unknown. Here, we focused on oxidized milk intake in mice during pregnancy and lactation to measure the changes in the learning and memory ability in offspring and also probed into the relevant association with gut microbiota. Milk was oxidized with H2O2-Cu or HClO, resulting in different degrees of oxidative damage. KM female mice were fed H2O2-Cu, HClO, or normal control diets immediately after caging until their offspring were 3-weeks old. Behavioral tests were then performed to test the learning and memory ability, and 16S rRNA sequencing was completed with harvested fecal contents. As analyzed, fecal microflora in mice with oxidized milk was affected, mainly reflected in decreased mucin-degrading bacteria, Akkermansia and Lactobacillus, and in reversely increased pro-inflammatory bacteria Shigella, pathobiont Mucispirillum, nervous associated bacteria Ruminococcus, Escherichia, and Desulfovibrio. In the meantime, the inflammation developed in mice was aggravated accompanied by increased expression of relevant genes, while the genes and proteins associated with the learning and memory ability were down-regulated. Further behavioral tests proved impairment of the learning and memory ability in offspring. In general, milk of oxidative damage is a risk factor of the impaired transgenerational ability in learning and memory, which is associated with gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa conditions. This finding may help support the potential of early adverse diet as a harmful factor in learning and memory.

AB  - A number of studies have confirmed that Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)-transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) activity is the driver of cancer development. However, the role and mechanism of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD pathway in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) remain to be clarified. Therefore, this study was designed to observe the effect of YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity on the development of CIN and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of CIN. Firstly, cervical tissues were collected from CIN patients in different stages [CIN grade 1 (CIN1) tissue, CIN grade 2/3 (CIN 2/3) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)] and healthy volunteers. Next, the expression levels of YAP, TAZ and TEAD in cervical tissues and cells were observed by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and western blot. Besides, Z172 and Z183 cells were transfected with siRNA-YAP/TAZ (si-YAP/TAZ) and YAP/TAZ overexpression vector (YAP-5SA). Also, Z172 cells were co-transfected with YAP-5SA and si-TEAD2/4. Subsequently, the stemness characteristics, glycolysis level and malignant transformation of cells in each group were observed by sphere-formation assay, commercial kit, MTT, Transwell, scratch experiment, xenotransplantation and western blot.The expression of YAP, TAZ and TEAD increased significantly in cervical cancer tissue and cell line at the stage of CIN2/3 and SCC. When YAP/TAZ was knocked down, the stemness characteristics, glycolysis level and malignant transformation of cancer cells were notably inhibited; while activating YAP/TAZ exhibited a completely opposite result. In addition, activating YAP/TAZ and knocking down the TEAD expression at the same time significant weakened the effect of activated YAP/TAZ signal on precancerous cells and reduced inhibitory effect of knocking down TEAD alone. YAP/TAZ-TEAD signal activates the characteristics and Warburg effect of cancer stem cells, thereby promoting the malignant transformation of CIN.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Trichilia catigua A. Juss (Meliaceae) is used in Brazilian folk medicine to alleviate fatigue and emotional stress and improve memory. Previous studies from our laboratory reported that an ethyl-acetate fraction (EAF) of T. catigua that was given before cerebral ischemia in vivo prevented memory loss and reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Despite the value of these findings of a neuroprotective effect of T. catigua, treatment that was given immediately before or immediately after ischemia limits its clinical rele-vance. Thus, unknown is whether T. catigua possesses a specific time window of efficacy (TWE) when admin-istered postischemia. Aim of the study: Given continuity to previous studies, we investigated whether an EAF of T. catigua maintains its neuroprotective properties if treatment begins at different time windows of efficacy after ischemia. We also evaluated, for the first time, whether T. catigua possesses neuroplasticity/neurotrophic properties.Material and methods: Rats were subjected to transient global brain ischemia (TGCI) and then given a single dose of the EAF (400 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg) orally 1, 4, or 6 h postischemia. The levels of protein PCG, GSH, and GSSG, and activity of SOD and CAT were assayed as markers of oxidative stress on the day after ischemia. In another experiment, naive rats underwent spatial learning training in a radial maze task and then subjected to TGCI. Delayed treatment with the EAF began 4 or 6 h later and continued for 7 days. Retrograde memory performance was assessed 10, 17, and 24 days postischemia. Afterward, brains were examined for neuro-degeneration and neuronal dendritic morphology in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Another group received the EAF at 4 h of reperfusion, and 4 days later their brains were examined for GFAP and Iba-1 immunoreactivity. Lastly, ischemic rats received the EAF 4 h after ischemia and neural plasticity-related pro-teins, BDNF, SYN, PSD 95, and NeuN were measured in the hippocampus 7 and 14 days after ischemia.Results: A single EAF administration 1, 4, or 6 h postischemia alleviated oxidative stress that was caused by ischemia, expressed as a reduction of the amount of the PCG and GSSG, normalization of the GSH/GSSG ratio, and the restoration of SOD activity. Ischemia caused the persistent loss of memory (i.e., amnesia), an outcome that was consistently ameliorated by treatment with the EAF that was initiated 4 or 6 h postischemia. The 4 h delay in EAF treatment positively impacted dendritic morphology in neurons that survived ischemia. TGCI reduced BDNF, SYN, PSD-95, and NeuN protein levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The EAF normalized SYN and PSD-95 protein levels. Ischemia-induced neurodegeneration and glial cell activation were not prevented by EAF treatment.Conclusion: The present study corroborates prior data that demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of T. catigua and extends these data by showing that the delayed administration of EAF postischemia effectively prevented memory impairment and decreased oxidative stress, dendritic deterioration, and synaptic protein loss within a TWE that ranged from 1 to 6 h. This specific TWE in preclinical research may have clinical relevance by suggesting the possible utility of this plant for the development of neuroprotective strategies in the setting of ischemic brain diseases. Another innovative finding of the present study was the possible neurotrophic/neuro-plastic properties of T. catigua.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the functional relevance and mechanistic basis of the histone demethylase Jumonji domain-containing protein-3 (JMJD3) in preserving dopaminergic neuron survival in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced lesions and MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cell lines exposed to 6-OHDA, respectively, were used to simulate in vivo and in vitro PD-like environments. PD-related genes with differential expressions were identified using RNA sequencing of hippocampal tissues collected from MPTP-lesioned mice. A specific lentiviral shRNA vector was used to investigate the effects of JMJD3 on neuron activities in vitro and PD-like phenotypes in vivo. JMJD3 was found to up-regulate the expression of Snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2) through the inhibition of H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) enrichment in the SNAI2 promoter region. As a result, the viability of 6-OHDA-exposed MN9D cells was stimulated, and cell apoptosis was diminished. Knockdown of SNAI2 decreased the expression of yes-associated protein (YAP) and HIF1 & alpha; while also reducing the viability of 6-OHDA-exposed MN9D cells and increasing cell apoptosis. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that JMJD3 activated the SNAI2/YAP/HIF1 & alpha; signaling pathway, inhibiting PD-like phenotypes in MPTP-lesioned mice. Thus, the findings provide evidence that JMJD3 inhibits the enrichment of H3K27me3 at the SNAI2 promoter, leading to the upregulation of SNAI2 expression and activation of the YAP/HIF1 & alpha; signaling pathway, ultimately exerting a protective effect on PD mice. This finding suggests that targeting the JMJD3-SNAI2 pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. Further in-depth studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and identify potential downstream targets of this pathway.

AB  - Hyaluronic Acid (HA) has been applied as an anti-ageing molecule in the form of topical products. Current topical commercial formulations of HA face the limitations of very small and stagnant skin permeation, thereby demanding enduring administration of the formulation to sustain its action. In this study, Lipid-based nanocarriers in the form of ethosomes were formulated in a 1% w/w HA strength and were extensively evaluated in vitro, ex-vivo, and in vivo parameters along with a comparison to it's commercial counterpart. The optimised ethosomes-based HA gel formulation revealed required pH (6.9 +/- 0.2), small globule size (1024 +/- 9 nm), zeta potential of -6.39 +/- 0.2 mV, and 98 +/- 1.1% HA content. The ex vivo skin permeation and deposition potenwere conferred on synthetic membrane Strat-M, Human cadaver skin, mice skin, rat skin, and pig skin, and both parameters were found to be much higher in comparison to the commercial topical formulation. Skin deposition capacity of the optimised HA formulation was further confirmed by Scan Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and it was observed that the developed ethosomal gel formulation got deposited more on the treated skin. The in vivo anti-ageing effect of optimised ethosomal gel on rats was found to be greater when compared to commercial formulation of HA and the developed carrier-based system proved to deliver the HA molecule in very small amounts into the systemic circulation. The results endorse the ethosomal carrier-based formulation of HA as a attractive technique for better local bioavailability of HA.

AB  - Background: The role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is unclear. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a signal for NLRP3 inflammasome acti-vation. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether mtROS-dependent NLRP3 inflamma-some activation is involved in HE, using in vivo and in vitro models. Methods: Bile duct ligation (BDL) in C57/BL6 mice was used as an in vivo HE model. NLRP3 activation was assessed in the hippocampus. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to determine the cellular source of NLRP3 in the hippocampal tissue. For the in vitro experiment, BV-2 microglial cells were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by ammonia treatment. NLRP3 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction were measured. Mito-TEMPO was used to suppress mtROS production. Results: BDL mice showed cognitive impairment with hyperammonemia. Both the priming and activation steps of NLRP3 inflammasome activation were processed in the hippocampus of BDL mice. Moreover, intracellular ROS levels increased in the hippo -campus, and NLRP3 was mainly expressed in the microglia of the hippocampus. In LPS-primed BV-2 cells, ammonia treatment induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, with elevation of mtROS and altered mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment with Mito-TEMPO suppressed mtROS production and the subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis under LPS and ammonia treatment in BV-2 cells. Conclusions: Hyperammonemia in HE may be involved in mtROS overproduction and sub-sequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further studies using NLRP3-specific inhibitor or NLRP3 knockout mice are needed to elucidate the important role of NLRP3 inflammasome in HE development.

AB  - Extruded cereals are widely used in swine production because of their highdigestibility and palatability. However, the excessive addition of extrusion cereals can acceleratethe release rate of glucose in the digestive tract of pigs, thus breaking the balance of glucose andamino acids during digestion and absorption. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the effectsof extrusion on the dynamics of starch digestion in cereals can provide an important basis for theregulation and optimization of dietary glucose amino acid release patterns. It was found that bydestroying the inherent micro-structure of cereals, the extrusion treatment reduced the short-rangeorder of starch, increased the proportion of digestible starch, and significantly improved the digestionrate and predicted glycemic index of starch. In this study, three samples were randomly selected from corn, wheat, and broken rice before and after extrusion for electron microscope scanning, Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis, and in vitro digestion to investigate the impact of extrusion on physicochemical characteristics and starch digestion kinetics of cereals. The cereals used for extrusion were sourced identically before and after the process, with each analysis conducted in triplicate. The results showed that the extrusion compromised the physical structure of cereal, resulting in loose structure arrangement, and the ratio of Fourier transform infrared spectral absorbance at wavelength 1047 cm-1 and 1022 cm-1, which characterized the short-range order of starch, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). In addition, the proportion of rapidly digestible starch (RDS), the velocity parameter k of digestive kinetics and the predicted glycemic index of cereals were significantly increased by extrusion (p < 0.05). Digestibility kinetics showed a total increase of 10.7%, 7.3%, and 5.4% for cereals, along with a sharp rise in digestion rate within the first 15 minutes. The findings revealed that the compromising of starch's structural integrity and the increase in proportion of RDS not only enhanced overall starch digestibility, but also significantly accelerated its digestion, particularly during the initial 15 min of intestinal digestion.

AB  - The development of animal models of mental disorders is an important task, since such models are useful for studying the neurobiological mechanisms of psychopathologies and for trial of new therapeutic drugs. One way to model pathologies of the nervous system is to impair fetal neurodevelopment through stress of the pregnant future mother, or prenatal stress. The use of variable frequency ultrasound in rodents is a promising method of imitating psychological stress, to which women in modern society are most often subjected. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of prenatal stress induced by exposure to variable frequency ultrasound (US PS) throughout the gestational period on the adult rat offspring, namely to identify features of behavioral alterations and neurochemical brain parameters that can be associated with certain mental disorders in humans, to determine the possibility of creating a new model of psychopathology. Our study included a study of some behavioral characteristics of male and female rats in the elevated plus maze, open field test, object recognition test, social interaction test, sucrose preference test, latent inhibition test, Morris water maze, forced swimming test, acoustic startle reflex and prepulse inhibition tests. We also determined the activity of the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems in the hippocampus and frontal cortex by HPLC-ED. Concentration of norepinephrine, dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin, and HIAA, as well as DOPAC/dopamine and HIAA/serotonin ratios were determined. A correlation analysis of behavioral and neurochemical parameters in male and female rats was performed based on the data obtained. The results of the study showed that US PS altered the behavioral phenotype of the rat offspring. US PS increased the level of anxious behavior, impaired orientation-research behavior, increased grooming activity, decreased the desire for social contacts, shifted behavioral reactions from social interaction to interaction with inanimate objects, impaired latent inhibition, and decreased the startle reflex. US PS activated the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems of the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. A correlation between neurochemical and behavioral parameters was revealed. Our study showed that US PS leads to a certain dysfunction on behavioral and neurochemical levels in rats that is most closely associated with symptoms of schizophrenia or autism. We hypothesize that this could potentially be an indicator of face validity for a model of psychopathology based on neurodevelopmental impairment.

AB  - Simple Summary In intensive farms, the mortality of newborn piglets during farrowing is a critical aspect that represents a significant cause of economic loss in pig production, and the deaths, representing 5-25% of newborn piglets, depend mainly on starvation and crushing. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effect of lift farrowing crates on piglet mortality by crushing and on sow welfare. Eighty-four sows of the same genetics were observed over three sessions for one year. Twenty-eight sows per session were randomly assigned to a room equipped with conventional crates or lift crates. No primiparous sows were considered in the study to avoid sows unexperienced with the dynamics of lift crates. The farm's veterinarian assessed the number of crushed piglets within 48 h, 72 h, and at weaning. Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) was measured at the entry and the exit from farrowing to evaluate stress level variation. Feet diseases and backfat thickness were evaluated to assess sows' potential diseases induced by lift crates and metabolic problems. The results show that the number of crushed piglets per sow was higher in the conventional crate rooms than the lift crate ones. Mean values of HCC variation in sows during farrowing were significantly different in the two housing systems and higher for the lift crate-housed sows. No significant differences were detected for backfat variation and feet disease scoring. In conclusion, sows housed in the lift crates evidenced an increase in hair cortisol values during farrowing, probably reflecting a higher stress status induced by the lift crate. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effect of lift farrowing crates on piglet mortality by crushing and on sow welfare. Eighty-four sows were considered in the one-year experiment in three monitoring sessions. In each session, 14 sows were housed in a room with conventional crates (CC), and 14 sows were lodged in a room equipped with lift crates (LC). The sows, of the same genetics, with parity ranging from 2 to 9, were randomly distributed in CC and LC rooms. No primiparous sows were considered in the study to avoid sows unexperienced with the dynamics of lift crates. The numbers of crushed piglets, assessed by the farm's veterinarian, within 48 h, 72 h, and at weaning (28th day), were recorded. Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) was measured upon entry and exit from farrowing to evaluate stress level variation. Feet diseases and backfat thickness were evaluated to assess sows' potential diseases induced by lift crates and metabolic problems. The results show that the number of crushed piglets per sow was higher in the CC rooms than in the LC rooms in the first two days after delivery (0.39 vs. 0.15, p < 0.05) and up to weaning (0.50 vs. 0.37; p < 0.05). Mean values of HCC variation in sows during farrowing were significantly different in the two housing systems and higher for the LC sows (0.53 pg/mg vs. 0.22 pg/mg; p < 0.05). No significant differences were detected for backfat variation and feet disease scoring between LC and CC sows. In conclusion, LC sows evidenced an increase in hair cortisol values during farrowing, probably caused by a higher stress status induced by the lift crate, along with the benefit of the higher survival rate of piglets before weaning.

AB  - The regulatory potential of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) FBXL19-AS1 has been highlighted in various cancers, but its effect on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of FBXL19-AS1 in TNBC and its underlying mechanism. RT-qPCR was employed to detect the expressions of FBXL19-AS1 and miR-378a-3p in tissues and cells. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot were utilized to detect the expression levels of proteins. Cell activities were detected using flow cytometry, CCK-8, and transwell assay. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were deployed to investigate interactions of different molecules. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways were used to analyze the downstream pathway. In vivo xenograft model was conducted to detect the effect of FBXL19-AS1 on tumor growth. FBXL19-AS1 was overexpressed in TNBC tissues and cell lines compared with counterparts. FBXL19-AS1 knockdown suppressed TNBC cell activities, whereas its overexpression exhibited the opposite effect. Mechanistically, FBXL19-AS1 was found to interact with miR-378a-3p. Further analysis revealed that miR-378a-3p exerted tumor-suppressive effects in TNBC cells. Additionally, miR-378a-3p targeted and downregulated the expression of ubiquitin aldehyde binding 2 (OTUB2), a deubiquitinase associated with TNBC progression. In vivo experiments substantiated the inhibitory effects of FBXL19-AS1 knockdown on TNBC tumorigenesis, and a miR-378a-3p inhibitor partially rescued these effects. The downstream pathway of the miR-378a-3p/OTUB2 axis was explored, revealing connections with proteins involved in modifying other proteins, removing ubiquitin molecules, and influencing signaling pathways, including the Hippo signaling pathway. Western blot analysis confirmed changes in YAP and TAZ expression levels, indicating a potential regulatory network. In summary, FBXL19-AS1 promotes exacerbation in TNBC by suppressing miR-378a-3p, leading to increased OTUB2 expression. The downstream mechanism may be related to the Hippo signaling pathway. These findings propose potential therapeutic targets for TNBC treatment.

AB  - Oil and protein from silkworm (Bombyx mori var. Leung Pairoj) pupae, by-product from sericulture, were extracted and evaluated for their potential uses as skin biomoisturizer. The silkworm pupae (SWP) oil and protein were simultaneously extracted by using three-phase partitioning (TPP) method and determined for their physicochemical properties including fatty acid and amino acid content, respectively. The highest yields of oil and protein at 8.24 +/- 0.21% and 8.41 +/- 0.26% w/w, respectively were obtained from 18 h extraction. Fatty acid analysis of SWP oil was rich in linolenic acid (37.81 +/- 0.34%), oleic acid (28.97 +/- 0.13%), palmitic acid (21.27 +/- 0.05%), stearic acid (6.60 +/- 0.09%) and linoleic acid (4.73 +/- 0.21%). The clear yellow SWP oil possessed saponification value of 191.51 mg/g, iodine value of 119.37 g I2/g and peroxide value of 2.00 mg equivalent O2/kg. The SWP protein composed of 17 amino acids which aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine and serine were the major residues. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the SWP protein consisted of distinct protein at around 51, 70,175 and over 175 kDa. Cytotoxicity of the SWP oil and protein was evaluated by using MTT assay and they showed low cytotoxicity toward keratinocyte cell (HaCat cell line). The SWP oil provided moisturizing effect on pig skin comparable to olive oil, while 1% and 2% of SWP protein showed higher moisturizing efficacy than 3% hydrolyzed collagen. The study indicated that the SWP oil and protein could be potential biomoisturizers for cosmetic products.

AB  - Background The Hippo pathway plays a critical role in controlled cell proliferation. The tumor suppressor Merlin and large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) mediate activation of Hippo pathway, consequently inhibiting the primary effectors, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid present in the plasma membrane (PM), binds to and activates Merlin. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase a (PIP5Ka) is an enzyme responsible for PIP2 production. However, the functional role of PIP5Ka in regulation of Merlin and LATS1 under Hippo signaling conditions remains unclear.Methods PIP5Ka, Merlin, or LATS1 knockout or knockdown cells and transfected cells with them were used. LATS1, YAP, and TAZ activities were measured using biochemical methods and PIP2 levels were evaluated using cell imaging. Low/high cell density and serum starvation/stimulation conditions were tested. Colocalization of PIP5Ka and PIP2 with Merlin and LATS1, and their protein interactions were examined using transfection, confocal imaging, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, and/or pull-down experiments. Colony formation and adipocyte differentiation assays were performed.Results We found that PIP5Ka induced LATS1 activation and YAP/TAZ inhibition in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, PIP5Ka suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced adipocyte differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, PIP5Ka protein stability and PIP2 levels were elevated at high cell density compared with those at low cell density, and both PIP2 and YAP phosphorylation levels initially declined, then recovered upon serum stimulation. Under these conditions, YAP/TAZ activity was aberrantly regulated by PIP5Ka deficiency. Mechanistically, either Merlin deficiency or LATS1 deficiency abrogated PIP5Ka-mediated YAP/TAZ inactivation. Additionally, the catalytic domain of PIP5Ka directly interacted with the band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin domain of Merlin, and this interaction reinforced interaction of Merlin with LATS1. In accordance with these findings, PIP5Ka and PIP2 colocalized with Merlin and LATS1 in the PM. In PIP5Ka-deficient cells, Merlin colocalization with PIP2 was reduced, and LATS1 solubility increased.Conclusions Collectively, our results support that PIP5Ka serves as an activator of the Hippo pathway through interaction and colocalization with Merlin, which promotes PIP2-dependent Merlin activation and induces local recruitment of LATS1 to the PIP2-rich PM and its activation, thereby negatively regulating YAP/TAZ activity.

AB  - Inhibitory interneurons are pivotal components of cortical circuits. Beyond providing inhibition, they have been proposed to coordinate the firing of excitatory neurons within cell assemblies. While the roles of specific interneuron subtypes have been extensively studied, their influence on pyramidal cell synchrony in vivo remains elusive. Employing an all-optical approach in mice, we simultaneously recorded hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells and probed the network influence of individual interneurons using optogenetics. We demonstrate that CA1 interneurons form a functionally interconnected network that promotes synchrony through disinhibition during awake immobility, while preserving endogenous cell assemblies. Our network model underscores the importance of both cell assemblies and dense, unspecific interneuron connectivity in explaining our experimental findings, suggesting that interneurons may operate not only via division of labor but also through concerted activity.
   Interneurons control the timing of activation of excitatory neurons, but how single interneurons affect synchrony in vivo is unclear. This study shows that CA1 hippocampus interneurons form a functionally connected network that promotes synchrony between pyramidal cells at the single neuron level.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are closely related to many viral infections. However, the molecular mechanism of how miRNAs regulate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection remains unclear. In this study, we first constructed a PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cytopathic model to validate the relationship between miR-129a-3p expression levels and PEDV resistance. Secondly, we explored the effect of miR-129a-3p on PEDV infection by targeting the 3 ' UTR region of the ligand ectodysplasin (EDA) gene. Finally, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the downstream regulatory mechanism of EDA. The results showed that after 48 h of PEDV infection, IPEC-J2 cells showed obvious pathological changes, and miR-129a-3p expression was significantly downregulated (p < 0.01). Overexpression of miR-129a-3p mimics inhibited PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells; silencing endogenous miR-129a-3p can promote viral replication. A dual luciferase assay showed that miR-129a-3p could bind to the 3 ' UTR region of the EDA gene, which significantly reduced the expression level of EDA (p < 0.01). Functional verification showed that upregulation of EDA gene expression significantly promoted PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. Overexpression of miR-129a-3p can activate the caspase activation and recruitment domain 11 (CARD11) mediated NF-kappa B pathway, thus inhibiting PEDV replication. The above results suggest that miR-129a-3p inhibits PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells by activating the NF-kappa B pathway by binding to the EDA 3 ' UTR region. Our results have laid the foundation for in-depth study of the mechanism of miR-129a-3p resistance and its application in porcine epidemic diarrhea disease-resistance breeding.

AB  - Plant leaves are a source of essential phenolic compounds, which have numerous health benefits and can be used in multiple applications. While various techniques are available for recovering bioactive compounds from by-products, more data are needed on enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE). The aim of this study was to compare EAE and solid-liquid extraction (SLE), to evaluate the impact on bioactive compounds' extraction yield, phytochemical composition, and the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antidiabetic properties of Aralia cordata leaves and roots, sea buckthorn Hippophae rhamnoides, and hemp Cannabis sativa leaves. The results indicate that EAE with Viscozyme L enzyme (EAE_Visc) extracts of the tested plant leaves possess the highest yield, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic content. Moreover, the EAE_Visc extract increased by 40% the total sugar content compared to the control extract of A. cordata root. Interestingly, the sea buckthorn leaf extracts exhibited alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, which reached an almost 99% inhibition in all extracts. Furthermore, the sea buckthorn leaves SLE and EAE_Visc extracts possess antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine changes in cell wall morphology after EAE. Overall, this study shows that EAE can be a promising method for increasing the yield and improving the functional properties of the resulting extracts in a fast and sustainable way compared to SLE.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a prevalent inflammatory illness, affects a sizeable portion of the global population. An important component of the upper respiratory system, nitric oxide (NO) controls inflammatory responses and functions as an antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agent. The enzymes arginase (ARG) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), whose activity has been linked to a range of respiratory disorders, generate NO. N-acetylcysteine has demonstrated potential as a CRS treatment option. The present study aimed to evaluate the levels of iNOS, ARG, and constitutive isoforms of NO-synthase in sinonasal fluid at multiple time points after surgery. Significant differences were observed in the levels of iNOS, ARG, and constitutive isoforms of NO-synthase between the two groups after treatment. The experimental group, receiving topical N-acetylcysteine, exhibited increased iNOS activity on the 3rd day, followed by a decline on days 10 and 28. Similarly, ARG activity increased on day 3rd in both groups but was lower in the experimental group at later time points. The findings suggest that NO-related enzymes, particularly iNOS and ARG, play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of chronic result in more focused and efficient therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Lidocaine toxicity is caused by unintended intravascular injection or overdose. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The objective was to investigate if the administration of rifampin could accelerate animal recovery and reduce the symptoms of lidocaine toxicity by induction of the CYP3A4. Thirty-six male rats were divided into control and treatment groups, each containing three subgroups. The treatment group received oral rifampin suspension daily for 1 week. In all rats, 2.00% lidocaine was injected intravenously. The first subgroup was monitored for neurological symptoms. In the second subgroup, data were recorded after the electrode was placed in the right hippocampus. Electrocardiograms were taken from the third subgroup. CYP3A4 was measured using an ELISA kit. Neurological recovery was seen after 22 and 15 min in the control and treatment groups, respectively. Rifampin also caused a significant reduction in amplitude and number of field action potentials compared to the control group. Numerous cardiac arrhythmias were observed in the control group. The mean level of CYP3A4 in the treatment group was significantly higher than in the control group. In conclusion, oral rifampin could increase the synthesis of CYP3A4, therefore, the animal recovery from lidocaine toxicity was accelerated.(c) 2023 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated neuronal and microglial Fyn, a Src family kinase (SFK), and how its interactions with tau contribute to epileptogenesis. Saracatinib, a Fyn/SFK inhibitor, modifies disease progression in rat kainate (KA) epilepsy models. In this study, we investigated neuronal-specific fyn knockdown effects on Fyn-tau signaling, neurodegeneration, and gliosis using a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-promoter-driven adeno-associated viral vector (AAV9)-mediated fyn-shRNA injection in the rat hippocampus. Eight days following AAV administration, rats received repeated low-dose KA injections intraperitoneally to induce status epilepticus (SE). Both fyn-shRNA and control groups showed comparable SE severity, indicating inadequate neuronal fyn knockdown at this timepoint. Two weeks post fyn-shRNA injection, hippocampal Fyn significantly decreased, alongside reductions in NR2B, pNR2BY1472, PSD95, and total tau. There was also a compensatory activation of SFK (pSFKY416:Fyn) and tau hyperphosphorylation (AT8:total tau), negatively correlating with NeuN expression. Proximity ligation assay indicated unchanged Fyn-tau interactions, suggesting tau interactions with alternative SH3 domain proteins. Persistent neuronal loss, astrogliosis, and microgliosis suggested limited effectiveness of neuronal-specific fyn knockdown at this timepoint. An extended-duration fyn knockdown study, or using broad SFK inhibitors such as saracatinib or tau-SH3 blocking peptides, may effectively prevent SE-induced epileptogenesis.

AB  - People travel to high-altitude regions as tourists, workers, and military personnel on duty. Despite the consistent 21% oxygen content in the atmosphere, ascending to higher altitudes results in a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen, inducing a state known as hypobaric hypoxia (HH). HH is an environmental stress that is responsible for neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits (anxiety, depression, mood disturbance, etc.), but little is known about its metabolic pathways. The kynurenine pathway (KP) is a promising candidate to uncover the mysteries of HH stress, as it is an important regulator of the immune system and is associated with behavioral deficits. To investigate the role of KP under HH, the levels of KP metabolites in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue (prefrontal cortex-PFC, neocortex, and hippocampus) of male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to HH at 7620 m for 1, 3, and 7 days were estimated utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The behavioral analogs for anxiety-like and depression-like behavior were assessed using the open field test and forced swim test, respectively. Upon HH exposure, crosstalk between the periphery and central nervous system and KP metabolite region-dependent differential expression in the brain were observed. KP metabolites showed a positive correlation with behavioral parameters. The results of our study are indicative that KP can be proposed as the etiology of behavioral deficits, and KP metabolite levels in serum or CSF can be used as plausible markers for anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors under HH stress with a scope of targeted therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Leptin (LEP) can cross the blood-brain barrier and facilitate cross-talk between the adipose tissue and central nerve system (CNS). This study aimed to investigate the effect of 8-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the LEP signaling in the hippocampus of rats with type 2 diabetes. 20 rats were randomly divided into four groups: (i) control (Con), (ii) type 2 diabetes (T2D), (iii) exercise (EX), and (iv) type 2 diabetes + exercise (T2D + EX). The rats in the T2D and T2D + EX were fed a high-fat diet for two months, then a single dose of STZ (35 mg/kg) was injected to induce diabetes. The EX and T2D + EX groups performed 4-10 intervals of treadmill running at 80-100% of V-max. Serum and hippocampal levels of LEP as well as hippocampal levels of LEP receptors (LEP-R), Janus kinase 2 (JAK-2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3), activated protein kinase (AMP-K), proxy zoster receptor alpha (PGC-1 alpha), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), Beta-Amyloid (A beta), Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta (GSK3 beta), and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (TAU) were measured. One-way ONOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests were used to analyze the data. Serum and hippocampal levels of LEP as well as hippocampal levels of LEP-R, JAK-2, STAT-3, AMP-K, PGC1 alpha, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR were increased while hippocampal levels of BACE1, GSK3B, TAU, and A beta were decreased in T2D + EX compared with T2D group. Serum LEP and hippocampal levels of LEP, LEP-R, JAK-2, STAT-3, AMP-K, PGC1a, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR were decreased. Conversely hippocampal levels of BACE1, GSK3B, TAU, and A beta were increased in T2D group compared with CON group. HIIT could improve LEP signaling in the hippocampus of rats with type 2 diabetes and decrease the accumulation of Tau and A beta, which may reduce the risk of memory impairments.

AB  - The vast majority of excitatory synapses are formed on small dendritic protrusions termed dendritic spines. Dendritic spines vary in size and density that are crucial determinants of excitatory synaptic transmission. Aberrations in spine morphogenesis can compromise brain function and have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Actin filaments (F-actin) are the major structural component of dendritic spines, and therefore, actin-binding proteins (ABP) that control F-actin dis-/assembly moved into the focus as critical regulators of brain function. Studies of the past decade identified the ABP cofilin1 as a key regulator of spine morphology, synaptic transmission, and behavior, and they emphasized the necessity for a tight control of cofilin1 to ensure proper brain function. Here, we report spine enrichment of cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), a conserved multidomain protein with largely unknown physiological functions. Super-resolution microscopy and live cell imaging of CAP1-deficient hippocampal neurons revealed impaired synaptic F-actin organization and dynamics associated with alterations in spine morphology. Mechanistically, we found that CAP1 cooperates with cofilin1 in spines and that its helical folded domain is relevant for this interaction. Moreover, our data proved functional interdependence of CAP1 and cofilin1 in control of spine morphology. In summary, we identified CAP1 as a novel regulator of the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton that is essential for synaptic cofilin1 activity.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress increase susceptibility to neurodegeneration and other age-related pathologies. We have previously demonstrated that an infusion prepared from Pulicaria incisa (Pi) has protective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative effects in glial cells. However, the neuroprotective activities of Pi infusion in cultured neurons and aging mice have never been studied. In the following study, the effects of Pi infusion were explored in a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress model in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Profiling of the infusion by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and aucubin as some of its main constituents. H2O2-induced ROS accumulation and caspase 3 activity decreased SH-SY5Y viability and were prevented upon the pretreatment of cells with Pi infusion. Additionally, the Pi infusion upregulated cellular levels and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as well as the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Aging mice treated daily for 18 months with Pi infusion exhibited reduced neuronal cell death in the hippocampus as compared to age-matched controls. We, therefore, propose Pi infusion as a candidate regulator of oxidative stress in the brain.

AB  - Hydrogels of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/sodium alginate (SA), and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were prepared by solvent casting in the absence and in the presence of magnets, in order to obtain MNPs distributed randomly (PVA/SA-rMNP) and magnetically oriented MNPs (PVA/SA-gMNP) in the polymer matrix. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) techniques were used to evaluate the topography and to map the distribution of magnetic domains in the polymer matrix, respectively. The tip-surface distance (lift distance) of 50 nm during the MFM analyses facilitated the mapping of magnetic domains because the van der Waals forces were minimized. The magnetic signal stemming from clusters of MNPs were more easily identified than that from isolated MNPs. PVA and SA, PVA/SA, PVA/SA-rMNP, and PVA/SA-gMNP coatings with surface roughness (R-a) values of 3.8 nm, 28.7 nm, and 49.8 nm, respectively, were tested for the proliferation of mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells. While PVA/SA, PVA/SA-rMNP, and PVA/SA-gMNP coatings preserved cell viability >70% in comparison to the control (plastic plate) over 48 h, cell proliferation tended to decrease on surfaces with higher R-a values (PVA/SA-gMNP). These findings showed that the orientation of magnetic domains led to an increase of surface roughness, which decreased the viability of HT-22 cells. Thus, these results might be interesting for situations, where the control of cell proliferation is necessary.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders stemming from maternal immune activation can significantly affect a child's life. A major limitation in pre-clinical studies is the scarcity of valid animal models that accurately mimic these challenges. Among the available models, administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to pregnant females is a widely used paradigm. Previous studies have reported that a model of 'emotional stress', involving chronic exposure of rodents to ultrasonic frequencies, induces neuroinflammation, aberrant neuroplasticity, and behavioral deficits. In this study, we explored whether this model is a suitable paradigm for maternal stress and promotes neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the offspring of stressed females. Pregnant dams were exposed to ultrasound stress for 21 days. A separate group was injected with LPS on embryonic days E11.5 and E12.5 to mimic prenatal infection. The behavior of the dams and their female offspring was assessed using the sucrose test, open field test, and elevated plus maze. Additionally, the three-chamber sociability test and Barnes maze were used in the offspring groups. ELISA and qPCR were used to examine pro-inflammatory changes in the blood and hippocampus of adult females. Ultrasound-exposed adult females developed a depressive-like syndrome, hippocampal overexpression of GSK-3 & beta;, IL-1 & beta;, and IL-6 and increased serum concentrations of IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, IL-17, RANTES, and TNF & alpha;. The female offspring also displayed depressive-like behavior, as well as cognitive deficits. These abnormalities were comparable to the behavioral changes induced by LPS. The ultrasound stress model can be a promising animal paradigm of neurodevelopmental pathology associated with prenatal 'emotional stress'.

AB  - Zinc is an essential trace element, and its deficiency causes taste dysfunction. Zinc accumulates in zinc trans-porter (ZnT)3-expressing presynaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons and acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. However, the distribution of zinc and its role as a signal transmitter in taste buds remain unknown. Therefore, we examined the distribution of zinc and expression profiles of ZnT3 in taste cells and evaluated zinc release from isolated taste cells upon taste stimuli. Taste cells with a spindle or pyriform mor-phology were revealed by staining with the fluorescent zinc dye ZnAF-2DA and autometallography in the taste buds of rat circumvallate papillae. Znt3 mRNA levels were detected in isolated taste buds. ZnT3-immunoreac-tivity was found in phospholipase-beta 2-immunopositive type II taste cells and aromatic amino acid decarboxy-lase-immunopositive type III cells but not in nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2-immunopositive type I cells. Moreover, we examined zinc release from taste cells using human transient receptor potential A1-overexpressing HEK293 as zinc-sensor cells. These cells exhibited a clear response to isolated taste cells exposed to taste stimuli. However, pretreatment with magnesium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, an extracel-lular zinc chelator -but not with zinc-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, used as a negative control -significantly decreased the response ratio of zinc-sensor cells. These findings suggest that taste cells release zinc to the inter-cellular area in response to taste stimuli and that zinc may affect signaling within taste buds.

AB  - Multivalent live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines are often used to control the bovine viral diarrhea disease (BVD). Still, they retain inherent disadvantages and do not provide the expected protection. This study developed a new vaccine prototype, including the external segment of the E2 viral protein from five different subgenotypes selected after a massive screening. The E2 proteins of every subgenotype (1aE2, 1bE2, 1cE2, 1dE2, and 1eE2) were produced in mammalian cells and purified by IMAC. An equimolar mixture of E2 proteins formulated in an oil-in-water adjuvant made up the vaccine candidate, inducing a high humoral response at 50, 100, and 150 mu g doses in sheep. A similar immune response was observed in bovines at 50 mu g. The cellular response showed a significant increase in the transcript levels of relevant Th1 cytokines, while those corresponding to the Th2 cytokine IL-4 and the negative control were similar. High levels of neutralizing antibodies against the subgenotype BVDV1a demonstrated the effectiveness of our vaccine candidate, similar to that observed in the sera of animals vaccinated with the commercial vaccine. These results suggest that our vaccine prototype could become an effective recombinant vaccine against the BVD.

AB  - This study examines the biological synthesis of gold nanoparticles using Camellia sinensis L. (green tea) and their cytotoxicity against human PC-3 prostate cancer cells. The green tea extract-mediated biogenic synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GT-AuNPs) via green tea extract synthesis was validated using UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, EDS, TEM, DLS, and XRD techniques. Additionally, the tetrazolium assay was utilized to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of GT-AuNPs generated by biosynthesis. The findings suggest that the biosynthesized GT-AuNPs reduced PC-3 cell proliferation with an IC50 of 19.71 g/mL during 24 h. These findings imply that GT-AuNPs exert their anti-proliferative action on the PC-3 cell line by inhibiting growth, decreasing DNA synthesis, and triggering apoptosis. After treatment, morphological examination of PC-3 cells exhibited surface detachment, cell shrinkage, and cell body distortion, indicating that GT-AuNPs had a cytotoxic effect on PC-3 cells.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in obese patients remains challenging. Recent studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of TNBC and malignancies. Through multiomic analysis and experimental validation, a dysfunctional Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit H (EIF3H)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) proteolytic axis is identified as a pivotal junction mediating the interplay between cancer-associated adipocytes and the response to anti-cancer drugs in TNBC. Mechanistically, cancer-associated adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in an upregulated hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This aberrant upregulation of HBP promotes YAP O-GlcNAcylation and the subsequent recruitment of EIF3H deubiquitinase, which stabilizes YAP, thus promoting tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. It is found that Retatrutide, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits HBP and YAP O-GlcNAcylation leading to increased YAP degradation through the deprivation of EIF3H-mediated deubiquitylation of YAP. In preclinical models of obese TNBC, Retatrutide downregulates HBP, decreases YAP protein levels, and consequently decreases tumor size and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. This effect is particularly pronounced in obese mice bearing TNBC tumors. Overall, these findings reveal a critical interplay between adipocyte-mediated metabolic reprogramming and EIF3H-mediated YAP proteolytic control, offering promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on TNBC progression.

AB  - Primary cultures of neural cells are important key tools for basic and translational neuroscience research. These primary cell cultures are classically generated from the rodent brain hippocampus or cortex and optimized for enrichment in neurons at the expense of glial cells. Importantly, considerable differences exist in neuronal cell populations and in glial cell contribution between different brain regions. Because many basic and translational research projects aim to identify mechanisms underlying brainstem neuronal networks that affect major vital functions, primary cultures representative of cell populations present in the hindbrain are required. However, the preparation of primary cultures of brainstem/hindbrain neurons is scarcely described in the literature, limiting the possibilities for studying the development and physiology of these brain regions in vitro. The present report describes a reliable protocol to dissociate and culture in vitro embryonic mouse fetal hindbrain neurons in a defined culture medium, while control of astrocytes' expansion was attained by using a chemically defined, serum-free supplement, namely CultureOne (TM). The neuronal cells maintained according to this protocol differentiate and, by 10 days in vitro, they develop extensive axonal and dendritic branching. Using immunofluorescence, we further characterized the different cell populations and neuronal subtypes. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrate the excitable nature of these neurons, while colocalization of pre- and postsynaptic neuronal markers showed that neurons form mature synapses, suggesting the establishment of functional networks in vitro. The cultures produced by this method show excellent reproducibility and can be used for molecular, biochemical, and physiological analyses, as illustrated here for tamoxifen-induced Cre recombination in genetically-modified neural cells.

AB  - The master epigenetic regulator lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300/CBP plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. Recent evidence has shown that in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), the expression level and function of p300/CBP are severely compromised, leading to altered gene expression causing pathological conditions. Here, we show that p300/CBP activation by a small-molecule TTK21, conjugated to carbon nanosphere (CSP) ameliorates A beta-impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation, theta burst stimulation, and synaptic tagging/capture (STC). This functional rescue was correlated with CSP-TTK21-induced changes in transcription and translation. Mechanistically, we observed that the expression of a large number of synaptic plasticity- and memory-related genes was rescued, presumably by the restoration of p300/CBP mediated acetylation. Collectively, these results suggest that small-molecule activators of p300/CBP could be a potential therapeutic molecule for neurodegenerative diseases like AD.

AB  - Background: Gintonin is a new material of ginseng that acts through the ginseng-derived lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand. The gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) inhibits amyloid plaque accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus, improves cognitive dysfunction by increasing acetylcholine levels, and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the effect of the GEF on the cognitive performance of subjects with subjective memory impairment (SMI). Methods: In this eight-week, randomized, assessor- and participant-blinded, placebo-controlled study, participants with SMI were assigned to three groups receiving placebo, GEF 300 mg/day or GEF 600 mg/ day. The Korean versions of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (K-ADAS), Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and Stroop color-word test (K-SCWT) were also evaluated along with the safety profiles. Results: One hundred thirty-six participants completed the study. After eight weeks, we analyzed intergroup differences in primary or secondary outcome score changes. When we compared the GEF group with the placebo group, we observed significant improvements in the K-ADAS and K-SCWT scores. The GEF group did not show a significant improvement in K-MMSE and BDI scores compared to the placebo group. No adverse events were observed in the gintonin and placebo groups for eight weeks. Conclusion: The GEF is safe and effective in improving subjective cognitive impairment related to both the K-ADAS and K-SCWT in this study. However, further large-scale and randomized controlled studies are warranted to secure other cognitive function tests besides the K-ADAS and K-SCWT, and to confirm the findings of the current study.

AB  - Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) has been characterized as an oncogene promoting the progression of various tumors. The role of AEG-1 in neurological diseases was highlighted by recent researches. However, the physiological function of AEG-1 remains elusive. Our study aimed to investigate the physiological role of AEG-1 in the central nervous system by generating a mouse model with specific deletion of Aeg-1 in the hippocampus and neocortex (Aeg-1fl/flCre+ mice). Behavioral assessments revealed that Aeg-1 deficiency caused impaired learning and memory capabilities in juvenile and adult mice. Depressive-like behaviors were also observed in Aeg-1fl/flCre+ mice. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses indicated that AEG-1 was involved in the neuronal morphogenesis. Interestingly, Aeg-1 knockout was irrelevant to the neuron loss but reduced the dendritic length and the dendritic spines density in hippocampus. Electrophysiological analyses showed a decreased response of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and a compromised efficiency of excitatory synaptic transmission following Aeg-1 deletion in hippocampus. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Aeg-1 deficiency in the hippocampus and neocortex leads to learning and memory impairments and depression in mice, which is mediated by the abnormalities of neuronal morphology and the impaired synaptic functions.

AB  - Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), the second most common primary liver cancer, is a fatal malignancy with a poor prognosis and only very limited therapeutic options. Although molecular targeted therapy is emerged as a promising treatment strategy, resistance to molecular-targeted therapy occurs inevitably, which represents a major clinical challenge. In this study, we confirmed that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is the most significantly affected pathways in ICC. As a novel phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR dual inhibitor, BEZ235, exerts antitumour activity by effectively and specifically blocking the dysfunctional activation of the PI3K/serine/threonine kinase (AKT)/mTOR pathway. We generate the orthotopic ICC mouse model through hydrodynamic transfection of AKT and yes-associated protein (YAP) plasmids into the mouse liver. Our study confirmed that BEZ235 can suppress the proliferation, invasion and colony conformation abilities of ICC cells in vitro but cannot effectively inhibit ICC progression in vivo. Inhibition of PI3K/mTOR allowed upregulation of c-Myc and YAP through suppressed the phosphorylation of LATS1. It would be a novel mechanism that mediated resistance to PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. However, Bromo- and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibition by JQ1 downregulates c-Myc and YAP transcription, which could enhance the efficacy of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. The efficacy results of combination therapy exhibited effective treatment on ICC in vitro and in vivo. Our data further confirmed that the combination of PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor and BET inhibition induces M1 polarization and suppresses M2 polarization in macrophages by regulating the expression of HIF-1 alpha. Our study provides a novel and efficient therapeutic strategy in treating primary ICC.

AB  - The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) plays a major role in fast inhibitory synaptic transmission and is highly regulated by the neuromodulator dopamine. In this aspect, most of the attention has been focused on the classical intracellular signaling cascades following dopamine G-protein-coupled receptor activation. Interestingly, the GABA(A)R and dopamine D5 receptor (D5R) have been shown to physically interact in the hippocampus, but whether a functional cross-talk occurs is still debated. In the present study, we use a combination of imaging and single nanoparticle tracking in live hippocampal neurons to provide evidence that GABA(A)Rs and D5Rs form dynamic surface clusters. Disrupting the GABA(A)R-D5R interaction with a competing peptide leads to an increase in the diffusion coefficient and the explored area of both receptors, and a drop in immobile synaptic GABA(A)Rs. By means of patch-clamp recordings, we show that this fast lateral redistribution of surface GABA(A)Rs correlates with a robust depression in the evoked GABAergic currents. Strikingly, it also shifts in time the expression of long-term potentiation at glutamatergic synapses. Together, our data both set the plasma membrane as the primary stage of a functional interplay between GABA(A)R and D5R, and uncover a non-canonical role in regulating synaptic transmission.

AB  - The Hippo-YAP pathway serves as a central signalling hub in epithelial tissue generation and homeostasis. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is an essential downstream transcription cofactor of this pathway, with its activity being negatively regulated by Hippo kinase-mediated phosphorylation, leading to its cytoplasmic translocation or degradation. Our recent study showed phospho-YAP complexes with Desmoglein-3 (Dsg3), the desmosomal cadherin known to be required for junction assembly and cell-cell adhesion. In this study, we show that YAP inhibition by Verteporfin (VP) caused a significant downregulation of desmosomal genes and a remarkable reduction in desmosomal proteins, including the Dsg3/phospho-YAP complex, resulting in attenuation of cell cohesion. We also found the desmosomal genes, along with E-cadherin, were the YAP-TEAD transcriptional targets and Dsg3 regulated key Hippo components, including WWTR1/TAZ, LATS2 and the key desmosomal molecules. Furthermore, Dsg3 and phospho-YAP exhibited coordinated regulation in response to varied cell densities and culture durations. Overexpression of Dsg3 could compensate for VP mediated loss of adhesion components and proper architecture of cell junctions. Thus, our findings suggest that Dsg3 plays a crucial role in the Hippo network and regulates junction configuration via complexing with phospho-YAP.

AB  - Exogenously administered human serum butyrylcholinesterase (Hu BChE) affords protection by binding to organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents and pesticides in circulation. The resulting Hu BChE-OP conjugate undergoes 'aging' and the conjugate circulates until cleared from the body. Thus, we evaluated the effects of Hu BChE-OP conjugates on the general health and operant behavior of macaques. Rhesus macaques trained to perform a six-item serial probe recognition (SPR) task were administered 30 mg/kg of Hu BChE-soman conjugate (n = 4) or Hu BChE-VX conjugate (n = 4) by intramuscular injection. Performance on the SPR task was evaluated at 60-90 min after conjugate administration and daily thereafter for the next 4 weeks. Diazepam (3.2 mg/kg), a positive control, was administered 5 weeks after conjugate administration and performance on the SPR task was evaluated as before. Blood collected throughout the study was analyzed for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BChE activities. Residual BChE activity of conjugates displayed a similar pharmacokinetic profile as free Hu BChE. Neither of the Hu BChE-OP conjugates produced clear or pronounced degradations in performance on the SPR task. In contrast, diazepam clearly impaired performance on the SPR task on the day of administration in 7 of 8 macaques (and sometimes longer). Taken together, these results suggest that Hu BChE-OP conjugates are safe and provide further support for the development of Hu BChE as a bioscavenger for use in humans.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a chronic, recurrent, and potentially life-threatening mental disorder that severely impacts both psychological and physiological health. Allii Macrostemonis Bulbus (AMB), a traditional Chinese medicinal and edible plant, is believed to be beneficial for mood regulation. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated its total saponins' antidepressant effects, though the specific active substances and pathways remain unclear.We first established an in vitro model of hippocampal neuronal injury in mice induced by Glu and conducted preliminary screening of different polarity fractions of AMB's total saponins, identifying spirostanol-type saponins (AMBN-90) with antidepressant potential. We then analyzed the components and used network pharmacology to predict the targets and pathways of AMBN-90's antidepressant effects. Next, we established an in vivo mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress and treated it with AMBN-90 for 6 weeks. Behavioral tests, hippocampal HE staining, and monoamine level measurements in the hippocampus were used to verify AMBN-90's antidepressant effects. Subsequently, Western blotting and molecular docking methods were employed to preliminarily reveal AMBN-90's potential antidepressant mechanisms. Results showed that AMBN-90 exhibited significant neuroprotective activity in vitro. In vivo, AMBN-90 significantly improved weight loss and depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress, ameliorated hippocampal neuronal damage, and significantly increased levels of 5-HT, DA, and NE in the hippocampus. It also elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and reduced neuronal apoptosis by activating the PKA-CREB-BDNF pathway. Molecular docking showed that components of AMBN-90 have superior affinity for the upstream proteins of the pathway, C-type G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our findings suggest that steroidal saponins in AMB may be developed as functional foods and drugs for alleviating depression.

AB  - Camellia japonica is a plant species with high cultural and biological relevance. Besides being used as an ornamental plant species, C. japonica has relevant biological properties. Due to hybridization, thousands of cultivars are known, and their accurate identification is mandatory. Infrared spectroscopy is currently recognized as an accurate and rapid technique for species and/or subspecies identifications, including in plants. However, selecting proper analysis tools (spectra pre-processing, feature selection, and chemometric models) highly impacts the accuracy of such identifications. This study tests the impact of two distinct machine learning-based approaches for discriminating C. japonica cultivars using near-infrared (NIR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies. Leaves infrared spectra (NIR-obtained in a previous study; FTIR-obtained herein) of 15 different C. japonica cultivars (38 plants) were modeled and analyzed via different machine learning-based approaches (Approach 1 and Approach 2), each combining a feature selection method plus a classifier application. Regarding Approach 1, NIR spectroscopy emerged as the most effective technique for predicting C. japonica cultivars, achieving 81.3% correct cultivar assignments. However, Approach 2 obtained the best results with FTIR spectroscopy data, achieving a perfect 100.0% accuracy in cultivar assignments. When comparing both approaches, Approach 2 also improved the results for NIR data, increasing the correct cultivar predictions by nearly 13%. The results obtained in this study highlight the importance of chemometric tools in analyzing infrared data. The choice of a specific data analysis approach significantly affects the accuracy of the technique. Moreover, the same approach can have varying impacts on different techniques. Therefore, it is not feasible to establish a universal data analysis approach, even for very similar datasets from comparable analytical techniques.

AB  - Simple Summary Using automated approaches to investigate feeding behavior in broilers provides accurate, non-invasive, and large-scale data collection, real-time monitoring capabilities, and opportunities for advanced data analysis that would not be possible with manual observations. These benefits contribute to a better understanding of broilers' behavior for improving production efficiency and animal welfare, optimizing management practices, and promoting the profitability of poultry production. Hence, this study aimed to estimate the feeding time of individual broilers through an automated approach. First, the proposed algorithm detected the broilers' heads. Then, a Euclidean distance-based tracking algorithm tracked the detected heads. The developed algorithm can estimate the broiler's feeding time by identifying whether its head is inside the feeder area. The overall accuracy of each broiler's feeding time per visit to the feeding pan was 87.3%. Feeding behavior is one of the critical welfare indicators of broilers. Hence, understanding feeding behavior can provide important information regarding the usage of poultry resources and insights into farm management. Monitoring poultry behaviors is typically performed based on visual human observation. Despite the successful applications of this method, its implementation in large poultry farms takes time and effort. Thus, there is a need for automated approaches to overcome these challenges. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the feeding time of individual broilers by a convolutional neural network-based model. To achieve the goal of this research, 1500 images collected from a poultry farm were labeled for training the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to detect the broilers' heads. A Euclidean distance-based tracking algorithm was developed to track the detected heads, as well. The developed algorithm estimated the broiler's feeding time by recognizing whether its head is inside the feeder. Three 1-min labeled videos were applied to evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance. The algorithm achieved an overall feeding time estimation accuracy of each broiler per visit to the feeding pan of 87.3%. In addition, the obtained results prove that the proposed algorithm can be used as a real-time tool in poultry farms.

AB  - The basic objective of this study was to examine the possible effects of treadmill exercise on obesity-related sexual behavior disorder in obese male rats and the role of kisspeptin in this effect. The rats were separated from their mothers at the age of 3 weeks, and classified into four groups as Control (C): normal diet-sedentary group, Exercise (E): normal diet-exercise group, Obese (O): high-fat diet-sedentary group, Obese + Exercise (O+E): high-fat diet-exercise grouSexual behavioral testing was conducted in the rats. At the end of the study, brain samples were taken from the animals for gene expression analyses. The treadmill exercise caused a significant increase in the O+E Group compared to the O Group in kisspeptin and kiss1R gene expression and in EF, ML, IL, MF, IF, III, EL, PEI, IR1, MFT, IFT, IRT sexual behavior parameters (p<0.05), and a significant decrease in ML, IL, III, EL sexual behavior parameters (p<0.05). Treadmill exercise caused a significant decrease in EF, ML, IL, MF, IF, III, EL, PEI, IR1, MFT, IFT, IRT sexual behavior parameters and kisspeptin and kiss1R gene expression in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and corpus striatum in E Group compared to C Group (p<0.05), and a significant increase in ML, IL, III, EL sexual behavior parameters (p<0.05). Based on this effect, we believe that it is caused by an increase in kisspeptin and kiss1R expression in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and corpus striatum. In conclusion, treadmill exerciseinduced kisspeptin secretion may increase GnRH secretion and cause hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis activation and ameliorative effect on deteriorated sexual function.

AB  - Context: Fruits of Forsythia suspensa Vahl (Oleaceae) and seeds of Cassia obtusifolia Linne (Caesalpinaceae) have been used to treat inflammation in Asia.
   Objective: We examined the alleviation of memory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats fed Forsythiae Fructus (FF) and Cassiae Semen water extracts (CS) and investigated the mechanisms responsible for the effects.
   Materials and methods: Thirty Sprague-Dawley male rats had hippocampal infusions of amyloid-beta((25-35)) (AD rats; memory deficit), and ten rats were infused with amyloid-beta((35-25)) (non-AD rats; no memory deficit). For eight weeks, all rats freely consumed high-fat diets (43% lard) incorporated with 200 mg/kg body weight assigned aqueous herbal extracts: AD-FF, AD-CS, or without extracts AD-CON (control), non-AD (normal-control).
   Results: Memory impairment was prevented in the AD-FF (0.54 +/- 0.06-fold) and the AD-CS rats (0.33 +/- 0.04-fold) compared to the AD-CON by inhibiting amyloid-beta deposition to the levels less than one-fourth of the AD-CON group. The hippocampal pAkt -> pGSK -> 3 beta -> pFOXO1 pathway was attenuated by approximately 3.25-fold in the AD-CON, while AD-FF prevented the attenuation better than AD-CS. The relative intensity of hippocampal tau protein based on beta-actin was suppressed with AD-FF (0.68 +/- 0.09) and AD-CS (0.96 +/- 0.81), compared to AD-CON (1.19 +/- 0.13). AD decreased the abundance of Bacteroidales by 34.2% and Lactobacillales by 23.8% and increased Clostridiales by 181% while the AD-FF, but not the AD-CS, normalised the gut microbiota changes to be similar to the non-AD.
   Discussion and conclusions: FF improved memory deficits better than CS in an AD-induced rat model. The potential neuroprotective benefits of FF against AD may be applicable to human AD therapy with additional clinical research.

AB  - ObjectiveRegulatory Factor X (RFX) transcription factors have been implicated in different cancers. Ras association domain family (RASSF) has been shown clinical significance in lung cancer. This paper was to investigate the interaction of RFX2 and RASSF1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsThe transcriptome differences of LUAD patients in GSE32863, GSE43458, and GSE21933 datasets were analyzed. A-549 and NCI-H358 cell lines after overexpression of RFX2 were co-cultured with activated CD8+ T cells, and the release of IFN-gamma, GZMB, PRF1 by CD8+ T cells, and PD-L1 in the LUAD cells were detected. Cell viability, invasion, and apoptosis were analyzed by CCK-8, Transwell, and TUNEL assays. Dual-luciferase assay and ChIP were conducted to detect the interaction between RFX2 and RASSF1 promoter. An in vivo tumor model was constructed to monitor tumor growth. YAP protein levels and phosphorylation were measured. A-549 and NCI-H358 cells treated with DMSO or PY-60 after RFX2 overexpression were co-cultured with activated CD8+ T cells.ResultsRFX2 was notably downregulated in LUAD. RFX2 overexpression increased infiltrating CD8+ T cells within transplanted tumors and inhibited immune escape, proliferation, and invasion of LUAD cells. RFX2 was enriched in the RASSF1 promoter, and RFX2 activated RASSF1 transcription by binding to the RASSF1 promoter. RASSF1 knockdown reversed the ability of RFX2 overexpression to inhibit immune escape. RFX2 depletion downregulated RASSF1, which reduced YAP phosphorylation, thus affecting the Hippo pathway to promote the immune escape.ConclusionRFX2 Loss in LUAD downregulates RASSF1 expression and YAP phosphorylation, thereby promoting immune escape through Hippo signaling.

AB  - Hypertension is associated with blood-brain barrier alteration and brain function decline. Previously, we established the 2-kidney,1-clip (2K1C) hypertensive mice model by renin-angiotensin system (RAS) stimulating. We found that 2K1C-induced hypertension would impair hippocampus-related memory function and decrease adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Even though large studies have investigated the mechanism of hypertension affecting brain function, there remains a lack of efficient ways to halt this vicious effect. The previous study indicated that running exercise ameliorates neurogenesis and spatial memory function in aging mice. Moreover, studies showed that exercise could normalize RAS activity, which might be associated with neurogenesis impairment. Thus, we hypothesize that running exercise could ameliorate neurogenesis and spatial memory function impairment in the 2K1C-hypertension mice. In this study, we performed 2K1C surgery on eight-weeks-old C57BL/6 mice and put them on treadmill exercise one month after the surgery. The results indicate that running exercise improves the spatial memory and neurogenesis impairment of the 2K1C-mice. Moreover, running exercise normalized the activated RAS and blood-brain barrier leakage of the hippocampus, although the blood pressure was not decreased. In conclusion, running exercise could halt hypertension-induced brain impairment through RAS normalization.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an important pathogen harming the global pig industry. Vaccines available for swine cannot protect against PRV completely. Furthermore, no antiviral drugs are available to treat PRV infections. Rehmmannia glutinosa polysaccharide (RGP) possesses several medicinal properties. However, its antiviral activity is not reported. In the present study, we found that RGP can inhibit PRV/XJ5 infection by western blotting, immunofluorescent assay (IFA), and TCID50 assay quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We revealed RGP can inhibit virus adsorption and invasion into PK-15 cells in a dose-dependent manner via western blotting, IFA, TCID50 assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and suppressed PRV/XJ5 replication through western blotting, and qPCR. Additionally, it also reduced PRV/XJ5-induced ROS, lipid oxidation, and improved SOD levels in PK-15 cells, which was observed by using corresponding test kits. To conclude, our findings suggest that RGP might be a novel therapeutic agent for preventing and controlling PRV infection and antioxidant agent.

AB  - Objective: This research aimed to evaluate the effects of hypoxia at different altitudes and durations on the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in rat tissues. Methods: A total of 72 Wistar rats were used to investigate the effect of hypoxia at different durations on rat tissues and 72 Wistar rats were used to investigate the effect of hypoxia at different altitudes. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining was performed to observe the pathological changes of hippocampus tissues, and the expression of HIF-1 alpha of rats under conditions of hypoxia was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Results: According to the pathological results, we found that the degree of the brain, lung, and heart damage and HIF-1 alpha expression, showed an increasing trend as the altitude (1,500, 3,000, 4,500, 6,000, 7,500, and 8,000 m for 12 hours) and duration (0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 72 hours at 7,500 m) of hypoxia increased. Although there is a significant difference at 8,000 m, considering model stability, animal ethics and cost, we chose 7,500 m as a fixed altitude during hypoxia at different durations. Compared with the normoxic group, the expression of HIF-1 alpha mRNA in the 7,500 m significantly increased by 30.48%, 21.00%, and 12.62%, in brain, lung, and heart tissue (p < 0.01), and HIF-1 alpha mRNA in the 72-hour hypoxic exposure group significantly increased by 52.58%, 20.39%, 27.88% in tissues (p < 0.05). Compared with the normoxic group, HIF-1 alpha protein expressions in the 7,500 m significantly increased by 10.26%, 31.71%, and 13.33% in brain, lung, and heart tissue (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p < 0.05), and HIF-1 alpha protein expressions in the 72-hour hypoxic exposure group significantly increased by 18.89%, 22.89%, and 29.75% in tissues (p < 0.05). Conclusion: HIF-1 alpha expression in the rat was correlated with altitude and duration of hypoxic exposure.

AB  - A functional nervous system is built upon the proper morphogenesis of neurons to establish the intricate connection between them. The microtubule cytoskeleton is known to play various essential roles in this morphogenetic process. While many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been demonstrated to participate in neuronal morphogenesis, the function of many more remains to be determined. This study focuses on a MAP called HMMR in mice, which was originally identified as a hyaluronan binding protein and later found to possess microtubule and centrosome binding capacity. HMMR exhibits high abundance on neuronal microtubules and altering the level of HMMR significantly affects the morphology of neurons. Instead of confining to the centrosome(s) like cells in mitosis, HMMR localizes to microtubules along axons and dendrites. Furthermore, transiently expressing HMMR enhances the stability of neuronal microtubules and increases the formation frequency of growing microtubules along the neurites. HMMR regulates the microtubule localization of a non-centrosomal microtubule nucleator TPX2 along the neurite, offering an explanation for how HMMR contributes to the promotion of growing microtubules. This study sheds light on how cells utilize proteins involved in mitosis for non-mitotic functions.

AB  - Objective To explore whether the protein Deglycase protein 1 (DJ1) can ameliorate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology in Amyloid Precursor Protein/Presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice and its possible mechanism to provide a theoretical basis for exploring the pathogenesis of AD.Methods Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) of DJ1-overexpression or DJ1-knockdown were injected into the hippocampus of 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice to construct models of overexpression or knockdown. Mice were divided into the AD model control group (MC), AAV vector control group (NC), DJ1-overexpression group (DJ1+), and DJ1-knockdown group (DJ1-). After 21 days, the Morris water maze test, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were used to evaluate the effects of DJ1 on mice. Results DJ1+ overexpression decreased the latency and increased the number of platform traversals in the water maze test. DJ1- cells were cured and atrophied, and the intercellular structure was relaxed; the number of age spots and the expression of AD-related proteins were significantly increased. DJ1+ increased the protein expression of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), light chain 3 (LC3), phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), and B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), as well as the antioxidant levels of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), while decreasing the levels of Kelch-like hydrates-associated protein 1 (Keap1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p62/sequestosome1 (p62/SQSTM1), Caspase3, and malondialdehyde (MDA).Conclusion DJ1-overexpression can ameliorate learning, memory, and AD-like pathology in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the activation of the NRF2/HO-1 and AMPK/mTOR pathways by DJ1.

AB  - Background: Studies investigating the relationship between exposure to air pollution and brain development using magnetic resonance images are emerging. However, most studies have focused only on prenatal exposures, and have included a limited selection of pollutants. Here, we aim to expand the current knowledge by studying pregnancy and childhood exposure to a wide selection of pollutants, and brain morphology in preadolescents.
   Methods: We used data from 3133 preadolescents from a birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands (enrollment: 2002-2006). Concentrations of nitrogen oxides, coarse, fine, and ultrafine particles, and composition of fine particles were estimated for participant's home addresses in pregnancy and childhood, using land use regression models. Structural brain images were obtained at age 9-12 years. We assessed the relationships of air pollution exposure, with brain volumes, and surface-based morphometric data, adjusting for socioeconomic and life-style characteristics, using single as well as multi-pollutant approach. Results: No associations were observed between air pollution exposures and global volumes of total brain, and cortical and subcortical grey matter. However, we found associations between higher pregnancy and childhood air pollution exposures with smaller corpus callosum, smaller hippocampus, larger amygdala, smaller nucleus accumbens, and larger cerebellum (e.g. -69.2mm3 hippocampal volume [95%CI -129.1 to -9.3] per 1ng/m3 increase in pregnancy exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Higher pregnancy exposure to air pollution was associated with smaller cortical thickness while higher childhood exposure was associated with predominantly larger cortical surface area.
   Conclusion: Higher pregnancy or childhood exposure to several air pollutants was associated with altered volume of several brain structures, as well as with cortical thickness and surface area. Associations showed some similarity to delayed maturation and effects of early-life stress.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) use disorder affects both sexes, with sex differences occurring in behavioral, structural, and biochemical consequences. The molecular mechanisms underlying these differences are unclear. Herein, we used a rat model to identify potential sex differences in the effects of METH on brain dopaminergic systems. Rats were trained to self-administer METH for 20 days, and a cue-induced drug-seeking test was performed on withdrawal days 3 and 30. Dopamine and its metabolites were measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum (dSTR), and hippocampus (HIP). Irrespective of conditions, in comparison to females, male rats showed increased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the PFC, dSTR, and HIP; increased cys-dopamine in NAc; and increased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (DOPET) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in dSTR. Males also showed METH-associated decreases in DA levels in the HIP but increases in the NAc. Female rats showed METH-associated decreases in DA, DOPAL, and DOPAC levels in the PFC but increases in DOPET and DOPAC levels in the HIP. Both sexes showed METH-associated decreases in NAc DA metabolites. Together, these data document sex differences in METH SA-induced changes in DA metabolism. These observations provide further support for using sex as an essential variable when discussing therapeutic approaches against METH use disorder in humans.

AB  - BackgroundThe potential neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine against ketamine-induced neurotoxicity remain inconclusive. This study aims to investigate the influence of dexmedetomidine on ketamine-induced neuronal apoptosis and neurodevelopmental toxicity.MethodsIn vitro experiments employed concentrations of 0.1 uM for dexmedetomidine and 50 uM for ketamine individually as well as their combination. Changes in apoptotic proteins and dendritic development in neurons were assessed after a 6-h exposure to the drugs with evaluations conducted 24 hs' post-treatment. In vivo experiments entailed intraperitoneal administration starting from postnatal Day 7 (P7) continuously for 3 days (P7-P9) using dosages of 100 mg/kg for ketamine and 1 mg/kg for dexmedetomidine alone or combined. Learning, memory and motor coordination abilities were evaluated via rotary rod tests and shuttle box experiments at P30 and P60, respectively.ResultsDexmedetomidine effectively mitigated ketamine-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons but did not alleviate associated dendritic developmental abnormalities. Although causing reduced motor coordination in mice, no improvement was observed with regard to this effect or reaction speed when treated with dexmedetomidine alongside ketamine.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that while dexmedetomidine can mitigate ketamine-induced neuronal apoptosis, it has limited impact on its associated neurodevelopmental toxicities.
   Dexmedetomidine effectively reversed the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons induced by ketamine. Dexmedetomidine failed to reverse the inhibition of dendritic development of hippocampal neurons caused by ketamine. Dexmedetomidine did not demonstrate a mitigating effect on the decline of motor coordination and reaction speed in mice induced by ketamine.image

AB  - Neurodegeneration is the consequence of harmful events affecting the nervous system that lead to neuronal death. Toxic substances, including air pollutants, are capable of inducing neurodegeneration. Ozone (O-3) is the most oxidative toxic pollutant. O-3 reacts with cellular components and forms reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, triggering nitro-oxidative damage during short-term exposure. Curcumin (CUR) is a natural phenolic molecule bearing well-documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biological activities in diverse experimental models. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of preventive dietary administration of CUR against hippocampal neurodegeneration and nitro-oxidative damage caused by short-term exposure to O-3. Eighty Wistar male rats were distributed into four experimental groups, twenty rats each: intact control; CUR dietary supplementation without O-3 exposure; exposure to 0.7 ppm of O-3; and exposed to O-3 with CUR dietary supplementation. Five rats from each group were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h of exposure. The CUR dose was 5.6 mg/kg and adjusted according to food consumption. CUR significantly decreased oxidative damage to plasma lipids and proteins, as well as neurodegeneration in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions. Concluding, CUR proved effective protection in decreasing neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and prevented systemic oxidative damage.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are one of the potential molecules in response to a hypomagnetic field (HMF), and exposure to an HMF for eight weeks led to an increase in ROS levels in the whole hippocampus area in mice. ROS are mainly derived from the byproducts of mitochondrial metabolism. However, previous in vivo studies mostly focus on the influence of one time point of HMF exposure on the mouse hippocampus and lack comparative studies on the effects of different durations of HMF exposure on the mouse hippocampus. Here, we investigated the effects of different durations of HMF on the number of active mitochondria and ROS levels in mouse hippocampus. Compared with the geomagnetic field (GMF) group, we found that the number of active mitochondria in the hippocampus was significantly reduced during the sixth week of HMF exposure, whereas the number of active mitochondria was significantly reduced and the ROS levels was significantly increased during the eighth week of HMF exposure. The number of active mitochondria gradually decreased and ROS levels gradually increased in both GMF and HMF groups with prolonged exposure time. In addition, the expression level of the PGC-1 alpha gene in the hippocampus, the main regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, decreased significantly in the eighth week of HMF exposure. These results reveal that the changes in active mitochondria number and ROS levels were dependent on the durations of HMF exposure, and prolonged exposure to HMF exacerbates these changes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques is a distinctive pathological feature of AD patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the therapeutic effect of chicoric acid (CA) on AD models and to explore its underlying mechanisms. APPswe/Ind SH-SY5Y cells and 5xFAD mice were treated with CA. Soluble A beta 1-42 and A beta plaque levels were analyzed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing was used to compare the changes in hippocampal gene expression profiles among the 5xFAD mouse groups. The specific gene expression levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. It was found that CA treatment reduced the A beta 1-42 levels in the APPswe/Ind cells and 5xFAD mice. It also reduced the A beta plaque levels as well as the APP and BACE1 levels. Transcriptome analysis showed that CA affected the synaptic-plasticity-related genes in the 5xFAD mice. The levels of L1CAM, PSD-95 and synaptophysin were increased in the APPswe/Ind SH-SY5Y cells and 5xFAD mice treated with CA, which could be inhibited by administering siRNA-L1CAM to the CA-treated APPswe/Ind SH-SY5Y cells. In summary, CA reduced A beta levels and increased the expression levels of synaptic-function-related markers via L1CAM in AD models.

AB  - Epilepsy is a complex disorder affecting the central nervous system and is characterised by spontaneously recurring seizures (SRSs). Epileptic patients undergo symptomatic pharmacological treatments, however, in 30% of cases, they are ineffective, mostly in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Therefore, there is a need for developing novel treatment strategies. Transplantation of cells releasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) could be used to counteract the imbalance between excitation and inhibition within epileptic neuronal networks. We generated GABAergic interneuron precursors from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and grafted them in the hippocampi of rats developing chronic SRSs after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we characterised the maturation of the grafted cells into functional GABAergic interneurons in the host brain, and we confirmed the presence of functional inhibitory synaptic connections from grafted cells onto the host neurons. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of grafted hESC-derived interneurons reduced the rate of epileptiform discharges in vitro. We also observed decreased SRS frequency and total time spent in SRSs in these animals in vivo as compared to non-grafted controls. These data represent a proof-of-concept that hESC-derived GABAergic neurons can exert a therapeutic effect on epileptic animals presumably through establishing inhibitory synapses with host neurons.

AB  - Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) is a subterranean termite species from Southeast Asia which has been unintentionally introduced to many parts of the world through commerce and modern transportation. Known for causing extensive damage to timber used in the built environment, the termite also has a habit of nesting in carton nests in wood and wooden structures in buildings. As so little is known of its breeding system, colony, and genetic structure, we initiated work to sequence its genome with an Illumina HiSeq (TM) 2000 sequencer. In this publication, we announce our paired-end sequencing data and report the isolation of 119,190 microsatellite markers from our DNA assembly. The microsatellite marker reported in this publication can be used to elucidate the mating system and genetic structure of this highly invasive termite species. Additionally, in this announcement the study authors make the Bio Project sequence accession number SRR13105492 accessible from the Sequence Read Archive database.

AB  - By the mid-1960s, nonhuman primates had become key experimental organisms for vaccine development and testing, and was seen by many scientists as important for the future success of this field as well as other biomedical undertakings. A major hindrance to expanding the use of nonhuman primates was the dependency on wild-captured animals. In addition to unreliable access and poor animal health, procurement of wild primates involved the circulation of infectious diseases and thus also public health hazards. This paper traces how the World Health Organization (WHO) became involved in the issue of primate supply, and shows how by the late 1960s concerns for vaccine development and the conservation of wildlife began to converge. How did the WHO navigate public health and animal health? What characterized the response and with what implications for humans and animals? The paper explores how technical standards of care were central to managing the conflicting concerns of animal and human health, biological standardization, and conservation. While the WHO's main aim was to prevent public health risks, I argue that imposing new standards of care implied establishing new hierarchies of humans and animals, and cultures of care.

AB  - Optimizing the efficiency of definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation is necessary for the generation of diverse organ-like structures. In this study, we used the small molecule inhibitor saracatinib (SAR) to enhance DE differentiation of human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. SAR significantly improved DE differentiation efficiency at low concentrations. The interaction between SAR and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) was explored through RNA-seq and molecular docking simulations, which further supported the inhibition of DE differentiation by p-FAK overexpression in SAR-treated cells. In addition, we found that SAR inhibited the nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a downstream effector of FAK, which promoted DE differentiation. Moreover, the addition of SAR enabled a significant reduction in activin A (AA) from 50 to 10 ng/mL without compromising DE differentiation efficiency. For induction of the pancreatic lineage, 10 ng/ml AA combined with SAR at the DE differentiation stage yielded a comparative number of PDX1(+)/NKX6.1(+) pancreatic progenitor cells to those obtained by 50 ng/ml AA treatment. Our study highlights SAR as a potential modulator that facilitates the cost-effective generation of DE cells and provides insight into the orchestration of cell fate determination.

AB  - Conformational flexibility plays an essential role in antibodies' functional and structural stability. They facilitate and determine the strength of antigen-antibody interactions. Camelidae express an interesting subtype of single-chain antibody, named Heavy Chain only Antibody. They have only one N-terminal Variable domain (VHH) per chain, composed of Frameworks (FRs) and Complementarity Determining regions (CDRs) like their VH and VL counterparts in IgG. Even when expressed independently, VHH domains display excellent solubility and (thermo)stability, which helps them to retain their impressive interaction capabilities. Sequence and structural features of VHH domains contributing to these abilities have already been studied compared to classical antibodies. To have the broadest view and understand the changes in dynamics of these macromolecules, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations for a large number of non-redundant VHH structures have been performed for the first time. This analysis reveals the most prevalent movements in these domains. It reveals the four main classes of V(H)Hs dynamics. Diverse local changes were observed in CDRs with various intensities. Similarly, different types of constraints were observed in CDRs, while FRs close to CDRs were sometimes primarily impacted. This study sheds light on the changes in flexibility in different regions of VHH that may impact their in silico design.

AB  - Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. During brain neuroinflammation, activated microglial cells resulting from amyloid-beta (A beta) overload trigger toxic proinflammatory responses. Bis(ethylmaltolato)oxidovanadium (BEOV) (IV), an important vanadium compound, has been reported to have anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective effects, but its anti-inflammatory property has rarely been investigated. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of BEOV on neuroinflammation were revealed in both A beta-stimulated BV2 microglial cell line and APPswe/PS1E9 transgenic mouse brain. BEOV administration significantly decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 both in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1E9 mice and in the A beta-stimulated BV2 microglia. Furthermore, BEOV suppressed the A beta-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling and upregulated the protein expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in a dose-dependent manner. PPAR gamma inhibitor GW9662 could eliminate the effect of BEOV on A beta-induced NF-kappa B activation and proinflammatory mediator production. Taken altogether, these findings suggested that BEOV ameliorates A beta-stimulated neuroinflammation by inhibiting NF-kappa B signaling pathway through a PPAR gamma-dependent mechanism.

AB  - Infection with flaviviruses causes mild to severe diseases, including viral hemorrhagic fever, vascular shock syndrome, and viral encephalitis. Several animal models explore the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis, as shown by neuron destruction due to neurotoxicity after viral infection. While neuronal cells are injuries caused by inflammatory cytokine production following microglial/macrophage activation, the blockade of inflammatory cytokines can reduce neurotoxicity to improve the survival rate. This study investigated the involvement of macrophage phenotypes in facilitating CNS inflammation and neurotoxicity during flavivirus infection, including the Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus. Mice infected with different flaviviruses presented encephalitis-like symptoms, including limbic seizure and paralysis. Histology indicated that brain lesions were identified in the hippocampus and surrounded by mononuclear cells. In those regions, both the infiltrated macrophages and resident microglia were significantly increased. RNA-seq analysis showed the gene profile shifting toward type 1 macrophage (M1) polarization, while M1 markers validated this phenomenon. Pharmacologically blocking C-C chemokine receptor 2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha partly retarded DENV-induced M1 polarization. In summary, flavivirus infection, such as JEV and DENV, promoted type 1 macrophage polarization in the brain associated with encephalitic severity.

AB  - Enhanced electrical activity in detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) cells is a key factor in detrusor overactivity which causes overactive bladder pathological disorders. Transient receptor potential melastatin-4 (TRPM4) channels, which are calcium-activated cation channels, play a role in regulating DSM electrical activities. These channels likely contribute to depolarizing the DSM cell membrane, leading to bladder overactivity. Our research focuses on understanding TRPM4 channel function in the DSM cells of mice, using computational modeling. We aimed to create a detailed computational model of the TRPM4 channel based on existing electrophysiological data. We employed a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model with an incorporated TRP-like current to simulate action potential firing in response to current and synaptic stimulus inputs. Validation against experimental data showed close agreement with our simulations. Our model is the first to analyze the TRPM4 channel's role in DSM electrical activity, potentially revealing insights into bladder overactivity. In conclusion, TRPM4 channels are pivotal in regulating human DSM function, and TRPM4 channel inhibitors could be promising targets for treating overactive bladder.

AB  - Methionine restriction (MR) extends lifespan and delays the onset of aging-associated pathologies. However, the effect of MR on age-related cognitive decline remains unclear. Here, we find that a 3-month MR ameliorates working memory, short-term memory, and spatial memory in 15-month-old and 18-month-old mice by preserving synaptic ultrastructure, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, and reducing the brain MDA level in aged mice hippocampi. Transcriptome data suggest that the receptor of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-related gene expressions were altered in the hippocampi of MR-treated aged mice. MR increased FGF21 expression in serum, liver, and brain. Integrative modelling reveals strong correlations among behavioral performance, MR altered nervous structure-related genes, and circulating FGF21 levels. Recombinant FGF21 treatment balanced the cellular redox status, prevented mitochondrial structure damages, and upregulated antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO1 expression by transcriptional activation of Nrf2 in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, knockdown of Fgf21 by i.v. injection of adeno-associated virus abolished the neuroprotective effects of MR in aged mice. In conclusion, the MR exhibited the protective effects against age-related behavioral disorders, which could be partly explained by activating circulating FGF21 and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, and consequently suppressing the neuroinflammation and oxidative damages. These results demonstrate that FGF21 can be used as a potential nutritional factor in dietary restriction-based strategies for improving cognition associated with neurodegeneration disorders.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Progressive accumulation of insoluble isoforms of amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) and tau protein are the major neuropathologic hallmarks, and the loss of cholinergic pathways underlies cognitive deficits in patients. Recently, glial involvement has gained interest regarding its effect on preservation and impairment of brain integrity. The limbic system, including temporal lobe regions and the olfactory bulb, is particularly affected in the early stages. In the early 1980s, the reduced expression of the somatostatin neuropeptide was described in AD. However, over the last three decades, research on somatostatin in Alzheimer's disease has been scarce in humans. Therefore, the aim of this study was to stereologically quantify the expression of somatostatin in the human hippocampus and olfactory bulb and analyze its spatial distribution with respect to that of A beta and au neuropathologic proteins and astroglia. The results indicate that somatostatin-expressing cells are reduced by 50% in the hippocampus but are preserved in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the coexpression of somatostatin with the A beta peptide is very common but not with the tau protein. Finally, the coexpression of somatostatin with astrocytes is rare, although their spatial distribution is very similar. Altogether, we can conclude that somatostatin expression is highly reduced in the human hippocampus, but not the olfactory bulb, and may play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative stress in ovaries and corpus luteum (CL) of Bos taurus indicus females and the oxidant effect of CL in ovarian tissues in regions near, intermediate, or distant from it. Ovaries (n=12) of Nelore heifers (n=6) were collected from a slaughterhouse and fragmented. Experiment 1, each ovary was obtained from three fragments, resulting in 18 fragments of ovaries with CL (OV+CL) and another 18 fragments of ovaries without CL (OV-CL). Three fragments were generated from CL, totaling 18 CL fragments. In experiment 2, the ovarian fragments were removed from specific regions near, intermediate, or distant from the CL. All the fragments were placed in Eppendorf-type microtubes (1 mL), kept in a thermal container at 4 & DEG;C, and then stored in a -80 & DEG;C freezer for analysis of oxidative stress (TBARS and NBT) and antioxidant potential (FRAP and ABTS). In the antioxidant activity analysis, luteal tissues showed more antioxidant activity than ovarian tissue (FRAP = P < 0.0001; ABTS = P < 0.02). In the oxidative stress analysis, CL had lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS; TBARS = P < 0.03; NBT = P < 0.0001) than ovarian tissues. There was no difference in antioxidant activity and oxidative stress between the fragments obtained from different regions (OV+CL versus OV-CL; P > 0.05). The presence of CL in the ovaries of Bos taurus indicus females did not influence the oxidative stress or antioxidant potential of the gonad. Thus, the removal of ovarian fragments with or without the presence of CL indicates that biotechnologies such as in vitro follicle cultivation is possible.

AB  - Intestinal cell lineage differentiation is a tightly regulated mechanism that involves several intracellular signaling pathways affecting the expression of a variety of transcription factors, which ultimately regulate cell specific gene expression. Absorptive and goblet cells are the two main epithelial cell types of the intestine. Previous studies from our group using an shRNA knockdown approach have shown that YAP1, one of the main Hippo pathway effectors, inhibits the differentiation of these two cell types. In the present study, we show that YAP1 activity is regulated by Src family kinases (SFKs) in these cells. Inhibition of SFKs led to a sharp reduction in YAP1 expression at the protein level, an increase in CDX2 and the P1 forms of HNF4 alpha and of absorptive and goblet cell differentiation specific markers. Interestingly, in Caco-2/15 cells which express both YAP1 and its paralog TAZ, TAZ was not reduced by the inhibition of SFKs and its specific knockdown rather impaired absorptive cell differentiation indicating that YAP1 and TAZ are not always interchangeable for regulating cell functions.

AB  - Six new crotofolane diterpenoids (1-6) and 13 known compounds (7-19) were isolated from the MeOH- CH2Cl2 (1:1, v/v) extracts of the leaves and stem bark of Croton kilwae. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by extensive analysis of spectroscopic and mass spectrometric data. The structure of crotokilwaepoxide A (1) was confirmed by single -crystal X-ray diffraction, allowing for the determination of its absolute configuration. The crude extracts and the isolated compounds were investigated for antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus type-2 (HRV-2) in HEp-2 and HeLa cells, respectively, for antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and for antimalarial activity against the Plasmodium falciparum Dd2 strain. ent-3 beta,19-Dihydroxykaur-16-ene (7) and ayanin (16) displayed anti-RSV activities with IC50 values of 10.2 and 6.1 mu M, respectively, while exhibiting only modest cytotoxic effects on HEp-2 cells that resulted in selectivity indices of 4.9 and 16.4. Compounds 2 and 5 exhibited modest anti-HRV-2 activity (IC50 of 44.6 mu M for both compounds), while compound 16 inhibited HRV-2 with an IC50 value of 1.8 mu M. Compounds 1-3 showed promising antiplasmodial activities (80- 100% inhibition) at a 50 mu M concentration.

AB  - E-cadherin, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, is coupled to actin cytoskeleton and distributes cell forces acting on cells. Since YAP transduces mechanical signals involving actin cytoskeleton, we aimed to investigate the relationship between YAP and mechanical cues in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines, characterized by different EMT-related phenotypes, cultured in 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids. We observed that the YAP/p-YAP ratio was reduced in HPAC and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines and remained unchanged in BxPC-3 cells when cultured in a 3D setting. CTGF and CYR61 gene expression were down-regulated in all PDAC 3D compared to 2D cultures, without any significant effect following actin cytoskeleton inhibition by Cytochalasin B (CyB) treatment. Moreover, LATS1 mRNA, indicating the activation of the Hippo pathway, was not influenced by CyB and differed in all PDAC cell lines having different EMT-related phenotype but a similar pattern of CTGF and CYR61 expression. Although the role of YAP modulation in response to mechanical cues in cancer cells remains to be completely elucidated, our results suggest that cell arrangement and phenotype can determine variable outcomes to mechanical stimuli in PDAC cells. Moreover, it is possible to speculate that YAP and Hippo pathways may act as parallel and not exclusive inputs that, converging at some points, may impact cell behavior.

AB  - Objective and designMast cells (MCs), as the fastest immune responders, play a critical role in the progression of neuroinflammation-related diseases, especially in depression. Quercetin (Que) and kaempferol (Kae), as two major diet-derived flavonoids, inhibit MC activation and exhibit significant antidepressant effect due to their anti-inflammatory capacity. The study aimed to explore the mechanisms of inhibitory effect of Que and Kae on MC activation, and whether Que and Kae suppress hippocampal mast cell activation in LPS-induced depressive mice.Subjects and treatmentIn vitro assays, human mast cells (HMC-1) were pretreated with Que or Kae for 1 h, then stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 2,5-di-t-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBHQ) for 3 h or 12 h. In vivo assays, Que or Kae was administered by oral gavage once daily for 14 days and then lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally injection to induce depressive behaviors.MethodsThe secretion and expression of TNF-alpha were determined by ELISA and Western blotting. The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcriptional activity was measured in HMC-1 stably expressing NFAT luciferase reporter gene. Nuclear translocation of NFATc2 was detected by nuclear protein extraction and also was fluorescently detected in HMC-1 stably expressing eGFP-NFATc2. We used Ca2+ imaging to evaluate changes of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in HMC-1 stably expressing fluorescent Ca2+ indicator jGCamP7s. Molecular docking was used to assess interaction between the Que or Kae and calcium release-activated calcium modulator (ORAI). The hippocampal mast cell accumulation and activation were detected by toluidine blue staining and immunohistochemistry with beta-tryptase.ResultsIn vitro assays of HMC-1 activated by PtBHQ (PMA and tBHQ), Que and Kae significantly decreased expression and secretion of TNF-alpha. Moreover, NFAT transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation of NFATc2 were remarkably inhibited by Que and Kae. In addition, the Ca2+ influx mediated by SOCE was suppressed by Que, Kae and the YM58483 (ORAI inhibitor), respectively. Importantly, the combination of YM58483 with Que or Kae had no additive effect on the inhibition of SOCE. The molecular docking also showed that Que and Kae both exhibit high binding affinities with ORAI at the same binding site as YM58483. In vivo assays, Que and Kae significantly reversed LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice, and inhibited hippocampal mast cell activation in LPS-induced depressive mice.ConclusionsOur results indicated that suppression of SOCE/NFATc2 pathway-mediated by ORAI channels may be the mechanism of inhibitory effect of Que and Kae on MC activation, and also suggested Que and Kae may exert the antidepressant effect through suppressing hippocampal mast cell activation.

AB  - Background Dysregulated Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is closely associated with cancer progression and chemo-resistance. We aim to explore the role of YAP1/Hippo pathway in regulating doxorubicin (ADM)-resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods In this study, we established two ADM-resistant cell lines (THP-1/ADM and K562/ ADM). Then, cell viability and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay and FCM assay, respectively. Real-time PCR was performed to examine the expression of genes in the AML/ADM cells and the clinic BM samples. The levels of all related proteins were examined by Western blot. Results We found that the YAP1 and its downstream target genes, including EGFR, SOX2, and OCT4, were associated with ADM resistance, evidenced by the increased expression in ADM-resistant AML/ADM cells and clinical BM specimens. Additionally, YAP1 ablation enhanced the promoting effects of ADM treatment on cell death in AML/ADM cells. Conversely, YAP1 increased ADM-a resistance in the original ADM-sensitive AML cells. These results may provide important new insights into understanding the role of YAP1 in regulating AML resistance by affecting CSCs characteristics. Conclusion In summary, we evidenced that the dysregulated YAP1/Hippo pathway influenced ADM resistance in AML. YAP1 might be a novel biomarker for the treatment of drug resistance in AML.

AB  - The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in plant defense against herbivorous insects. However, the relationship between Ectropis obliqua-induced defensive metabolites and the JA signaling pathway in tea plants remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated seven key special metabolites, including p-coumaroylputrescine, feruloylputrescine, prunin, naringenin, and three monolignols, to address this knowledge gap. Epicatechin was selected as a positive control based on its well-documented regulation through the JA signaling pathway. Notably, the content of all selected compounds was significantly increased by E. obliqua infestation. Furthermore, exogenous application of high-dose methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induced the accumulation of six of the eight compounds, excluding p-coumaryl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, whereas low-dose MeJA failed to elicit their accumulation. To confirm the results, we screened two bioactive molecules, D-allose and L-theanine, which significantly increased the endogenous JA levels at low concentrations. Interestingly, neither D-allose nor L-theanine triggered the biosynthesis of these defensive compounds. Additionally, D-allose-treated tea leaves had no significant effect on the performance of E. obliqua larvae. These findings demonstrate that the metabolic accumulation induced by E. obliqua is mediated through a high-threshold JA signaling cascade. This study provides novel insights into the relationship between plant resistance and JA signaling pathway, advancing our understanding of special metabolites mediated plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) infection is one of the most serious threats to the swine industry. While the disease can be prevented, to some extent, by commercial PCV2a vaccines, the evolving nature of PCV2 necessitates the development of a novel vaccine that can compete with the mutations of the virus. Thus, we have developed novel multiepitope vaccines based on the PCV2b variant. Three PCV2b capsid protein epitopes, together with a universal T helper epitope, were synthesized and formulated with five delivery systems/adjuvants: complete Freund's adjuvant, poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), poly(hydrophobic amino acid), liposomes and rod-shaped polymeric nanoparticles built from polystyrene-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-poly(N-dimethylacrylamide). Mice were subcutaneously immunized with the vaccine candidates three times at three-week intervals. All vaccinated mice produced high antibody titters after three immunizations as analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while mice vaccinated with PMA-adjuvanted vaccine elicited high antibody titers even after a single immunization. Thus, the multiepitope PCV2 vaccine candidates designed and examined here show strong potential for further development.

AB  - We noted recently that the injection of cells with a needle through a cystoscope in the urethral sphincter muscle of pigs failed to deposit them nearby or at the intended target position in about 50% of all animals investigated (n > 100). Increasing the chance for precise cell injection by shotgun approaches employing several circumferential injections into the sphincter muscle bears the risk of tissue injury. In this study, we developed and tested a novel needle-free technique to precisely inject cells in the urethral sphincter tissue, or other tissues, using a water-jet system. This system was designed to fit in the working channels of endoscopes and cystoscopes, allowing a wide range of minimally invasive applications. We analyze key features, including the physical parameters of the injector design, pressure ranges applicable for tissue penetration and cell injections and biochemical parameters, such as different compositions of injection media. Our results present settings that enable the high viability of cells post-injection. Lastly, the method is suitable to inject cells in the superficial tissue layer and in deeper layers, required when the submucosa or the sphincter muscle of the urethra is targeted.

AB  - Mechanisms that entrain and pace rhythmic epileptiform discharges remain debated. Traditionally, the quest to understand them has focused on interneuronal networks driven by synaptic GABAergic connections. How-ever, synchronized interneuronal discharges could also trigger the transient elevations of extracellular GABA across the tissue volume, thus raising tonic conductance (Gtonic) of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA recep-tors in multiple cells. Here, we monitor extracellular GABA in hippocampal slices using patch-clamp GABA "sniffer"and a novel optical GABA sensor, showing that periodic epileptiform discharges are preceded by transient, region-wide waves of extracellular GABA. Neural network simulations that incorporate volume -transmitted GABA signals point to a cycle of GABA-driven network inhibition and disinhibition underpinning this relationship. We test and validate this hypothesis using simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from multiple neurons and selective optogenetic stimulation of fast-spiking interneurons. Critically, reducing GABA uptake in order to decelerate extracellular GABA fluctuations-without affecting synaptic GABAergic transmission or resting GABA levels-slows down rhythmic activity. Our findings thus unveil a key role of extrasynaptic, volume-transmitted GABA in pacing regenerative rhythmic activity in brain networks.

AB  - Apart from the well-established role of the gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) in the regulation of the reproductive functions, much less is known about the peripheral role of the GnIH and its receptor in the metabolic processes. On account of pig being an excellent model for studies of food intake and obesity in humans, we investigated the peripheral effects of the GnIH on food intake and energy homeostasis and revealed the underlying mechanism(s) in female piglets in vivo. Compared to the vehicle-treated group, intraperitoneally injected GnIH significantly increased the food intake and altered the meal microstructure both in the fasting and ad libitum female piglet. GnIH-triggered hyperphagia induced female piglet obesity and altered islet hormone secretion in the pancreas, accompanied with dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. Interestingly, GnIH decreased the glucose transport capacity and glycogen synthesis, whereas it increased the gluconeogenesis in the liver, while it also induced an insulin resistance in white adipose tissue (WAT) via inhibiting the activity of AKT-GSK3-beta signaling. In terms of the lipid metabolism, GnIH reduced the oxidation of fatty acids, whereas the elevated fat synthesis ability in the liver and WAT was developed though the inhibited AMPK phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that peripheral GnIH could trigger hyperphagia-induced obesity and an associated glycolipid metabolism disorder in female piglets, suggesting that GnIH may act as a potential therapeutic agent for metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes.

Cornel iridoid glycosides of Cornus officinalis is therapeutic to Alzheimer's disease (AD), while its pharmacodynamic material basis is not clear. Cornuside, an iridoid glycoside extracted from of Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc, might be a potential anti-AD candidate.Aim of the study: Cornuside was evaluated for its effect on scopolamine induced AD mice, and its action mechanisms were explored.Materials and methods: ICR mice were administered with 1 mg/kg scopolamine intraperitoneally to induce amnesia. The therapeutic effect of cornuside of cognitive function was evaluated via series of behavioral tests, including Morris water maze test, step-through test and step-down test. In addition, specific enzyme reaction tests were used to detect the content of acetylcholine (ACh) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters were detected by high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Results: Cornuside ameliorated the spatial memory impairment in Morris water maze test and cognitive disruption in step-through and step-down test. Furthermore, cornuside improved the level of ACh by reducing the activities of AChE and BuChE, and increasing the activity of ChAT in hippocampus. Cornuside also increased the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters by inhibiting MAO activity in hippocampus and cortex. In addition, cornuside attenuated MDA by enhancing the activities of SOD and CAT in hippocampus and cortex. Conclusion: Cornuside improved cognitive dysfunction induced by scopolamine in behavioral tests. The mechanisms of cornuside were further investigated from the aspects of neurotransmitters and oxidative stress. Cornuside could inhibit oxidative stress and neurotransmitter hydrolases, increase ACh and monoamine neurotransmitters, which finally contributed to its therapeutic effect on scopolamine induced amnesia.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC)-hitchhiking, in which different nanocarriers (NCs) shuttle on the erythrocyte membrane and disassociate from RBCs to the first organ downstream of the intravenous injection spot, has recently been introduced as a solution to enhance target site uptake. Several experimental studies have already approved that cellular hitchhiking onto the RBC membrane can improve the delivery of a wide range of NCs in mice, pigs, and ex vivo human lungs. In these studies, the impact of NC size, NC surface chemistry, and shear rate on the delivery process and biodistribution has been widely explored. To shed light on the underlying physics in this type of drug delivery system, we present a computational platform in the context of the lattice Boltzmann method, spring connected network, and frictional immersed boundary method. The proposed algorithm simulates nanoparticle (NP) dislodgment from the RBC surface in shear flow and biomimetic microfluidic channels. The numerical simulations are performed for various NP sizes and RBC-NP adhesion strengths. In shear flow, NP detachment increases upon increasing the shear rate. RBC-RBC interaction can also significantly boost shear-induced particle detachment. Larger NPs have a higher propensity to be disconnected from the RBC surface. The results illustrate that changing the interaction between the NPs and RBCs can control the desorption process. All the findings agree with in vivo and in vitro experimental observations. We believe that the proposed setup can be exploited as a predictive tool to estimate optimum parameters in NP-bound RBCs for better targeting procedures in tissue microvasculature.

AB  - The controlled supply of bioactive molecules is a subject of debate in animal nutrition. The release of bioactive molecules in the target organ, in this case the intestine, results in improved feed, as well as having a lower environmental impact. However, the degradation of bioactive molecules' in transit in the gastrointestinal passage is still an unresolved issue. This paper discusses the feasibility of a simple and cost-effective procedure to bypass the degradation problem. A solid/liquid adsorption procedure was applied, and the operating parameters (pH, reaction time, and LY initial concentration) were studied. Lysozyme is used in this work as a representative bioactive molecule, while Adsorbo (R), a commercial mixture of clay minerals and zeolites which meets current feed regulations, is used as the carrier. A maximum LY loading of 32 mgLY/gAD (LY(32)-AD) was obtained, with fixing pH in the range 7.5-8, initial LY content at 37.5 mgLY/gAD, and reaction time at 30 min. A full characterisation of the hybrid organoclay highlighted that LY molecules were homogeneously spread on the carrier's surface, where the LY-carrier interaction was mainly due to charge interaction. Preliminary release tests performed on the LY(32)-AD synthesised sample showed a higher releasing capacity, raising the pH from 3 to 7. In addition, a preliminary Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay showed an antioxidant capacity for the LY of 1.47 +/- 0.18 mu mol TroloxEq/g with an inhibition percentage of 33.20 +/- 3.94%.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Regional gray matter (GM) alterations have been reported in early-onset psychosis (EOP, onset before age 18), but previous studies have yielded conflicting results, likely due to small sample sizes and the different brain regions examined. In this study, we conducted a whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis in a large sample of individuals with EOP, using the newly developed ENIGMA-VBM tool.
   METHODS: 15 independent cohorts from the ENIGMA-EOP working group participated in the study. The overall sample comprised T1-weighted MRI data from 482 individuals with EOP and 469 healthy controls. Each site performed the VBM analysis locally using the standardized ENIGMA-VBM tool. Statistical parametric T-maps were generated from each cohort and meta-analyzed to reveal voxel-wise differences between EOP and healthy controls as well as the individual-based association between GM volume and age of onset, chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalent dose, and other clinical variables.
   RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, individuals with EOP showed widespread lower GM volume encompassing most of the cortex, with the most marked effect in the left median cingulate (Hedges' g = 0.55, p = 0.001 corrected), as well as small clusters of lower white matter (WM), whereas no regional GM or WM volumes were higher in EOP. Lower GM volume in the cerebellum, thalamus and left inferior parietal gyrus was associated with older age of onset. Deficits in GM in the left inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, right precentral gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus were also associated with higher CPZ equivalent doses.
   CONCLUSION: EOP is associated with widespread reductions in cortical GM volume, while WM is affected to a smaller extent. GM volume alterations are associated with age of onset and CPZ equivalent dose but these effects are small compared to case-control differences. Mapping anatomical abnormalities in EOP may lead to a better understanding of the role of psychosis in brain development during childhood and adolescence.

AB  - Blood biochemical parameters provide valuable information on the health, nutrition, productive and reproduc-tive status of the animal. In alpacas, it has not been investigated whether environmental changes affect these parameters. The objective of the study was to evaluate the biochemical parameters in Huacaya alpacas both in the high Andean zone and on the coast. For this, blood samples were taken considering the sex of the alpacas. The biochemical parameters were analyzed with the Byosistems (R) kits of the automated biochemistry analyzer A25. For the statistical analysis, a variance analysis of a factorial of 2 x 2 (zone and sex) was done. A highly significant difference between zones was found for blood levels in glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (FA), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin and albumin (p < 0,05), on the other hand, no differences were found between sexes for the most of the biochemical parameters (p > 0,05), except for albumin (p < 0,05). No interaction was found in any of the biochemical parameters evaluated. Blood levels of glucose, AST, FA, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin and albumin present higher levels in the high Andean zone than in the coast.

AB  - Tropomyosins (Tpms) have been described as master regulators of actin, with Tpm3 products shown to be involved in early developmental processes, and the Tpm3 isoform Tpm3.1 controlling changes in the size of neuronal growth cones and neurite growth. Here, we used primary mouse hippocampal neurons of C57/Bl6 wild type and Bl6(Tpm3flox) transgenic mice to carry out morphometric analyses in response to the absence of Tpm3 products, as well as to investigate the effect of C-terminal truncation on the ability of Tpm3.1 to modulate neuronal morphogenesis. We found that the knock-out of Tpm3 leads to decreased neurite length and complexity, and that the deletion of two amino acid residues at the C-terminus of Tpm3.1 leads to more detrimental changes in neurite morphology than the deletion of six amino acid residues. We also found that Tpm3.1 that lacks the 6 C-terminal amino acid residues does not associate with stress fibres, does not segregate to the tips of neurites, and does not impact the amount of the filamentous actin pool at the axonal growth cones, as opposed to Tpm3.1, which lacks the two C-terminal amino acid residues. Our study provides further insight into the role of both Tpm3 products and the C-terminus of Tpm3.1, and it forms the basis for future studies that aim to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying Tpm3.1 targeting to different subcellular compartments.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) exhibits anti-oxidation, antiatherosclerosis, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, and liver protective effects; it may also inhibit ECM collagen deposition and alleviate liver fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that sea buckthorn granule (SG) polysaccharides may possess anti-hepatitis activity. Aim of the study: To investigate the role of sea buckthorn in regulating hepatic pregnane X receptor (PXR)/ constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)/NF-kappa B signal transduction and CYP2C following BCG-induced liver injury. Materials and methods: A mouse liver injury model was established through single tail vein injection of Bacillus Calmette-Gue<acute accent>rin (BCG) vaccine. SGs were administrated intragastrically for 7 days. Pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN, PXR agonists) and 1,4-bis-(2-[3,5-dichloropyridyloxy]) benzene (TCPOBOP, CAR agonists) were administered as positive controls. To evaluate modeling success, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) levels and hepatic IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), and 14,15EET expressions were measured. Results: Overall, 5281 reliable proteins were identified, including 43 cytochrome P450 (CYP) subtypes, with the CYP2C subfamily accounting for approximately 27 %. BCG-induced hepatitis downregulated 23 CYPs. The BCG group exhibited increased inflammatory infiltration and ALT/AST levels. PXR, CAR, CYP2C, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET were downregulated, whereas NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha were upregulated. Following SG administration, hepatic inflammation and ALT/AST levels decreased; PXR, CAR, CYP2C, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET increased, and NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha decreased. The SG high-dose group effects were comparable to the PCN and TCPOBOP group effects. Conclusions: SGs may regulate the PXR/CAR/NF-kappa B signaling pathway and CYP reprogramming, mitigating BCGinduced liver injury and inflammation.

AB  - Background Guettarda viburnoides Cham. & Schltdl., "veludinho do campo", is used in the Brazilian Amazon for its effects on the central nervous system (CNS) as a "brain tonic"; however, scientific evidence is needed to elucidate its ethnobotanical uses. Objective This study evaluated the neurobehavioural effects of an ethanolic extract of G. viburnoides (EEGV). Molecular docking, microchemical and morphoanatomical features of the species were investigated. Methods EEGV was investigated by UHPLC-MS/MS and dereplication and molecular network were investigated using platforms available for natural product chemistry. For the in vivo assay, EEGV was administered to mice orally (3, 30 or 100 mg/kg). The effect of EEGV on spatial memory was measured using the Morris water maze test in mice with scopolamine-induced amnesia. The depression- and anxiety-like effects were assessed by forced swimming, tail suspension, marble burying and elevated plus maze tests. The AChE inhibition was evaluated in the brains of treated mice and molecular docking simulations were carried out with the main constituents. The leaves and stems of G. viburnoides were analysed via optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Results Secoxyloganin, grandifloroside, hyperin/or isoquercitrin, uncaric acid and ursolic acid were identified by UHPLC-MS/MS. Molecular networking by three flavonoids, three triterpenes, two coumarins, two iridoids, and one phenolic acid. EEGV reversed these scopolamine-induced effects. In the forced swim and tail suspension test, EEGV (30 and 100 mg/kg) significantly reduced the immobility time. EEGV significantly reduced the number of buried marbles, while in the elevated plus maze test, no changes were observed compared to the Sco group. AChE activity was altered in the hippocampus. Studies of the molecular coupling of iridoid glycosides (grandifloroside and secoxyloganin) and flavonoid hyperin with AChE revealed significant interactions, corroborating the activity indicated by the inhibition assay. Conclusions These results might be in accordance with medicinal use for neuroprotetor effects and important microchemical and micromorphological data that support the identification and quality control of G. viburnoides.

AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are implicated in the regulation of fear and anxiety. GPCR signaling involves canonical G protein pathways but can also engage downstream kinases and effectors through scaffolding interactions mediated by beta-arrestin. Here, we investigated whether beta-arrestin signaling regulates anxiety-like and fear-related behavior in mice in response to activation of the GPCR delta-opioid receptor (delta OR or DOR). Administration of beta-arrestin-biased delta OR agonists to male C57BL/6 mice revealed beta-arrestin 2-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdala and beta-arrestin 1-dependent activation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus accumbens. In mice, beta-arrestin-biased agonist treatment was associated with reduced anxiety-like and fear-related behaviors, with some overlapping and isoform-specific input. In contrast, applying a G protein-biased delta OR agonist decreased ERK1/2 activity in all three regions as well as the dorsal striatum and was associated with increased fear-related behavior without effects on baseline anxiety. Our results indicate a complex picture of delta OR neuromodulation in which beta-arrestin 1- and 2-dependent ERK signaling in specific brain subregions suppresses behaviors associated with anxiety and fear and opposes the effects of G protein-biased signaling. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of noncanonical beta-arrestin-dependent GPCR signaling in the regulation of these interrelated emotions.

AB  - Foeniculum vulgare Mill, commonly known as fennel, is an aromatic herb traditionally used for culinary and medicinal purposes, with potential therapeutic effects on neurological disorders. However, limited research has focused on its neurotrophic impact, particularly on neuronal maturation and synaptic development. This study investigates the neurotrophic effects of F. vulgare ethanol extracts (FVSE) on the maturation of rat primary hippocampal neurons. Results show that FVSE and its prominent component, anethole, significantly promote neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner. Optimal axonal and dendritic growth occurred at concentrations of 40 mu g/mL FVSE and 20 mu M anethole, respectively, without causing cytotoxicity, underscoring the safety of FVSE for neuronal health. Additionally, FVSE enhances the formation of synapses, essential for neuronal communication. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that FVSE components influence critical neurotrophic pathways, including PI3K-AKT and Alzheimer's disease pathways. Specifically, FVSE modulates key proteins, including tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3 beta ser9), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk1/2). Anethole was found to play a key role in regulating these pathways, which was confirmed by immunocytochemistry experiments demonstrating its effect on promoting neuronal growth and synaptic development. In conclusion, this study highlights the neurotrophic properties of FVSE, with anethole emerging as a critical bioactive compound. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of fennel in treating neurological disorders, offering a basis for future research into interventions promoting neuronal growth and survival.

AB  - BackgroundQingyangshen (Cynanchum otophyllum C.K. Schneid) is a folk drug for treating depression and other mental disorders induced by social defeat stress. Neuroplasticity in the hippocampus is essential for the modulation of cognition and emotion, and its impairment may contribute to the development and progression of depression. Our previous studies have found that Qingyangshen glycosides (QYS) can improve depression-like behavior in social failure mouse models, mainly through PGC-1 alpha/FNDC5/BDNF signaling pathways activation, but its effects and mechanisms on hippocampal neuroplasticity remain unknown. MethodsChronic social defeat stress (CSDS) was used to induce social defeat in mice. Morphological changes in the hippocampus were observed by H&E staining and Golgi staining. Immunofluorescence double staining was used to detect the expression of synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), while western blot was employed to evaluate PSD-95, SYN, and doublecortin (DCX) proteins. The pathological processing of social defeat and the therapeutic effects of QYS on it was confirmed through behavioral assessment associated with morphologic observation. ResultsDuring the whole study, the sucrose preference indices and OFT activity time of CSDS mice were significantly decreased (p <= 0.05), and the tail suspension immobility time was significantly increased (p <= 0.05), suggesting that the mice had significant depressive symptoms. Treatment with QYS (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) significantly alleviated depressive symptoms in CSDS mice, which was demonstrated by significantly (p <= 0.05 or p <= 0.01) reducing the duration of tail-hanging immobility and increasing the tendency of sucrose preference indices and OFT activity time. QYS treatment also significantly increased the expression of DCX, PSD-95, and SYN proteins, which play a crucial role in depression. ConclusionsQYS alleviated these symptoms by enhancing hippocampal neuroplasticity through upregulating the expression of synapse-associated proteins (SAPs). The therapeutic mechanism of QYS may involve modulating the neuroplasticity of hippocampus neurons by altering the expression of SAPs.

AB  - Horses have been companions of people for thousands of years. Areas in which humans use these animals include, for example, transport, participation in sports competitions, or during rehabilitation (hippotherapy). Unfortunately, injuries such as lower limb fracture very often require euthanasia due to the significant difficulties in conducting fracture therapy/repair. Therefore, there are still many possibilities for the improvement of existing treatments. The aim of the study was to conduct a numerical analysis enabling the prediction of bone union of the third metacarpal bone of a horse. The loading conditions and type of fracture were based on a pony weighing 120 kg; however, research on a live animal was not the purpose of this study. Numerical studies were carried out for three different methods of stabilization using bone plates in the Ansys program (lateral, anterior, and lateral-anterior stabilization). An algorithm based on the Carter model was used to predict bone union, while linear-coupled models were used to describe the behaviour of materials. The authors also performed dynamic analyses in the Abaqus/Explicit program to determine the maximum speed at which the horse could move so that the fracture would not deepen. For dynamic analyses, the authors used nonlinear models-Johnson-Cook in the case of the 316L surgical steel material and cortical bone. Material failure was described using the Johnson-Cook failure model for steel and the limit strain model for cortical bone. A series of numerical simulations allowed to determine the direction of bone union building, and the most favourable case of stabilization was determined.

AB  - Although most cognitive impairments induced by prolonged alcohol consumption tend to improve within the initial months of abstinence, there is evidence suggesting certain cognitive deficits may persist. This study aimed to investigate the impact of aerobic exercise on learning and memory in alcohol use disorder (AUD) mice following a period of abstinence from alcohol. We also sought to assess the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. To this end, we established an AUD mouse model through a two-bottle choice (sucrose fading mode and normal mode) and chronic intermittent alcohol vapor (combined with intraperitoneal injection) and randomly allocated mice into exercise groups to undergo treadmill training. Learning and memory abilities were assessed through the Morris water maze test and spontaneous activity was evaluated using the open field test. The levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus were quantified using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits. The findings reveal that after cessation of alcohol consumption, learning and memory abilities in AUD mice did not completely return to normal levels. The observed enhancement of cognitive functions in AUD mice through aerobic exercise may be attributed to restoring levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, boosting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations, and facilitating an increase in hippocampal mass. These results offer empirical evidence to support aerobic exercise as a viable therapeutic strategy to alleviate cognitive deficits associated with AUD.
   The article investigates the impact of aerobic exercise on learning and memory in mice with alcohol use disorder following a period of abstinence from alcohol. It elucidates the relationship between cognitive abilities and molecular mechanisms, with a specific focus on assessing the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. image

AB  - Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a main cause of hospital-acquired fungal infections. Combination therapy is promising as a novel anti-C. albicans strategy because of its better efficacy. Theasaponins are pentacyclic triterpenes in the Camellia genus with multiple biological activities. Our previous studies prove that theasaponins display inhibitory activity against C. albicans. Ascorbic acid (VC) is a vitamin found in many plants that shows potential in combination therapy. However, whether VC enhances the activity of theasaponins remains unclear. In this study, the checkerboard micro-dilution method was used to assess the effect of VC (0-80 mmol/L) on the anti-C. albicans effect of theasaponins (0-1000 mu g/mL). Then, the effects of theasaponins (31.25 mu g/mL), VC (80 mmol/L), and theasaponins (31.25 mu g/mL) + VC (80 mmol/L) on C. albicans planktonic cells and different stages of biofilm formation were assessed. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms. According to the results, VC enhanced the anti-planktonic and anti-biofilm effect of theasaponins against C. albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentration of theasaponins was significantly decreased and the fungicidal efficiency was increased with the addition of VC. VC remarkably aggravated the suppression of theasaponins with regard to various virulence factors of C. albicans, including adhesion, early biofilm formation, mature biofilm, cell surface hydrophobicity, and phospholipase activity. Compared with the theasaponins or VC groups, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species was higher, while the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate were lower in the combination group, suggesting more severe oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, and energy deficiency. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the combination predominantly suppressed the pathways of glycolysis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and cysteine and methionine metabolism. This implied that energy deficiency and redox imbalance were associated with the anti-C. albicans activity of the combination. These results prove that VC enhances the inhibitory effect of theasaponins against C. albicans and that the combination has the potential to be used as a topical antifungal therapy or disinfectant.

AB  - The oil fraction will affect the aggregation behavior and structural strength of emulsion gels. In this study, the effect of the camellia oil (CO) fraction on the properties of emulsion gels stabilized by regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) was studied. The results showed that CO was essential for gel formation, with oil droplets incorporated into the RSF matrix as anchors to achieve rapid gelation of RSF. The gel hardness significantly increased from 20.03 to 53.35 g as the fraction of CO increased from 5 % to 25 %. The oxidation stability of the emulsion gels was also improved, and the peroxide value (POV) decreased from 2419.3 to 839.9 mu mol/kg. As the oil fraction rose from 5 % to 25 %, the percentage of released free fatty acids decreased from 73.24 % to 59.49 % due to forming a more compact gel structure. In addition, the rheological results revealed that all emulsion gels had a shear-thinning behavior and good temperature stability in the range of 5 to 90 degrees C. This study provided a theoretical basis for preparing RSF-based emulsion gels, helps in the recycling of silk protein resources, and promotes the development of emulsion gel applications in the food industry.

TI  - Running exercise alleviates hippocampal neuroinflammation and shifts the balance of microglial M1/M2 polarization through adiponectin/AdipoR1 pathway activation in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress

AB  - Running exercise has been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms. However, the mechanism underlying the antidepressant effects of running exercise is not fully understood. The imbalance of M1/M2 microglia phenotype/polarization and concomitant dysregulation of neuroinflammation play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of depression. Running exercise increases circulating levels of adiponectin which is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and suppress inflammatory responses. AdipoR1 is an adiponectin receptor that is involved in regulating microglial phenotypes and activation states. However, whether running exercise regulates hippocampal microglial phenotypes and neuroinflammation through adiponectin/AdipoR1 to exert its antidepressant effects remains unclear. In the current study, 4 weeks of running exercise significantly alleviated the depressive-like behaviors of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-exposed mice. Moreover, running exercise decreased the microglial numbers and altered microglial morphology in three subregions of the hippocampus to restore the M1/M2 balance; these effects were accompanied by regulation of pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine production and secretion in CUS-exposed mice. These effects may involve elevation of peripheral tissue (adipose tissue and muscle) and plasma adiponectin levels, and hippocampal AdipoR1 levels as well as activation of the AMPK-NF-kappa B/STAT3 signaling pathway by running exercise. When an adeno-associated virus was used to knock down hippocampal AdipoR1, mice showed depressive-like behaviors and alterations in microglia and inflammatory factor expression in the hippocampus that were similar to those observed in CUS-exposed mice. Together, these results suggest that running exercise maintains the M1/M2 balance and inhibits neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of CUS-exposed mice. These effects might occur via adiponectin/AdipoR1-mediated activation of the AMPK-NF-kappa B/STAT3 signaling pathway.

AB  - Clasmatodendrosis (an autophagic astroglial degeneration) plays an important role in the regulation of spontaneous seizure duration but not seizure frequency or behavioral seizure severity in chronic epilepsy rats. Recently, it has been reported that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor to glutathione (GSH), attenuates clasmatodendritic degeneration and shortens spontaneous seizure duration in chronic epilepsy rats, although the underlying mechanisms of its anti-convulsive effects are not fully understood. To elucidate this, the present study was designed to investigate whether NAC affects astroglial glutamine synthase (GS) expression mediated by GSH peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and/or peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) in the epileptic hippocampus. As compared to control animals, GS and GPx1 expressions were upregulated in reactive CA1 astrocytes of chronic epilepsy rats, while their expressions were significantly decreased in clasmatodendritic CA1 astrocytes and reactive astrocytes within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Prdx6 expression was increased in reactive CA1 astrocytes as well as clasmatodendritic CA1 astrocytes. In the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, Prdx6 expression levels were similar to those in control animals. NAC ameliorated clasmatodendrosis through the increment of GS and GPx1 expressions, while it abolished Prdx6 upregulation. 1-hexadecyl-3-(trifluoroethgl)-sn-glycerol-2 phosphomethanol (MJ33, a selective inhibitor of aiPLA2 activity of Prdx6) alleviated clasmatodendrosis by enhancing GPx1 and GS expressions in clasmatodendritic CA1 astrocytes without changing the Prdx6 level. NAC or MJ33 did not affect GS, GPx1 and Prdx6 expression in astrocytes within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that upregulated aiPLA2 activity of Prdx6 may abolish GPx1-mediated GS preservation and lead to clasmatodendrosis in CA1 astrocytes, which would extend spontaneous seizure duration due to impaired glutamate-glutamine conversion regulated by GS. Therefore, the present data suggest that aiPLA2 activity of Prdx6 in astrocytes may be one of the upstream effectors of seizure duration in the epileptic hippocampus.

AB  - The effect of microwave pretreatment and moisture levels of Camelina sativa seeds on the quality of extracted oil by cold press was investigated. The seed moistures were adjusted to 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10.0% and pretreated with microwaves for 0, 1, 2, and 3 min. Microwave pretreatment (3 min) of the seeds with 2.5% moisture increased the oil extraction yield by similar to 11% compared to the control sample. The highest amount of acidity (0.564 g FFA<middle dot>g(-1) oil), peroxide value (2.4 meq O-2<middle dot>kg(-1) oil), carotenoid (5.26 mg<middle dot>kg(-1) oil), and browning index (0.710) were found in the oil extracted from seeds with 10% moisture and 3 min microwave pretreatment. The total phenolic compound was increased by microwave pretreatment but was mitigated by the seed moisture content, and the highest amount (208.24 mg caffeic acid<middle dot>100 g(-1) oil) was observed at 3 min microwave pretreatment of the seeds with 2.5% moisture. Chlorophyll content decreased by both microwave pretreatment and seed moisture content in camelina oil. Generally, the fatty acid composition of the extracted oils was not affected by the seed pretreatments. In conclusion, pretreatment of the camelina seeds before oil extraction is suggested to obtain a high oil extraction yield with a good quality oil.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bupleurum chinense DC.-Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (BS) is a classic drug pair that has good clinical effects on depression and many tumors. However, the concurrent targeting mechanism of how the aforementioned drug pair is valid in the two distinct diseases, has not been clarified yet. Aim of the study: The components of BS were detected by LC-MS, combined with network pharmacology to explore the active ingredients and common targeting mechanism of its multi-pathway regulation of BS in treating depression and CRC, and to validate the dual effects of BS using the CUMS mice model and orthotopic transplantation tumor mice model of CRC. Results: Twenty-nine components were screened, 84 common gene targets were obteined, and the top 5 key targets including STAT3, PIK3R1, PIK3CA, AKT1, IL-6 were identified by PPI network. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signaling pathways might play a crucial role of BS in regulating depression and CRC. BS significantly modulated CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior, attenuated neuronal damage, and reduced serum EPI and NE levels in CUMS model mice. BS improved the pathological histological changes of solid tumors and liver tissues and inhibited solid tumors and liver metastases in tumor-bearing mice. BS significantly decreased the proteins' expression of IL-6, p-JAK2, p-STAT3, p-PI3K, p-AKT1 in hippocampal tissues and solid tumors, and regulated the levels of IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 in serum of two models of mice. Conclusion: BS can exert dual antidepressant and anti-CRC effects by inhibiting the expression of IL-6/JAK2/ STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathway proteins and regulating the release of inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - The central nervous system, information integration center of the body, is mainly composed of neurons and glial cells. The neuron is one of the most basic and important structural and functional units of the central nervous system, with sensory stimulation and excitation conduction functions. Astrocytes and microglia belong to the glial cell family, which is the main source of cytokines and represents the main defense system of the central nervous system. Nerve cells undergo neurotransmission or gliotransmission, which regulates neuronal activity via the ion channels, receptors, or transporters expressed on nerve cell membranes. Ion channels, composed of large transmembrane proteins, play crucial roles in maintaining nerve cell homeostasis. These channels are also important for control of the membrane potential and in the secretion of neurotransmitters. A variety of cellular functions and life activities, including functional regulation of the central nervous system, the generation and conduction of nerve excitation, the occurrence of receptor potential, heart pulsation, smooth muscle peristalsis, skeletal muscle contraction, and hormone secretion, are closely related to ion channels associated with passive transmembrane transport. Two types of ion channels in the central nervous system, potassium channels and calcium channels, are closely related to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Accordingly, various drugs that can affect these ion channels have been explored deeply to provide new directions for the treatment of these neurological disorders. In this review, we focus on the functions of potassium and calcium ion channels in different nerve cells and their involvement in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy, autism, and rare disorders. We also describe several clinical drugs that target potassium or calcium channels in nerve cells and could be used to treat these disorders. We concluded that there are few clinical drugs that can improve the pathology these diseases by acting on potassium or calcium ions. Although a few novel ion-channel-specific modulators have been discovered, meaningful therapies have largely not yet been realized. The lack of target-specific drugs, their requirement to cross the blood-brain barrier, and their exact underlying mechanisms all need further attention. This review aims to explain the urgent problems that need research progress and provide comprehensive information aiming to arouse the research community's interest in the development of ion channel-targeting drugs and the identification of new therapeutic targets for that can increase the cure rate of nervous system diseases and reduce the occurrence of adverse reactions in other systems.

AB  - Background: Shi chang pu (Acorus tatarinowii Schott) is a herbal used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China. The essential oil of Shi chang pu (SCP-oil) is the main active component. However, its effects on the neuroinflammation of AD have not been well studied.
   Purpose: Neuroinflammation mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in AD. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of SCP-oil on cognitive impairment of App(Swe)/PSEN1(M146)V/MAPT(P301L) triple transgenic (3 x Tg-AD) mice model and investigate the mechanism underlying its anti-inflammation effects.
   Methods: Thirty-two 3 x Tg-AD mice at 12 months and 8 wild-type B6 mice were used for this experiment. The 3 x Tg-AD mice were administered with SCP-oil or donepezil hydrochloride for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test and step-down test were used to evaluate the cognitive ability of mice. The pathological changes, neuroinflammation, and the NLRP3 inflammasome related-protein of AD mice were detected by histomorphological examination, TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, Elisa, and western blot assays.
   Results: SCP-oil treatment attenuated cognitive dysfunction of 3 x Tg-AD mice. Moreover, SCP-oil also ameliorated characteristics pathological of AD, such as pathological changes damage, deposition of A beta, phosphorylation of Tau, and neuronal loss. Additionally, SCP-oil treatment alleviated the neuroinflammation and inhibited phosphorylation of IKK beta, NF-kappa B, and NLRP3 inflammasome related-protein NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, cleavedCaspase-1, and GSDMD-N in the hippocampus of 3 x Tg-AD mice.
   Conclusion: Overall, SCP-oil contributed to neuroprotection in 3 x Tg-AD mice by reduced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Hippocampal plasticity is hypothesized to play a role in the etiopathogenesis of depression and the antidepressant effect of medications. One form of plasticity that is unique to the hippocampus and is involved in depression-related behaviors in animal models is adult neurogenesis. While chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) strongly promotes neurogenesis, less is known about its acute effects and little is known about the neurogenic effects of other forms of stimulation therapy, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Here, we investigated the time course of acute ECS and rTMS effects on markers of cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Mice were subjected to a single session of ECS, 10 Hz rTMS (10-rTMS), or intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). Mice in both TMS groups were injected with BrdU 2 days before stimulation to label immature cells. One, 3, or 7 days later, hippocampi were collected and immunostained for BrdU + cells, actively proliferating PCNA + cells, and immature DCX + neurons. Following ECS, mice displayed a transient increase in cell proliferation at 3 days post-stimulation. At 7 days post-stimulation there was an elevation in the number of proliferating neuronal precursor cells (PCNA + DCX +), specifically in the ventral hippocampus. iTBS and rTMS did not alter the number of BrdU + cells, proliferating cells, or immature neurons at any of the post-stimulation time points. Our results suggest that neurostimulation treatments exert different effects on hippocampal neurogenesis, where ECS may have greater neurogenic potential than iTBS and 10-rTMS.

AB  - Despite Alzheimer's disease (AD) representing a significant global health concern, disease-modifying therapeutic options remain elusive. The use of animal models of the disease to develop drugs intended for the treatment of AD does not always predict their efficacy in clinical trials. Our research demonstrates the benefits of a drug-withdrawal approach to screening AD-modifying compounds, focussing on beta-amyloid (A beta)-related pathological changes in APP/PS1 transgenic mice at different stages of the disease. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we examined the AD-modifying effect of donepezil as a reference drug. A significant cognitive decline exhibited by APP/PS1 transgenic mice from 8.4 months of age was accompanied by progressive accumulation of A beta plaques, decreased synaptophysin and vesicular acetylcholine transporter immunoexpression. Donepezil had a disease-modifying effect, slowing the deterioration of all the pathological markers studied when treatment was started in a pre-symptomatic stage of AD. However, in the group of mice with advanced stage of AD, such disease-modifying effects were not evident.

AB  - Purpose: Magnolol (MA) exhibits anti-depressant effect by inhibiting inflammation. However, its effect on microglia polarization remains not fully understood. Herein, our study was performed to evaluate the effect of MA on microglia polarization in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression and explore its potential mechanism.
   Study design: The CUMS procedure was conducted, and the mice were intragastrically treated with MA. BV2 cells were pretreated with MA prior to LPS/ATP challenge.
   Methods: The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-4, IL-10 in brain and BV2 cells were examined by ELISA. The mRNA expressions of Arg1, Ym1, Fizz1 and Klf4 in brains were measured. ROS content was determined using flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence was employed to evaluate Iba-1 level, Nrf2 nuclear translocation, Iba-1(+)CD16/32(+) and Iba-1(+)CD206(+) cell population. The protein expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, NLRP3, caspase-1 p20 and IL-1 beta in brains and BV2 cells were investigated by western blot. Nrf2 siRNA was induced in experiments to explore the role of Nrf2 in MA-mediated microglia polarization. The ubiquitination of Nrf2 was visualized by Co-IP.
   Results: The treatment with MA notably relieved depressive like behaviors, suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, promoted anti-inflammatory cytokines and the transcription of M2 phenotype microglia-specific indicators. MA upregulated the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, downregulated the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 p20, IL-1 beta both in vivo and in vitro. MA also reduced ROS concentration, promoted Nrf2 nucleus translocation and prevented Nrf2 ubiquitination. Nrf2 Knockdown by siRNA abolished the MA-mediated microglia polarization.
   Conclusion: The present research demonstrated that MA attenuated CUMS-stimulated depression by inhibiting M1 polarization and inducing M2 polarization via Nrf2/HO-1/NLRP3 signaling.

AB  - It has long been asserted that failure to recover from central nervous system diseases is due to the system's intricate structure and the regenerative incapacity of adult neurons. Yet over recent decades, numerous studies have established that endogenous neurogenesis occurs in the adult central nervous system, including humans'. This has challenged the long-held scientific consensus that the number of adult neurons remains constant, and that new central nervous system neurons cannot be created or renewed. Herein, we present a comprehensive overview of the alterations and regulatory mechanisms of endogenous neurogenesis following central nervous system injury, and describe novel treatment strategies that target endogenous neurogenesis and newborn neurons in the treatment of central nervous system injury. Central nervous system injury frequently results in alterations of endogenous neurogenesis, encompassing the activation, proliferation, ectopic migration, differentiation, and functional integration of endogenous neural stem cells. Because of the unfavorable local microenvironment, most activated neural stem cells differentiate into glial cells rather than neurons. Consequently, the injury-induced endogenous neurogenesis response is inadequate for repairing impaired neural function. Scientists have attempted to enhance endogenous neurogenesis using various strategies, including using neurotrophic factors, bioactive materials, and cell reprogramming techniques. Used alone or in combination, these therapeutic strategies can promote targeted migration of neural stem cells to an injured area, ensure their survival and differentiation into mature functional neurons, and facilitate their integration into the neural circuit. Thus can integration replenish lost neurons after central nervous system injury, by improving the local microenvironment. By regulating each phase of endogenous neurogenesis, endogenous neural stem cells can be harnessed to promote effective regeneration of newborn neurons. This offers a novel approach for treating central nervous system injury.

AB  - Matcha tea has been used as an adjunct in weight loss programs. The weight loss effects of matcha tea were evaluated in a prospective non-randomized open-label comparative study of overweight and obese individuals who followed a specified low-calorie diet (LCD) plan. A total of 40 participants were enrolled and assigned to either matcha tea or control groups. The matcha tea group followed a LCD plan and received matcha tea once daily, whereas the control group followed only the LCD diet plan. The study lasted 12 weeks. The main outcome measures included anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, obesity-related hormone peptides, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress biomarkers. Thirty-four participants had completed the study. The matcha tea and control groups showed significant reductions in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, water content, minerals, and fat mass at week 12. The post-treatment body composition and anthropometric measurements were not significantly different between the two groups. The matcha tea group showed a potential increase in HDL-C, a potential decrease in blood glucose, and a potential increase in HbA1c. Furthermore, the study indicated a potential decrease in insulin and leptin levels, a potential increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase, and a potential decreased activity of glutathione peroxidase. IL-10 was increased by matcha tea consumption. The data suggest that matcha tea may have some potential effect on weight loss, along with anti-inflammatory properties. The findings of this study will be used to design a multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine the potential weight loss benefits of matcha tea.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine the factors affecting the metallurgical quality of cast iron during serial production of castings using a campaign cupola and a holding furnace. The problem to be solved, which was to obtain cast iron with the required mechanical properties while reducing the internal porosity, results from the foundry's need to increase the metallurgical quality of the alloy. The increasing difficulty and complicated constructions of castings, for which it is not possible to introduce risers at the stage of technological design, make the stage of proper preparation of cast iron the only way to obtain castings without shrinkage defects. The article presents the results of the study of physicochemical and mechanical properties, microstructure and shrinkage tendency of ductile iron depending on the charge materials used, the amount of Mg used during spheroidization and the type of final inoculants. Step castings and wedge tests were produced on a vertical molding line. The spheroidization was carried out by injecting a core wire containing Mg alloy into the cast iron. The final inoculation of 0.2% was performed using a pneumatic dispenser equipped with a vision system to control the effectiveness of the inoculation. The ITACA Meltdeck thermal analysis system was used to study the physicochemical properties of the initial cast iron, and the ITACA X system to analyze the state of the final cast iron on the molding line. Mechanical tests were performed on samples cut from a stepped casting, and microstructure tests were carried out using a light microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The results of thermal analyses show that increasing the share of pig iron at the expense of steel increases the minimum solidification temperature of eutectic, and thus, increases the potential for graphite nucleation in cast iron. Increasing the nucleation potential can be obtained by adding anthracite, FeSi and SiC. A very important factor in obtaining cast iron of high metallurgical quality is the possible limitation during spheroidization of the length of the core wire containing Mg, which is a carbide-forming element. The lower the initial sulfur level, the greater the possibility of reducing the amount of cored wire. The inoculants containing Ce and Bi were the most advantageous final inoculants from the point of view of obtaining the best microstructure parameters and plastic properties of cast iron.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that mothers experience stress before or during pregnancy, which can significantly impact their GABAergic system and lead to amygdala hyperactivity. While animal models are expected to reflect the above findings in humans, the current knowledge on the effects of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rat dams remains insufficient. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the structural and neurochemical alterations in the dorsal hippocampus, specifically gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) relative to total creatine (tCr), induced by the CUMS and the effects of antidepressant mirtazapine (MIR) treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used in rat dams at two time points to assess the reversibility of these alterations. Eight weeks post-CUMS, chronic stress induced significant alterations in hippocampal metabolism and structural changes, including lower GABA/tCr concentrations and an increased amygdala volume compared to controls. In stressed dams treated with MIR, no changes in GABA levels or amygdala volume were observed. Fourteen weeks post-CUMS, no significant changes in hippocampal neurochemistry were confirmed, while amygdala changes persisted in stressed dams. Moreover, significant time-dependent changes were observed in the amygdala and hypothalamus in the control group with MIR. Interestingly, high-resolution respirometry was performed to assess brain mitochondrial function, revealing only changes in this group. Based on these findings, we confirmed the reversibility of metabolite. Furthermore, MIR has demonstrated potential in regulating neurotransmitter levels and protecting amygdala volume after stress; however, further research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic effects.

AB  - Hyssopus officinalis L. is one of the most important medicinal plants in traditional medicine used to treat seizures. In this study, we assessed the effects of H. officinalis hydroalcoholic extract against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in rat. The anti-seizure activity of the extract was assessed in three doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg. Kindling was induced by intraperitoneal injection of PTZ (35 mg/kg) every 48 h, and H. officinalis extract was administered daily and behavioral tests performed. The possible involvement of GABA receptors in the extract activity was investigated using flumazenil. Tonic seizure threshold and mortality rate were measured following intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg PTZ on the 14th day, following 14 days administration of H. officinalis hydroalcoholic extract. Blood and hippocampus samples were prepared to measure brain and serum antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO). Finally, the expression of GABA receptor gene in brain tissue was investigated. H. officinalis extract increased tonic seizure threshold and decreased mortality due to PTZ. Flumazenil, as a GABA receptor antagonist, reduced the tonic seizure threshold. Extract treatment significantly improved memory and learning, increased brain antioxidant capacity, decreased brain MDA and NO in kindled rats. It also increased GABA receptor gene expression in pre-treated groups compared to the negative control group. H. officinalis extract probably exerts potential antiepileptic effects through the GABAergic system. Also, H. officinalis extract has a supportive effect against hippocampal neuronal damage and improves memory and learning in kindled rats.

AB  - Background: Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) in dogs indicates a particular set of upper airway abnormalities found in brachycephalic dogs (e.g., French bulldogs). Stenotic nares is one of the primary BOAS-related abnormalities restricting the functional breathing of affected dogs. For severe stenosis, rhinoplasty is required to increase the accessibility of the external nostril to air; however, the specific improvement from surgery in terms of respiratory physiology and uptake of inhaled air has not been fully elucidated Method: This study employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate the effects of different stenotic intensities on airflow patterns in a total of eight French bulldog upper airways. A bulldog with severe stenosis after surgery was included to examine the efficacy of the surgical intervention. Results: The results showed homogeneous airflow distributions in healthy and mild stenosis cases and significantly accelerated airstreams at the constricted positions in moderate and severe stenosis bulldogs. The airflow resistance was over 20-fold greater in severe stenosis cases than the healthy cases. After surgery, a decrease in airflow velocity was observed in the surgical region, and the percentage of reduced airflow resistance was approximately 4%. Conclusions: This study suggests impaired breathing function in brachycephalic dogs with moderate and severe stenosis. The results also serve as a reference for veterinarians in surgical planning and monitoring bulldogs' recuperation after surgery.

AB  - Background: Ethanol (Eth.) abuse induces memory impairment. Oxidative damage and apoptosis are considered the likely causes of memory impairment. Silymarin (Sil.) is a flavonoid isolated from the plant Silymarin marianum (milk thistle). While studies have reported the neuroprotective effect of Sil. against neurodegenerative processes, the precise mechanism of action of Sil. in Eth.-induced memory impairment remains unclear.Methods: Twenty-eight rats were equally divided into four groups: Control (saline 1 ml/rat); Sil. (200 mg/kg for 30 days); Eth. (2 g/kg/day for 30 days); and Sil. + Eth. Behavioral tests including inhibitory avoidance and open field were used to investigate memory and locomotion. Brain antioxidant parameters, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity and total thiol group, plus oxidative parameters, including malondialdehyde and total oxidant status, followed by hippocampal apoptosis (Bax/Bcl2, cleaved caspase) and histopathological changes were evaluated in the groups.Results: While the administration of Eth. impaired memory, Sil. significantly reversed Eth-induced memory deficits. Eth. administration also augmented brain oxidative and hippocampal apoptosis parameters. In contrast, a marked reduction in brain antioxidant and anti-apoptotic parameters was observed in the Eth. group. At the tissue level, hippocampal sections from Eth.-treated animals revealed severe neuronal damage. The administration of Sil. to Eth.-treated rats remarkably alleviated all the said Eth.-induced biochemical and histopathological effects. On the contrary, Sil. alone did not change the behavior and biochemical/molecular parameters. Conclusion: The memory-enhancing effect of Sil. in Eth.-induced demented rats may be partly mediated by the augmented antioxidant effects and amelioration of apoptotic and histopathological changes.

AB  - Transcranial magneto-acoustic stimulation (TMAS), which is characterized by high spatiotemporal resolution and high penetrability, is a non-invasive neuromodulation technology based on the magnetic-acoustic coupling effect. To reveal the effects of TMAS treatment on amyloid-beta (A beta) plaque and synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease, we conducted a comparative analysis of TMAS and transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) based on acoustic effects in 5xFAD mice and BV2 microglia cells. We found that the TMAS-TUS treatment effectively reduced amyloid plaque loads and plaque-associated neurotoxicity. Additionally, TMAS-TUS treatment ameliorated impairments in long-term memory formation and long-term potentiation. Moreover, TMAS-TUS treatment stimulated microglial proliferation and migration while enhancing the phagocytosis and clearance of A beta. In 5xFAD mice with induced microglial exhaustion, TMAS-TUS treatment-mediated A beta plaque reduction, synaptic rehabilitation improvement, and the increase in phospho-AKT levels were diminished. Overall, our study highlights that stimulation of hippocampal microglia by TMAS treatment can induce anti-cognitive impairment effects via PI3K-AKT signaling, providing hope for the development of new strategies for an adjuvant therapy for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Maintenance of body temperature within physiological range is critical for the fetal and neonatal development. Hyperthermia is one of the most frequently encountered pediatric complaints and may cause neurological disorders due to neuronal injury. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of hyperthermia on behavioral alterations, neuronal survival, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in young male Sprague-Dawley rats. Twenty-one 13-day-old rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 7 per group). Body temperature was increased to 39 degrees C and 41 degrees C in a hyperthermia induction chamber for 30 min, whereas the animals in control group were maintained at 36 degrees C. Twenty-four hours after hyperthermia, animals were subjected to the open field test, elevated-O-maze test, and grip strength test to assess the locomotor activity, anxiety, and motor function. Neuronal survival, apoptosis, and cell proliferation were investigated in cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions, and corpus callosum (CC). Decreased locomotor activity and motor function and increased anxiety were observed in the hyperthermia groups, and these were more pronounced in the 41 degrees C group. Neuronal survival was significantly decreased in DG, CA1, and CC in the hyperthermia groups (**p < 0.01). Apoptosis was significantly induced in cortex, DG, and CC of the animals exposed to heat (*p < 0.05). In addition, cell proliferation positivity decreased significantly only in DG and CC of the animals exposed to heat (*p < 0.05). Our results suggest that neurobehavioral deficits caused by hyperthermia may be due to the increased apoptosis and neuronal cell death and decreased cell proliferation in the brain of postnatal developing rats.

AB  - The cumulative damage caused by repetitive mild traumatic brain injury can cause long-term neurodegeneration leading to cognitive impairment. This cognitive impairment is thought to result specifically from damage to the hippocampus. In this study, we detected cognitive impairment in mice 6 weeks after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury using the novel object recognition test and the Morris water maze test. Immunofluorescence staining showed that p-tau expression was increased in the hippocampus after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. Golgi staining showed a significant decrease in the total density of neuronal dendritic spines in the hippocampus, as well as in the density of mature dendritic spines. To investigate the specific molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment due to hippocampal damage, we performed proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of the hippocampus with and without repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. The differentially expressed proteins were mainly enriched in inflammation, immunity, and coagulation, suggesting that non-neuronal cells are involved in the pathological changes that occur in the hippocampus in the chronic stage after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. In contrast, differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins were mainly enriched in pathways related to neuronal function and structure, which is more consistent with neurodegeneration. We identified N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 as a hub molecule involved in the response to repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, and western blotting showed that, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 expression was not altered in the hippocampus after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, its phosphorylation level was significantly increased, which is consistent with the omics results. Administration of GRP78608, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 antagonist, to the hippocampus markedly improved repetitive mild traumatic brain injury-induced cognitive impairment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 signaling in the hippocampus is involved in cognitive impairment in the chronic stage after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and may be a potential target for intervention and treatment.

AB  - Background Low-temperature severely limits the growth and development of Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade plays a key role in the response to cold stress. Methods and results Our study aims to identify MAPK cascade genes in C. oleifera and reveal their roles in response to cold stress. In our study, we systematically identified and analyzed the MAPK cascade gene families of C. oleifera, including their physical and chemical properties, conserved motifs, and multiple sequence alignments. In addition, we characterized the interacting networks of MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK)-MAPK kinase (MAPKK)-MAPK in C. oleifera. The molecular mechanism of cold stress resistance of MAPK cascade genes in wild C. oleifera was analyzed by differential gene expression and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Conclusion In this study, 21 MAPKs, 4 MAPKKs and 55 MAPKKKs genes were identified in the leaf transcriptome of C. oleifera. According to the phylogenetic results, MAPKs were divided into 4 groups (A, B, C and D), MAPKKs were divided into 3 groups (A, B and D), and MAPKKKs were divided into 2 groups (MEKK and Raf). Motif analysis showed that the motifs in each subfamily were conserved, and most of the motifs in the same subfamily were basically the same. The protein interaction network based on Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) homologs revealed that MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK genes were widely involved in C. oleifera growth and development and in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Gene expression analysis revealed that the CoMAPKKK5/CoMAPKKK43/CoMAPKKK49-CoMAPKK4-CoMAPK8 module may play a key role in the cold stress resistance of wild C. oleifera at a high-elevation site in Lu Mountain (LSG). This study can facilitate the mining and utilization of genetic resources of C. oleifera with low-temperature tolerance.

AB  - Dysfunction of the corticolimbic system, particularly at the dendritic spine level, is a recognized core mechanism in neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (NVHL) in Sprague-Dawley rats induces both a schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotype and dendritic spine pathology (reduced total number and mature spines) in corticolimbic areas, which is mitigated by antipsychotics. However, there is limited information on the impact of rat strain on NVHL outcomes and antipsychotic effects. We compared the behavioral performance in the open field, novel object recognition (NORT), and social interaction tests, as well as structural neuroplasticity with the Golgi-Cox stain in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) male rats with and without NVHL. Additionally, we explored the effect of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone (RISP). WKY rats with NVHL displayed motor hyperactivity without impairments in memory and social behavior, accompanied by dendritic spine pathology in the neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) layer 3 and basolateral amygdala. RISP treatment reduced motor activity and had subtle and selective effects on the neuroplasticity alterations. In SH rats, NVHL increased the time spent in the border area during the open field test, impaired the short-term performance in NORT, and reduced social interaction time, deficits that were corrected after RISP administration. The NVHL caused dendritic spine pathology in the PFC layers 3 and 5 of SH rats, which RISP treatment ameliorated. Our results support the utility of the NVHL model for exploring neuroplasticity mechanisms in schizophrenia and understanding pharmacotherapy.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to compare the estimated metabolisable energy requirements (MER) of fattening light lambs raised in feedlot with the U. S. National Research Council (NRC) predictions. Body weight (BW) gain and feed intake were collected from 15 pens (7 lambs/pen) of Manchega male lambs under on-farm conditions over six weeks. The pens were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments (5 pens/treatment) consisting of three concentrates of different composition and barley straw. Feeds were offered for ad libitum consumption throughout the experimental period. Average daily metabolisable energy intake (MEI) was calculated on a weekly basis for each pen from the average daily consumption of concentrate and barley straw and their respective ME contents. Following, the average daily MER was predicted for each pen from the weekly average of both BW and BW gain, according to two models: One including the adjustment of ME for body maintenance (MEm) for the effect of level of MEI on visceral organ tissue energy use as described by NRC (Model 1), and the other excluding such adjustment (Model 2). Model 1 had no mean bias, and exhibited a higher concordance correlation coefficient and a lower underprediction, supporting the need for the upward adjustment of MEm in accordance with MEI to enhance the precision and accuracy of predicted MER. It was concluded that the NRC method was precise and accurate enough to support its application for calculating the MER of feedlot light lambs.
   A dataset comprising metabolisable energy (ME) intake and growth performance data of Manchega male lambs was utilised. The lambs' ME requirements were predicted according to the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) methods. Our data agree with NRC predictions, supporting its use in feedlot Manchega lambs.

AB  - Gut microbiota delays aging by regulating the immune, metabolic, and neurological functions of the host. However, current research on novel probiotics with antiaging properties significantly lags, impacting their application in clinical treatments. In this study, metagenomics, culturomics, and probiotic property screening were used to identify Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 as a potential probiotic with anti-aging properties. In addition, B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 effectively improved the behavioral characteristics, significantly reduced the levels of the age-related protein beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) (BP: M = 0.81 vs. 1.13, p < 0.05), attenuated neuronal damage in the hippocampus, and improved the composition of the gut microbiota of senescence-accelerated mouse tendency-8 (SAMP8) mice. The targeted metabolomics suggested that L-tryptophan (L-Trp) may be a key substance for B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 to exert anti-aging effects (BP: M = 14878.6 ng/mL vs. 5464.99 ng/mL, p < 0.01). Mechanistically, using the aging model of SAMP8 mice and HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells, it was found that B. pseudocatenulatum NCU-08 might enter the intestine to regulate L-Trp, and then transport it to the brain. In the brain, L-Trp was metabolized to NAD(+), which activated the Sirt1/P53/P21/Rb signaling pathway, thereby exerting antiaging effects. Interestingly, this antiaging effect was inhibited after the intervention of the Sirt1 inhibitor EX-527. This study is the first to confirm the antiaging properties of NCU-08 isolated from the fecal samples of seven centenarians in Jiangxi Province, providing data support for the future development of probiotic preparations with antiaging effects.

AB  - The recovery and use of oil crops' byproducts is becoming essential to assure the sustainability of biodiesel production. This work aims to study oil cakes obtained from three second-generation oil feedstocks, i.e., Brassica juncea, Brassica carinata, and Camelina sativa, to be used as animal feed. To do so oil cakes were characterized for crude protein content, fibre fractions, macro- and micro-nutrient composition. Fatty acids and amino acid profiles and energy contents were also determined. Results indicated good nutritional properties for the oil cakes, particularly for AA and FA. A preliminary study to evaluate the effect of cakes' recovery on biodiesel production sustainability indicated a GHG reduction vs. petroleum diesel of 70 %, 67 %, 65 % for B. carinata, B. juncea, C. sativa, respectively. These data may be compared with the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II, 2021) of the EU that asks for a GHG reduction of 65 %.

AB  - In the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, the deposition of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) is associated with oxidative stress, leading to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. We have already reported that betaine (glycine betaine), an osmolyte and methyl donor in cells, prevents the development of cognitive impairment in mice with intracerebroventricular injection of A beta(25-35), an active fragment of A beta, associated with oxidative stress in the hippocampus, but molecular mechanisms of betaine remain to be determined. Here, to investigate a key molecule underlying the preventive effect of betaine against cognitive impairments in A beta(25-35)-injected mice, cognitive tests and qPCR assays were performed in A beta(25-35)-injected mice with continuous betaine intake, in which intake was started a day before A beta(25-35) injection, and then continued for 8 days. The A beta(25-35) injection impaired short-term and object recognition memories in the Y-maze and object recognition tests, respectively. PCR assays revealed the down-regulation of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that mediates metabolic responses, in the hippocampus of A beta(25-35)-injected mice, whereas betaine intake prevented memory deficits as well as the decrease of hippocampal SIRT1 expression in A beta(25-35)-injected mice. Further, sirtinol, an inhibitor of the Sirtuin family, blocked the preventive effect of betaine against memory deficits. On the other hand, resveratrol, the potent compound that activates SIRT1, also prevented memory impairments in A beta(25-35)-injected mice, suggesting that SIRT1 plays a causative role in the preventive effect of betaine against memory deficits caused by A beta exposure.

AB  - Artificial photonic synapses have set off a new upsurge for mimicking a series of neural activities in recent years. In particular, the investigation of learning and memory behaviors with pressure or emotion and corresponding mechanisms is currently the focus of more attention. Herein, a hippocampus-inspired device based on MoS2 for illumination time encoding is fabricated, in which the encryption technology is employed for data security. In addition, the pressure-induced memory behaviors with full memory function (memory trace) over time such as encoding, storage and retrieval are demonstrated, resulting from the decreasing positive photocurrent of the MoS2 devices. The proposed mechanism of the memory effect when exposed to the light is elucidated in detail. Moreover, the effect of stress hormone on memory behavior is displayed via different illumination time periods and light intensities. These results indicate the potential application of MoS2 devices in artificial neural network.

AB  - An estimated 20% of women experience depression at some point during menopause. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), as the main therapy for depression and other menopausal syndromes, comes with a few undesirable side effects and a potential increase in cancer and cardiovascular risk. Consequently, there is a dire need for the development of new therapies to treat menopausal depression. Oxidative stress combined with the decline in sex hormones might explain the occurrence of psychological symptoms characteristic of menopause. Therefore, antioxidants have been suggested as a promising therapy for aging-associated diseases, such as menopausal depression. As a flavonoid antioxidant, kaempferol might have a potential neuroprotective action. Hence, the study was conducted to assess the potential antidepressant action of kaempferol and clarify the underlying mechanism. The results show that kaempferol has potential beneficial effects on VCD-induced rodent model of menopausal depression and produces antioxidant effects as well as increases the deacetylation of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and the protein level of Sirtuin3 (Sirt3) in the hippocampus. On the contrary, Sirt3 depletion abrogated the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects as well as antioxidant effects of kaempferol. In conclusion, kaempferol might produce antidepressant effects via upregulating the expression of Sirt3, the major deacetylase in mitochondria, and subsequently activate the mitochondrial antioxidases. These findings shed some light on the use of kaempferol or vegetables and herbs that contain kaempferol as a complementary therapy for menopausal depression.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injuries involving the posterior fossa are rare and case reports indicate they often result in severe outcomes. We seek to describe characteristics and outcomes of traumatic posterior fossa injuries. Methods We performed a planned secondary analysis of all patients with posterior fossa injuries enrolled in the NEXUS head computed tomography (CT) validation study dataset. The dataset includes prospectively collected data on all patients undergoing non-contrast cranial CT following blunt traumatic head injury from April 2006 to December 2015, at four emergency departments comprising community and university sites, as well as urban, suburban and rural settings in California (Antelope Valley Hospital, San Francisco General Hospital, UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, UCSF Fresno Community Regional Medical Center). We classi fi ed each patient into one of three injury patterns: Type I - notable traumatic injuries primarily above the tentorium, with minimal posterior fossa involvement; Type II - notable traumatic injuries both above and within the posterior fossa; and Type III - notable traumatic injuries primarily within the posterior fossa. We extracted demographic data for each patient as well as physician assessments of the NEXUS head CT and Canadian Head CT rule clinical criteria, mechanisms of injury, patient outcomes, and the location and types of intracranial injuries sustained. Findings Of 11,770 patients in the database, 184 (1.6%) had posterior fossa injuries on CT imaging. Mean age was 55.4 years (standard deviation 22.5 years, range 2 - 96 years); 131 (71.2%) were males. We identi fi ed 63 patients with Type I injuries, 87 with Type II injuries, and 34 Type III injuries. The most common mechanisms of injury were falls (41%), pedestrian vs automobile (15%), and motor vehicle collisions (13%). On presentation most patients had altered mental status (72%), abnormal behavior (53%), or a neurologic de fi cit (55%). The majority of individuals, 151 (82%), had clinically important injuries and 111 (60%) required neurosurgical intervention. The dispositions for the subjects included 52 deaths (28%), 49 (27%) patients discharged home, and 48 (26%) discharged to rehabilitation facilities. When compared to individuals with Type I and Type II injuries, patients with Type III injuries had lower mortality (6% vs 30% and 35%) and higher percentage of patients discharged home (60% vs 19% and 21%). Interpretation Patients with Type I and II injury patterns (those that involve both the posterior fossa and supratentorium) experienced high mortality and disability. Patients with Type III injuries (isolated posterior fossa) had a better prognosis.

AB  - A cross-sectional study evaluated the risk of zoonotic Streptococcus suis (S. suis) illness from consuming raw pork and swine blood in Nakhon Sawan Province. A four-step risk assessment recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission was used to evaluate the risk along the pork supply chain. A total of 480 pork and swine blood samples were collected from the abattoir (n = 120) and retail (n = 360) during December 2020 and January 2021. Streptococcus suis in samples was enumerated using a culture-based technique and then confirmed by the biochemical and molecular technique. Streptococcus suis was serotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Two positive swine blood samples were contaminated with non-zoonotic S. suis serotype 23 at retail. In the case of all negative samples, the deterministic prevalence becomes zero and then the risk could not be estimated. Otherwise, the beta probability distribution was used to describe the probabilistic prevalence, while the maximum likelihood estimator was applied to estimate the upper limit of a probability distribution of concentration. The district averages of probabilistic prevalences of zoonotic S. suis in pork products at abattoir and retail were 9.9% and 4.1%, respectively. The district averages of concentrations of zoonotic S. suis in pork and blood samples from abattoir were 6.8 x 10(-3) cfu/g and 6.83 cfu/ml and in pork and blood samples from retail were 2.3 x 10(-3) cfu/g and 2.30 cfu/ml, respectively. The overall annual risk estimate per 100,000 population in pork and swine blood from abattoir and retail were 9.8 x 10(-11), 2.2 x 10(-6), 5.4 x 10(-13), and 8.3 x 10(-8). These risk estimates were negligible (<10(-6)) except for the annual risk estimate in swine blood from the abattoir. The results from this cross-sectional risk assessment should prompt the food safety regulator to cautiously sample by taking into account the duration of sampling and sample size.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Epimedium Tourn. ex L. is a traditional Chinese medicine used for thousands of years in China to treat forgetfulness. Icariin is a principal component of the genus Epimedium. Aim of the study: The metabolic mechanism of icariin treating forgetfulness is explored. Materials and methods: A D-galactose-induced senescent mouse model was employed. The cognitive performance of mice was assessed in the fear conditioning test. Hippocampal pathology was assessed in the immunohistochemistry assay. Plasma metabolome was analyzed using GC-MS method, and the differential metabolites were further identified by UPLC-MS/MS or GC-MS method. The liver function, including ALT and AST, was assessed by enzyme reaction. Icariin was administered intraperitoneally at 50 and 100 mg/kg. Mice were administered five consecutive days per week for 8 weeks. Results: Icariin treatment improved hippocampus-related fear memory but not amygdala-related memory, whereas Pexidartinib (PLX3397), a microglial scavenger, did not. Icariin treatment maintained the TMEM119positive microglial population and decreased the accumulation of the senescent biomarker p16 in the dorsal hippocampus in senescent mouse brains, whereas PLX3397 did not. Notably, p16 in the CA2 subregion significantly decreased in icariin-treated mice than the other hippocampal subregions. The senescent mice exhibited the circulating metabolic characteristics of mild ketoacidosis, active tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia, active detoxification, active cis-oleic acid metabolism, and inhibitory GABA shut. R-3Hydroxybutyric acid primarily produced in the liver was selectively and robustly decreased by icariin treatment, which was not observed with PLX3397 treatment. The TCA cycle was rescued in senescent mice by icariin treatment. Icariin also protected liver function (plasma ALT) in D-gal-induced senescent mice. Conclusions: Icariin may protect mouse hippocampal cognition from D-gal-induced senescence by protecting microglial homeostasis, and facilitating the utilization of R-3-hydroxybutyric acid is one of the underpins.

AB  - Hyperglycemia due to relative hypoinsulinism is common in extremely preterm infants and is associated with hippocampus-mediated long-term cognitive impairment. In neonatal rats, hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia leads to oxidative stress, altered neurochemistry, microgliosis and abnormal synaptogenesis in the hippocampus. Intranasal insulin (INS) bypasses the blood-brain barrier, targets the brain and improves synaptogenesis in rodent models, and memory in adult humans with Alzheimer's Disease or type 2 diabetes, without altering the blood levels of insulin or glucose. To test whether INS improves hippocampal development in neonatal hyperglycemia, rat pups were subjected to hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia by injecting streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 80 mg/kg i.p. on postnatal day (P) 2 and randomized to INS, 0.3U twice daily from P3-P6 (STZ + INS group) or no treatment (STZ group). The acute effects on hippocampal neurochemical profile and transcript mRNA expression of insulin receptor (Insr), glucose transporters (Glut1, Glut 4 and Glut8) and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1(Parp1, a marker of oxidative stress) were determined on P7 using in vivo 1H MR spectroscopy (MRS) and qPCR. The long-term effects on the neurochemical profile, microgliosis and synaptogenesis were determined at adulthood using 1H MRS and histochemical analysis. Relative to the control (CONT) group, mean blood glucose concentration was higher from P3 to P6 in the STZ and STZ+INS groups. On P7, MRS showed 10% higher taurine concentration in both STZ groups. qPCR showed 3-folds higher Insr and 5-folds higher Glut8 expression in the two STZ groups. Parp1 expression was 18% higher in the STZ group and normal in the STZ + INS group. At adulthood, blood glucose concentration in the fed state was higher in the STZ and STZ + INS groups. MRS showed 59% higher brain glucose concentration and histochemistry showed microgliosis in the hippocampal subareas in the STZ group. Brain glucose was normal in the STZ + INS group. Compared with the STZ group, phosphocreatine and phosphocreatine/creatine ratio were higher, and microglia in the hippocampal subareas fewer in the STZ + INS group (p < 0.05 for all). Neonatal hyperglycemia was associated with abnormal glucose metabolism and microgliosis in the adult hippocampus. INS administration during hyperglycemia attenuated these adverse effects and improved energy metabolism in the hippocampus.

AB  - Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a primary bile acid (BA), has been demonstrated to play an important role as a signaling molecule in various physiological functions. However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) function remains largely unknown. Herein, porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) were used as an in vitro model to investigate the effects of CDCA on IEC proliferation and explore the underlying mechanisms. IPEC-J2 cells were treated with CDCA, and flow cytometry and transcriptome analysis were adopted to investigate the effects and potential molecular mechanisms of CDCA on the proliferation of IECs. Our results indicated that adding 50 mu mol/L of CDCA in the media significantly increased the proliferation of IPEC-J2 cells. In addition, CDCA treatment also hindered cell apoptosis, increased the proportion of G0/G1 phase cells in the cell cycle progression, reduced intracellular ROS, and MDA levels, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential, antioxidation enzyme activity (T-AOC and CAT), and intracellular ATP level (p < 0.05). RNA-seq results showed that CDCA significantly upregulated the expression of genes related to cell cycle progression (Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cyclin G2 (CCNG2), cell-cycle progression gene 1 (CCPG1), Bcl-2 interacting protein 5 (BNIP5), etc.) and downregulated the expression of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis (ND1, ND2, COX3, ATP6, etc.). Further KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that CDCA significantly enriched the signaling pathways of DNA replication, cell cycle, and p53. Collectively, this study demonstrated that CDCA could promote IPEC-J2 proliferation by regulating cell cycle progression and mitochondrial function. These findings provide a new strategy for promoting the intestinal health of pigs by regulating intestinal BA metabolism.

AB  - Vigabatrin (VGB), a potent selective gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) inhibitor, is an approved non-traditional anti-seizure drug for patients with intractable epilepsy. Nevertheless, its effect on epileptogenesis, and whether this effect is correlated with post-epileptogenic cognitive function remain unclear. Based on lithium-pilocarpine-induced seizure modeling, we evaluated the effect of VGB on epileptogenesis and neuronal damage following status epilepticus in Sprague-Dawley rats. Cognitive evaluations were performed with the aid of inhibitory avoidance testing. We found that VGB could interrupt epileptogenesis by reducing spontaneous recurrent seizures, hippocampal neuronal damage, and chronic mossy fiber sprouting. Nevertheless, VGB did not help with the retention of cognitive performance. Our findings suggest that further research into the role of VGB in epileptogenesis and the treatment of epilepsy in clinical practice is warranted.

AB  - Introducing dynamics into bio-based adhesives shows many advantages on rendering mechanics and functions. However, the efficient employment of dynamic chemistry in achieving robust, stable, and reusable bio-based adhesives derived from low-value residues remains elusive. Here, we facilely develop a reused camellia meal-based adhesive integrating excellent mechanical robustness, environment durability, and mildew resistance through the cooperation of dual dynamic bonds. By deliberately harnessing dynamic covalent bonds as the first strong interlinking and dynamic noncovalent bonds as the second weak interaction, our strategy allows the resulting adhesive with a much-improved adhesion strength (2.1/1.06 MPa to wood in dry/wet condition) and remarkable adhesion maintenance against harsh environmental factors (organic solvents, salt, acid, alkali, temperature, soaking time). By virtue of these abundant dynamic bonds, this adhesive not only escapes from the inherent drawback of biomaterials to display enlarged anti-mildew efficacy, but also is capable of reprocessing to gain reusability. Combining these desirous characters with the simple two-step fabrication process, this study provides a great potential for the development of high-performance bio-based adhesives sustainably and intelligently.

AB  - Simple Summary The activity in the hippocampus is characterized by a strong oscillation at theta frequency that organizes the neuronal firing. We have recently shown that different theta oscillations are present in the hippocampus, opening the possibility to multiple interactions between theta rhythms. In this work, we analyzed the functional connectivity between theta generators during the exploration of a known environment with or without a novel stimulus. The directionality of the interactions was determined using tools based on Granger causality and transfer entropy. We found significant interactions between activity components originated in CA3 and in layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex. During exploration with a novel stimulus, the connectivity from the entorhinal cortex layer II increased, while the influence of CA3 decreased. These results suggest that the entorhinal cortex layer II may drive theta interactions and synchronization in the hippocampus during novelty exploration. Theta oscillations organize neuronal firing in the hippocampus during context exploration and memory formation. Recently, we have shown that multiple theta rhythms coexist in the hippocampus, reflecting the activity in their afferent regions in CA3 (Schaffer collaterals) and the entorhinal cortex layers II (EC-II, perforant pathway) and III (EC-III, temporoammonic pathway). Frequency and phase coupling between theta rhythms were modulated by the behavioral state, with synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurring in tasks involving memory updating. However, information transmission between theta generators was not investigated. Here, we used source separation techniques to disentangle the current generators recorded in the hippocampus of rats exploring a known environment with or without a novel stimulus. We applied analytical tools based on Granger causality and transfer entropy to investigate linear and non-linear directed interactions, respectively, between the theta activities. Exploration in the novelty condition was associated with increased theta power in the generators with EC origin. We found a significant directed interaction from the Schaffer input over the EC-III input in CA1, and a bidirectional interaction between the inputs in the hippocampus originating in the EC, likely reflecting the connection between layers II and III. During novelty exploration, the influence of the EC-II over the EC-III generator increased, while the Schaffer influence decreased. These results associate the increase in hippocampal theta activity and synchrony during novelty exploration with an increase in the directed functional connectivity from EC-II to EC-III.

AB  - Skeletal muscle fibrosis is defined as the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and is a hallmark of muscular dystrophies. Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the main source of ECM, and thus have been strongly implicated in fibrogenesis. In skeletal muscle fibrotic models, including muscular dystrophies, FAPs undergo dysregulations in terms of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, however few studies have explored the impact of FAPs migration. Here, we studied fibroblast and FAPs migration and identified lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a signaling lipid central to skeletal muscle fibrogenesis, as a significant migration inductor. We identified LPA receptor 1 (LPA(1)) mediated signaling as crucial for this effect through a mechanism dependent on the Hippo pathway, another pathway implicated in fibrosis across diverse tissues. This cross-talk favors the activation of the Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), leading to increased expression of fibrosis-associated genes. This study reveals the role of YAP in LPA-mediated fibrotic responses as inhibition of YAP transcriptional coactivator activity hinders LPA-induced migration in fibroblasts and FAPs. Moreover, we found that FAPs derived from the mdx4cv mice, a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, display a heightened migratory phenotype due to enhanced LPA signaling compared to wild-type FAPs. Remarkably, we found that the inhibition of LPA(1) or YAP transcriptional coactivator activity in mdx4cv FAPs reverts this phenotype. In summary, the identified LPA-LPA(1)-YAP pathway emerges as a critical driver of skeletal muscle FAPs migration and provides insights into potential novel targets to mitigate fibrosis in muscular dystrophies.

AB  - As we learn, dynamic memory processes build structured knowledge across our experiences. Such knowledge enables the formation of internal models of the world that we use to plan, make decisions, and act. Recent theorizing posits that mnemonic mechanisms of differentiation and integration - which at one level may seem to be at odds - both contribute to the emergence of structured knowledge. We tested this possibility using fMRI as human participants learned to navigate within local and global virtual environments over the course of 3 days. Pattern similarity analyses on entorhinal cortical and hippocampal patterns revealed evidence that differentiation and integration work concurrently to build local and global environmental representations, and that variability in integration relates to differences in navigation efficiency. These results offer new insights into the neural machinery and the underlying mechanisms that translate experiences into structured knowledge that allows us to navigate to achieve goals.

AB  - Goal-oriented navigation is widely understood to depend upon internal maps. Although this may be the case in many settings, humans tend to rely on vision in complex, unfamiliar environments. To study the nature of gaze during visually-guided navigation, we tasked humans to navigate to transiently visible goals in virtual mazes of varying levels of difficulty, observing that they took near-optimal trajectories in all arenas. By analyzing participants' eye movements, we gained insights into how they performed visually-informed planning. The spatial distribution of gaze revealed that environmental complexity mediated a striking trade-off in the extent to which attention was directed towards two complimentary aspects of the world model: the reward location and task-relevant transitions. The temporal evolution of gaze revealed rapid, sequential prospection of the future path, evocative of neural replay. These findings suggest that the spatiotemporal characteristics of gaze during navigation are significantly shaped by the unique cognitive computations underlying real-world, sequential decision making.

AB  - Background Pancreatic fibrosis is an early diagnostic feature of the common inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (CF). Many people with CF (pwCF) are pancreatic insufficient from birth and the replacement of acinar tissue with cystic lesions and fibrosis is a progressive phenotype that may later lead to diabetes. Little is known about the initiating events in the fibrotic process though it may be a sequela of inflammation in the pancreatic ducts resulting from loss of CFTR impairing normal fluid secretion. Here we use a sheep model of CF (CFTR-/-) to examine the evolution of pancreatic disease through gestation.
   Methods Fetal pancreas was collected at six time points from 50-days of gestation through to term, which is equivalent to similar to 13 weeks to term in human. RNA was extracted from tissue for bulk RNA-seq and single cells were prepared from 80-day, 120-day and term samples for scRNA-seq. Data were validated by immunochemistry.
   Results Transcriptomic evidence from bulk RNA-seq showed alterations in the CFTR-/- pancreas by 65-days of gestation, which are accompanied by marked pathological changes by 80-days of gestation. These include a fibrotic response, confirmed by immunostaining for COL1A1, alpha SMA and SPARC, together with acinar loss. Moreover, using scRNA-seq we identify a unique cell population that is significantly overrepresented in the CFTR-/- animals at 80- and 120-days gestation, as are stellate cells at term.
   Conclusion The transcriptomic changes and cellular imbalance that we observe likely have pivotal roles in the evolution of CF pancreatic disease and may provide therapeutic opportunities to delay or prevent pancreatic destruction in CF.

AB  - Tartrazine (E-102) is one of the most widely used artificial food azo-colors that can be metabolized to highly sensitizing aromatic amines such as sulphanilic acid. These metabolites are oxidized to N-hydroxy derivatives that cause neurotoxicity. Melatonin is a neurohormone. That possesses a free-radical scavenging effect. The present work was mainly designed to evaluate the possible ameliorative role of melatonin against tartrazine induced neurotoxicity in cerebral cortex and cerebellum of male rats. Adult male rats were administered orally with tartrazine (7.5 mg/kg) with or without melatonin (10 mg/kg) daily for four weeks. The data revealed that tartrazine induced redox disruptions as measured by significant (p < 0.05) increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level and inhibition of (GSH) concentration and catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) antioxidant enzyme activities. Besides, brain acetyl cholin (Ach) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were elevated while, dopamine (DA) was depleted in trtrazine-treated rats. Moreover, tartrazine caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the brain interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). At the tissue level, tartrazine caused severe histopathological changes in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex of rats. The immunohistochemical results elucidated strong positive expression for Caspase-3 and GFAP and weak immune reaction for BcL2 and synaptophysin in tatrazine-treated rats. The administration of melatonin to tartrazine-administered rats remarkably alleviated all the aforementioned tartrzine-induced effects. It could be concluded that, melatonin has a potent ameliorative effect against tartrazine induced neurotoxicity via the attenuation of oxidative/antioxidative responses.

AB  - Background: Rhodiola crenulate (R. crenulate), a famous Tibetan medicine, has been demonstrated to possess superiorly protective effects in high-altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI). However, its mechanisms on HHBI are still largely unknown.
   Methods: Herein, the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of R. crenulate on HHBI of BABL/c mice were explored through in vivo experiments. The mice model of HHBI was established using an animal hypobaric and hypoxic chamber. R. crenulate extract (RCE) (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg) was given by gavage for 7 days. Pathological changes and neuronal viability of mice hippocampus and cortex were evaluated using H&E and Nissl staining, respectively. The brain water content (BWC) in mice was determined by calculating the ratio of dry to wet weight of brain tissue. And serum of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH-Px) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected via commercial biochemical kits. Synchronously, the contents of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), lactic acid (LA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPcase, Na+-K+-ATPcase, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 in brain tissue were quantitative analysis by corresponding ELISA assay. Subsequently, NLRP3, ZO-1, claudin-5, occluding, p-p65, p65, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, caspase-1 and IL-18 were determined by immunofluorescent and western blot analyses.
   Results: The results demonstrated that RCE remarkably alleviated pathological damage, BWC, as well enhanced neuronal viability. Furthermore, the oxidative stress injuries were reversely abrogated after RCE treatment, evidenced by the increases of SOD, GSH-Px and T-AOC, while the decreases of MDA and LDH contents. Marvelously, the administration of RCE rectified and balanced the abnormal energy metabolism via elevating the levels of ATP, SDH, PK, Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPcase and Na+-K+-ATPcase, and lowering LA. Simultaneously, the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin-5 and occludin) was enhanced, illustrating RCE treatment might maintain the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, RCE treatment confined the contents of IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, and attenuated fluorescent signal of NLRP3 protein. Concurrently, the results of western blot indicated that RCE treatment dramatically restrained p-p65/p65, ASC, NLRP3, cleaved-caspase-1/caspase-1 and IL-18 protein expressions in brain tissues of mice.
   Conclusion: RCE may afford a protectively intervention in HHBI of mice through suppressing the oxidative stress, improving energy metabolism and the integrity of BBB, and subsiding inflammatory responses via the NF-kappa B/NLRP3 signaling pathway. As a promising agent for the treatment of mice HHBI, the deep-crossing molecular mechanisms of R. crenulate still needs to be further elucidated to identify novel core hub targets.

AB  - A paradoxical reduction in anxiety levels in chronic predator stress paradigm (PS) in Sprague-Dawley rats has recently been shown in previous works. In this paper, we studied the possible neurobiological mechanism of this phenomenon. We segregated PS-exposed Sprague-Dawley rats into the high- and low-anxiety phenotypes. The long-lasting effects of PS on corticosterone levels, blood flow speed in the carotid arteries, diffusion coefficient, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra in the hippocampus were compared in the high-anxiety and low-anxiety rats. In addition, we evaluated the gene BDNF expression in the hippocampus which is considered to be a main factor of neuroplasticity. We demonstrated that in low-anxiety rats, the corticosterone level was decreased and carotid blood flow speed was increased. Moreover, in the hippocampus of low-anxiety rats compared to the control group and high-anxiety rats, the following changes were observed: (a) a decrease in N-acetyl aspartate levels with a simultaneous increase in phosphoryl ethanol amine levels; (b) an increase in lipid peroxidation levels; (c) a decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient value; (d) an increase in BDNF gene expression. Based on these findings, we proposed that stress-induced anxiety reduction is associated with the elevation of BDNF gene expression directly. Low corticosterone levels and a rise in carotid blood flow speed might facilitate BDNF gene expression. Meanwhile, the decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient value and decrease in N-acetyl aspartate levels, as well as an increase in the lipid peroxidation levels, in the hippocampus possibly reflected destructive changes in the hippocampus. We suggested that in Sprague-Dawley rats, these morphological alterations might be considered as an impetus for further increase in neuroplasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - Transmembrane protein (TMEM230) is located in secretory/recycling vesicles, including synaptic vesicles in neurons. However, the functional relationship between TMEM230 and epilepsy is still a mystery. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression of TMEM230 in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE) and two different mice models of chronic epilepsy, and to determine the probable roles of TMEM230 in epilepsy. Our results showed that TMEM230 expression was increased in the temporal neocortex of epileptic patients and the hippocampus and cortex of epileptic mice compared with that in the control tissues. Moreover, TMEM230 was mainly expressed in the neurons in both humans and mice epileptic brain. TMEM230 co-localized with glutamate vesicular transporter 1 (VGLUT-1), but not with vesicular.-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) transporter ( VGAT). Mechanistically, coimmunoprecipitation confirmed that TMEM230 interacted with VGLUT-1, but not with VGAT in the hippocampus of epileptic mice. Lentivirus mediated overexpression of TMEM230 increased mice susceptibility to epilepsy and behavioural phenotypes of epileptic seizures during the kainite (KA)-induced chronic phase of epileptic seizures and the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling process, whereas lentivirus-mediated TMEM230 downregulation had the opposite effect. These results shed light on the functions of TMEM230 in neurons, suggesting that TMEM230 may play a critical role in the regulation of epileptic activit y via influencing excitatory neurotransmission.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease which significantly and negatively affects families and society. Aerobic exercise serves as a non-pharmacological strategy, potentially safeguarding against cognitive decline and lowering the risk of AD. However, how aerobic exercise ameliorates AD remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of two types of aerobic exercise, including aerobic interval training (AIT) and aerobic continuous training (ACT), on cognitive and exploratory function, brain histopathology, and hepatic amyloid beta (A beta) clearance in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 double transgenic (APP/PS1) transgenic mice. Methods: Twenty-four six-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice (body weight: 20-22 g) were used to establish the AD model. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: rest (AD group, n = 8), aerobic interval training (AIT group, n = 8), and aerobic continuous training (ACT group, n = 8). The exploration ability and anxiety of AD mice were measured using the open-field test. Learning and memory of AD mice were detected using the novel object recognition test, Y-maze test, and Morris water maze test. Neuronal damage was analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. A beta deposition in the brain was detected using a thioflavin-S fluorescence assay and immunofluorescence. The mechanisms underlying hepatic A beta clearance were investigated using an immunofluorescence assay and western blotting. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test, and p < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results: The results revealed that both AIT and ACT improved the recognition memory and exploration ability of mice after 8 weeks of intervention. Additionally, both forms of aerobic exercise significantly mitigated neuronal damage and A beta deposition in the brain and improved the hepatic clearance of A beta. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that AIT and ACT can improve cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice, potentially by increasing the hepatic phagocytic capacity of A beta. Hepatic clearance of A beta may serve as a supplementary mechanism by which aerobic exercise can improve AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Saffron, the dried stigma of Crocus sativus L., has a long history of use in the treatment of depression in traditional Chinese medicine and Islamic medicine. The unique aroma of saffron, primarily derived from its volatile oil, has been widely used by folk to mitigate anxiety and depression via sniffing because the aroma of saffron has a pleasant and invigorating effect.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect and the underlying mechanism of saffron essential oil (SEO) in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS).
   Materials and methods: In this study, compounds of SEO were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, while network pharmacology was used to predict potential active compounds, antidepressant targets, and related signaling pathways of SEO. The CUMS depression model was further used to explore the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of SEO. During the modeling period, mice were regularly administered fluoxetine (3.6 mg/kg, i.g.) or diluted SEO (2%, 4%, and 6% SEO, inhalation). The antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of SEO were evaluated by behavior tests (the open field test, the sucrose preference test, the tail suspension test, and the forced swimming test), hematoxylin-eosin staining, and Nissl staining. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to measure dopamine (DA), 5-serotonin (5-HT), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and.-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in serum. The relative abundance of Raf1, MEK1, P-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, P-CREB1/CREB1, BDNF, and P-Trk B/Trk B in the hippocampus was determined using western blot (WB).
   Results: According to the network pharmacology analysis, seven active SEO compounds mediated 113 targets related to depression treatment, most of which were enriched in the 5-HT synapse, calcium signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway. In vivo experiments indicated that fluoxetine and SEO improved depression-like behaviors in depressed mice. The levels of 5-HT, DA, BDNF, and GABA in serum increased significantly. Histopathological examinations revealed that fluoxetine and SEO ameliorated neuronal damage in the hippocampus. WB analysis showed that the relative expressions of Raf1, MEK1, P-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, P-CREB1/CREB1, BDNF, and P-Trk B/Trk B were significantly higher in the fluoxetine and SEO groups than in the CUMS group.
   Conclusion: Overall, these findings suggest that SEO significantly alleviates the depressive symptoms in CUMS exposed mice and partially restores hippocampal neuronal damage. Meanwhile, the best efficacy was observed in 4% SEO. Furthermore, the antidepressant mechanism of SEO is primarily dependent on the regulation of the MAPK-CREB1-BDNF signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Golden berries ( Physalis peruviana) are esteemed for their healing properties and widespread use in traditional medicine, particularly for their neuroprotective benefits. Aim of the study: This work aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of golden berry total leaf extract cultivated in Egypt (TLE) against cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced neurotoxicity and to identify the chemical composition of different organs of P. peruviana from both Egypt and USA. Material and methods: Metabolite profiling of TLE was conducted using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). In the animal model experiment, CP (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered once weekly for four weeks to induce neurocognitive dysfunction. Concurrently, TLE (500 mg/kg, orally) was administered twice weekly throughout the four weeks to evaluate its effectiveness in alleviating CP-induced neuronal deficits. Behavioral assessments, Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests, were conducted, followed by, histological evaluations of brain tissue samples. Additionally, biochemical analyses were performed on hippocampal tissue samples, examining the following markers, acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) activity, nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-kappa B p65) (Ser536), Interleukin 1(3 (IL-1(3), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X) levels. Results: TLE significantly preserved hippocampal neurons and improved cognitive performance in behavioral tests. TLE achieved these beneficial effects by suppressing AChE activity, diminishing the oxidative stress and restoring redox balance via inhibiting p-NF kappa B/IL-1(3,/TNF alpha/IL-6 cascades. Leaf extract revealed the highest total phenolic content (TPC) (2.7 f 6.41 mg GAE/g extract) and total flavonoid content (TFC) (0.37 f 1.19 mg QE/g) and the strongest antioxidant effects in Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) and 2,2 '-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays with IC50 values of 21.13 f 1.48 and 18.19 f 1.29 mu g/mL, respectively. UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis resulted in the tentative identification of 20 metabolites including phenolic acids, flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acid amides, and alkyl resorcinols. Conclusions: Findings verify for the first time the neuroprotective potential of golden berry leaf, currently discarded as agricultural waste, and highlight its multifaceted mechanism of neuroprotection in CP-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting its suitability as a promising therapeutic agent for neurotoxicity management.

AB  - This study explores the effects of compound glycyrrhizin (GL) on seizures in the rat model and its potential molecular mechanisms. Eighty male, healthy, and clean-graded Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, aged 1 month, were used in this study. Of these, 60 rats were selected to construct the epilepsy model and were randomly divided into the GL group (status epilepticus (SE) + GL, n = 60) and the model group (Model, n = 10), and received tail vein injections of GL or saline, respectively. Another ten normal rats served as the control group (Control). According to different doses of GL, they were divided into the high dose group (HGL, 50 mg/kg, n = 20), the medium dose group (MGL, 20 mg/kg, n = 20), and the low dose group (LGL, 10 mg/kg, n = 20). The expression levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) in serum and hippocampal tissue of rats 24 h after SE were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. The neuronal density in brain tissue and the number of NeuN-positive cells in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) areas of rats in each group were statistically compared. SE incidence rate in the Model group was 40%, and the survival rate was 60%. The grade III seizure onset time (SOT) after kainic acid (KA) injection was (22.19 +/- 2.07) min. The SOT in the SE + GL group after KA injection was (35.76 +/- 3.46) min; the SE incidence rate was 10%; the survival rate was 90%. The relative expression of TLR-4 mRNA in the hippocampal tissue at different time points (3 h, 12 h, and 24 h) was markedly higher than that in the Control group, showing significance (P < 0.05). The expression levels of HMGB1 and TLR-4 in the hippocampal tissue of rats in the Model group were markedly higher than in other groups, and compared with the Model group, the expression levels of HMGB1 and TLR-4 in the hippocampal tissue of the HGL, MGL, and LGL groups were markedly reduced (P < 0.05). The neuronal density in the cerebral cortex of rats in the GL group was markedly reduced compared to the Model (P < 0.05), and the normal neuronal density in the cerebral cortex of the HGL, MGL, and LGL groups was markedly lower than that in the Control group (P < 0.05). The normal neuronal density in the cerebral cortex of the HGL and MGL groups was markedly increased compared to the Model group (P < 0.05). The number of NeuN-positive cells in the CA1 and CA3 areas of rats in the Model and SE + GL groups was greatly reduced, and the number of NeuN-positive cells in the CA1 area was markedly higher than that in the CA3 area in the HGL group and the Model group (P < 0.05). The compound GL was found to delay the onset of the first seizure in rats, reduce seizure sensitivity, and alleviate symptoms. GL treatment effectively decreased the expression of HMGB1 and TLR-4, reduced the pathological damage associated with epilepsy, and contributed to the protection of neurons.

AB  - Background: Due to the long-term contact with metallic elements of orthodontic appliances, the potential influence of released metal ions on living organisms and the type of induced changes was investigated. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four young domestic pigs classified in two groups (experimental and control) were chosen as the object of this study. In the experimental group of animals, two metal plates consisting of orthodontic bands representing the mass of orthodontic appliance were mounted on the internal side of the cheek for six months. The liver, lung, and brain samples were taken post mortem from animals of both groups. The gene expression of two isoforms of metallothionein (MT-1 and MT-2) were investigated using the qPCR technique. Protein expression was confirmed by the Western blot and ELISA techniques. Results: The differences in metallothionein concentrations were observed in the lung and brain in the group of experimental animals, but not in the liver. The expression of MT-1 and MT-2 genes in the experimental vs. control group (respectively) was as follows: lung MT-1 1.04 vs. 1.11, MT-2 0.96 vs. 1.05, liver MT-1 0.89 vs. 0.91 vs. 1.12, MT-2 0.91 vs. 1.05, brain MT-1 1.24 vs. 1.20, and MT-2 0.955 vs. 0.945. These results were confirmed by gene activity, which was tested by qPCR. This increased the activity of metallothionein genes in the lungs and brain as a consequence of the release of metal ions into these tissues. The possible effects of detected change in metallothionein-2 gene expression could be the alteration of physiological functions of lung tissue. Conclusions: The effect of long-term exposure to metal orthodontic appliances on metallothioneins gene expression, as well as the induction of protein synthesis was proved.

AB  - Sac embolization of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remains clinically limited by endoleak recurrences. These recurrences are correlated with recanalization due to the presence of endothelial lining and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated aneurysm progression. This study incorporates doxycycline (DOX), a well-known sclerosant and MMPs inhibitor, into a shear-thinning biomaterial (STB)-based vascular embolizing hydrogel. The addition of DOX is expected to improve embolizing efficacy while preventing endoleaks by inhibiting MMP activity and promoting endothelial removal. The results show that STBs containing 4.5% w/w silicate nanoplatelet and 0.3% w/v of DOX are injectable and have a twofold increase in storage modulus compared to those without DOX. STB-DOX hydrogels also reduced clotting time by 33% compared to untreated blood. The burst release of DOX from the hydrogels show sclerosing effects after 6 h in an ex vivo pig aorta model. Sustained release of DOX from hydrogels on endothelial cells shows MMP inhibition (approximately an order of magnitude larger than control groups) after 7 days. The hydrogels successfully occlude a patient-derived abdominal aneurysm model at physiological blood pressures and flow rates. The sclerosing and MMP inhibition characteristics in the engineered multifunctional STB-DOX hydrogels may provide promising opportunities for the efficient embolization of aneurysms in blood vessels.
   Combining occlusive, sclerosing, and MMP inhibitory properties enabled the development of a Gelatin-Laponite (STB) hydrogel loaded with Doxycycline (DOX) for abdominal aortic aneurysm sac embolization and endothelial ablation. Validated in a patient-derived aneurysm model, STB-DOX gels showed optimal injectability, strength, and aneurysm sac embolization. In vitro, MMP inhibition and endothelial removal are observed.image

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bushen-Yizhi formula (BSYZ), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription widely used in treating mental retardation and neurodegenerative diseases with kidney deficiency, has been reported to attenuate oxidative stress-related neuronal apoptosis. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is considered to be related to cognitive and emotional disorders. However, it remains to be clarified that the effect of BSYZ on CCH and its underlying mechanism.Aim of the study: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of BSYZ on CCH-injured rats based on the domination of oxidative stress balance and mitochondrial homeostasis through inhibiting abnormal excessive mitophagy.Materials and methods: The in vivo rat model of CCH was established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo), while the in vitro PC12 cell model was exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) condition, and a mitophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) by decreasing autophagosome-lysosome fusion was used as reverse validation in vitro. The protective role of BSYZ on CCH-injured rats was measured by open field test, morris water maze test, analysis of amyloid fibrils and apoptosis, and oxidative stress kit. The expression of mitochondria-related and mitophagy-related proteins was evaluated by Western blot, immunofluorescence, JC-1 staining assay and Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos assay. The components of BSYZ extracts were identified by HPLC-MS. The molecular docking studies were used to investigate the potential interactions of characteristic com-pounds in BSYZ with lysosomal membrane protein 1 (LAMP1).Results: Our result indicated that BSYZ improved the cognition and memory abilities of the BCCAo rats by diminishing the occurrence of apoptosis and abnormal amyloid deposition accumulation, suppressing oxidative stress damage for abnormal excessive mitophagy activation in the hippocampus. Moreover, in OGD/R-damaged PC12 cells, BSYZ drug serum treatment substantially enhanced the PC12 cell viability and suppressed intracel-lular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation for protecting against oxidative stress, along with the improvement of mitochondrial membrane activity and lysosomal proteins. Our studies also showed that inhib-iting of autophagosome-lysosome fusion to generate autolysosomes by using chloroquine abrogated the neuro-protective effects of BSYZ on PC12 cells regarding the modulation of antioxidant defence and mitochondrial membrane activity. Furthermore, the molecular docking studies supported the direct bindings between lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and compounds in BSYZ extract to inhibit excessive mitophagy.Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that BSYZ played a neuroprotective role in rats with CCH and reduced neuronal oxidative stress via promoting the formation of autolysosomes to inhibit abnormal excessive mitophagy.

AB  - The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) orchestrates a proproliferative transcriptional program that controls the fate of somatic stem cells and the regenerative responses of certain tissues. As such, agents that activate YAP may hold therapeutic potential in disease states exacerbated by insufficient proliferative repair. Here we report the discovery of a small molecule, termed PY-60, which robustly activates YAP transcriptional activity in vitro and promotes YAP-dependent expansion of epidermal keratinocytes in mouse following topical drug administration. Chemical proteomics revealed the relevant target of PY-60 to be annexin A2 (ANXA2), a protein that directly associates with YAP at the cell membrane in response to increased cell density. PY-60 treatment liberates ANXA2 from the membrane, ultimately promoting a phosphatase-bound, nonphosphorylated and transcriptionally active form of YAP. This work reveals ANXA2 as a previously undescribed, druggable component of the Hippo pathway and suggests a mechanistic rationale to promote regenerative repair in disease.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Astragalus mongholicus Bunge (AMB) is a herb with wide application in traditional Chinese medicine, exerting a wealth of pharmacological effects. AMB has been proven to have an evident therapeutic effect on ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, including cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, the specific mechanism underlying AMB in CIRI remains unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the potential role of AMB in CIRI through a comprehensive approach of network pharmacology and in vivo experimental research. Methods: The intersection genes of drugs and diseases were obtained through analysis of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network was created through the string website. Meanwhile, the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was carried out using R studio, and thereafter the key genes were screened. Then, the molecular docking prediction was made between the main active ingredients and target genes, and hub genes with high binding energy were obtained. In addition, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was used to validate the result of molecular docking. Based on the results of network pharmacology, we used animal experiments to verify the predicted hub genes. First, the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MACO/R) model was established and the effective dose of AMB in CIRI was determined by behavioral detection and 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Then the target proteins corresponding to the hub genes were measured by Western blot. Moreover, the level of neuronal death was measured using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Results: Based on the analysis of the TCMSP database and GEO database, a total of 62 intersection target genes of diseases and drugs were obtained. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the therapeutic effect of AMB on CIRI might be realized through the advanced glycation endproduct-the receptor of advanced glycation endproduct (AGE-RAGE) signaling pathway in diabetic complications, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway and other pathways. Molecular docking results showed that the active ingredients of AMB had good binding potential with hub genes that included Prkcb, Ikbkb, Gsk3b, Fos and Rela. Animal experiments showed that AWE (60 g/kg) could alleviate CIRI by regulating the phosphorylation of PKC(3, IKK(3, GSK3(3, c-Fos and NF kappa B p65 proteins. Conclusion: AMB exerts multi-target and multi-pathway effects against CIRI, and the underlying mechanism may be related to anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress and inhibiting calcium overload.

AB  - Objective Microglia, the prototypical innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are highly plastic and assume their phenotypes dependent on intrinsically genetic, epigenetic regulation or extrinsically microenvironmental cues. Microglia has been recognized as key regulators of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and brain functions. Chromatin accessibility is implicated in immune cell development and functional regulation. However, it is still unknown whether and how chromatin remodelling regulates the phenotypic plasticity of microglia and exerts what kind of effects on NSPCs. Methods We investigated the role of chromatin accessibility in microglia by deleting chromatin remodelling gene Arid1a using microglia-specific Cx3cr1-cre and Cx3cr1-CreERT2 mice. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were performed to dissect the molecular mechanisms. In addition, we examined postnatal M1/M2 microglia polarization and analysed neuronal differentiation of NSPCs. Finally, we tested the effects of microglial Arid1a deletion on mouse behaviours. Results Increased chromatin accessibility upon Arid1a ablation resulted in enhanced M1 microglial polarization and weakened M2 polarization, which led to abnormal neurogenesis and anxiety-like behaviours. Switching the polarization state under IL4 stimulation could rescue abnormal neurogenesis, supporting an essential role for chromatin remodeler ARID1A in balancing microglial polarization and brain functions. Conclusions Our study identifies ARID1A as a central regulator of microglia polarization, establishing a mechanistic link between chromatin remodelling, neurogenesis and mouse behaviours, and highlights the potential development of innovative therapeutics exploiting the innate regenerative capacity of the nervous system.

AB  - Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a vascular sarcoma that metastasizes early in its clinical course and lacks an effective medical therapy. The TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 fusion proteins are chimeric transcription factors and initiating oncogenic drivers of EHE. A combined proteomic/genetic screen in human cell lines identified YEATS2 and ZZZ3, components of the Ada2a-containing histone acetyltransferase (ATAC) complex, as key interactors of both fusion proteins despite the dissimilarity of the C terminal fusion partners CAMTA1 and TFE3. Integrative next-generation sequencing approaches in human and murine cell lines showed that the fusion proteins drive a unique transcriptome by simultaneously hyperactivating a TEAD-based transcriptional program and modulating the chromatin environment via interaction with the ATAC complex. Interaction of the ATAC complex with both fusion proteins indicates that it is a key oncogenic driver and unifying enzymatic therapeutic target for this sarcoma. This study presents an approach to mechanistically dissect how chimeric transcription factors drive the formation of human cancers.

AB  - The positive effects of physical exercise (EX) are well known to be mediated by cerebral BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a neurotrophin involved in learning and memory, the expression of which could be induced by circulating irisin, a peptide derived from Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) produced by skeletal muscle contraction. While the influence of EX modalities on cerebral BDNF expression was characterized, their effect on muscle FNDC5/Irisin expression and circulating irisin levels remains to be explored. The present study involved Wistar rats divided into four experimental groups: sedentary (SED), low- (40% of maximal aerobic speed, MAS), intermediate- (50% of MAS) and high- (70% of MAS) intensities of treadmill EX (30 min/day, 7 days). Soleus (SOL) versus gastrocnemius (GAS) FNDC5 and hippocampal BDNF expressions were evaluated by Western blotting. Additionally, muscular FNDC5/Irisin localization and serum/hippocampal irisin levels were studied by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. Our findings revealed that (1) serum irisin and hippocampal BDNF levels vary with EX intensity, showing a threshold intensity at 50% of MAS; (2) hippocampal BDNF levels positively correlate with serum irisin but not with hippocampal FNDC5/Irisin; and (3) GAS, in response to EX intensity, overexpresses FNDC5/Irisin in type II muscle fibers. Altogether, peripheral FNDC5/Irisin levels likely explain EX-dependent hippocampal BDNF expression.

AB  - Aging is a complex phenomenon associated with oxidative stress and mitochondria! dysfunction. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential ameliorative effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX) on the aging process and its underlying mechanisms. We treated D-galactose- (D-gal-) induced aging mice with PTX and measured the changes in behavior, degree of oxidative damage, and mitochondrial ultrastructure and content as well as the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2- (Nrf2-) mediated antioxidant genes and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha- (PGC-1 alpha-) dependent mitochondrial biogenesis genes. The results demonstrated that PTX improved cognitive deficits, reduced oxidative damage, ameliorated abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, increased mitochondrial content and Nrf2 activation, and upregulated antioxidant and mitochondrial biogenesis gene expression in the hippocampus of wild-type aging mice. However, the above antiaging effects of PTX were obviously decreased in the brains of Nrf2-deficient D-gal-induced aging mice. Moreover, in hydrogen peroxide-treated SH-SY5Y cells, we found that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB) and Nrf2/PGC-1 alpha act in a linear way by CREB siRNA transfection. Thus, PTX administration improved the aging-related decline in brain function by enhancing antioxidative capability and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, which might depend on increasing Nrf2 and PGC-1 alpha by activating the cAMP-CREB pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary: There are ongoing concerns about the welfare of animals in the Australian live export trade by sea. However, information about the welfare of animals during voyages is difficult to obtain. In early 2018, the Australian government installed Independent Observers on some live export voyages. Summaries of Independent Observer (IO) reports provide a new source of information about management of animals in the live export trade. Cattle voyages from Australia to China have concerned animal welfare advocates due to their duration and lack of consistent veterinary oversight. We reviewed IO summaries on live cattle export voyages to China for the period July 2018 to December 2019 (n = 37). Key animal welfare risk factors identified in the IO summaries included: hunger, thirst, exposure to extreme temperatures, poor pen conditions, health issues, absence of veterinarians, rough seas, poor ship infrastructure, mechanical breakdown and mismanagement at discharge.<br></p>

   There are long-standing and ongoing concerns about the welfare of animals in the Australian live export trade by sea. However, scrutiny of animal welfare on board vessels is generally hindered by a lack of independent reporting. Cattle voyages from Australia to China have concerned animal welfare advocates due to their long duration and lack of consistent veterinary oversight. In April 2018, following a media expose of animal cruelty and declining public trust, the Australian government installed Independent Observers on some live export voyages. Summaries of Independent Observer (IO) reports by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) provided a new and independent source of information about management of animals in the live export trade. The IO summaries on live cattle export voyages to China for the period July 2018 to December 2019 (n = 37) were reviewed. The IO summaries detailed voyages that carried 147,262 slaughter, feeder or breeder cattle which included both dairy and beef breeds. The long-haul voyages averaged 20 days in duration, generally departing the ports of Fremantle and Portland and discharging at ports in northern China. Key animal welfare risk factors identified in the IO summaries included: hunger, thirst, exposure to extreme temperatures, poor pen conditions, health issues, absence of veterinarians, rough seas, poor ship infrastructure, mechanical breakdown and mismanagement at discharge.</p>

AB  - Tea domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4) plays a pivotal role in tissue development and homeostasis by interacting with Yes-associated protein (YAP) in response to Hippo signaling inactivation. TEAD4 and YAP can also cooperate with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-activated Smad proteins to regulate gene transcription. Yet, it remains unclear whether TEAD4 plays a YAP-independent role in TGF-beta signaling. Here, we unveil a novel tumor suppressive function of TEAD4 in liver cancer via mitigating TGF-beta signaling. Ectopic TEAD4 inhibited TGF-beta-induced signal transduction, Smad transcriptional activity, and target gene transcription, consequently suppressing hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and migration in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in mice. Consistently, depletion of endogenous TEAD4 by siRNAs enhanced TGF-beta signaling in cancer cells. Mechanistically, TEAD4 associates with receptor-regulated Smads (Smad2/3) and Smad4 in the nucleus, thereby impairing the binding of Smad2/3 to the histone acetyltransferase p300. Intriguingly, these negative effects of TEAD4 on TGF-beta/Smad signaling are independent of YAP, as impairing the TEAD4-YAP interaction through point mutagenesis or depletion of YAP and/or its paralog TAZ has little effect. Together, these results unravel a novel function of TEAD4 in fine tuning TGF-beta signaling and liver cancer progression in a YAP-independent manner.

AB  - Geranylacetone and nerylacetone are natural sesquiterpenoids, which play various roles in plant-insect interactions, including the deterrent and repellent effects on herbivores. The structural modifications of natural compounds often change their biological activities. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of geranylacetone, nerylacetone and their epoxy-derivatives on the probing and settling behavior of Myzus persicae (Sulz.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The no-choice test using the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique showed that the probes before the first phloem phase were usually shorter than 3 min, which means that they were terminated within the epidermis and/or outer layers of mesophyll. This resulted in a tendency to delay the initiation of the phloem phase in aphids, which reflects a weak preingestive deterrent activity of the studied compounds at the level of non-vascular tissues. Most M. persicae showed bouts of sustained phloem sap ingestion. However, the 24-h free-choice test demonstrated that aphids did not settle on the leaves treated with geranylacetone, nerylacetone, and their epoxy-derivatives. The refusal to settle after the consumption of phloem sap on treated plants indicated that the studied compounds had postingestive deterrent activity. The epoxidation of geranylacetone and nerylacetone did not evoke significant changes in their activity profiles.

TI  - Exercise-Linked Irisin Prevents Mortality and Enhances Cognition in a Mice Model of Cerebral Ischemia by Regulating Klotho Expression
T2  - OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY

KW  - INJURY
AB  - Irisin, which can be released in the hippocampus after physical exercise, is demonstrated to have beneficial effects on neurovascular diseases. This study investigated the impact of exercise linked-irisin on mortality and cognition in a mice model of cerebral ischemia and further explored its underlying mechanism. The cerebrospinal concentrations of irisin and klotho from ischemic stroke patients were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cognitive function of mice was evaluated by a series of behavioural experiments. The expressions of klotho, MnSOD, and FOXO3a in the hippocampus of mice were detected by Western blot. Superoxide production in the brain tissue of mice was evaluated with the dihydroethidium (DHE) dying. The results demonstrated that stroke patients showed a positive correlation between their CSF irisin concentration and klotho concentration. In addition, when mice subjected to cerebral ischemia, their cognitive function was impaired, the protein expressions of klotho, MnSOD, and FOXO3a downregulated, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased compared with the sham group. After pretreatment with exogenous irisin, improved cognitive impairment, upregulated protein expressions of klotho, MnSOD, and FOXO3a, and reduced ROS generation were observed in mice with MCAO. However, the neuroprotective effects of irisin compromised with the evidence of severe cognitive impairment, decreased protein expressions of MnSOD and FOXO3a, and increased ROS production in klotho knockout mice. Thus, our results indicated that exercise-linked irisin could prevent mortality and improve cognitive impairment after cerebral ischemia by regulating klotho expression.

AB  - Objective: To explore the protective effect of MP on oxidative damage in vivo and in vitro. Methods: A mouse aging model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (D-gal), and pathological changes in the hippocampal ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissues were evaluated with GSH-Px and MDA assay kits. An MTT assay was used to detect the viability of the model SH-SY5Y cells with H2O2-induced damage, and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) kit was used to evaluate LDH leakage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cell cycle arrest were analyzed by flow cytometry, and cleaved caspase 3 and P53 protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. Results: Demonstrated that MP increased GSH-Px activity, reduced MDA levels, and attenuated the cell damage induced by H2O2. Furthermore, MP protected neuronal cells from oxidative stress through a mechanism including a decrease in LDH leakage and reversal of H2O2-induced cell morphological damage. MP treatment alleviated the H2O2-induced increases in ROS levels, inhibited apoptosis, relieved cell cycle arrest, and downregulated cleaved caspase 3 and P53 protein expression. Conclusions: MP is a novel antioxidant with neuroprotective effects.

AB  - Introduction The effectiveness of neural interfacing devices depends on the anatomical and physiological properties of the target region. Multielectrode arrays, used for neural recording and stimulation, are influenced by electrode placement and stimulation parameters, which critically impact tissue response. This study presents a multiscale computational model that predicts responses of neurons in the hippocampus-a key brain structure primarily involved in memory formation, especially the conversion of short-term memories into long-term storage-to extracellular electrical stimulation, providing insights into the effects of electrode positioning and stimulation strategies on neuronal response.Methods We modeled the rat hippocampus with highly detailed axonal projections, integrating the Admittance Method to model propagation of the electric field in the tissue with the NEURON simulation platform. The resulting model simulates electric fields generated by virtual electrodes in the perforant path of entorhinal cortical (EC) axons projecting to the dentate gyrus (DG) and predicts DG granule cell activation via synaptic inputs.Results We determined stimulation amplitude thresholds required for granule cell activation at different electrode placements along the perforant path. Membrane potential changes during synaptic activation were validated against experimental recordings. Additionally, we assessed the effects of bipolar electrode placements and stimulation amplitudes on direct and indirect activation.Conclusion Stimulation amplitudes above 750 mu A consistently activate DG granule cells. Lower stimulation amplitudes are required for axonal activation and downstream synaptic transmission when electrodes are placed in the molecular layer, infra-pyramidal region, and DG crest.Significance The study and underlying methodology provide useful insights to guide the stimulation protocol required to activate DG granule cells following the stimulation of EC axons; the complete realistic 3D model presented constitutes an invaluable tool to strengthen our understanding of hippocampal response to electrical stimulation and guide the development and placement of prospective stimulation devices and strategies.

AB  - F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 5 (FBXW5), with WD40 repeats, can bind to the PPxY sequence of the large tumor suppressor kinases 1/2 (LATS1/2) kinase domain, resulting in ubiquitination. Ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of LATS1/2 abrogate the Hippo pathway and worsen gastric cancer (GC). However, the effects and molecular mechanisms of FBXW5 in GC remain unexplored. To elucidate the clinical significance of FBXW5, immunohistochemistry was conducted to reveal the positive correlation between FBXW5 expression and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001) and TNM stage (training cohort: p = 0.018; validation cohort: p = 0.001). Further, patients with high FBXW5 expression were found to have poor prognosis (training cohort: log-rank p = 0.020; validation cohort: log-rank p = 0.025). Cell experiments revealed the promoting effects of FBXW5 on the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance of GC cells. Blocking LATS1-YAP1 leads to the loss of FBXW5-mediated regulation of the Hippo pathway and partial functions. Further, co-immunoprecipitation and in vivo ubiquitination assays revealed the interaction between FBXW5 and LATS1, which promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of LATS1. Based on mouse xenograft assays, FBXW5 silencing attenuated the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts. Altogether, FBXW5 was found to inactivate the Hippo signaling pathway by enhancing LATS1 ubiquitination and degradation, which promoted the invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance of GC cells.

AB  - Age-related decline in brain endothelial cell (BEC) function contributes critically to neurological disease. Comprehensive atlases of the BEC transcriptome have become available, but results from proteomic profiling are lacking. To gain insights into endothelial pathways affected by aging, we developed a magnetic-activated cell sorting-based mouse BEC enrichment protocol compatible with proteomics and resolved the profiles of protein abundance changes during aging. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed a segregation of age-related protein dynamics with biological functions, including a downregulation of vesicle-mediated transport. We found a dysregulation of key regulators of endocytosis and receptor recycling (most prominently Arf6), macropinocytosis and lysosomal degradation. In gene deletion and overexpression experiments, Arf6 affected endocytosis pathways in endothelial cells. Our approach uncovered changes not picked up by transcriptomic studies, such as accumulation of vesicle cargo and receptor ligands, including Apoe. Proteomic analysis of BECs from Apoe-deficient mice revealed a signature of accelerated aging. Our findings provide a resource for analysing BEC function during aging.
   Todorov-Volgyi, Gonzalez-Gallego et al. provide a proteomic profiling of brain endothelium during aging to unveil changes undetected in transcriptomic studies, identifying a dysregulation of proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport pathways, most prominently Arf6.

AB  - Background: A previously unstudied medicinal plant, Leucophyllum frutescens (Berland.) I.M. Johnst. (Scrophulariaceae) was investigated to evaluate its potential in preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Methanolic leaf extract (MELE) and its fractions (HELE, CHLE, and BULE) were evaluated for their polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity by five different methods, including in vitro enzyme inhibition assays, which are clinically linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The potentially active n-butanol fraction (BULE) was further evaluated for its neuroprotective effects using an albino rat animal model and phytoconstituents profiling using Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and in silico molecular docking by Maestro (R) Schrodinger. Results: The n-butanol fraction (BULE) in the hydroalcoholic leaf extract exhibited the highest total phenolic content (230.435 +/- 1.575 mg gallic acid equivalent gm(-1) +/- SD). The chloroform leaf extract exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (293.343 +/- 3.756 mg quercetin equivalent gm(-1) +/- SD) as well as the highest antioxidant content, which was equivalent to Trolox, with five assay methods. Similarly, the chloroform and n-butanol fractions from the hydroalcoholic leaf extract significantly inhibited human acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase with their IC50 values of 12.14 +/- 0.85 and 129.73 +/- 1.14 mu g.mL(-1), respectively. The in vivo study revealed that BULE exhibited a significant neuroprotective effect at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day in an aluminum chloride-induced neurodegenerative albino rat model. The LC-MS/MS analysis of BULE tentatively confirmed the presence of biologically active secondary metabolites, such as theobromine, propyl gallate, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, myricetin-3-acetylrhamnoside, isoquercitrin-6'-O-malonate, diosmetin-7-O-glucuronide-3'-O-pentose, pinoresinol diglucoside, asarinin, eridictoyl, epigallocatechin, methyl gallate derivative, and eudesmin. The results from the computational molecular docking of the identified secondary metabolites revealed that diosmetin-7-O-glucuronide-3'-O-pentose had the highest binding affinity to human butyrylcholinesterase, while isoquercetin-6'-O-malonate had the highest to human acetylcholinesterase, and pinoresinol diglucoside to human salivary alpha-amylase. Conclusions: The present study concluded a need for further exploration into this medicinal plant, including the isolation of the bioactive compounds responsible for its neuroprotective effects.

AB  - Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly explored for targeted skin penetration, particularly for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. However, the complex system between NP properties, skin structure, and experimental conditions poses significant challenges in predicting their penetration depth and pathways. To what depth do NPs penetrate the skin, and which pathways do they follow? These are the questions which we tried to answer in this paper. A n in-silico human skin model based on 20 years of literature on NPs skin penetration is developed. The model incorporates 19 independent parameters, including a wide range of NP properties, skin across species, and test conditions. Using random forest analysis coupled with Kennard-Stone sorting, the model achieves a high predictive accuracy of 95%. The study identifies hair follicle diameter as the most critical factor influencing NP penetration across skin layers, surpassing other skin properties, NP properties, or experimental variables. Pig and rabbit skin are the most suitable models for simulating human skin in NP penetration studies. Additionally, the in-silico model reveals that NPs in emulsions and oil-based media predominantly follow the intercellular and transappendageal route. In contrast, those embedded in aqueous media favor the intracellular route. These findings offer insights for optimizing NP-based drug delivery systems.

AB  - In this study, the effects of trehalose and 1, 3-cyclohexanediol (1, 3-CHD) on the ultrastructure of frozen-thawed ram sperm were assessed and compared. In the control group, sperm were frozen without trehalose and 1, 3-CHD. In the trehalose group, 100 mM trehalose was used for sperm cryopreservation. In the cyclohexanediol group, the freezing extender contained 100 mM 1, 3-CHD. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe the ultrastructural alterations of sperm. For verification of the TEM results, the plasma membrane and acrosome integrity of ram frozen sperm was assessed. Three fertility-proven rams were used in this study. Semen collection was repeated 6 times. The collected semen was pooled to preclude the individual difference each time. The sperm collected from a representative ram were used for ultrastructural observation. The TEM results indicated extensive and severe cryoinjuries on the main organelles of ram frozen sperm. Some alterations in plasma membrane, including detachment, rupture, dilation, or loss, appeared in post-thaw sperm. The bending shape and leakage of genetic materials were also observed in the nucleus. In addition, the outer acrosome membrane in some frozen sperm was broken or partly lost. Further, leakage of the inner contents of acrosomes also occurred. Sperm mitochondria was negatively influenced by cryopreservation. With 1, 3-CHD or trehalose, the percentage of sperm with normal acrosomes was 62% or 64%, and it was significantly higher than that of the control (41.51%, p < 0.05). However, different from trehalose, 1, 3-CHD cannot efficiently protect the post-thaw integrity of the plasma membrane (48.09% vs. 26.92%, p < 0.05). The TEM results were consistent with the quality assessment of frozen-thawed sperm. Collectively, trehalose and 1, 3-CHD can mitigate cryoinjuries on sperm ultrastructure. The cryoprotective effects of trehalose on sperm plasma membrane are superior to 1, 3-CHD. Sperm plasma membrane is the most sensitive to cryoinjuries, followed by acrosomes, mitochondria, and nuclei.

AB  - Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a difficult-to-control bacterium since commercial vaccines do not prevent colonization and excretion. The present study aimed to evaluate the performance of an orally administered vaccine composed of antigens extracted from Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and incorporated into mesoporous silica (SBA-15), which has an adjuvant-carrier function, aiming to potentiate the action of the commercial intramuscular vaccine. A total of 60 piglets were divided into four groups (n = 15) submitted to different vaccination protocols as follows, Group 1: oral SBA15 + commercial vaccine at 24 days after weaning, G2: oral vaccine on the third day of life + vaccine commercial vaccine at 24 days, G3: commercial vaccine at 24 days, and G4: commercial vaccine + oral vaccine at 24 days. On the first day, the piglets were weighed and, from the third day onwards, submitted to blood collections for the detection and quantification of anti-Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae IgG. Nasal swabs were collected to monitor IgA by ELISA, and oropharyngeal swabs were used to assess the bacterial load by qPCR. Biological samples were collected periodically from the third day of life until the 73rd day. At 41 days of life, 15 individuals of the same age, experimentally challenged with an inoculum containing M. hyopneumoniae, were co-housed with the animals from groups (1 to 4) in a single pen to increase the infection pressure during the nursery period. At 73 days, all piglets were euthanized, and lungs were evaluated by collecting samples for estimation of bacterial load by qPCR. Quantitative data obtained from physical parameters and laboratory investigation were analyzed by performing parametric or non-parametric statistical tests. Results indicate that animals from G2 showed smaller affected lung areas compared to G3. Animals from G2 and G4 had a low prevalence of animals shedding M. hyopneumoniae at 61 days of age. Additionally, no correlation was observed between lung lesions and M. hyopneumoniae load in lung and BALF samples in animals that received the oral vaccine, while a strong correlation was observed in other groups. In the present study, evidence points to the effectiveness of the oral vaccine developed for controlling M. hyopneumoniae in pig production under field conditions.

AB  - Flexible surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates have become one of the research hot spots due to the facile sampling by swabbing or wrapping on rough surfaces and the sensitive and nondestructive detection of contaminants. In this work, we proposed a simple and fast in situ reduction method to prepare Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) composited agar hydrogel (Ag NPs@Agar) flexible SERS substrate. Owing to the three-dimen-sional (3D) structure, good hydrophilicity and adsorption of the agar hydrogel, Ag NPs were grown uniformly in the 3D cross-linked structure. The distribution density of Ag NPs was further increased by the volume shrinkage when the hydrogel was dried in air. This high density and uniformly distribution of Ag NPs produced a large number of highly active SERS regions. In addition, the sensitivity of Ag NPs@Agar was further improved with the assistance of hydrophilic agar gel, which can trap the probe molecules into highly active SERS areas. The SERS results showed that the substrate can be used to detect dye molecules (rhodamine 6G), the minimum detectable concentration was 10-15 M, the relative standard deviation tested at 18 different positions was only 7.58%, and the intensity of the characteristic peak at 611 cm-1 decreased only about 10% after 49 days of storage, demonstrating the superior stability. Moreover, the Ag NPs@Agar substrate also could successfully achieve the micro-trace detection of melamine and sodium penicillin G in Xinjiang specialty camel milk powder. The above available results show that the prepared flexible Ag NPs@Agar SERS substrates possess potentials for the illegal additives and antibiotics in food safety analysis.

AB  - Respiratory viruses continue to present serious health challenges to human wellness. Growing evidence suggests that the more severe and damaging effects and symptoms of influenza, rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 may primarily result from their common ability to disorganize the body's healthy immune response. The simultaneous over-stimulation of several reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways and concurrent suppression of bioavailable Nitic Oxide (NO) contribute to an immune disbalance that can lead to cellular oxidative distress and an excessive inflammatory response. This study evaluated the real-time, acute ability of a single, orally administered 50 mg encapsulated dose of a plant-based dietary supplement ("PB-Blend"), compared to 1000 mg of Vitamin C as a positive control, to modulate multiple ROS associated with a dampened immune response, as well as NO and other markers of inflammation, in a cohort recovering from a moderate course of COVID-19. This randomized, double-blind study was performed on 28 individuals 18-24 days after a moderate COVID-19 infection. Participants were orally supplemented with a single encapsulated dose of either 50 mg of PB-Blend or 1000 mg Vitamin C as a positive control. Changes in the levels of bioavailable NO (measured as circulating NOHb) were assessed, as well as the ex vivo cellular formation of mitochondrial, NOX2-, iNOS-, and TNF alpha-dependent ROS. All parameters were measured in real time before ingestion (baseline), and then at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after administration. ROS were measured using a portable electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. Inflammatory, immunity (hsCRP and TNF alpha plasma levels), interleukin (IL1, IL6, IL8, and IL10), cytokine (IFN gamma, TNF alpha, and NF-kappa B), and immunoglobulin (IgA, IgM, IgG, and IgE) profiles were also followed. In addition to laboratory and cell function investigations, we performed clinical cardio ergometry, blood O2 saturation, and respirometry examinations. As hypothesized, the collected baseline data from this study group confirmed that mitochondrial, NOX2, and iNOS enzymatic systems were strongly involved in the generation of ROS at 18-24 days following a positive COVID-19 PCR test. Acute single-dose supplementation of 50 mg PB-Blend had a multifunctional impact on ROS and significantly inhibited the following: (a.) mitochondrial ROS levels by up to 56%; (b.) iNOS by up to 60%; and (c.) NOX2-dependent ROS generation by up to 49%. Moreover, 1000 mg Vitamin C supplementation exhibited narrower ROS-mitigating activity by solely inhibiting NOX2-dependent ROS generation by 45%. Circulating NOHb levels were significantly increased after PB-Blend administration (33%), but not after Vitamin C administration. PB-Blend and Vitamin C exhibited similar potential to reduce ex vivo high dose TNF alpha (200 ng/mL)-induced H2O2 formation. These results suggest that 50 mg of PB-Blend has the potential to modulate disbalanced mitochondria, iNOS, and NOX2 enzymatic systems that can be engendered during respiratory viral infection and subsequent recovery. Moreover, PB-Blend, but not Vitamin C, showed potential to upregulate bioavailable NO, which is known to decline under these conditions. Based upon these observations, PB-Blend could be considered an alternative to, or to be used in tandem with Vitamin C in applications that promote immune support and recovery during seasons of heightened respiratory viral risk (e.g., "flu season").

AB  - Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) is one of the coactivators recruited by the nuclear receptors (NRs) when NRs are activated by steroid hormones, such as glucocorticoid. SRC-1 is abundant in hippocampus and hypothalamus and is also related to some major risk factors for depression, implicated by its reduced expression after stress and its effect on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis function. However, whether SRC-1 is involved in the formation of depression remains unclear. In this study, we firstly established chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce depressive-like behaviors in mice and found that SRC-1 expression was reduced by CUS. A large number of studies have shown that neuroinflammation is associated with stress-induced depression and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection can lead to neuroinflammation and depressive-like behaviors in mice. Our result indicated that LPS treatment also decreased SRC-1 expression in mouse brain, implying the involvement of SRC-1 in the process of inflammation and depression. Next, we showed that the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) failed to elicit the depressive-like behaviors and dramatically promoted the expression of SRC-1 in brain of wild type mice. What's more, the SRC-1 knockout mice were more susceptible to CUMS to develop depressive-like behaviors and presented the changed expression of glucocorticoid receptor. However, SRC-1 deficiency did not affect the microglia activation induced by CUMS. Altogether, these results indicate a correlation between SRC-1 level and depressive-like behaviors, suggesting that SRC-1 might be involved in the development of depression induced by stress.

AB  - Precisely localizing the spatial distribution of proteins within various brain cell types and subcellular compartments, such as the synapses, is essential for generating and testing hypotheses to elucidate their roles in brain function. While the fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3) has been extensively studied in the context of blood cell development and leukemia pathogenesis, its role in the brain remains poorly understood. Previous efforts to address this issue were hindered by the low expression levels of Flt3 and the limited sensitivity of the standard immunolabeling method, which were insufficient to reliably detect Flt3 protein in brain tissue. In this study, we systematically characterized Flt3 protein localization during brain development using a highly sensitive immunolabeling method based on alkaline phosphatase (AP) polymer biochemistry. This approach revealed a previously unrecognized neuron-selective Flt3 expression pattern in both mouse and human cerebella, with a developmental increase in total protein levels accompanied by a shift from a cytosolic to a dendritic subcellular distribution. Combining AP-polymer-based immunohistochemistry (AP-IHC) for Flt3 with conventional immunostaining of cell type marker proteins revealed parvalbumin- and calbindin-positive Purkinje cells to be the main cell type expressing Flt3 in the cerebellum. To validate the versatility of the AP-IHC method for detecting low-abundance neuronal proteins, we demonstrated robust labeling of Kir2.1, a potassium channel protein, in brain tissue sections from mouse, pig, and human samples. We further applied the AP-IHC method to human stem cell-derived neurons, effectively visualizing the postsynaptic density scaffold protein PSD95 within synapses. To our knowledge, this is the first study to employ an AP-IHC method combined with other standard immunofluorescent staining to co-detect weakly expressed neuronal proteins and other cellular markers in brain tissue and cultured neurons. Additionally, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized neuron-specific pattern of Flt3 expression in the cerebellum, laying the foundation for future mechanistic studies on its role in normal brain development and neurological disorders.

AB  - The vasculature is a key component of adult brain neural stem cell (NSC) niches. In the adult mammalian hippocampus, NSCs reside in close contact with a dense capillary network. How this niche is maintained is unclear. We recently found that adult hippocampal NSCs express VEGF, a soluble factor with chemoattractive properties for vascular endothelia. Here, we show that global and NSCspecific VEGF loss led to dissociation of NSCs and their intermediate progenitor daughter cells from local vasculature. Surprisingly, though, we found no changes in local vascular density. Instead, we found that NSC-derived VEGF supports maintenance of gene expression programs in NSCs and their progeny related to cell migration and adhesion. In vitro assays revealed that blockade of VEGF receptor 2 impaired NSC motility and adhesion. Our findings suggest that NSCs maintain their own proximity to vasculature via self-stimulated VEGF signaling that supports their motility towards and/or adhesion to local blood vessels.

AB  - In the central nervous system (CNS), the apelin/APJ system is broadly expressed. According to some studies, activation of this system protects against excitotoxicity mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and exerts neuroprotective effects. However, the role of this system in epilepsy remains unclear. In the present study, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used to assess APJ localization and expression in the brains of mice with recurrent spontaneous seizures induced by kainic acid (KA). Behavior and local field po-tentials (LFPs) were assessed in mice with KA-induced seizures. Susceptibility to seizures was assessed in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure model. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to evaluate the role of the apelin/APJ system in regulating synaptic transmission in brain slices from mice in which Mg2+-free medium was used to induce seizures. NMDA receptor GluN2B subunit expression and phosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser1480 were measured in the mouse hippocampus. APJ was primarily localized in neurons, and its expression was upregulated in the epileptic brain. APJ activation after KA-induced status epilepticus (SE) reduced epileptic activity, whereas APJ inhibition aggravated epileptic activity. In the PTZ model, APJ activation reduced and APJ inhibition increased susceptibility to seizures. The apelin/APJ system affected NMDA receptor-mediated post-synaptic currents in patch-clamp recordings. Moreover, APJ regulated the levels of GluN2B phosphorylated at Ser1480 and the abundance of cell-surface GluN2B in neurons. Furthermore, endocytosis of the NMDA receptor GluN2B subunit was regulated by the apelin/APJ system. Together, our findings indicate that the apelin/APJ system modulates seizure activity and may be a novel therapeutic target for epilepsy.

AB  - Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a prevalent inflammatory disease primarily affecting the nasal mucosa and is caused by allergies. The common symptoms of AR include rhinorrhea, sneezing, itchy nose, congestion, teary eyes, and nasal rubbings. The present study assessed the beneficial properties of bakuchiol on OVA-induced AR in mice via the regulation of inflammatory responses. AR was induced by injecting (i.p.) OVA (50 mu g) and aluminum hydroxide (1 mg) into mice at various time intervals. The bakuchiol treatment was done at dosages of 10 and 20 mg/kg with dexamethasone (2.5 mg/kg) as a positive control. The body weight and nasal symptoms were measured on the day of the last OVA challenge. For in vitro tests, mouse splenocytes were isolated, sensitized with 20 mu L OVA, and then treated with 10 mu M bakuchiol. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulins, histamine, leukotriene C4 (LTC-4), and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) were assayed using the corresponding assay kits. The assay kits were also used to analyze the status of oxidative stress markers. The Th1/Th2 cell proportion was assessed using flow cytometry. The bakuchiol (10 and 20 mg/kg) treatment reduced the nasal symptoms in AR mice. Bakuchiol decreased the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, Igs (IgE and IgG1), histamine, IL-10, IL-33, and TNF-alpha in AR mice. Bakuchiol also reduced PGDA and LTC-4 levels in the NLF of AR mice. The ROS and MDA levels were decreased, whereas boosted SOD activity was observed in the bakuchiol-treated AR mice. The eosinophil count was decreased in the nasal tissues of bakuchiol-treated AR mice. Bakuchiol also influenced the Th1 and Th2 cell proportions in AR mice. The present findings suggest that bakuchiol is effective against OVA-mediated allergic and inflammatory responses in AR mice through its strong anti-inflammatory properties.

AB  - Parvalbumin (PV) neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) orchestrate cognitive functions via extensive brain-wide projections. However, the age-related cognitive decline of their anatomical circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we employed viral tracing and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) to reveal the vulnerability of the BF-PV circuits during aging. Quantitative whole-brain fluorescence intensity analysis revealed that BF-PV neurons projecting to the medial mammillary nucleus (MM) exhibited pronounced age-dependent neurodegeneration, characterized by 81.1% fiber loss and axonal swelling, while those innervating hippocampal CA1 showed a 70.3% reduction in fiber density. Optogenetic interventions demonstrated that selective activation of the BFPV-MM circuit can ameliorate cognitive deficits in old mice, significantly improving the novel object recognition index and its change rate. In contrast, modulation of the BFPV-CA1 circuit showed no significant effects. Moreover, with the whole-brain dataset, we reconstructed the morphology of individual neurons, revealing structural divergence between MM- and CA1-projecting PV neurons. Taken together, our results delineate the optogenetic-targeted activation of the BFPV-MM circuit, which can ameliorate age-related cognitive decline and provide both theoretical and therapeutic foundations for targeting neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Chondrosarcoma (CHS) is a rare type of soft sarcoma with increased production of cartilage matrix arising from soft bone tissues. Currently, surgical resection is the primary clinical treatment for chondrosarcoma due to the poor response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the therapeutic effect is not satisfactory due to the higher local recurrence rate. Thus, management and elucidation of the pathological mechanism of chondrosarcoma remain an ongoing challenge, and the development of effective chondrosarcoma mouse models and treatment options are urgently needed. Here, we generated a new transgenic chondrosarcoma model by double conditional deletions of Trp53 and Rb1 in chondrocyte lineage which spontaneously caused spinal chondrosarcoma and lung metastasis. Bioinformatic analysis of the human soft sarcoma database showed that Trp53 and Rb1 genes had higher mutations, reaching up to approximately 33.5% and 8.7%, respectively. Additionally, Trp53 and Rb1 signatures were decreased in the human and mouse chondrosarcoma tissues. Mechanistically, we found that YAP expression and activity were significantly increased in mouse Col2-Cre;Trp53(f/f)/Rb1(f/f) chondrosarcoma tissues compared to the adjacent normal cartilage. Knockdown of YAP in primary chondrosarcoma cells significantly inhibited chondrosarcoma proliferation, invasion, and tumorsphere formation. Chondrocyte lineage ablation of YAP delayed chondrosarcoma progression and lung metastasis in Col2-Cre;Trp53(f/f)/Rb1(f/f) mice. Moreover, we found that metformin served as a YAP inhibitor, which bound to the activity area of YAP protein, and inhibited chondrosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and progression in vitro and significantly suppressed chondrosarcoma formation in vivo. Collectively, this study identifies the inhibition of YAP may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chondrosarcoma.

AB  - Evidence has validated the prophylactic effects of exercising on different aspects of health. On the opposite side, immobilization may lead to various destructive effects causing neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated the association between exercising and mitochondrial quality for preventing the destructive effects of restraint stress in different rat brain regions. Twenty-four male Wistar rats, were randomized into four groups (n = 6), exercise, stress, exercise + stress, and control. The exercise procedure consisted of running on a rodent treadmill for 8 weeks, and rats in the stress group were immobilized for 6 h. Rats were then euthanized by decapitation and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme activity, antioxidant levels, and mitochondrial biogenesis factors were assessed in the frontal, hippocampus, parietal and temporal regions using spectrophotometer and western blot technique. Based on our results, increased activity of TCA cycle enzymes in the exercised and exercise-stressed groups was detected, except for malate dehydrogenase which was decreased in exercise-stressed group, and fumarase that did not change. Furthermore, the level of antioxidant agents (superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione), mitochondrial biogenesis factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and mitochondrial transcription factor A), and dynamics markers (Mitofusin 2, dynamic related protein 1, PTEN induced putative kinase-1, and parkin) increased in both mentioned groups. Interestingly our results also revealed that the majority of the mitochondrial factors increased in the frontal and parietal lobes, which may be in relation with the location of motor and sensory areas. Exercise can be used as a prophylactic approach against bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - NRXN1 encoding the synaptic organizing protein neurexin 1 (Nrxn1) is among the strongest risk genes for autism spectrum disorders as well as other neuropsychiatric disorders. The most common contributing mutation is a deletion in one allele. While mice lacking one form of the protein, Nrxn1 alpha, have been characterized, information is lacking on animal models with heterozygous deletion of all isoforms, as well as on therapeutic approaches directly targeting Nrxn1. We report that Nrxn1+/- mice with a deletion affecting all isoforms, alpha, beta and gamma, show deficits in excitatory synaptic transmission affecting presynaptic and postsynaptic properties at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, and show increased repetitive behaviors. Based on previous studies indicating that exclusion of the insert at Nrxn1 splice site 5 (S5) boosts synaptic transmission, we tested S5 exclusion as a therapeutic approach. Genetic exclusion of S5 in the remaining Nrxn1 allele alleviated the deficits, restoring miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency, paired pulse ratio, AMPA/NMDA ratio, and repetitive behaviors to wild type levels and partially restoring Nrxn1 protein level in Nrxn1 Delta S5/- compared to Nrxn1+/- mice. These data suggest that S5 exclusion may be a beneficial therapeutic direction in cases of neuropsychiatric disorders involving NRXN1.

AB  - The ability to use sensory cues to inform goal-directed actions is a critical component of behavior. To study how sounds guide anticipatory licking during classical conditioning, we employed high-density electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampal CA1 area and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice. CA1 and PFC neurons undergo distinct learning-dependent changes at the single-cell level and maintain representations of cue identity at the population level. In addition, reactivation of task-related neuronal assemblies during hippocampal awake Sharp-Wave Ripples (aSWRs) changed within individual sessions in CA1 and over the course of multiple sessions in PFC. Despite both areas being highly engaged and synchronized during the task, we found no evidence for coordinated single cell or assembly activity during conditioning trials or aSWR. Taken together, our findings support the notion that persistent firing and reactivation of task-related neural activity patterns in CA1 and PFC support learning during classical conditioning.

AB  - Intercropping with guava (Psidium guajava L.) can assist with the management of Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama), the insect vector of the huanglongbing pathogen, in citrus orchards. Sulfur volatiles have a repellent activity and physiological effects, as well as being important components of guava volatiles. In this study, we tested whether the sulfur volatiles emitted by guava plants play a role in plant-plant communications and trigger anti-herbivore activities against ACP in sweet orange plants (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck). Real-time determination using a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) showed that guava plants continuously release methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and the contents increased rapidly after mechanical damage. The exposure of orange plants to DMDS resulted in the suppression of the developmental performance of ACP. The differential elevation of salicylic acid (SA) levels; the expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), salicylate-O-methyl transferase (SMT), and pathogenesis-related (PR1) genes; the activities of defense-related enzymes PAL, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POD); and the total polyphenol content were observed in DMDS-exposed orange plants. The emission of volatiles including myrcene, nonanal, decanal, and methyl salicylate (MeSA) was increased. In addition, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, and aromatic amino acid (such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) metabolic pathways were induced. Altogether, our results indicated that DMDS from guava plants can activate defense responses in eavesdropping orange plants and boost their herbivore resistance to ACP, which suggests the possibility of using DMDS as a novel approach for the management of ACP in citrus orchards.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that stress modulates the competitive interaction between the hippocampus and striatum, two structures known to be critically involved in motor sequence learning. These earlier investigations, however, have largely focused on blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses. No study to date has examined the link between stress, motor learning and levels of striatal and hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This knowledge gap is surprising given the known role of GABA in neuroplasticity subserving learning and memory. The current study thus examined: a) the effects of motor learning and stress on striatal and hippocampal GABA levels; and b) how learning- and stress-induced changes in GABA relate to the neural correlates of learning. To do so, fifty-three healthy young adults were exposed to a stressful or non-stressful control intervention before motor sequence learning. Striatal and hippocampal GABA levels were assessed at baseline and post-intervention/learning using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Regression analyses indicated that stress modulated the link between striatal GABA levels and functional plasticity in both the hippocampus and striatum during learning as measured with fMRI. This study provides evidence for a role of GABA in the stress-induced modulation of striatal and hippocampal systems.
   Using fMRI and MRS measurements from healthy, young adults, Dolfen et al examined the effects of motor learning and stress on striatal and hippocampal GABA levels, as well as effects on neural correlates of learning. They demonstrated that stress modulated the link between striatal GABA levels and functional plasticity in the hippocampus and striatum, which reveals a role for GABA in the stress-induced modulation of these systems.

AB  - Cisplatin is a drug used effectively in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, cisplatin has many side ef-fects, including cognitive impairment. Agomelatine, a synthetic melatonin analogue, is an important antide-pressant. Increasing evidence has shown that agomelatine may be a potential neuroprotective agent. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of agomelatine on learning and memory functions in cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment in a rat model. Male rats were administered agomelatine and cisplatin for 4 weeks. Neurobehavioral tests were performed at the end of the 4th week. After behavioral tests, rats were euthanized and BDNF, TNF, IL-1 beta, MDA and GSH levels were measured in hippocampal homegenates by ELISA. In addition, nNOS and TrkB receptor activity were measured immunohistochemically. The results showed that agomelatine significantly improved cognitive functions in spatial memory tests in rats with cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment. In addition, agomelatine treatment positively affected the discrimination index (DI). On the other hand, agomelatine treatment elevated cisplatin-suppressed hippocampal BDNF levels. Agomelatine treatment reduced cisplatin-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing TNF and IL-1 beta levels. Similarly, agomelatine reduced oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Histological findings showed that agomelatine treatment reduced pyramidal neuron damage in hippocampal DG, CA1 and CA3. Cisplatin increased nNOS and TrkB positivity in DG, CA1 and CA3 neurons compared to control. In contrast, agomelatine treatment decreased both nNOS and TrkB positive scores. These findings indicate that agomelatine reduces cisplatin-related cognitive impairment by exerting anti-inflammatory action and possibly by the modulation of the BDNF/TrkB/nNOS pathways in the hippocampus.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of two types of exercise on the hypothalamic expression of CRH and GnRH genes in response to acute noise stress in young rats. 42 male Wistar rats were divided into 7 groups including control (Con), Control Time (CT), acute noise stress (S), Moderate-intensity Continuous Training (MCT), High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), MCT + noise stress (MS), and HIIT + noise stress (HS). Exercise raining was performed for eight weeks. Noise stress was induced for one session. Hippocampus samples were taken 48 h following eight weeks in exercise training groups (MCT and HIIT) as well as CT and just after noise stress in related groups (S, HS, and MS). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the groups. CRH expression was significantly higher in the HIIT group while was significantly lower in the MCT group compared to the CT group (P = 0.0001). GnRH expression was significantly lower in the HIIT group than the MCT group; it was significantly higher in MCT group than the CT group (P = 0.0001). CRH expression increased in S group (P = 0.0001); it was significantly lower in HS and MS groups than in S group. CRH expression was significantly higher while, GnRH expression was significantly lower in the MS group compared to MCT group (P = 0.0001). So, HIIT inhibited GnRH and increased CRH while MCT increased GnRH and inhibited CRH gene expression. HIIT and MCT training, in that order, were effective in reducing the effects of noise stress.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (A beta)-containing amyloid plaques, and microglia play a critical role in mediating A beta clearance. Mounting evidence has confirmed that the ability of microglia in clearing A beta decreased with aging and AD progress, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Previously, we have demonstrated that Nogo receptor (NgR), a receptor for three axon growth inhibitors associated with myelin, can decrease adhesion and migration of microglia to fibrils A beta with aging. However, whether NgR expressed on microglia affect microglia phagocytosis of fibrils A beta with aging remains unclear. Here, we found that aged but not young microglia showed increased NgR expression and decreased A beta phagocytosis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NgR knockdown APP/PS1 mice showed simultaneous reduced amyloid burden and improved spatial learning and memory, which were associated with increased A beta clearance. Importantly, Nogo-P4, an agonist of NgR, enhanced the protein level of p-Smad2/3, leading to a significant transcriptional inhibition of CD36 gene expression, which in turn decreased the microglial phagocytosis of A beta. Moreover, ROCK accounted for Nogo-P4-induced activation of Smad2/3 signaling. Finally, the decreasing effect of NgR on microglial A beta uptake was confirmed in a mouse model of intra-hippocampal fA beta injection. Our findings suggest that NgR may play an important role in the regulation of A beta homeostasis, and has potential as a therapeutic target for AD.

AB  - Although radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for brain tumors, it always injures the central nervous system, leading to potential sequelae such as cognitive dysfunction. Radiation induces molecular, cellular, and functional changes in neuronal and glial cells. The hippocampus plays a critical role in learning and memory; therefore, concerns about radiation-induced injury are widespread. Multiple studies have focused on this complex problem, but the results have not been fully elucidated. Naked mole rat brains were irradiated with Co-60 at a dose of 10 Gy. On 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after irradiation, hippocampi in the control groups were obtained for next-generation sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were subsequently performed. Venn diagrams revealed 580 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were common at different times after irradiation. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that the 580 common DEGs were enriched in molecular transducer activity. In particular, CACNA1B mediated regulatory effects after irradiation. CACNA1B expression increased significantly after irradiation. Downregulation of CACNA1B led to a reduction in apoptosis and reactive oxygen species levels in hippocampal neurons. This was due to the interaction between CACNA1B and Nrf2, which disturbed the normal nuclear localization of Nrf2. In addition, CACNA1B downregulation led to a decrease in the cognitive functions of naked mole rats. These findings reveal the pivotal role of CACNA1B in regulating radiation-induced brain injury and will lead to the development of a novel strategy to prevent brain injury after irradiation.

AB  - Aim: Gamma radiation, a form of ionizing radiation, is used in many different areas, especially in the health field and in the treatment of cancer. However, gamma radiation used for therapeutic purposes also has numerous harmful effects on human health. This study was planned to investigate the impacts of exposure to gamma ra-diation on the hippocampal area and the preventive effects of myricitrin and chebulinic acid against that damage.Material and method: Thirty-six male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into six groups. The control group was exposed to no treatment. The chebulinic acid and myricitrin groups were injected with the relevant drug at a dosage of 0.033 mg/kg) (vehicle; normal saline) per day. The gamma groups were placed in a plexiglass test setup with their heads positioned close to the source. The subjects were exposed to radiation with a mixed source containing radioactive Cs-137 and Co-60 isotopes obtained from Ondokuz Mayis University Physics Department Nuclear Physics Laboratory for 1 h. Gamma radiation was applied 16 mGy for one hour per day for 10 days. The gamma radiation+chebulinic acid and the gamma radiation myricitrin groups also received 0.033 mg/kg per day of these drugs via injection. Immediately after the experimental procedure, all animals were subjected to behavioural tests, and perfused brain tissues were analyzed using stereological methods.Results: Stereological analysis showed that gamma radiation caused a decrease in the numbers of neurons in the hippocampal area (p < 0.01; One-way ANOVA) and that chebulinic acid and myricitrin reduced this decrease (p < 0.01; One-way ANOVA). Decreases in learning and memory capacity were detected in behavioural tests in rats from the Gamma group.Conclusion: The study findings showed that that the adverse health effects of Gamma radiation can be amelio-rated using myricitrin and chebulinic acid. Myricitrin was more effective in terms of cell proliferation and defence against oxidative stress than chebulinic acid, and exhibited a more neuroprotective effect. However, more detailed analyses should be performed before using either antioxidant for therapeutic purposes.

AB  - LRRTMs are postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins that have region-restricted expression in the brain. To determine their role in the molecular organization of synapses in vivo, we studied synapse development and plasticity in hippocampal neuronal circuits in mice lacking both Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2. We found that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 regulate the density and morphological integrity of excitatory synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons in the developing brain but are not essential for these roles in the mature circuit. Further, they are required for long-term-potentiation in the CA3-CA1 pathway and the dentate gyrus, and for enduring fear memory in both the developing and mature brain. Our data show that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 regulate synapse development and function in a cell-type and developmental-stage-specific manner, and thereby contribute to the fine-tuning of hippocampal circuit connectivity and plasticity.

AB  - The behavioral responses of Hypera rumicis L. adults to varying blends of synthetic plant volatiles (SPVs) at various concentrations in lieu of single compounds are reported for the first time. For this study, Rumex confertus plants were treated with two blends of SPVs at different quantities that act as either attractants or repellents to insects. Blend 1 (B1) consisted of five green leaf volatiles (GLVs), namely (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, (E)-2-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. Blend 2 (B2) contained six plant volatiles, namely (Z)-ocimene, linalool, benzyl acetate, methyl salicylate, beta-caryophyllene, and (E)-beta-farnesene. Each blend was made available in four different amounts of volatiles, corresponding to each compound being added to 50 mu L of hexane in amounts of 1, 5, 25 and 125 ng. The effects of the two blends at the different concentrations on the insects were evaluated using a Y-tube olfactometer. Both sexes of the insects were found to be significantly repelled by the highest volatile levels of B1 and by two levels of B2 (25 and 125 ng). Females were also observed to be repelled using B2 with 5 ng of each volatile. Attraction was observed for both sexes only for B1 at the three lower volatile levels (1, 5 and 25 ng). In additional experiments, using only attractants, unmated females were found to be attracted to males, whereas mated females were only attracted to B1. Both unmated and mated males (previously observed in copula) were attracted only to females.

AB  - The application of spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) will be more effective and feasible following the successful cryopreservation and transfer of SSCs in livestock. Like other cells, SSCs are also sensitive to cryoinjury; hence composition of the cryomedia and freezing protocols need to be optimized. The present study aims to optimize the best freezing rates by minimising the ice crystallization and dehydration effect in order to maximize the post-thaw SSCs survivability and stemness characteristics. Three different freezing protocols with varied cooling profiles, cooling profile 1 (isopropanol based freezing): 1 degrees C/min from 0 degrees C to -10 degrees C, 0.5 degrees C/min up to -40 degrees C, further reduced to 0.25 degrees C/min up to -50 degrees C and 0.1 degrees C/min to -60 degrees C; cooling profile 2 (using programmable freezer): 1 degrees C/min up to 4 degrees C, 0.3 degrees C/min up to -8 degrees C, and cooled at 0.5 degrees C/min to -50 degrees C, further decrease to -90 degrees C (8 degrees C/min) and cooling profile 3 (uncontrolled rapid freezing): 3.3 degrees C/min from 0 degrees C to -10 degrees C, 5 degrees C/min up to -40 degrees C, 2 degrees C/min to -50 degrees C and 1.2 degrees C/min up to -60 degrees C, were compared for cryopreservation efficiency. The overall viability (91.41 +/- 2.00 % Vs 74.59 +/- 2.34 %), stemness activity (1.34 +/- 0.095 OD units Vs 0.356 +/- 0.026 OD units), and proliferation rate (0.849 +/- 0.019 OD units Vs 0.749 +/- 0.015 OD units) of post-thaw SSC culture irrespective of the freezing regimes were significantly decreased when compared to pre-freeze SSC culture characteristics. The post-thaw viability was significantly greater in cooling profile 1 (79.64 +/- 4.1 %) when compared to cooling profile 2 (69.72 +/- 2.4 %) and cooling profile 3 (75.43 +/- 4.8 %). Also, cooling profile 1 yielded greater (p < 0.05) post-thaw stemness activity (0.456 +/- 0.044 OD units) when compared to other methods. The study suggests that the cooling profile 1 using isopropanol based freezing can be recommended for preservation of viability and stemness characteristics of SSCs.

AB  - Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) hold enormous potential for treating multiple diseases owing to their ability to self-renew and differentiate into any cell type. Albeit possessing such promising potential, controlling their differentiation into a desired cell type continues to be a challenge. Recent studies suggest that PSCs respond to different substrate stiffness and, therefore, can differentiate towards some lineages via Hippo pathway. Human PSCs can also differentiate and self-organize into functional cells, such as organoids. Traditionally, human PSCs are differentiated on stiff plastic or glass plates towards definitive endoderm and then into functional pancreatic progenitor cells in the presence of soluble growth factors. Thus, whether stiffness plays any role in differentiation towards definitive endoderm from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) remains unclear. Our study found that the directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells towards endodermal lineage on the varying stiffness did not differ from the differentiation on stiff plastic dishes. We also observed no statistical difference between the expression of yes-associated protein (YAP) and phosphorylated YAP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid, a YAP activator, enhanced definitive endoderm formation, whereas verteporfin, a YAP inhibitor, did not have the significant effect on the differentiation. In summary, our results suggest that human embryonic stem cells may not differentiate in response to changes in stiffness, and that such cues may not have as significant impact on the level of YAP. Our findings indicate that more research is needed to understand the direct relationship between biophysical forces and hPSCs differentiation.

AB  - The ability to measure changes in neural activities using devices implanted in the brain can be useful for recording brain signals to assess specific risk factors, monitor the development of brain diseases, and expand the understanding of neural circuitry. Here, a neuroimplantable interface is introduced that integrates biomaterials with an advanced structural design to facilitate monitoring of electrophysiological responses in widespread brain regions. The neural interface uses biocompatible and photopatternable materials to create ultrathin, homogeneous encapsulant/substrate laminates. Comprehensive in vitro tests of the laminin-enveloped neural interface demonstrate efficacy in relieving inflammation via a biomimetic strategy by diminishing microglia and astrocyte aggregation near recording sites, enhancing periodic signal acquisition. The performance is evaluated by injecting an acetylcholine receptor agonist into mouse brains. This approach enables to monitor real-time signal changes, gain insights into neural network dynamics by assessing stimulus-evoked signaling at specific sites, and identify signaling patterns and hippocampal synaptic connections. Additionally, in a Parkinson's disease mouse model, deep brain stimulation is performed and signals are recorded to confirm symptom amelioration, offering a biomedical device approach. The key strategy highlights intact neural electrodes with biocompatible, mechanically compliant materials conferring compact bioelectronic functionalities, high neuronal microenvironment compatibility, and pathological neural system recognition.

AB  - Pediatric survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) suffer from long-term neurologic disabilities, including deficits in memory and learning. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) can assess alterations in brain neurochemical profile non-invasively in vivo over time. Our study aimed to evaluate (1) the longitudinal metabolic alterations in the hippocampus after TBI using in vivo 1H-MRS and MRI in developing rat brain, and (2) test whether treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) affects hippocampal metabolic profile. Using a controlled cortical impact model of TBI, we used post-natal day (PND) 21 rat pups and acquired longitudinal 1H-MRS of the ipsilateral perilesional and contralateral hippocampi 2-4 h, 24 h, 72 h, 7 days, and 21 days post injury. Behavioral analysis was performed on post-injury days (Dpi) 3-7, 14, and 21-28. ALCAR treated rats received intraperitoneal administration (100 mg/kg) at 1 h, 4 h, 12 h, and 23 h post injury. Our results show that TBI in immature brain results in long-term structural and neurochemical alterations. TBI resulted in long-term decreased hippocampal volume and a reduction in levels of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln),gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), myo-inositol (Ins) and taurine (Tau) in the ipsilateral (injured) hippocampus up to 72 h post injury. In TBI + vehicle and TBI + ALCAR groups, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) remained decreased 21 days post injury. Treatment with ALCAR did not significantly change hippocampal neurochemical profile at 24 h post injury. Behavioral studies in TBI-injured rats demonstrated that sensory motor function decreased initially and recovered with time. The TBI + ALCAR group performed significantly better compared to TBI + vehicle group in both sensory motor and hippocampal dependent recognition memory. Further studies with the longer duration of ALCAR administration are necessary to adequately assess the efficacy of ALCAR following pediatric TBI.

AB  - Context Paclitaxel (PTX) leads to chemotherapy brain (chemo-brain) which is characterised by cognitive impairment. It has been reported that necroptosis is associated with cognitive impairment in some neurodegenerative diseases, but it is not clear whether it is related to the development of chemo-brain. Objective To investigate the role of necroptosis and related changes in PTX-induced cognitive impairment. Materials and methods C57bl/6n mice were randomly divided into five groups: control, vehicle, and different concentrations of PTX (6, 8, 10 mg/kg). Two additional groups received pre-treatment with Gdcl3 or PBS through Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection before PTX-treatment. Cognitive function, necroptosis, synaptic plasticity and microglia polarisation were analysed. Results PTX (10 mg/kg) induced significant cognitive impairment, accompanied by changes in synaptic plasticity, including decreased density of PSD95 (0.65-fold), BDNF (0.44-fold) and dendritic spines (0.57-fold). PTX induced necroptosis of 53.41% (RIP3) and 61.91% (MLKL) in hippocampal neurons, with high expression of RIP3 (1.58-fold) compared with the control group. MLKL (1.87-fold) exhibited the same trend, reaching a peak on the 14th day. The increased expression of iNOS (1.63-fold) and inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha (1.85-fold) and IL-beta (1.89-fold) compared to the control group suggests that M1 polarisation of microglia is involved in the process of cognitive impairment. Pre-treatment with Gdcl3 effectively reduced the number of microglia (0.50-fold), inhibited the release of TNF-alpha (0.73-fold) and IL-beta (0.56-fold), and improved cognitive impairment. Conclusion We established a stable animal model of PTX-induced cognitive impairment and explored the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. These findings can guide the future treatment of chemo-brain.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS), marked by enduring metabolic inflammation, has detrimental effects on cognitive performance and brain structure, influencing behavior. This study aimed to investigate whether maternal MetS could negatively impact the neurodevelopment and metabolism of offspring. To test this hypothesis, 2 months old female Wistar rats were subjected to a 10-week regimen of tap water alone or supplemented with 20% fructose to induce MetS. Dams were mated with healthy males to generate litters: OC (offspring from control dams) and OMetS (offspring from dams with MetS). To isolate prenatal effects, all pups were breastfed by control nurse dams, maintaining a standard diet and water ad libitum until weaning. Behavioral assessments were conducted between postnatal days (PN) 22 and 95, and metabolic parameters were analyzed post-sacrifice on PN100. Results from the elevated plus maze, the open field, and the marble burying tests revealed a heightened anxiety-like phenotype in OMetS females. The novel object recognition test showed that exclusively OMetS males had long-term memory impairment. In the reciprocal social interaction test, OMetS displayed a lower number of social interactions, with a notable increase in "socially inactive" behavior observed exclusively in females. Additionally, in the three-chamber test, social preference and social novelty indexes were found to be lower solely among OMetS females. An increase in visceral fat concomitantly with hypertriglyceridemia was the relevant postmortem metabolic finding in OMetS females. In summary, maternal MetS leads to enduring damage and adverse effects on offspring neurobehavior and metabolism, with notable sexual dimorphism.

AB  - In the present study, we produced Pu-erh, Liubao, Qingzhuan, and Fuzhuan teas using a single raw tea material and applied widely targeted metabolomics to study the impact of various microbial-fermented methods on the chemical profile of dark tea. The contents of catechins and free amino acids decreased drastically, whereas the contents of gallic acid and theabrownins increased significantly during microbial fermentation. Pu-erh tea had the highest content of theabrownins (11.82 +/- 0.49%). Moreover, MS-based metabolomics analysis revealed that the different types of dark teas were significantly different from their raw material. A total of 85 differential metabolites were screened among 569 metabolites identified referring to self-compiled database. Glycosylated, hydroxylated, methylated, and condensed and oxidated products originating from microbial bioconversion of their corresponding primitive forms were significantly increased in dark teas. These results suggest that various microbial-fermented methods greatly affect the metabolic profile of dark tea, which can provide useful information for dark tea biochemistry research.

AB  - Although Doppler ultrasonography (USG) is frequently used in human medicine to evaluate placental function and fetal well-being, studies in veterinary medicine are limited. Thus, this study aimed to determine the relationship between placentome perfusion and echotexture and endocrine changes during the last stages of pregnancy in cows using B-mode/Doppler USG and reveal the effects of hormonal changes on placentome and uterine artery hemodynamics. The animals consisted of 12 pregnant Swiss Brown cows 3.8 +/- 0.34 years old with at least one birth. Imaging with USG was continued for 1 month, thrice weekly, until delivery. To determine serum progesterone (P4), total estrogen, and cortisol levels, blood was drawn from the tail vein immediately after USG examinations. Contrast (CON), homogeneity (HOM), and mean gray value (MGV) were determined by placentome echotexture analysis. Color Doppler perfusion areas (A mix) and power Doppler perfusion areas (A red) of the placentome, pulse rate (PR), pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), blood flow velocity (BFVe), blood flow volume (BFVo), and diameter (DM) in the spectral analysis of uterine artery values were collected. ImageJ was used to analyze the B-mode images, and PixelFlux (Chameleon (R) Software, Munster, Germany) was used to calculate the placentome perfusion values and hemodynamic parameters of the uterine artery in Doppler images. In the last month of pregnancy, there was no statistical difference in the placentome echotexture values CON and HOM. However, MGV increased close to birth (P < 0.001). Placentome perfusion level and area did not change significantly but were found to decrease numerically 2 days before delivery (P > 0.05). Uterine artery PR increased from 62.36 bpm on day 25 prepartum to 81.42 bpm at birth (P < 0.05). The P4 concentration decreased in the last month of pregnancy, whereas an increase was detected in estrogen and cortisol during this period (P < 0.05). In the uterine artery of pregnant cornu, RI and PI were negatively correlated with BFVe (P < 0.01). Based on this study, echotextural differences were observed in placentomes in the last stage of pregnancy in cows, and there were significant changes in placental and uterine artery blood flow. These changes may be related to placental maturation, especially on the days close to birth.

AB  - The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the main interface between the sensory association areas of the neocortex and the hippocampus. It is crucial for the evaluation and processing of sensory data for long-term memory consolidation and shows damage in many brain diseases, for example, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and developmental disorders. The pre-alpha layer of the EC in humans (layer II) displays a remarkable distribution of neurons in islands. These cellular islands give rise to a portion of the perforant path-the major reciprocal data stream for neocortical information into the hippocampal formation. However, the functional relevance of the morphological appearance of the pre-alpha layer in cellular islands and the precise timing of their initial appearance during primate evolution are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a comparative study of the EC from 38 nonhuman primates and Homo sapiens and found a strong relationship between gyrification index (GI) and the presence of the pre-alpha cellular islands. The formation of cellular islands also correlated with brain and body weight as well as neopallial volume. In the two human lissencephalic cases, the cellular islands in the pre-alpha layer were lacking. These findings emphasize the relationship between cortical folding and island formation in the EC from an evolutionary perspective and suggest a role in the pathomechanism of developmental brain disorders.

AB  - Retrosplenial area 29e, which was a cortical region described mostly in earlier rodent literature, is often included in the dorsal presubiculum (PrSd) or postsubiculum (PoS) in modern literature and commonly used brain atlases. Recent anatomical and molecular studies have revealed that retrosplenial area 29e belongs to the superficial layers of area prostriata, which in primates is found to be important in fast analysis of quickly moving objects in far peripheral visual field. As in primates, the prostriata in rodents adjoins area 29 (granular retrosplenial area), area 30 (agranular retrosplenial area), medial visual cortex, PrSd/PoS, parasubiculum (PaS), and postrhinal cortex (PoR). The present study aims to reveal the chemoarchitecture of the prostriata versus PrSd/PoS or PaS by means of a systematic survey of gene expression patterns in adult and developing mouse brains. First, we find many genes that display differential expression across the prostriata, PrSd/PoS, and PaS and that show obvious laminar expression patterns. Second, we reveal subsets of genes that selectively express in the dorsal or ventral parts of the prostriata, suggesting the existence of at least two subdivisions. Third, we detect some genes that shows differential expression in the prostriata of postnatal mouse brains from adjoining regions, thus enabling identification of the developing area prostriata. Fourth, gene expression difference of the prostriata from the medial primary visual cortex and PoR is also observed. Finally, molecular and connectional features of the prostriata in rodents and nonhuman primates are discussed and compared.

AB  - Tau protein is involved in maintaining neuronal structure. In Alzheimer's disease, small numbers of tau molecules can aggregate to form oligomers. However, how these oligomers produce changes in neuronal function remains unclear. Previously, oligomers made from full-length human tau were found to have multiple effects on neuronal properties. Here we have cut the tau molecule into two parts: the first 123 amino acids and the remaining 124-441 amino acids. These truncated tau molecules had specific effects on neuronal properties, allowing us to assign the actions of full-length tau to different regions of the molecule. We identified one key target for the effects of tau, the voltage gated sodium channel, which could account for the effects of tau on the action potential. By truncating the tau molecule, we have probed the mechanisms that underlie tau dysfunction, and this increased understanding of tau's pathological actions will build towards developing future tau-targeting therapies.
   Hill et al. examine the effects of full-length or truncated human recombinant tau on the excitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in mice. Their results suggest that effects seen with full-length tau oligomers can be dissected apart using tau truncations and highlights a tau-mediated alteration in voltage-gated sodium channel currents.

AB  - Positive modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to the therapeutic effects of clinically relevant antidepressant drugs, including atypical antipsychotics. Quetiapine, an antipsychotic which represents a therapeutic option in patients who are resistant to classical antidepressants, promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis in preclinical studies. Norquetiapine, the key active metabolite of quetiapine in humans, has a distinctive receptor profile than the parent compound. The drug is indeed a high affinity norepinephrine transporter inhibitor and such activity has been proposed to contribute to its antidepressant effect. At present, no information is available on the effects of norquetiapine on adult neurogenesis. We extensively investigated the activity of quetiapine and norquetiapine on adult murine neural stem/progenitor cells and their progeny. Additionally, selective antagonists for beta(2)/alpha(2) adrenergic receptors allowed us to evaluate if these receptors could mediate quetiapine and norquetiapine effects. We demonstrated that both drugs elicit in vitro proneurogenic effects but also that norquetiapine had distinctive properties which may depend on its ability to inhibit norepinephrine transporter and involve beta(2)/alpha(2) adrenergic receptors.

AB  - Heterosis or hybrid vigor is extensively used in plant breeding. However, the contribution of metabolites to heterosis is still elusive. Here, we systematically identified the non-volatile and volatile metabolites of two hybrids and their parents in Camellia sinensis. The metabolomics analysis showed prevalent non-additive accumulation in hybrids, among which the non-additive nucleotides, alkaloids, organic acids, and tannins contribute to the positive heterosis of hybrids, including typical inosine, guanosine, adenosine, caffeine, succinic acid, adipic acid, xylonic acid, and gallic acid. The catechins and free amino acids in hybrids showed negative heterosis compared to its maternal cultivar TGY. Furthermore, the significant accumulation of non-additive terpenes combined with the mild heterosis of other types of volatiles contributes to the aroma of tea plant hybrids. The genetics of volatiles from different parents affect the aroma of hybrids processed into oolong tea. The comprehensive heterosis of these non-additive metabolites may play an important role in the formation of desirable breeding traits for hybrids. Our results provide insights into the utilization of heterosis breeding and the regulation of heterosis metabolites in tea plants.

AB  - To provide clinical evidence for the management of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) by analyzing the role of soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (sLOX-1) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) in the disease. We purchased 15 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat pups and randomized them into five groups (n=3), of which one group was untreated as the control group and the other four were modeled by HIE. After modeling, a group was treated as a model group without any treatment, another group was injected with sLOX-1-silencing lentiviral vector (sLOX-1-si group), and the third and fourth were injected with CSF1silencing lentiviral vector (CSF1-si group) and an equal amount of normal saline (blank group), respectively. After the corresponding intervention, the rat tissue in each group was obtained to observe the pathological injury by HE and TUNEL staining. In addition, sLOX-1, CSF1, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) levels in brain tissue of each group were determined. The model group showed more severe pathological damage of the hippocampus and higher neuronal apoptosis than the control group. Besides, higher sLOX-1 and CSF1 levels and lower 5-HT, DA and NE contents were identified in the model group versus the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the blank group, sLOX-1-si and CSF1-si groups showed significantly alleviated hippocampal damage, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, reduced 5-HT, DA, NE, Bax, and cl-caspase-3, and increased Bcl-2 (P<0.05). Silencing sLOX-1 and CSF1 expression ameliorated the pathological injury of HIE and inhibited neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - Although the brain fills nearly the entire cranial cavity in birds, it can occupy a small portion of it in crocodilians. The lack of data regarding the volumetric correspondence between the brain and the cranial cavity hampers thorough assessments of the degree of encephalization in non-neornithean dinosaurs and other extinct archosaurs and, consequently, informed inferences regarding their cognitive capacities. Existing data suggest that, across extant archosaurs, the degree of endocranial doming and the volume of intracranial nonneural components are inversely related. We build upon this information to develop an equation relating these two anatomical features in non-neornithean dinosaurs and other extinct archosaurs. We rely on measurements of the endocast doming and brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index in extant relatives of non-neornithean dinosaurs, namely, the crurotarsans Caiman crocodilus, Crocodylus niloticus, and Crocodylus porosus; the paleognaths Struthio camelus and Apteryx mantelli; and the fowl Macrocephalon maleo, Gallus gallus, Meleagris gallopavo, Phasianus colchicus, and Anas platyrhynchos. Applying the equation to representative endocasts from major clades of dinosaurs, we found that BEC varies from about 0.6 in ceratopsians and thyreophorans to around 0.7 in ornithopods, pachycephalosaurians, sauropods, and theropods. We, therefore, warn against the use of a catch-all value, like 0.5, and instead encourage refinement in the adoption of BEC across archosaurs.

AB  - Liver metastasis is a major cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Fatty liver promotes liver metastasis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We demonstrated that hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in fatty liver enhanced the progression of CRC liver metastasis by promoting oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Fatty liver upregulated Rab27a expression, which facilitated EV production from hepatocytes. In the liver, these EVs transferred YAP signaling-regulating microRNAs to cancer cells to augment YAP activity by suppressing LATS2. Increased YAP activity in CRC liver metastasis with fatty liver promoted cancer cell growth and an immunosuppressive microenvironment by M2 macrophage infiltration through CYR61 production. Patients with CRC liver metastasis and fatty liver had elevated nuclear YAP expression, CYR61 expression, and M2 macrophage infiltration. Our data indicate that fatty liver-induced EV-microRNAs, YAP signaling, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment promote the growth of CRC liver metastasis.

AB  - Background: Brown algae from the order Dictyotales are known to produce specialized metabolites with a wide array of biological activities. Studying these compounds is important for understanding their ecological roles, exploring biomedical potential and developing biotechnological applications. Methods: To evaluate the metabolic diversity of brown algae from the shallow habitats of the northern region of San Andr & eacute;s Island (Colombia, SW Caribbean), a metabolic profiling approach was employed, based on 1H-NMR spectra taken from organic extracts. Four sampling expeditions were conducted to collect the most abundant species, taking into account the taxonomic identity, growth substrate and collection date. Results: Five species were found and identified as Canistrocarpus crispatus, Stypopodium zonale, Dictyopteris delicatula, Padina gymnospora and Dictyota spp. Multivariate analyses applied to these spectra revealed that S. zonale and C. crispatus differentiated from the other samples mainly due to the signals for meroditerpenes and diterpenes, respectively. S. zonale had differential metabolic production observed when comparing algae collected in rocky bottoms with thalli growing on dead coral. This difference was attributed to changes in concentrations of the meroditerpene atomaric acid (1). Meanwhile, the major metabolite found in C. crispatus samples was dictyol B acetate (2). Conclusions: NMR metabolomics of San Andr & eacute;s brown algae differentiated species based on lipid content and metabolic complexity. Notably, prenylated-guaiane diterpenes characterized C. crispatus, and meroditerpenoid concentrations varied in S. zonale. Temporal lipid variations were observed in P. gymnospora, while juvenile Dictyota spp. presented a less complex metabolic signature.

AB  - Despite their distinct embryonic origins, the skull and brain are highly integrated. Understanding the covariation between the skull and brain can shed light on anatomical, cognitive, and behavioral traits in extant and extinct species. Domestic dogs offer a unique opportunity to investigate skull-brain covariation due to their diverse skull morphologies and neural anatomy. To assess this question, we examined T2-weighted MRI studies of 62 dogs from 33 breeds, plus an additional 17 dogs of mixed or unknown breeds. Scans were opportunistically collected from a veterinary teaching hospital of dogs that were referred for neurological examination but did not have grossly observable structural brain abnormalities. As the neurocrania of dogs become broader and shorter, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the right olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, marginal gyrus, and cerebellum. On the other hand, as the neurocrania of dogs become narrower and longer, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum, and brainstem. Selective breeding for specific skull shapes may impact canine brain anatomy and function.
   Using T2-weighted MRI studies of 79 dogs, we find that skull shape covaries with brain morphology. Dogs with extreme skull shapes - brachycephaly and dolichocephaly - show regional reductions in relative gray matter volume. image

AB  - Beta-klotho (KLB) is a coreceptor required for endocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 and FGF21 signaling in the brain. Klb is prominent within the hypothalamus, which is consistent with its metabolic functions, but diverse roles for Klb are now emerging. Central Klb expression is low but discrete and may govern FGF-targeted sites. However, given its low expression, it is unclear if Klb mRNA is more widespread. We performed in situ hybridization to label Klb mRNA to generate spatial maps capturing the distribution and levels of Klb within the mouse hypothalamus, hippocampal region, subiculum, and amygdala. Semiquantitative analysis revealed that Klb-labeled cells may express low, medium, or high levels of Klb mRNA. Hypothalamic Klb hybridization was heterogeneous and varied rostrocaudally within the same region. Most Klb-labeled cells were found in the lateral hypothalamic zone, but the periventricular hypothalamic region, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contained the greatest proportion of cells expressing medium or high Klb levels. We also found heterogeneous Klb hybridization in the amygdala and subiculum, where Klb was especially distinct within the central amygdalar nucleus and ventral subiculum, respectively. By contrast, Klb-labeled cells in the hippocampal region only expressed low levels of Klb and were typically found in the pyramidal layer of Ammon's horn or dentate gyrus. The Klb-labeled regions identified in this study are consistent with reported roles of Klb in metabolism, taste preference, and neuroprotection. However, additional identified sites, including within the hypothalamus and amygdala, may suggest novel roles for FGF15/19 or FGF21 signaling.

AB  - Herbivorous land crabs such as Chiromantes haematocheir and C. dehaani show biomass-degrading activities. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analysis to detect biomass-degrading enzymes. A de novo transcriptome assembly in the midgut glands of molting and non-molting C. haematocheir crabs was constructed using RNA sequencing. Illumina sequencing generated 44,937,002 and 44,394,310 reads from the two midgut glands. In total, 178,710 contigs with an average length of 750 bp and an N50 value of 1,235 bp were assembled, of which 37,890 contigs were annotated using BLASTx search against the NCBI database. We identified 22 contigs (11 genes) belonging to the laccase family and 44 contigs (22 genes) belonging to the peroxidase family. Sixteen contigs (three genes) belonging to the GH9 cellulase family were also detected. We selected the gene accounting for the majority of expressed laccase and analyzed its properties. The 24131-laccase transcript (2465 bp) had one complete open reading frame, nt 149-1987, encoding a protein of 613 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 67.708 kDa. The enzyme was shown to belong to the multicopper oxidase family. The 24131-laccase protein was confirmed to have oxidation activity against 2,6-dimethoxyphenol by ectopic expression in Escherichia coli. Laccase activity was significantly enhanced by feeding land crabs with plant diets. These data suggest that the enzyme plays an important role in the digestion of lignin in the guts of land crabs.

AB  - Aeriscardovia aeriphila, also known as Bifidobacterium aerophilum, was first isolated from the caecal contents of pigs and the faeces of cotton-top tamarin. Bifidobacterium species play important roles in preventing intestinal infections, decreasing cholesterol levels, and stimulating the immune system. In this study, we isolated a strain of bacteria from the duodenal contents of broiler chickens, which was identified as A. aeriphila, and then evaluated the effects of A. aeriphila on growth performance, antioxidant functions, immune functions, and gut microbiota in commercial broiler chickens. Chickens were orally gavaged with A. aeriphila (1x109 CFU/mL) for 21 d. The results showed that A. aeriphila treatment significantly increased the average daily gain and reduced the feed conversion ratio (P<0.001). The levels of serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were significantly increased following A. aeriphila treatment (P<0.05). Blood urea nitrogen and aspartate aminotransferase levels were decreased, whereas glucose and creatinine levels increased as a result of A. aeriphila treatment. Furthermore, the levels of serum antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (P<0.01), superoxide dismutase (P<0.001), and glutathione peroxidase (P<0.05), and total antioxidant capacity (P<0.05) were enhanced following A. aeriphila treatment. A. aeriphila treatment significantly increased the levels of serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) (P<0.05), IgG (P<0.01), IgM (P<0.05), interleukin-1 (IL-1) (P<0.05), IL-4 (P<0.05), and IL-10 (P<0.05). The broiler chickens in the A. aeriphila group had higher secretory IgA (SIgA) levels in the duodenum (P<0.01), jejunum (P<0.001), and cecum (P<0.001) than those in the control group. The messenger RNA (mRNA) relative expression levels of IL-10 (P<0.05) and IL-4 (P<0.001) in the intestinal mucosa of chickens were increased, while nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) (P<0.001) expression was decreased in the A. aeriphila group compared to the control group. Phylum-level analysis revealed Firmicutes as the main phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes, in both groups. The data also found that Phascolarctobacterium and Barnesiella were increased in A. aeriphila-treated group. In conclusion, oral administration of A. aeriphila could improve the growth performance, serum antioxidant capacity, immune modulation, and gut health of broilers. Our findings may provide important information for the application of A. aeriphila in poultry production.

AB  - The structural features that contribute to the efficacy of biased agonists targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) towards G proteins or beta-arrestin (beta-arr) signaling pathways is nebulous, although such knowledge is critical in designing biased ligands. The dynamics of the agonist-GPCR complex is one of the critical factors in determining agonist bias. Angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) is an ideal model system to study the molecular basis of bias since it has multiple beta-arr2 and Gq protein biased agonists as well as experimentally solved three dimensional structures. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for the Angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) bound to ten different agonists, we infer that the agonist bound receptor samples conformations with different relative weights, from both the inactive and active state ensembles of the receptor. This concept is perhaps extensible to other class A GPCRs. Such a weighted mixed ensemble recapitulates the inter-residue distance distributions measured for different agonists bound AT1R using DEER experiments. The ratio of the calculated relative strength of the allosteric communication to beta-arr2 vs Gq coupling sites scale similarly to the experimentally measured bias factors. Analysis of the inter-residue distance distributions of the activation microswitches involved in class A GPCR activation suggests that beta-arr2 biased agonists turn on different combination of microswitches with different relative strengths of activation. We put forth a model that activation microswitches behave like rheostats that tune the relative efficacy of the biased agonists toward the two signaling pathways. Finally, based on our data we propose that the agonist specific residue contacts in the binding site elicit a combinatorial response in the microswitches that in turn differentially modulate the receptor conformation ensembles resulting in differences in coupling to Gq and beta-arrestin.

AB  - Objectives: In this study, based on the known vestibulo-hippocampal connections, we asked whether mild chronic vestibulopathy leads only to vestibular-related deficits or whether there are effects on hippocampal function, structure, and cognition in general. In more detail, we assessed whether chronic vestibulopathy leads to (a) deficits in vestibular tasks without cognitive demand (balancing), (b) deficits in spatial cognitive tasks that require vestibular input (path integration, rotational memory), (c) deficits in spatial cognitive tasks that do not rely on vestibular input, (d) deficits in general cognitive function, and (e) atrophy in the brain. Methods: A total of 15 patients with chronic uni- or bilateral vestibulopathy (56.8 +/- 10.1 years; 4 females) were included in this study and were age- and gender-matched by the control participants (57.6 +/- 10.5) in a pairwise manner. Given their clinical symptoms and their deficits of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) the patients could be classified as being mildly affected. All participants of the underwent the following tests: clinical balance (CBT), triangle completion (TCT) for path integration, rotational memory (RM), the visuo-spatial subset of the Berlin intelligence structure test (BIS-4) and d2-R for attention and concentration, and a structural MRI for gray matter analysis using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Results: Compared to the healthy controls, the vestibulopathy patients performed significantly worse in terms of CBT, TCT, and RM but showed no differences in terms of the BIS-4 and d2-R. There were also no significant volumetric gray matter differences between the two groups. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that both non-cognitive and cognitive functions that rely on vestibular input (balancing, path integration, rotational memory) are impaired, even in mild chronic vestibulopathy, while other cognitive functions, which rely on visual input (visuo-spatial memory, attention), are unimpaired in this condition, together with an overall intact brain structure. These findings may reflect a segregation between vestibular- and visual-dependent processes in the medial temporal lobe on the one hand and a structure-function dissociation on the other.

AB  - Background: Chronic arsenic-exposure causes neuromuscular disorders and other health anomalies. Damage to DNA and cytoskeletal/extracellular matrix is brought on by reactive-oxygen-species (ROS)-induced intrinsic antioxidant depletion (thiols/urate). Therapeutic chelating-agents have multiple side-effects. Objectives: The protection of (Camellia sinensis) tea-extract and role of uric-acid (UA) or allopurinol (urate-depletor) on arsenic-toxicity were verified in rat model. Methods: Camellia sinensis (CS dry-leaves), UA or allopurinol was supplemented to arsenic-intoxicated rats for 4-weeks. Purified theaflavins and their galloyl-ester were tested in-vitro on pure AChE (acetylcholinesterase) and their PDB/PubChem 3-D structures were utilized for in-silico binding studies. The primary chemical components were evaluated from CS-extracts. Biochemical analysis, PAGE-zymogram, DNA-stability comet analysis, HE-staining was performed in arsenic-exposed rat brain tissues. Results: Animals exposed to arsenic showed symptoms of erratic locomotion, decreased intrinsic antioxidants (catalase/SOD1/uric acid), increased AChE, and malondialdehyde. Cerebellar and cerebrum tissue damages were shown with increased levels of matrix-metalloprotease (MMP2/9) and DNA damage (comets). Allopurinol- supplemented group demonstrated somewhat similar biochemical responses. In the CS-group brain tissues especially cerebellum is considerably protected which is evident from endogenous antioxidant and DNA and cytoskeleton protection with concomitant inactivation of MMPs and AChE. Present study indicates theaflavin-digallate (TFDG) demonstrated the highest inhibition of purified AChE (IC50 = 2.19 mu g/ml with the lowest binding free-energy; -369.87 kcal/mol) followed by TFMG (IC50 = 3.86 mu g/ml, -347.06 kcal/mol) suggesting their possible restoring effects of cholinergic response. Conclusions: Favorable responses in UA-group and adverse outcome in allo-group justify the neuro-protective effects of UA as an endogenous antioxidant. Role of flavon-gallate in neuro protection mechanism may be further studied.

AB  - The mammalian hippocampal formation (HF) is organized into domains associated with different functions. These differences are driven in part by the pattern of input along the hippocampal long axis, such as visual input to the septal hippocampus and amygdalar input to the temporal hippocampus. HF is also organized along the transverse axis, with different patterns of neural activity in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. In some birds, a similar organization has been observed along both of these axes. However, it is not known what role inputs play in this organization. We used retrograde tracing to map inputs into HF of a food-caching bird, the black-capped chickadee. We first compared two locations along the transverse axis: the hippocampus and the dorsolateral hippocampal area (DL), which is analogous to the entorhinal cortex. We found that pallial regions predominantly targeted DL, while some subcortical regions like the lateral hypothalamus (LHy) preferentially targeted the hippocampus. We then examined the hippocampal long axis and found that almost all inputs were topographic along this direction. For example, the anterior hippocampus was preferentially innervated by thalamic regions, while the posterior hippocampus received more amygdalar input. Some of the topographies we found bear a resemblance to those described in the mammalian brain, revealing a remarkable anatomical similarity of phylogenetically distant animals. More generally, our work establishes the pattern of inputs to HF in chickadees. Some of these patterns may be unique to chickadees, laying the groundwork for studying the anatomical basis of these birds' exceptional hippocampal memory.

AB  - Encapsulation of insulin-producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign-body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling-resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for approximate to 3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

AB  - Synapses maintain both action potential-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release; however, organization of these two forms of release within an individual synapse remains unclear. Here, we used photobleaching properties of iGluSnFR, a fluorescent probe that detects glutamate, to investigate the subsynaptic organization of evoked and spontaneous release in primary hippocampal cultures. In nonneuronal cells and neuronal dendrites, iGluSnFR fluorescence is intensely photobleached and recovers via diffusion of nonphotobleached probes with a time constant of ~10 s. After photobleaching, while evoked iGluSnFR events could be rapidly suppressed, their recovery required several hours. In contrast, iGluSnFR responses to spontaneous release were comparatively resilient to photobleaching, unless the complete pool of iGluSnFR was activated by glutamate perfusion. This differential effect of photobleaching on different modes of neurotransmission is consistent with a subsynaptic organization where sites of evoked glutamate release are clustered and corresponding iGluSnFR probes are diffusion restricted, while spontaneous release sites are broadly spread across a synapse with readily diffusible iGluSnFR probes.

AB  - Corvidae, passerine songbirds such as jays, crows, and ravens known as corvids, have become model systems for the study of avian cognition. The superior cognitive capabilities of corvids mainly emerge from a disproportionally large telencephalon found in these species. However, a systematic mapping of the neuroanatomy of the corvid brain, and the telencephalon in particular, is lacking so far. Here, we present a brain atlas of the carrion crow, Corvus corone, with special emphasis on the telencephalic pallium. We applied four staining techniques to brain slices (Nissl, myelin, combination of Nissl and myelin, and tyrosine hydroxylase targeting catecholaminergic neurons). This allowed us to identify brain nuclei throughout the brain and delineate the known pallial subdivisions termed hyperpallium, entopallium, mesopallium, nidopallium, arcopallium, and hippocampal complex. The extent of these subdivisions and brain nuclei are described according to stereotaxic coordinates. In addition, 3D depictions of pallial regions were reconstructed from these slices. While the overall organization of the carrion crow's brain matches other songbird brains, the relative proportions and expansions of associative pallial areas differ considerably in agreement with enhanced cognitive skills found in corvids. The presented global organization of the crow brain in stereotaxic coordinates will help to guide future neurobiological studies in corvids.

AB  - Iron has been emerging as a key contributor to aging-associated, chronic disorders due to the propensity for generating reactive oxygen species. To date, there are a limited number of publications exploring the role of iron in the pathogenesis of primary/age-related osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this study was to determine whether reduced iron via pharmacologic iron chelation with deferoxamine (DFO) affected the development and/ or severity of cartilage lesions in a primary OA model. At 12-weeks-of-age, 15 male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs received either 46 mg/kg DFO (n = 8) or vehicle control (n = 7) injected subcutaneously twice daily for five days each week. Movement changes, captured via overhead enclosure monitoring, were also determined. Termination occurred at 30-weeks-of-age. Iron was quantified in serum, urine, liver, and femoral head articular cartilage. Left knees were evaluated for: structural changes using histopathology guidelines; and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression analysis was conducted on right knee articular cartilage. DFO reduced iron levels in femoral head articular cartilage (p = 0.0006) and liver (p = 0.02), and increased iron within urine (p = 0.04) and serum (p = 0.0009). Mobility of control animals declined, while the DFO group maintained activity levels similar to the first month of treatment (p = 0.05). OA-associated cartilage lesions were reduced in knees of DFO animals (p = 0.0001), with chondrocyte hypocellularity a key histologic difference between groups (p < 0.0001). DFOreceiving animals had increased immunostaining for phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase alpha within knee articular cartilage; lower transcript counts of several proapoptotic genes (p = 0.04-0.0004) and matrix-degrading enzymes (p = 0.02-<0.0001), and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 (p < 0.0001) and a tissue inhibitor of matrix-metalloproteinases (p = 0.03) were also observed. These results suggest that iron chelation delayed the progression of primary OA in an animal model and could hold potential as a translational intervention. These findings provide expanded insight into factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of primary OA.

AB  - Simple Summary Successful cryopreservation of semen of South American camelids has been limited, hindering the application of artificial insemination. In this scenario, the addition of antioxidants to semen extenders provides a strategy to improve sperm freezability. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of black maca in the freezing medium of epididymal spermatozoa of alpaca species. Fifteen pairs of epididymis were collected from a local slaughterhouse. Each sample was divided into six groups: (1) fresh, (2) yolk medium (YM), (3) 10 mg/mL maca, (4) 20 mg/mL maca, (5) 30 mg/mL maca, and (6) resveratrol (as an antioxidant control). Sperm cryopreservation was performed through the slow freezing method. The sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, DNA integrity, total ROS production, and mitochondrial function were analyzed. The results show that maca (20 mg/mL) improved the parameters associated with sperm function. Similarly, ROS production decreased, although DNA integrity was similar among the groups. These results suggest that maca at 20 mg/mL has cytoprotective effects during freezing/thawing of epididymal sperm of alpaca species. Further research will be focused on assessing the effects of maca supplementation on semen extenders by using biomolecular markers associated with fertility. Artificial insemination is an important assisted reproductive technology that has been applied in several mammalian species. However, successful cryopreservation of semen of South American camelids has been limited, hindering the commercial application of artificial insemination in alpaca species. In this scenario, the addition of antioxidants to semen extenders provides a strategy to improve the freezability of mammalian sperm. Bioactive metabolites from natural extracts of black maca have shown valuable antioxidant properties. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of atomized black maca in the freezing medium of epididymal spermatozoa of alpacas. Fifteen pairs of epididymis were collected from a local slaughterhouse. Each sample was divided into six groups: (1) fresh, (2) yolk medium (YM), (3) 10 mg/mL maca, (4) 20 mg/mL maca, (5) 30 mg/mL maca, and (6) resveratrol (as an antioxidant control). Sperm cryopreservation was performed through the slow freezing method. Markers associated with functionality, such as motility, viability, and plasma membrane integrity, as well as markers associated with oxidative damage, such as DNA integrity, total ROS production, and mitochondrial function, were analyzed. The results show that the supplementation with black maca (20 mg/mL) improved the sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, and mitochondrial function evaluated according to an index of formazan deposits. Similarly, the ROS production decreased with maca at 20 mg/mL, although the DNA integrity did not show any differences among the groups. These results suggest that maca at 20 mg/mL has cytoprotective effects during freezing/thawing of epididymal sperm of alpaca species. Further research will be focused on assessing the effects of maca supplementation on semen extenders by using biomolecular markers (proAKAP4) associated with fertility.

AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize the cardiorespiratory patterns of male South American sea lions (SASLs, Otaria flavescens) resting on land. We recorded respiratory and heart rate (n = 360 individuals studied) by observing the nostrils, chest movements and the impact of the heart on the thoracic wall. The sea lions breathe apneustically with a pause on inspiration, representing 74% of the respiratory cycle. The mean breathing frequency was 3.2 +/- 1.0 breaths min(-1), with a breathing cycle presenting periods of bradypneas, tachypneas, and long-term post-inspiratory pauses. The normal heart rate (nHR) was 73.4 +/- 14.5 beats min(-1) and no significant differences were observed between age classes. All animals showed variability in HR in relation to respiratory phases (Inspiration: 101.2 +/- 18.4 beats min(-1); post-inspiratory pause: 73.4 +/- 14.5 beats min(-1); expiration: 64.6 +/- 17.7 beats min(-1)), consistent with respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). The mean HR (measured during all respiratory phases) was 79.9 +/- 22.7 beats min(-1), and was significantly different between age classes. The total duration of respiratory cycle, and duration of both inspiration and expiration, decreased with an increment in ambient temperature, with no variation in the pause duration. Heart rate during pause and expiration was significantly higher during high temperatures. Similar changes in cardiorespiratory patterns have been reported in other pinnipeds. Our results showed ontogenetic differences in development and typical variations with environmental and behavioral variables.

AB  - We examined the presence/absence and parcellation of cholinergic neurons in the hypothalami of five birds: a Congo grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), a Timneh grey parrot (P. timneh), a pied crow (Corvus albus), a common ostrich (Struthio camelus), and an emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae). Using immunohistochemistry to an antibody raised against the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, hypothalamic cholinergic neurons were observed in six distinct clusters in the medial, lateral, and ventral hypothalamus in the parrots and crow, similar to prior observations made in the pigeon. The expression of cholinergic nuclei was most prominent in the Congo grey parrot, both in the medial and lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, no evidence of cholinergic neurons in the hypothalami of either the ostrich or emu was found. It is known that the expression of sleep states in the ostrich is unusual and resembles that observed in the monotremes that also lack hypothalamic cholinergic neurons. It has been proposed that the cholinergic system acts globally to produce and maintain brain states, such as those of arousal and rapid-eye-movement sleep. The hiatus in the cholinergic system of the ostrich, due to the lack of hypothalamic cholinergic neurons, may explain, in part, the unusual expression of sleep states in this species. These comparative anatomical and sleep studies provide supportive evidence for global cholinergic actions and may provide an important framework for our understanding of one broad function of the cholinergic system and possible dysfunctions associated with global cholinergic neural activity.
   Immunohistochemical staining for choline acetyltransferase reveals cholinergic neuronal populations in the hypothalamus in parrots and crows, although these neurons were absent in the common ostrich and emu. Depicted is the most distinct cholinergic hypothalamic nucleus located in the dorsal medial aspect of the hypothalamus (the dorsomedial hypothalamic cluster, DMH) of the Congo grey parrot, in close proximity to, but not contacting, the wall of the third ventricle. image

AB  - Polynucleotide kinase 30-phosphatase (PNKP), an essential DNA end-processing enzyme in mammals with 30-phosphatase and 50-kinase activities, plays a pivotal role in multiple DNA repair pathways. Its functional deficiency has been etiologically linked to various neurological disorders. Recent reports have shown that mutation at a conserved glutamine (Gln) in PNKP leads to late-onset ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 4 (AOA4) in humans and embryonic lethality in pigs. However, the molecular mechanism underlying such phenotypes remains elusive. Here, we report that the enzymatic activities of the mutant versus WT PNKP are comparable; however, cells expressing mutant PNKP and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AOA4 patients showed a significant amount of DNA double-strand break accumulation and consequent activation of the DNA damage response. Further investigation revealed that the nuclear localization of mutant PNKP is severely abrogated, and the mutant proteins remain primarily in the cytoplasm. Western blot analysis of AOA4 patient-derived PBMCs also revealed the presence of mutated PNKP predominantly in the cytoplasm. To understand the molecular determinants, we identified that mutation at a conserved Gln residue impedes the interaction of PNKP with importin alpha but not with importin beta, two highly conserved proteins that mediate the import of proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Collectively, our data suggest that the absence of PNKP in the nucleus leads to constant activation of the DNA damage response due to persistent accumulation of double-strand breaks in the mutant cells, triggering death of vulner-able brain cells-a potential cause of neurodegeneration in AOA4 patients.

AB  - Depression is associated with bidirectional interactions between inflammatory responses and behavioral dysfunction. Paeoniflorin (PF), a monoterpene glycoside derived from Paeonia lactiflora, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of PF on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behaviors in mice and neuroinflammation in BV2 microglial cells. Mice were co-administered PF (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg/day) and LPS (2 mg/kg) for 7 days. Behavioral tests; Nissl staining; and Golgi, Iba1, DLG4, and cytokine assays were conducted. Additionally, hippocampal NF-kappa B, Nrf2, and BDNF signaling pathways were analyzed using Western blots. In BV2 cells, oxidative stress and the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway were assessed using CCK-8, flow cytometry, and Western blotting after 24 h of LPS and PF treatment. PF significantly alleviated LPS-induced depression-like behaviors, increased hippocampal neuron and dendritic spine density, and upregulated synaptic proteins (PSD95, SNAP25, and BDNF). Mechanistically, PF suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the Akt/GSK3 beta pathway, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6), and enhanced the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant axis. In BV2 cells, PF restored mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited apoptosis, and decreased cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6) by inhibiting TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling. In conclusion, PF significantly improved LPS-induced depression-like behaviors and attenuated neuroinflammation in BV2 microglial cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for inflammation-associated depression.

AB  - Swine-derived kidneys are a promising alternative organ source for transplantation, but compatibility in the major histocompatibility complex remains an immunological barrier. Furthermore, in repeat transplantations, CD4+ memory T cells can lead to a more rapid immune response against repeated exposure to the same antigens. Several studies have shown that HLA and SLA proteins share overlapping B cell epitopes due to structural or electrostatic similarities, but the role of overlapping T cell epitopes has not been fully explored. This study aims to computationally analyse the potential risk of memory T cell activation in subsequent human-after-swine and swine-after-human transplantation by evaluating shared T cell epitopes between the two graft sources. We show that while HLA and SLA demonstrate striking structural similarities, their linear protein sequences are very distinct, which translates to disparate HLA- and SLA-derived peptidomes and T cell epitopes. By applying the PIRCHE-II Tmem analysis to a simulated panel of recipients receiving repeat transplantations from a human kidney and from a swine xenograft, we observed a median of 1 shared T cell epitope in the cross-species context, compared to a median of 17 shared between two human-derived kidneys. This suggests that a swine xenograft exposes a low risk of T cell memory against a later human donor, and that xenotransplantation may provide an opportunity to receive a graft for highly HLA-sensitised recipients.

AB  - Many studies on neuronal plasticity have been conducted in the hippocampus and sensory cortices. In female rats in the estrus phase, when there is a low concentration of estradiol in the blood, there is a reduction in the dendritic spine density of CA1 neurons, while an increase in dendritic spines has been observed during metestrus, when progesterone levels are high. In comparison with the hippocampus, less information is known about dendritic remodeling of the motor cortex. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the neuronal morphology of pyramidal cells of layer V of the motor cortex in each phase of the estrous cycle. For this, we used Long-Evans strain rats and formed 4 experimental groups according to the phase of the estrous cycle at the moment of sacrifice: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, or diestrus. All animals were gently monitored regarding the expression of one estrous cycle in order to determine the regularity of the cycle. We obtained the brains in order to evaluate the neuronal morphology of neurons of layer V of the primary motor cortex following the Golgi-Cox method and Sholl analysis. Our results show that the dendritic arborization of neurons of rats sacrificed in the metestrus phase is reduced compared to the other phases of the estrous cycle. However, we did not find changes in dendritic spine density between experimental groups. When comparing our results with previous data, we can suggest that estrogens and progesterone differentially promote plasticity events in pyramidal neurons between different brain regions.

AB  - Loperamide has been a safe and effective treatment for diarrhea for many years. However, many cases of cardiotoxicity with intentional abuse of loperamide ingestion have recently been reported. We evaluated loperamide in in vitro and in vivo cardiac safety models to understand the mechanisms for this cardiotoxicity. Loperamide slowed conduction (QRS-duration) starting at 0.3 mu M [similar to 1200-fold (x) its human Free Therapeutic Plasma Concentration; FTPC] and reduced the QT-interval and caused cardiac arrhythmias starting at 3 mu M (similar to 12,000x FTPC) in an isolated rabbit ventricular-wedge model. Loperamide also slowed conduction and elicited Type II/III A-V block in anesthetized guinea pigs at overdose exposures of 879x and 3802x FTPC. In ion-channel studies, loperamide inhibited hERG (I-Kr)(,) I-Na,I- and I-Ca currents with IC50 values of 0.390 mu M, 0.526 mu M, and 4.091 mu M, respectively (i.e., >1560x FTPC). Additionally, in silico trials in human ventricular action potential models based on these IC50s confirmed that loperamide has large safety margins at therapeutic exposures (<= 600x FTPC) and confirmed repolarization abnormalities in the case of extreme doses of loperamide. The studies confirmed the large safety margin for the therapeutic use of loperamide but revealed that at the extreme exposure levels observed in human overdose, loperamide can cause a combination of conduction slowing and alterations in repolarization time, resulting in cardiac proarrhythmia. Loperamide's inhibition of the I-Na channel and hERG-mediated IKr are the most likely basis for this cardiac electrophysiological toxicity at overdose exposures. The cardiac toxic effects of loperamide at the overdoses could be aggravated by co-medication with other drug(s) causing ion channel inhibition.

AB  - BackgroundInfectious agents associated with community-acquired acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain understudied in Lebanon. We aim to assess the microbiological profiles of ARIs by employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and identifying predictors of positive PCR results among patients admitted for ARI. Methods and resultsWe conducted a retrospective single-center study at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, including all respiratory PCR panels performed on pediatric (< 18) and adult (>= 18) patients presenting with an ARI from January 2015 to March 2018, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify the epidemiological patterns of ARIs and the factors associated with positive PCRs in both adult and pediatric patients. Among 281 respiratory PCRs, 168 (59.7%) were positive for at least one pathogen, with 54.1% positive PCR for viruses, 7.8% for bacteria species, and 3.9% with virus-bacteria codetection. Almost 60% of the patients received antibiotics prior to PCR testing. PCR panels yielded more positive results in pediatric patients than in adults (P = 0.005). Bacterial detection was more common in adults compared to pediatrics (P < 0.001). The most common organism recovered in the entire population was Human Rhinovirus (RhV) (18.5%). Patients with pleural effusion on chest CT were less likely to have a positive PCR (95% Cl: 0.22-0.99). On multivariate analysis, pediatric age group (P < 0.001), stem cell transplant (P = 0.006), fever (P = 0.03) and UTRI symptoms (P = 0.004) were all predictive of a positive viral PCR. ConclusionUnderstanding the local epidemiology of ARI is crucial for proper antimicrobial stewardship. The identification of factors associated with positive respiratory PCR enhances our understanding of clinical characteristics and potential predictors of viral detection in our population.

AB  - Over the last few decades, there has been a constant increase in sow litter size, the consequences of which include parturition duration extension, an increase in the percentage of stillborn and hypoxic piglets, and increased variation in piglet birth weight, which reduces their vitality. As such, it seems clear that further increasing sow fertility will generate difficulties and costs in rearing numerous litters with low birth weights. Therefore, the current study aimed to analyze the genetic background of sow hyperprolifcacy using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The research included 144 sows in the maternal component, divided into two equal groups. The first group (control) consisted of females giving birth to the optimal number of piglets in their third and fourth litters (14-16), while the second group (cases) included those with excessive litter size (>16). The analyzed sows were genotyped using Illumina's PorcineSNP60v2 BeadChip microarray, comprising 64,232 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Statistical analysis using R included quality control of genotyping data and GWAS analysis based on five logistic regression models (dominant, codominant, overdominant, recessive, and logadditive) with a single SNP marker as the explanatory variable. On this basis, one SNP (SIRI0000069) was identified on chromosome seven within the EFCAB11 (EF-hand calcium binding domain 11) gene that had a statistically significant effect on sow hyperprolificacy. Additionally, ten SNPs (INRA0007631, ALGA0011600, ALGA0043433, ALGA0043428, M1GA0010535 ALGA00443338, ALGA0087116, MARC0056787, ALGA0112928, and ALGA0089047) had a relationship with the analyzed feature at a level close to significance, set at 1-5. These SNPs appear important since they are located on chromosomes on which a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and SNPs associated with reproductive characteristics, including litter size, have been identified.

AB  - The embryonic ectoderm development (EED) is a core component of the polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) whose mutations are linked to neurodevelopmental abnormalities, intellectual disability, and neurodegeneration. Although EED has been extensively studied in neural stem cells and oligodendrocytes, its role in microglia is incompletely understood. Here, we show that microglial EED is essential for synaptic pruning during the postnatal stage of brain development. The absence of microglial EED at early postnatal stages resulted in reduced spines and impaired synapse density in the hippocampus at adulthood, accompanied by upregulated expression of phagocytosis-related genes in microglia. As a result, deletion of microglial Eed impaired hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in mice. These results suggest that microglial EED is critical for normal synaptic and cognitive functions during postnatal development.

AB  - In cells, proteins encoded by the same gene do not all behave uniformly but engage in functional subpopulations induced by spatial or temporal segregation. While conventional microscopy has limitations in revealing such spatial and temporal diversity, single-molecule tracking (SMT) microscopy circumvented this problem and allows for high-resolution imaging and quantification of dynamic single-molecule properties. Particularly in the nucleus, SMT has identified specific DNA residence times of transcription factors (TFs), DNA-bound TF fractions and positions of transcriptional hot-spots upon cell stimulation. By contrast to cell stimulation, SMT has not been employed to follow dynamic TF changes along stages of cell differentiation. Herein, we analysed the serum response factor (SRF), a TF involved in the differentiation of many cell types to study nuclear single-molecule dynamics in neuronal differentiation. Our data in living mouse hippocampal neurons show dynamic changes in SRF DNA residence time and SRF DNA-bound fraction between the stages of adhesion, neurite growth and neurite differentiation in axon and dendrites. Using TALM (tracking and localization microscopy), we identified nuclear positions of SRF clusters and observed changes in their numbers and size during differentiation. Furthermore, we show that the SRF cofactor MRTF-A (myocardin-related TF or MKL1) responds to cell activation by enhancing the long-bound DNA fraction. Finally, a first SMT colocalization study of two proteins was performed in living cells showing enhanced SRF/MRTF-A colocalization upon stimulation. In summary, SMT revealed modulation of dynamic TF properties during cell stimulation and differentiation.

AB  - Black -box deep learning (DL) models trained for the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) often lack systematic model interpretation. This work computes the activated brain regions during DL and compares those with classical Machine Learning (ML) explanations. The architectures used for DL were 3D DenseNets, EfficientNets, and Squeeze -and -Excitation (SE) networks. The classical models include Random Forests (RFs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM), Decision Trees (DTs), and Logistic Regression (LR). For explanations, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, Local Interpretable Model -agnostic Explanations (LIME), Gradient -weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), GradCAM++ and permutation -based feature importance were implemented. During interpretation, correlated features were consolidated into aspects. All models were trained on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The validation includes internal and external validation on the Australian Imaging and Lifestyle flagship study of Ageing (AIBL) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). DL and ML models reached similar classification performances. Regarding the brain regions, both types focus on different regions. The ML models focus on the inferior and middle temporal gyri, and the hippocampus, and amygdala regions previously associated with AD. The DL models focus on a wider range of regions including the optical chiasm, the entorhinal cortices, the left and right vessels, and the 4th ventricle which were partially associated with AD. One explanation for the differences is the input features (textures vs. volumes). Both types show reasonable similarity to a ground truth Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis. Slightly higher similarities were measured for ML models.

AB  - Despite the progress in assisted reproductive techniques, there is still a lack of rapid and minimally invasive in situ approaches for further enhancements of female fertility. Therefore, we synthesized clinically relevant liposome nanoparticles for ovarian intrafollicular injection to allow in vivo cellular imaging for future drug delivery, using the mare as an animal model. Ovarian follicles of living mares were injected in vivo with fluorescently labeled liposomes. Samples of the follicular wall (mural granulosa, theca interna, and theca externa), granulosa cells, and follicular fluid were harvested 24 h postinjection through the follicle wall biopsy (FWB), flushing, and aspiration techniques, respectively, using a transvaginal ultrasound-guided approach. In parallel, post-mortem dissected, and cultured porcine antral follicles were microinjected with doxorubicin-encapsulated liposomes to assess intracellular delivery potential. All injected mare and pig follicles were macroscopically healthy, and fluorescence imaging revealed successful intrafollicular binding to mural granulosa cells and progressive migration of liposomes to other follicle cell layers (theca interna, and theca externa), regardless of the follicle size. Intracellular delivery of doxorubicin was confirmed in all porcine follicle wall cell types. We conclude that the intrafollicular injection of nanomolecules is a promising approach for real-time monitoring of intrafollicular processes and potential utilization of in vivo cellular drug delivery to assist in follicle disease treatments and fertility improvement.

AB  - Terpenoids, natural compounds released by plants, function to enhance plant defense. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of terpenoid-enriched essential oils (EOs) on tomato plants. From the application of a highly diluted solution of 11 different EOs to potted tomato soil, our study showed that rose essential oil (REO), rich in beta-citronellol, played a crucial role in activating defense genes in tomato leaves. As a result, leaf damage caused by herbivores, such as Spodoptera litura and Tetranychus urticae, was significantly reduced. In addition, our results were validated in field trials, providing evidence that REO is an effective biostimulant for enhancing plant defense against pests. Notably, the REO solution also had the added benefit of attracting herbivore predators, such as Phytoseiulus persimilis. Our findings suggest a practical approach to promote organic tomato production that encourages environmentally friendly and sustainable practices.

AB  - The proposed deep space exploration to the moon and later to Mars will result in astronauts receiving significant chronic exposures to space radiation (SR). SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.

AB  - The endogenous neurosteroid (3 alpha,5 alpha)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP) modulates inflammatory and neuroinflammatory signaling through toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human and mouse macrophages, human blood cells and alcohol-preferring (P) rat brains. Although it is recognized that 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP inhibits TLR4 activation by blocking interactions with MD2 and MyD88, the comprehensive molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This study explores additional TLR4 activation sites, including TIRAP binding to MyD88, which is pivotal for MyD88 myddosome formation, as well as LPS interactions with the TLR4:MD2 complex. Both male and female P rats (n = 8/group) received intraperitoneal administration of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP (15 mg/kg; 30 min) or a vehicle control, and their hippocampi were analyzed using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting techniques. 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP significantly reduces the levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1 beta and HMGB1, confirming its anti-inflammatory actions. We found that MyD88 binds to TLR4, IRAK4, IRAK1, and TIRAP. Notably, 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP significantly reduces MyD88-TIRAP binding (Males: -31 +/- 9%, t-test, p < 0.005; Females: -53 +/- 15%, t-test, p < 0.005), without altering MyD88 interactions with IRAK4 or IRAK1, or the baseline expression of these proteins. Additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis revealed 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP binding sites on the TLR4:MD2 complex, targeting a hydrophobic pocket of MD2 usually occupied by Lipid A of LPS. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays validated that 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP disrupts MD2 binding of Lipid A (Kd = 4.36 +/- 5.7 mu M) with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 4.5 +/- 1.65 nM. These findings indicate that 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP inhibition of inflammatory mediator production involves blocking critical protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions at key sites of TLR4 activation, shedding light on its mechanisms of action and underscoring its therapeutic potential against TLR4-driven inflammation.

AB  - The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2016, 524, 665-703) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3614-3665) and Chen et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3666-3701) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity-dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity-dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.

AB  - Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a chromosomic microdeletion (7q11.23). WBS has been modeled by a mouse line having a complete deletion (CD) of the equivalent mouse locus. This model has been largely used to investigate the etiopathological mechanisms of WBS, although pharmacological therapies have not been identified yet. Surprisingly, CD mice were so far mainly tested in adulthood, despite the developmental nature of WBS and the critical relevance of early timing for potential treatments. Here we provide for the first time a phenotypic characterization of CD mice of both sexes during infancy and adolescence, i.e., between birth and 7 weeks of age. CD pups of both sexes showed reduced body growth, delayed sensory development, and altered patterns of ultrasonic vocalizations and exploratory behaviors. Adolescent CD mice showed reduced locomotion and acoustic startle response, and altered social interaction and communication, the latter being more pronounced in female mice. Juvenile CD mutants of both sexes also displayed reduced brain weight, cortical and hippocampal dendritic length, and spine density. Our findings highlight the critical relevance of early neurobehavioral alterations as biomarkers of WBS pathology, underlying the importance of adolescence for identifying novel therapeutic targets for this neurological disorder.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent, socially burdensome disease. Different studies have demonstrated the important role of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of depression as modulators of neurotransmission and neurovascular coupling. This is evidenced by astrocyte impairments observed in brains of depressed patients and the appearance of depressive-like behaviors upon astrocytic dysfunctions in animal models. However, little is known about the importance of de novo generated astrocytes in the mammalian brain and in particular its possible involvement in the precipitation of depression and in the therapeutic actions of current antidepressants (ADs). Therefore, we studied the modulation of astrocytes and adult astrogliogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of rats exposed to an unpredictable chronic mild stress (uCMS) protocol, untreated and treated for two weeks with antidepressants-fluoxetine and imipramine. Our results show that adult astrogliogenesis in the DG is modulated by stress and imipramine. This study reveals that distinct classes of ADs impact differently in the astrogliogenic process, showing different cellular mechanisms relevant to the recovery from behavioral deficits induced by chronic stress exposure. As such, in addition to those resident, the newborn astrocytes in the hippocampal DG might also be promising therapeutic targets for future therapies in the neuropsychiatric field.

AB  - The genus Enenterum Linton, 1910 comprises species which parasitize herbivorous kyphosid fish. In the present study, a new species is described based on fresh specimens collected from Kyphosus incisor from Rio de Janeiro. The new species is characterized by having the oral sucker infundibuliform with 10 lobes, prepharynx two times longer than pharynx, presence of oesophagus, testes slightly lobed, round ovary and rectum with muscular sphincter connected to the anus. New genetic sequences include partial 18S and 28S rDNA and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2. The phylogenetic analyses place Enenterum gomesae n. sp. as sister of Enenterum aureum, corroborating the morphological analyses. Enenterum aureum (=E. pimelopteri) previously described from Kyphosus spp. from Rio de Janeiro is now considered E. gomesae n. sp. The new species represents the only South American species so far described for this genus.

AB  - Dr. Deepak "Dee" Pandya spent his career as an internal medicine physician as well as in his respective laboratories at the Bedford, Massachusetts Veterans Administration Hospital and at Boston University School of Medicine. His achievements mapping out the cytoarchitecture and connectivity of areas all over the nonhuman primate brain and small mammals are unparalleled. Dee made numerous discoveries and created painstakingly detailed reports, which impacted the field of neuroanatomy and expanded our perceptions of the many diverse inputs and suggestive functions of specific brain regions. The "old school" methods employed from microscopic work to detailed analyses yielded a product that was accurate and exciting all at the same time. We will all miss Dee's smile and tender manner, but more so, we will miss his wonderful and patient mentorship during the precious time we all spent with him. His mentorship resulted in all of his trainees becoming better scientists and left us with the understanding that people like Dee only come by once in a lifetime. In this tribute article for this special issue in the Journal of Comparative Neurology (JCN), the authors describe some of the tedious methods that were used to present our work as a way to provide insight into the extraordinary time and effort it took to produce and publish our articles with Dee in JCN. Dee's work with his colleagues set the stage for more modern methods of counting and mapping neuronal populations presented here, paving the way for such technologies as artificial intelligence and light sheet imaging to advance the field forward to reach new and exciting discoveries.
   In this tribute article, we describe the legacy of Dr. Deepak Pandya on neuroanatomy and how he influenced our research. We provide examples of tracing with India ink and how methods have evolved to tracking neurons and their connections with artificial intelligence and whole brain imaging. ###image

AB  - Unlike numerous other members of the holarctic Tribe Marmotini of the squirrel family (Sciuridae) that typically exhibit spontaneous bouts of torpor that progress into an annual season of hibernation, members of the genus Ammospermophilus (antelope ground squirrels) do not enter torpor, and they remain active throughout the year in nature. We have experimentally evaluated seasonal patterns of variation in the circadian rhythm of body temperature in captive A. leucurus over a two-and-a-half-year period by exposing groups to either a constant daily photoperiod of 12 h light or a seasonally changing photoperiod that cycled between a summer maximum of 16 h per day and a winter minimum of 8 h; ambient air temperature was maintained at 26 degrees C. All squirrels showed continuous, year-round diurnal locomotor activity, and the group exposed to seasonally changing photoperiod adjusted onset and end of activity to changes in duration of the photoperiod. Animals in both groups showed a marked circadian rhythm of core body temperature with a typical daytime level of about 38 degrees C and nighttime level of about 35 degrees C for most of each year, but the group exposed to naturally changing daylength surprisingly reduced the level of its circadian oscillation by about 2 degrees C at the winter seasonal extreme of shortest daily illumination to a daytime level about 36 degrees C and a nocturnal level of about 33 degrees C. Despite this modest experimentally induced reduction in the level of the circadian rhythm of body temperature, we conclude that A. leucurus shows an overall stable annual pattern of circadian rhythmicity of its core body temperature that is consistent with a lack of any other evidence that the species engages in torpor or hibernation.

AB  - Nanotechnology is one of the most advanced methods available for the degradation of toxic pollutants from the environment. Specifically, nanoparticles generated with plant extracts are more stable and biocompatible than those produced using traditional chemical and physical processes. The current study focuses on the green synthesis of N-CuO@Zeolite nanocomposite with Camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract. The green synthesized nanocomposite was used for the photocatalytic degradation of hazardous organic pollutants, including Auramine-O (AO) and yellow color textile industrial dye (YD). Under direct sunlight irradiation, synthesized nanomaterials exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for AO and YD degradation. The best conditions for photocatalytic degradation were found to be pollutant concentrations of 2 mg L-1 for AO and 6 mg L-1 for YD, photocatalyst dosages of 15 mg for both AO and YD, and neutral pH for both pollutants. Within 150 minutes, the synthesized N-CuO@zeolite nanocomposite attained degradation efficiencies of 95 % for AO and 92 % for YD, compared to its parent materials N-CuO (80 % for AO and 76 % for YD) and CuO (68 % for AO and 65 % for YD). The degradation rates of both pollutants were accurately described by first-order kinetics, consistent with the Langmuir adsorption model. Additionally, the ecologically sustainable novel N-CuO@Zeolite nanocomposite illustrated superior reliability and reusability, keeping photocatalytic efficiency even after ten cycles of constant utilization, and its long-term stability was confirmed by PXRD analysis after processing. The material's excellent reusability and stability emphasize the nanocomposite's potential as a long-term solution for industrial wastewater treatment applications.

AB  - Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (XFG) is an aggressive form of secondary open angle glaucoma, characterised by the production of exfoliation material and is estimated to affect 30 million people worldwide. Activation of the TGF-beta pathway by TGF-beta 1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. To further investigate the role of TGF-beta 1 in glaucomatous changes in the trabecular meshwork (TM), we used RNA-Seq to determine TGF-beta 1 induced changes in the transcriptome of normal human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. The main purpose of this study was to perform a hypothesis-independent RNA sequencing analysis to investigate genome-wide alterations in the transcriptome of normal HTMs stimulated with TGF-beta 1 and investigate possible pathophysiological mechanisms driving XFG. Our results identified multiple differentially expressed genes including several genes known to be present in exfoliation material. Significantly altered pathways, biological processes and molecular functions included extracellular matrix remodelling, Hippo and Wnt pathways, the unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, and the antioxidant system. This cellular model of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma can provide insight into disease pathogenesis and support the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Myocarditis is an inflammatory and oxidative disorder characterized by immune cell recruitment in the damaged tissue and organ dysfunction. In this paper, we evaluated the molecular pathways involved in myocarditis using a natural compound, Coriolus versicolor, in an experimental model of autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). Animals were immunized with an emulsion of pig cardiac myosin and complete Freund's adjuvant supplemented with mycobacterium tuberculosis; thereafter, Coriolus versicolor (200 mg/Kg) was orally administered for 21 days. At the end of the experiment, blood pressure and heart rate measurements were recorded and the body and heart weights as well. From the molecular point of view, the Coriolus versicolor administration reduced the activation of the TLR4/NF-?B pathway and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (INF-?, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-2) and restored the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10). These anti-inflammatory effects were accompanied with a reduced lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels and restored the antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and CAT) and GSH levels. Additionally, it reduced the histological injury and the immune cell recruitment (CD4+ and CD68+ cells). Moreover, we observed an antiapoptotic activity in both intrinsic (Fas/FasL/caspase-3) and extrinsic (Bax/Bcl-2) pathways. Overall, our data showed that Coriolus versicolor administration modulates the TLR4/NF-?B signaling in EAM.

AB  - Background: The increase in meat production would also imply an increase in the generation of by-products or edible offal. These by-products can be used, due to their high protein content, as a substrate to obtain hydrolysates with functional activities. This study aimed to valorize bovine lungs by producing hydrolysates with antioxidant capacity. Results: A response surface methodology study was carried out using a central composite design in which factors were temperature (43.2-76.8 degrees C), enzyme/substrate ratio [ES: 0.65-4.85% (w/w)] using Alcalase 2.4 L/Flavourzyme (1:1) and pH (5.8-9.2). The antioxidant capacity of the obtained BLH (bovine lung hydrolysates) was evaluated by the ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The maximum antioxidant capacity was achieved at 53.degrees C, ES ratio of 2.3% (w/w), and pH of 8.2. Under optimal hydrolysis conditions, the antioxidant capacity increased rapidly from the beginning of the reaction to 30 min, reaching a maximum at 120 min; then, it decreased until the end (180 min). The degree of hydrolysis increased as hydrolysis occurred up to a maximum of 45%. Molecular weight distribution of BLH evaluated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and SEC-FPLC showed that bovine lung proteins hydrolyzed for 120 min presented low molecular weight peptides (<5 kDa), which are absent in the non-hydrolyzed sample. Conclusion: In this work, we optimized the variables for producing BLH with antioxidant capacity using commercial proteases in a short reaction time, making it a worthwhile strategy for the recovery of by-products from the meat industry.

AB  - The agroecological transition of agriculture not only requires changes in practices but also in ways of thinking and in their underlying values. Agroecology proposes broad scientific principles that need to be adapted to the singularities of each farm. This contextualization leads to the identification of agroecological practices that work locally and could serve as evidence-based practices to be transferred to local practitioners. This strategy was tested in a 4-year experiment conducted with dairy-sheep farmers in the South of France. The aim was to collectively engage in the agroecological transition. Our work focused on the creation of a diagnostic tool that was used to analyze local farms and identify virtuous practices to be promoted locally as evidence-based practices. But this strategy came up against the complexity and singularity of the situations to be transformed: not only was no evidence found but the construction of the diagnostic tool itself led to controversy concerning the models of agriculture to be promoted. The experiment then took a pragmatic turn: on-farm workshops were organized to enable farmers to benefit from the professional judgment of peer farmers who were willing to help their colleagues accomplish their agroecological transition. The diagnostic tool, which was designed to be prescriptive, was then used to judge the social acceptability of solutions that made sense in each farmer's own situation. Our experiment led us to conclude that managing the agro-ecological transition of farmers and their farming system is better conceived as a value-based process than as an evidence-based one.

AB  - Epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders, is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common medically intractable seizure disorders. Traf2-and NcK-interacting kinase (TNIK) has recently attracted attention as a critical modulation target of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, but its role in epilepsy remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized the involvement of TNIK in epilepsy and investigated TNIK expression in patients with intractable TLE and in a pilocarpine-induced rat model of epilepsy by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. A pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epilepsy rat model was used to determine the effect of the TNIK inhibitor NCB-0846 on behavioral manifestations of epilepsy. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP)/mass spectrometry (MS) was used to identify the potential mechanism. Through Co-IP, we detected and confirmed the main potential TNIK interactors. Subcellular fractionation was used to establish the effect of NCB-0846 on the expression of the main inter -actors in postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions. We found that TNIK was primarily located in neurons and decreased significantly in epilepsy model rats and TLE patients compared with controls. NCB-084 6 delayed kindling progression and decreased seizure severity. Co-IP/MS identified 63 candidate TNIK interactors in rat hippocampi, notably CaMKII. Co-IP showed that TNIK might correlate with endogenous GRIA1, SYN2, PSD-95, CaMKIV, GABRG1, and GABRG2. In addition, the significant decrease in GRIA1 in hippocampal total lysate and PSDs after NCB-0846 treatment might help modify the progression of PTZ kindling. Our results suggest that TNIK contributes to epileptic pathology and is a potential antiepileptic drug target. 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Piglet weaning is accompanied by gastrointestinal tract (GIT) dysfunction, resulting in post-weaning diarrhea (PWD). The treatment involves antibiotics due to the susceptibility of the weaned GIT to pathogens. However, antibiotic resistance has shifted attitudes toward a nutraceutical approach by enriching feed with functional compounds. Polyphenols are touted for their antimicrobial activity and ability to improve GIT function. Thus, we investigated the protective effects of crude blueberry phenolic extracts (BPE) in vitro using porcine cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a weaning model. Cells were pretreated with 1 mu g/mL and 2.5 mu g/mL BPE for 24 h, followed by 10 mu g/mL LPS stimulation for 6 h. Antioxidant status, paracellular permeability, the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and tight junction proteins were measured. The antimicrobial activity of the extract was evaluated against porcine pathogens. The pretreatment of cells with 1 mu g/mL BPE preserved catalase (CAT) activity. Reduced paracellular permeability was observed in a dose-dependent manner. The BPE preserved the relative mRNA abundance of tight junctions and reduced inflammatory cytokine expression. Pretreatment with the BPE was able to preserve occludin (OCLN) protein levels. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the BPE against Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Salmonella typhimurium (ST) was 62.50 mu g/mL. These findings indicate that blueberry polyphenols hold potential as feed additives in swine weaning.

AB  - Infection of humans by many viruses is typically initiated by the internalization of a single virion in each of a few susceptible cells. Thus, the outcome of the infection process may depend on stochastic single-molecule events. A crucial process for viral infection, and thus a target for developing antiviral drugs, is the uncoating of the viral genome. Here a force spectroscopy procedure using an atomic force microscope is implemented to study uncoating for individual human rhinovirus particles. Application of an increasing mechanical force on a virion led to a high force-induced structural transition that facilitated extrusion of the viral RNA molecule without loss of capsid integrity. Application of force to virions that h ad previously extruded the RNA, or to RNA-free capsids, led to a lower force-induced event associated with capsid disruption. The kinetic parameters are determined for each reaction. The high-force event is a stochastic process governed by a moderate free energy barrier (approximate to 20 kcal mol-1), which results in a heterogeneous population of structurally weakened virions in which different fractions of the RNA molecule are externalized. The effects of antiviral compounds or capsid mutation on the kinetics of this reaction reveal a correlation between the reaction rate and virus infectivity.
   The exit of the genomic RNA molecule from the common cold virus is analyzed by the application of an increasing mechanical force on individual virus particles. The results reveal a stochastic process that resulted in a heterogeneous population of weakened virus particles in which the RNA molecule w as extruded to different extents. Compounds that inhibit this process impair viral infection.image

AB  - Background Older companion dogs naturally develop a dementia-like syndrome with biological, clinical and therapeutic similarities to Alzheimer disease (AD). Given there has been no new safe, clinically effective and widely accessible treatment for AD for almost 20 years, an all-new cell therapeutic approach was trialled in canine veterinary patients, and further modelled in aged rats for more detailed neurobiological analysis. Methods A Phase 1/2A veterinary trial was conducted in N = 6 older companion dogs with definitive diagnosis of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD). Treatment comprised direct microinjection of 250,000 autologous skin-derived neuroprecursors (SKNs) into the bilateral hippocampus using MRI-guided stereotaxis. Safety was assessed clinically and efficacy using the validated Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Rating Scale (CCDR) at baseline and 3-month post treatment. Intention to treat analysis imputed a single patient that had a surgical adverse event requiring euthanasia. Three dog brains were donated following natural death and histology carried out to quantify Alzheimer pathology as well as immature neurons and synapses; these were compared to a brain bank (N = 12) of untreated aged dogs with and without CCD. Further, an age-related memory dysfunction rat model (N = 16) was used to more closely evaluate intrahippocampal engraftment of canine SKN cells, focusing on mnemonic and synaptic effects as well as donor cell survival, neurodifferentation and electrophysiologic circuit integration in a live hippocampal slice preparation. Results Four out-of-five dogs improved on the primary clinical CCDR endpoint, three fell below diagnostic threshold, and remarkably, two underwent full syndromal reversal lasting up to 2 years. At post mortem, synaptic density in the hippocampus specifically was nine standard deviations above non-treated dogs, and intensity of new neurons also several fold higher. There was no impact on AD pathology or long-term safety signals. Modelling in aged rats replicated the main canine trial findings: hippocampally-dependent place memory deficits were reversed and synaptic depletion rescued. In addition, this model confirmed donor cell survival and migration throughout the hippocampus, neuronal differentiation in situ, and physiologically-correct integration into pyramidal layer circuits. Conclusions With further development, SKN cell therapy may have potential for treating carefully chosen AD patients based on neurosynaptic restoration in the hippocampus.

AB  - Epilepsy is characterized by abnormal neuronal firing in the brain. Several therapeutic strategies exist for epilepsy; however, several patients remain poorly treated. Therefore, the development of effective treatments remains a high priority in the field. Neuroactive steroids can potentiate extra-synaptic and synaptic GABA(A) receptors, thereby providing therapeutic benefits relative to benzodiazepines. This research study investigated the therapeutic effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of LPM682000012, a new synthetic neuroactive steroid-positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABA(A) receptors employed for treating epilepsy. Acute and chronic rat epilepsy models were established to identify the anti-seizure potency of LPM682000012. The dose-dependent sedative effects of LPM682000012 and Ganaxolone in normal rats were evaluated, which revealed that they both dose-dependently alleviated acute epileptic seizure in the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-mediated seizure model. Furthermore, LPM682000012 indicated an enhanced safety profile than Ganaxolone. Moreover, LPM682000012 also indicated therapeutic effects in the kainic acid (KA)-induced chronic spontaneous seizure model. Morphologically, LPM682000012 decreased neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and increased dendritic spine density in the CA1 region. In addition, mechanical analyses, including transcriptomics, Western blot, and proteomics analyses, revealed that the Serpina3n/NF-kappa B signaling pathway was up-regulated in epileptic rat hippocampal tissue, and LPM682000012 treatment reversed these changes. In summary, this report demonstrated that the novel neurosteroid GABA(A) PAM LPM682000012 activated the synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA(A) receptors and alleviated KA-induced neuronal loss and synaptic remodeling, potentially by down-regulating the Serpina3n/NF-kappa B signaling pathways. The results provide evidence that LPM682000012 is a potential anti-seizure pharmacotherapy candidate for epilepsy and warrants further research.

AB  - An age-associated decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic function contributes to impaired synaptic plasticity and is associated with cognitive impairments. Levels of serine racemase (SR), an enzyme that synthesizes D-serine, an NMDAR co-agonist, decline with age. Thus, enhancing NMDAR function via increased SR expression in middle age, when subtle declines in cognition emerge, was predicted to enhance performance on a prefrontal cortex-mediated task sensitive to aging. Middle-aged ((similar to)12 mo) male Fischer-344 rats were injected bilaterally in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with viral vector (LV), SR (LV-SR) or control (LV-GFP). Rats were trained on the operant attentional set-shift task (AST) to examine cognitive flexibility and attentional function. LV-SR rats exhibited a faster rate of learning compared to controls during visual discrimination of the AST. Extradimensional set shifting and reversal were not impacted. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that LV-SR significantly increased SR expression in the mPFC. Electrophysiological characterization of synaptic transmission in the mPFC slices obtained from LV-GFP and LV-SR animals indicated a significant increase in isolated NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses in LV-SR slices. Thus, results of the current study demonstrated that prefrontal SR upregulation in middle age rats can improve learning of task contingencies for visual discrimination and increase glutamatergic synaptic transmission, including NMDAR activity.

AB  - Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (ZSS), a well-known herbal medicine for treating insomnia, is popular in not only China but also in Europe, India and Iran. However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, taking the targeted organs of insomnia, the liver and hippocampus, as the objects, a combination metabolomics based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was established to illustrate the abnormality of metabolic characteristics of the liver, hippocampus and serum of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA)-induced insomnia rats and to demonstrate the mechanism of ZSS in treating insomnia. The results showed that ZSS could restore the brain cell morphology, decrease the degree of hepatocyte necrosis and regulate the disturbance of neurotransmitters and hormones in insomnia rats. In terms of metabolomics, a total of 33 liver metabolites, 25 hippocampal metabolites and 18 serum metabolites were finally selected as the potential biomarkers and an important pathway of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis was common in three tissues in PCPA rats. Meanwhile, ZSS significantly reversed the levels of 23 liver metabolites, 15 hippocampal metabolites and 5 serum metabolites. The present study demonstrates the actions of ZSS in treating insomnia by enhancing both cerebral and hepatic functions.

AB  - Episodic memory is essential to navigate in a changing environment by recalling past events, creating new memories, and updating stored information from experience. Although the mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation have been profoundly studied, much less is known about memory retrieval. Hippocampal spatial representations are key for retrieval of contextually guided episodic memories. Indeed, hippocampal place cells exhibit stable location-specific activity which is thought to support contextual memory, but can also undergo remapping in response to environmental changes. It is unclear if remapping is directly related to the expression of different episodic memories. Here, using an incidental memory recognition task in rats, we showed that retrieval of a contextually guided memory is reflected by the levels of CA3 remapping, demonstrating a clear link between external cues, hippocampal remapping, and episodic memory retrieval that guides behavior. Furthermore, we describe NMDARs as key players in regulating the balance between retrieval and memory differentiation processes by controlling the reactivation of specific memory traces. While an increase in CA3 NMDAR activity boosts memory retrieval, dentate gyrus NMDAR activity enhances memory differentiation. Our results contribute to understanding how the hippocampal circuit sustains a flexible balance between memory formation and retrieval depending on the environmental cues and the internal representations of the individual. They also provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of hippocampal subregions to generate this balance.
   Understanding if and how contextual representations guide memory retrieval is an important question in neuroscience. This study shows that retrieval of a contextual memory is reflected by the levels of CA3 remapping and describes NMDARs as a key player in regulating the balance between retrieval and memory differentiation processes.

Furthermore, our previous study indicated that human recombinant G-CSF (hrG-CSF) supplementation during porcine oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) or during embryo in vitro culture (IVC) improved their quality and development potential when using cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) with more than three cumulus cell layers (CCL >3). Thus, in this study, we investigate the optimal conditions of hrG-CSF supplementation throughout the in vitro production (IVP: IVM + IVC) system to improve the embryo production efficiency of "poor-quality (CCL <= 3)" oocytes. COCs were classified into two groups according to the number of CCL (>3 and <= 3) and embryonic viability was analyzed after treatment with hrG-CSF during IVC. The mRNA transcription levels of G-CSF in COCs were compared based on their type and the period of IVM. Finally, developmental capacity and quality were evaluated after treatment with hrG-CSF for different periods of IVP. No marked effects on the developmental potential of embryos when using CCL <= 3 type COCs were observed after supplementing hrG-CSF only during IVC. Moreover, the mRNA transcription level of G-CSF increased gradually with IVM culture time and was higher in CCL <= 3 COCs than in >3. Supplementing hrG-CSF only during the IVM period resulted in the best embryo developmental potential, while supplementing hrG-CSF during the IVP period resulted in the best quality embryos, reflected in the increased total cell number and decreased apoptotic nuclei index of blastocysts. These findings indicate that "poor-quality" COCs may have a greater demand for G-CSF than "good-quality", meanwhile hrG-CSF supplementation throughout IVP improves resource utilization efficiency in poor-quality COCs.

AB  - The current study aimed to reveal in detail patterns of intrahippocampal connectivity in homing pigeons (Columba livia). In light of recent physiological evidence suggesting differences between dorsomedial and ventrolateral hippocampal regions and a hitherto unknown laminar organization along the transverse axis, we also aimed to gain a higher-resolution understanding of the proposed pathway segregation. Both in vivo and high-resolution in vitro tracing techniques were employed and revealed a complex connectivity pattern along the subdivisions of the avian hippocampus. We uncovered connectivity pathways along the transverse axis that started in the dorsolateral hippocampus and continued to the dorsomedial subdivision, from where information was relayed to the triangular region either directly or indirectly via the V-shaped layers. The often-reciprocal connectivity along these subdivisions displayed an intriguing topographical arrangement such that two parallel pathways could be discerned along the ventrolateral (deep) and dorsomedial (superficial) aspects of the avian hippocampus. The segregation along the transverse axis was further supported by expression patterns of the glial fibrillary acidic protein and calbindin. Moreover, we found strong expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II alpha and doublecortin in the lateral but not medial V-shape layer, indicating a difference between the two V-shaped layers. Overall, our findings provide an unprecedented, detailed description of avian intrahippocampal pathway connectivity, and confirm the recently proposed segregation of the avian hippocampus along the transverse axis. We also provide further support for the hypothesized homology of the lateral V-shape layer and the dorsomedial hippocampus with the dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn of mammals, respectively.

AB  - The retinas of fishes often have single and double cone photoreceptors that are organized in lattice-like mosaics. In flatfishes experiencing eye migration (i.e., the metamorphic process whereby one eye migrates to the other side of the head), the hexagonal lattice of single cones present in the larva undergoes major restructuring resulting in a dominant square mosaic postmetamorphosis consisting of four double cones surrounding each single cone. The expression of different opsin types during eye migration has not been examined despite its importance in understanding photoreceptor plasticity and whether cell fate (in terms of spectral phenotype) could influence square mosaic formation. Here, we probed the retina of Atlantic halibut undergoing eye migration for opsin expression using two antibodies, AHblue and AB5407, that labeled short wavelength sensitive 2 (SWS2) opsin and longer wavelength (predominantly middle wavelength sensitive, RH2) opsins, respectively. Throughout the retina, double and triple cones labeled with AB5407 exclusively, whereas the vast majority of single cones labeled with AHblue. A minority (<5%) of single cones in the square mosaic of the centroventral retina labeled with AB5407. In regions of mosaic transition and near peripheral growth zones, some single cones co-expressed at least two opsins as they labeled with both antibodies. Short wavelength (SWS2 expressing, or S) cones formed a nonrandom mosaic gradient from central to dorsal retina in a region dominated by the larval single cone mosaic. Our results demonstrate the expression of at least two opsins throughout the postmetamorphic retina and suggest opsin switching as a mechanism to create new cone spectral phenotypes. In addition, the S cone gradient at the onset of eye migration may underlie a plastic, cell induction mechanism by which a cone's phenotype determines that of its neighbors and the formation of the square mosaic.

AB  - The adverse effects of heat stress on reproductive performance of sheep are becoming increasingly severe. Previous research has revealed that heat stress decreases both cholesterol and estradiol content; however, regulation of estradiol by cholesterol and its regulatory mechanism under heat stress are unclear. Mevalonate kinase (MVK), a key cholesterol synthesis pathway enzyme, binds to the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR; a key gene regulating hormone synthesis) mRNA. In this study, ovine ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) were used in an in vitro model. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and an RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA) were used to investigate whether the decrease in cholesterol caused by acute heat stress resulted in a decrease in estradiol synthesis. Acute heat stress reduced the cholesterol content in ovine ovarian GCs, which transactivated the cholesterol synthesis pathway corresponding to the gene expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1A), SREBP-2, and MVK. Upregulated MVK increased the MVK-LHR mRNA complex, which caused LHR mRNA decay and downregulation, further leading to the downregulation of CYP19A1 and a decrease in estradiol. The cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, PF429242, alleviated the decrease in estradiol synthesis caused by acute heat stress. Overall, acute heat stress caused a decrease in total cholesterol, which transactivated the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes, such as SREBP-1A, SREBP2, and MVK, increasing the MVK-LHR complex, downregulating LHR expression, and further decreasing estradiol.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Duragen (R) and skimmed milk (SM) extenders on the quality parameters, bacterial load and fertilization ability of stored ram semen. A total of 50 ejaculates from Sardi rams (n = 5) aged 2.5- 3 years, were collected and stored in Duragen (R) and SM at 15 degrees C. The motilities and velocity parameters generated by the CASA system were then evaluated at 0, 8 and 24 h of storage. Afterward, bacterial loads of sperm extended in Duragen (R) and SM were determined at 0, 5 and 24 h of incubation. In addition, ewes (n = 100) aged 2 years, have been chosen in the same herd. The selected ewes were then synchronized and inseminated using semen extended in Duragen (R) and SM and stored for 5 h at 15 degrees C. The results revealed that total and progressive motilities, straight velocity (VSL), straightness (SRT), lateral head displacement (ALH) and beat cross frequency (BCF) were not affected by the extender type after 24 h of storage (p > .05). However, curvilinear ve- locity (VCL), velocity average path (VAP), linearity (LIN) and wobble (WOB) showed higher values in Duragen (R) compared with SM extender after 24 h of storage (p < .05). Bacterial loads were observed mainly in sperm stored in SM at 5 h (183 UFC/mL) and at 24 h (357 UFC/mL) of incubation. However, the only case showing a bacterial load in Duragen<(R)> is when the storage time attains 24 h (199 UFC/mL). Concerning fertility, sperm diluted in both extenders resulting in high fertility rates which reaches 66% and 73% for Duragen (R) and SM, respectively, with no statistical difference (p > .05). In summary, Duragen (R) extender decreased bacterial load in stored semen and maintained high ram sperm quality and fertility. These findings suggest that Duragen (R) extender could be used as SM alternative in ovine artificial insemination (OAI).

AB  - High mobility group (HMG) proteins are chromatin regulators with essential functions in development, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. The protein HMG20A is predicted by the AlphaFold2 software to contain three distinct structural elements, which we have functionally characterized: i) an amino-terminal, intrinsically disordered domain with transactivation activity; ii) an HMG box with higher binding affinity for double-stranded, four-way-junction DNA than for linear DNA; and iii) a long coiled-coil domain. Our proteomic study followed by a deletion analysis and structural modeling demonstrates that HMG20A forms a complex with the histone reader PHF14, via the establishment of a two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. siRNA-mediated knockdown of either PHF14 or HMG20A in MDA-MB-231 cells causes similar defects in cell migration, invasion and homotypic cell-cell adhesion ability, but neither affects proliferation. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that PHF14 and HMG20A share a large subset of targets. We show that the PHF14-HMG20A complex modulates the Hippo pathway through a direct interaction with the TEAD1 transcription factor. PHF14 or HMG20A deficiency increases epithelial markers, including E-cadherin and the epithelial master regulator TP63 and impaired normal TGF beta-trigged epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Taken together, these data indicate that PHF14 and HMG20A cooperate in regulating several pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity.

AB  - Simple Summary The family of coronaviruses comprises a diverse set of strains and variants which cause diseases from the common cold to COVID-19. Moreover, they infect a wide array of hosts from bats, camels, birds, to humans. Studying coronaviruses through the lens of host specificity provides a unique perspective to understanding the evolution, diversity and dynamics of this family. In particular, this can reveal groups of different hosts infected by similar strains, giving clues on strains which were more likely to have evolved to jump from one host to another. In this work, we frame host specificity as a classification task, in designing a very compact numerical representation of the spike sequences of different coronaviruses. Based on this numerical representation, classification methods are able to detect the target host with high accuracy. Such an approach can used to efficiently scale to large volumes of sequences, in order to unveil trends in the host specificity of different coronavirus strains. The study of host specificity has important connections to the question about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in humans which led to the COVID-19 pandemic-an important open question. There are speculations that bats are a possible origin. Likewise, there are many closely related (corona)viruses, such as SARS, which was found to be transmitted through civets. The study of the different hosts which can be potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to understanding, mitigating, and preventing current and future pandemics. In coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is important in determining host specificity, since it is the point of contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. In this paper, we classify the hosts of over five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating them into clusters of distinct hosts among birds, bats, camels, swine, humans, and weasels, to name a few. We propose a feature embedding based on the well-known position weight matrix (PWM), which we call PWM2Vec, and we use it to generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these coronaviruses. While our embedding is inspired by the success of PWMs in biological applications, such as determining protein function and identifying transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to use PWMs from viral sequences to generate fixed-length feature vector representations, and use them in the context of host classification. The results on real world data show that when using PWM2Vec, machine learning classifiers are able to perform comparably to the baseline models in terms of predictive performance and runtime-in some cases, the performance is better. We also measure the importance of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus. Finally, we perform some statistical analyses on these results to show that our embedding is more compact than the embeddings of the baseline models.

AB  - Proper maintenance of intracellular vesicular pH is essential for cargo trafficking during synaptic function and plasticity. Mutations in the SLC9A6 gene encoding the recycling endosomal pH regulator (Na+, K+)/H+ exchanger isoform 6 (NHE6) are causal for Christianson syndrome (CS), a severe form of X-linked intellectual disability. NHE6 expression is also downregulated in other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its dysfunction could contribute more broadly to the pathophysiology of other neurological conditions. To understand how ablation of NHE6 function leads to severe learning impairments, we assessed synaptic structure, function, and cellular mechanisms of learning in a novel line of Nhe6 knockout (KO) mice expressing a plasma membrane-tethered green fluorescent protein within hippocampal neurons. We uncovered significant reductions in dendritic spines density, AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression, and AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The neurons also failed to undergo functional and structural enhancement during long-term potentiation (LTP). Significantly, the selective TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone restored spine density as well as functional and structural LTP in KO neurons. TrkB activation thus may act as a potential clinical intervention to ameliorate cognitive deficits in CS and other neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease that is commonly observed in people around the world. Osteoarthritis commonly affects patients who are obese and those above the age of 60. A valid knee image was generated by Computed Tomography (CT). In this work, efficient segmentation of CT images using Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) optimization is implemented. The initial stage employs, the CT image normalization and the normalized image is incited to image enhancement through histogram correlation. Consequently, the enhanced image is segmented by utilizing Niblack and Bernsen algorithm. The (EHO) optimized outcome is evaluated in two steps. The initial step includes image enhancement with the measure of Mean square error (MSE), Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and Structural similarity index (SSIM). The following step includes the segmentation which includes the measure ofAccuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity. The comparative analysis of EHO provides 95% of accuracy, 94% of specificity and 93% of sensitivity than that of Active contour and Otsu threshold.

AB  - In this paper an improved optimization strategy is proposed to address issues related to uncertainty of the optimum power flow (OPF) considering the cost analysis. Elephant Herd Optimization (EHO) method roused by the crowding conduct of elephant gathering has been modified to achieve the minimization of the objective functions. Initially, the OPF is analyzed with the Newton-Raphson (N-R) approach by considering only conventional resources, later on the wind and PV-based power scheduling is performed. The output power of the wind and PV systems is computed from the Weibull probability distribution function (PDF) and Lognormal PDF. Initially, the objective function is defined to analyze the power loss, voltage deviation, carbon emissions and generation cost. The defined multi-objective function is solved for PV and Wind power generation costs, emission, voltage stability, and losses. The considered constraints are the cost of generation and the risks associated with the renewable energy sources apart from voltage and reactive power limits. Moreover, the penalty deviation charges have also been considered during extreme conditions for sustainable power sources. The proposed approach has been applied to IEEE 57 bus system and the resulting emissions, generation cost, losses and voltage deviation are evaluated and the direct, reserve, and penalty costs of wind and PV are analyzed It is contrasted to standard approaches such as Differential Evolutionary (DE) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) to substantiate the efficiency of the EHO method. The proposed approach is deployed in the MATLAB for various cases.

AB  - Author summary
   In evolutionary studies, it is customary to obtain homologous sequences from different individuals in a population or a species to construct a phylogeny. Frequently, sequences from different individuals will be identical; we refer to a set of identical sequences as a haplotype. If short-read sequencing technologies are used to obtain sequences from many individuals, the sequence from each individual is tagged with a unique barcode, and a mixed sample of tagged sequences is subsequently sequenced. The tagged sequences can be identified using the appropriate bioinformatics tools, for further downstream analyses. We have developed a novel method, AFPhyloMix, to reconstruct the phylogeny of a mixed sample of homologous sequences, and the relative abundance of different haplotypes, from different individuals without the need for barcoding. AFPhyloMix aligns the short reads obtained to a reference alignment, and identifies the variable sites along the alignment. On the basis of the patterns of nucleotide frequencies at these and neighbouring sites, AFPhyloMix uses a Bayesian inference model to compute the phylogenetic tree and the haplotype relative abundances. Our results show that AFPhyloMix works well on both the simulated data set and the real data set.</p>
   A current strategy for obtaining haplotype information from several individuals involves short-read sequencing of pooled amplicons, where fragments from each individual is identified by a unique DNA barcode. In this paper, we report a new method to recover the phylogeny of haplotypes from short-read sequences obtained using pooled amplicons from a mixture of individuals, without barcoding. The method, AFPhyloMix, accepts an alignment of the mixture of reads against a reference sequence, obtains the single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) patterns along the alignment, and constructs the phylogenetic tree according to the SNP patterns. AFPhyloMix adopts a Bayesian inference model to estimate the phylogeny of the haplotypes and their relative abundances, given that the number of haplotypes is known. In our simulations, AFPhyloMix achieved at least 80% accuracy at recovering the phylogenies and relative abundances of the constituent haplotypes, for mixtures with up to 15 haplotypes. AFPhyloMix also worked well on a real data set of kangaroo mitochondrial DNA sequences.</p>

AB  - Simple Summary The role of natural selection on evolution at the gene expression level is still not well-understood. However, it is important for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of species differentiation. By identifying differentially expressed genes with variation forced by natural selection, we found that expression variation and variation related to phenotypic divergence were extensively adaptive between both species and subspecies for three closely related horseshoe bats. In addition, despite the immune-related adaptive expression variation found both within and between species, there were different functional patterns with respect to adaptive expression variation between two taxonomic scales as well. These results could be helpful for better comprehending the role of natural selection on evolution, and providing scientific basis for the protection of bat species. In the process of species differentiation and adaption, the relative influence of natural selection on gene expression variation often remains unclear (especially its impact on phenotypic divergence). In this study, we used differentially expressed genes from brain, cochlea, and liver samples collected from two species of bats to determine the gene expression variation forced by natural selection when comparing at the interspecific (Rhinolophus siamensis and R. episcopus episcopus) and the intraspecific (R. e. episcopus and R. episcopus spp.) levels. In both cases, gene expression variation was extensively adaptive (>66.0%) and mainly governed by directional selection, followed by stabilizing selection, and finally balancing selection. The expression variation related to acoustic signals (resting frequency, RF) and body size (forearm length, FA) was also widely governed by natural selection (>69.1%). Different functional patterns of RF- or FA-related adaptive expression variation were found between the two comparisons, which manifested as abundant immune-related regulations between subspecies (indicating a relationship between immune response and phenotypic adaption). Our study verifies the extensive adaptive expression variation between both species and subspecies and provides insight into the effects of natural selection on species differentiation and adaptation as well as phenotypic divergence at the expression level.

AB  - Anti-aging is a challenging and necessary research topic. Momordica charantia L. is a common edible medicinal plant that has various pharmacological activities and is often employed in daily health care. However, its anti-aging effect on mice and the underlying mechanism thereof remain unclear. Our current study mainly focused on the effect of Momordica charantia L. on d-galactose-induced subacute aging in mice and explored the underlying mechanism. UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS was applied to qualitatively analyze the chemical components of Momordica charantia L. ethanol extract (MCE). A subacute aging mice model induced by d-galactose (d-gal) was established to investigate the anti-aging effect and potential mechanism of MCE. The learning and memory ability of aging mice was evaluated using behavioral tests. The biochemical parameters, including antioxidant enzyme activity and the accumulation of lipid peroxides in serum, were measured to explore the effect of MCE on the redox imbalance caused by aging. Pathological changes in the hippocampus were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the levels of aging-related proteins in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were assessed using Western blotting. The experimental results demonstrated that a total of 14 triterpenoids were simultaneously identified in MCE. The behavioral assessments results showed that MCE can improve the learning and memory ability of subacute mice. The biochemical parameters determination results showed that MCE can improve the activity of antioxidant enzymes and decrease the accumulation of lipid peroxides in aging mice significantly. Furthermore, aging and injury in the hippocampus were ameliorated. Mechanistically, the results showed a significant upregulation in the protein expression of P-PI3K/PI3K and P-AKT/AKT (p < 0.01), as well as a significant reduction in cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, Bax and P-mTOR/mTOR (p < 0.01). Our results confirm that MCE could restore the antioxidant status and improve cognitive impairment in aging mice, inhibit d-gal-induced apoptosis by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and rescue the impaired autophagy caused by mTOR overexpression, thereby exerting an anti-aging effect.

AB  - Simple Summary The jejunum tissue is an important site of nutrient digestion and absorption in neonatal calves. However, little is known regarding the effects of colostrum and mature milk intake on protein phosphorylation in the jejunal tissue of calves during the passive immunity period. Using titanium-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, coupled with the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, we found that the phosphoproteins were differentially expressed in the jejunum tissue of the neonate after ingested colostrum and milk feeding. The parental genes were primarily involved in developmental, glycohomeostasis, and immune regulation processes. We suggest that the changes induced in phosphorylated protein expression for calves fed with colostrum may play a key role in the developmental and innate immune process. Improvements in the feeding of calves are of increasing importance for the development of the dairy industry. While colostrum is essential for the health of newborn calves, knowledge of protein phosphorylation alterations in neonatal calves that are fed colostrum or mature milk is lacking. Here, mid-jejunum tissue samples were collected from calves that received colostrum or milk. Subsequently, the jejunum phosphoproteome was analyzed using a phosphopeptide enrichment method, i.e., titanium immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 2093 phosphopeptides carrying unique 1851 phosphorylation sites corresponding to 1180 phosphoproteins were identified. Of the 1180 phosphoproteins, 314 phosphorylation sites on 241 proteins were differentially expressed between the groups. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the phosphoproteins were strongly associated with developmental and macromolecule metabolic processes, signal transduction, and responses to stimuli and insulin. Pathway analysis showed that the spliceosome, Hippo, insulin, and neurotrophin signaling pathways were enriched. These results reveal the expression pattern and changes in the function of phosphoproteins in bovine jejunum tissues under different feeding conditions and provide further insights into the crucial role of colostrum feeding during the early stages of life.

AB  - Everyday episodic memories involve linking together related events that are temporally separated. However, the mechanisms of forming this temporal association have remained unclear. Here, using astrocyte-specific manipulations, we show that potentiating astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) enhances the strength of such temporal association, in parallel with long-term potentiation (LTP) enhancement of temporoammonic pathway to CA1, whereas attenuation of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling has the opposite effect. Moreover, we identify that these effects are mediated by astrocytic a4 subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (a4-nAChRs) via mechanisms involving NMDAR co-agonist supply. Finally, astrocytic a4-nAChRs underlie the cognitive enhancer nicotine's physiological effects. Together, these find-ings highlight the importance of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in cognitive behavior and reveal a mechanism in governing the temporal association of episodic memory formation that operates through a4-nAChRs on hip-pocampal astrocytes.

AB  - The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway plays a central role in many biological processes such as regulating cell fate, organ size, and tissue growth, and its key components are spatiotemporally expressed and posttranslationally modified during these processes. Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that involves the covalent attachment of NEDD8 to target proteins by NEDD8-specific E1-E2-E3 enzymes. Whether neddylation is involved in Hippo-YAP signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence supporting the critical role of NEDD8 in facilitating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway by mediating neddylation of the transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). Overexpression of NEDD8 induces YAP1 neddylation and enhances YAP1 transactivity, but inhibition of neddylation suppresses YAP1 transactivity and attenuates YAP1 nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, inhibition of YAP1 signaling promotes MLN4924-induced ovarian granulosa cells apoptosis and disruption of nedd8 in zebrafish results in downregulation of yap1-activated genes and upregulation of yap1-repressed genes. Further assays show that the xiap ligase promotes nedd8 conjugates to yap1 and that yap1 neddylation. In addition, we identify lysine 159 as a major neddylation site on YAP1. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for neddylation in the regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling.

AB  - Trichuris spp. are nematode parasites infecting wild ruminants in zoological institutions worldwide. These helminths cause significant morbidity in giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) and other hoofstock located in zoological institutions throughout the United States. Historically, studies and institutions have used a variety of nematode detection methods with various flotation solutions. Optimization of Trichuris egg detection is necessary for monitoring collections. Fecal and soil optimized protocols were generated in this study using samples containing Trichuris eggs from multiple semi free-ranging zoological institutions. First, Sheather's sugar (specific gravity (SG) 1.27), sucrose (SG 1.40), magnesium sulfate (SG 1.26), and zinc sulfate (SG 1.18) were compared as flotation solutions by quantitative eggs per gram using a modified Stoll method. Then a soil recovery method was optimized comparing Tween 20, sodium hydroxide, DawnTM (Procter and Gamble) detergent, and sodium chloride as liberating solutions to free eggs from the soil. We found that Sheather's sugar and sucrose solutions were the most effective for Trichuris egg detection, and either sodium hydroxide or sodium chloride liberated eggs from soil.

AB  - Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) induced by glucocorticoids (GCs) has been considered to be asso-ciated with the dysfunction of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Studies have reported that GCs can reg-ulate the normal differentiation of BMSCs. However, the exact mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. In this study, we used methylprednisolone (MPS) to induce BMSCs, and then found that the Hippo signaling pathway was upregu-lated in a dose-dependent manner compared to that in the control group. In addition, the osteogenic ability of BMSCs was decreased, as evaluated by Alizarin Red S staining ana-lysis and alkaline phosphatase activity assays, accompanied by the downregulated expression of Runx2, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. Additionally, the adipogenic capacity of BMSCs under the MPS conditions was increased, as identified by Oil Red O staining with upregulated triglyceride and PPAR gamma expression. Moreover, suppression by knockdown of MST1 was found to attenuate the Hippo signaling pathway and adipogenic differentiation, while enhancing osteogenic dif-ferentiation. In conclusion, our findings revealed that the Hippo signaling pathway was involved in GC-ONFH by affecting the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capa-cities of BMSCs. Our study could provide a basis for further investigation of the specific function of the Hippo pathway in ONFH.

AB  - Phytocannabinoids, including the non-addictive cannabis component cannabidivarin (CBDV), have been reported to hold therapeutic potential in several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Nonetheless, the therapeutic value of phytocannabinoids for treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a major NDD, remains unexplored. Here, we characterized the neurobehavioral effects of CBDV at doses of 20 or 100 mg/kg in the Fmr1-knockout (Fmr1-KO) mouse model of FXS using two temporally different intraperitoneal regimens: subchronic 10-day delivery during adulthood (Study 1: rescue treatment) or chronic 5-week delivery at adolescence (Study 2: preventive treatment). Behavioral tests assessing FXS-like abnormalities included anxiety, locomotor, cognitive, social and sensory alterations. Expression of inflammatory and plasticity markers was investigated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. When administered during adulthood (Study 1), the effects of CBDV were marginal, rescuing at the lower dose only the acoustic hyper-responsiveness of Fmr1-KO mice and at both doses their altered hippocampal expression of neurotrophins. When administered during adolescence (Study 2), CBDV at both doses prevented the cognitive, social and acoustic alterations of adult Fmr1-KO mice and modified the expression of several inflammatory brain markers in both wild-type littermates and mutants. These findings warrant the therapeutic potential of CBDV for preventing neurobehavioral alterations associated with FXS, highlighting the relevance of its early administration.

AB  - Formyl peptide receptor type 2 (FPR2/ALX) belongs to the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) family clustered on chromosome 19 and encodes a family of three Class A of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A short N-terminal region, an NPXXY motif in transmembrane (TM) region 7 and an E/DRY motif that bridges TM3 and TM6 stabilizing inactive receptor conformations characterize this class of receptors. In recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), FPRs play a crucial role in innate immune responses. FPR2/ALX is highly expressed in myeloid cells, as well as in chondrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial, epithelial and smooth muscle cells. FPR2/ALX mRNA expression was recently reported in the rat brainstem, spinal cord, thalamus/hypothalamus, cerebral neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum. The central nervous system (CNS) distribution of FPR2/ALX suggests important functions in nociception. Thus, the present study was carried out to investigate the possible role of FPR2/ALX in nociception in mice. Intrathecal administration of the formyl peptide receptor type 1 (FPR1) agonist fMLF and the FPR2/ALX agonist BML-111 relieved nociception and these effects were reduced by contemporary administration of the FPR2/ALX antagonist WRW4. Furthermore, measurement of cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord of neuropathic mice demonstrated that the antinociceptive effects of BML-111 might depend on the reduction in cytokine release and BDNF in the spinal cord. These results suggest a possible role of FPR2/ALX for pain control in the spinal cord.

AB  - BackgroundThe VPS50 protein functions in synaptic and dense core vesicle acidification, and perturbations of VPS50 function produce behavioral changes in Caenorhabditis elegans. Patients with mutations in VPS50 show severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, characteristics that have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The mechanisms that link VPS50 mutations to ASD are unknown.ResultsTo examine the role of VPS50 in mammalian brain function and behavior, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate knockouts of VPS50 in both cultured murine cortical neurons and living mice. In cultured neurons, KO of VPS50 did not affect the number of synaptic vesicles but did cause mislocalization of the V-ATPase V1 domain pump and impaired synaptic activity, likely as a consequence of defects in vesicle acidification and vesicle content. In mice, mosaic KO of VPS50 in the hippocampus altered synaptic transmission and plasticity and generated robust cognitive impairments.ConclusionsWe propose that VPS50 functions as an accessory protein to aid the recruitment of the V-ATPase V1 domain to synaptic vesicles and in that way plays a crucial role in controlling synaptic vesicle acidification. Understanding the mechanisms controlling behaviors and synaptic function in ASD-associated mutations is pivotal for the development of targeted interventions, which may open new avenues for therapeutic strategies aimed at ASD and related conditions.

AB  - In the discussion about zoo elephant husbandry, the report of Clubb et al. (2008, Science 322: 1649) that zoo elephants had a "compromised survivorship" compared to certain non-zoo populations is a grave argument, and was possibly one of the triggers of a large variety of investigations into zoo elephant welfare, and changes in zoo elephant management. A side observation of that report was that whereas survivorship in African elephants (Loxodonta africana) improved since 1960, this was not the case in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). We used historical data (based on the Species360 database) to revisit this aspect, including recent developments since 2008. Assessing the North American and European populations from 1910 until today, there were significant improvements of adult (>= 10 years) survivorship in both species. For the period from 1960 until today, survivorship improvement was significant for African elephants and close to a significant improvement in Asian elephants; Asian elephants generally had a higher survivorship than Africans. Juvenile (<10 years) survivorship did not change significantly since 1960 and was higher in African elephants, most likely due to the effect of elephant herpes virus on Asian elephants. Current zoo elephant survivorship is higher than some, and lower than some other non-zoo populations. We discuss that in our view, the shape of the survivorship curve, and its change over time, are more relevant than comparisons with specific populations. Zoo elephant survivorship should be monitored continuously, and the expectation of a continuous trend towards improvement should be met.

AB  - Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a crucial cytokine, has various homeostatic and pathogenic bioactivities. The aim of this study was to assess the neuroprotective effect of ketamine against TNF-alpha-induced motor dysfunction and neuronal necroptosis in male C57BL/6J mice in vivo and HT-22 cell lines in vitro. The behavioural testing results of the present study indicate that ketamine ameliorated TNF-alpha-induced neurological dysfunction. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining results showed that TNF-alpha-induced brain dysfunction was caused by necroptosis and microglial activation, which could be attenuated by ketamine pre-treatment inhibiting reactive oxygen species production and mixed lineage kinase domain-like phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons. Therefore, we concluded that ketamine may have neuroprotective effects as a potent inhibitor of necroptosis, which provides a new theoretical and experimental basis for the application of ketamine in TNF-alpha-induced necroptosis-associated diseases.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of solid-state fermentation and biofortification of maize cobs using yeast and plant extracts on their biochemical properties and enzyme activity. Maize cobs were fermented with extracts from elephant grass, cassava leaves, or Siam weed, combined with baker's yeast or palm wine yeast. In vitro assays revealed increased L-lysine concentration (up to 8.6 mg/g), soluble protein content (up to 27.4 mg/g), total phenolic content (up to 15.5 mu g GAE/g), total flavonoid content (up to 23.4 mu g CE/g), and xylanase activity (up to 25.7 Units) compared to controls. Glucose concentration decreased (to 0.8 mg/mL), indicating efficient utilization. Amylase and protease activities varied, with some combinations showing higher enzymatic activity (amylase at 35.4 Units, protease at 39.2 Units). These results underscore the potential of solid-state fermentation and biofortification to enhance the nutritional quality of agro-residues, offering novel insights into sustainable food production and waste utilization strategies.

AB  - The escalating global prevalence of depression demands effective therapeutic strategies, with psychobiotics emerging as a promising solution. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the neurobehavioral impact of psychobiotics remain elusive. This study reveals a significant reduction in hippocampal indole3-lactic acid (ILA) levels in depressed mice, which is ameliorated by the psychobiotic Bifidobacterium breve. In both human subjects and mice, the ILA increase in the circulatory system results from bifidobacteria supplementation. Further investigation identifies the key aromatic lactate dehydrogenase ( Aldh ) gene and pathway in bifidobacteria responsible for ILA production. Importantly, the antidepressant effects are nullified in the Aldh mutants compared to the wild-type strain. At the bifidobacteria species level, those with Aldh exhibit heightened antidepressant effects. Finally, this study emphasizes the antidepressant efficacy of psychobiotic-derived ILA, potentially mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling activation to alleviate neuroinflammation. This study unveils the molecular and genetic foundations of psychobiotics' antidepressant effects, offering insights for microbial therapies targeting mood disorders.

AB  - Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with sedative and anxiolytic properties. Increasing evidence reports that DEX has a neuroprotective effect. In this study, we investigated the potential effects of DEX on learning and memory functions in rats with experimental cognitive impairment. In the study, 21 adult male rats were used. The rats were divided into three groups, namely control, Scopolamine (SCOP) and SCOP + DEX. Cognitive impairment was induced with 1 mg/kg SCOP daily for 21 days. DEX was administered at a dose of 10 mu g/kg between days 14 and 21 of the experiment. Following the injections, a spatial memory test was performed with a Morris Water Maze (MWM). At the end of the experiment, the hippocampus was dissected. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels were determined by ELISA. The tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and Cyclic AMP-Response Element-Binding Protein (CREB) levels were measured by immunohistochemistry. DEX treatment improved the learning performance of rats compared to SCOP for 5 days. However, it did not significantly change memory performance. DEX increased the BDNF and ACh levels in the hippocampus while decreasing the AChE levels. Similarly, DEX treatment significantly increased CREB phosphorylation. No significant difference was observed between the TrkB receptor levels of the groups. This study demonstrated that the role of DEX in reducing SCOP-induced cognitive impairment is partially mediated by the increase in BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway activity.

AB  - (1) Background: Physiological changes in nasal patency in response to posture contribute to sleep-related problems. Previously, we reported that the supine and prone positions cause a significant decrease in nasal patency in subjective and objective assessments of healthy individuals. Therefore, we conducted a study to evaluate the effect of posture on nasal patency in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR); (2) Methods: The present study comprised 30 patients diagnosed with AR and 30 healthy subjects without nasal disease (non-AR). Changes in nasal patency were evaluated in the sitting, supine, and prone positions. We used the visual analog scale to evaluate subjective nasal blockage. Acoustic rhinometry and endoscopy were used to objectively measure changes in nasal patency; (3) Results: In the non-AR group, the prone position had a significant effect on subjective nasal blockage compared with the sitting position, with significant decreases in the minimal cross-sectional area (mCSA) measured by acoustic rhinometry. Furthermore, endoscopy demonstrated a significantly increased inferior turbinate hypertrophy in the non-AR group. In the AR group, there was no statistical difference in subjective nasal blockage symptoms between the different positions. However, in objective examinations (acoustic rhinometry and endoscopy), the prone position showed significantly decreased nasal patency; (4) Conclusions: In patients with AR, subjective nasal blockage did not significantly increase in the supine or prone position. Endoscopy demonstrated increased inferior turbinate hypertrophy in supine and prone positions resulting in a significant reduction in nasal cavity mCSA, indicating an objective reduction in nasal patency.

AB  - Prenatal constant light exposure (CLE) impaired the anxiety response and circadian rhythms of testicular enzymes in adult male rat offspring, while melatonin corrected these deficiencies. However, the mechanism by which CLE induces these long-term behavioral consequences and the impact of melatonin system have not been examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of prenatal CLE and melatonin treatment on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and the melatonin system in male and female adult rat offspring. Six groups of male and female rat offspring (P60) exposed to either light/dark (LD) or CL regimes, and treated with vehicle or melatonin (10 mg/kg, s.c.) were evaluated for anxiety by open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), and light/dark (LD) tests, and depressive-like response by splash test and sucrose preference test. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT) and melatonin expression, and hippocampal MT1A and MT1b receptor expression were assessed by ELISA. Prenatal CLE induced behavioral deficits and elevated plasma CORT levels, while melatonin levels, their circadian rhythmicity, and hippocampal MT receptor expression were not altered in male and female offspring in the CLE regime. However, prenatal melatonin treatment corrected behavioral deficits in a sex-specific manner by up-regulating hippocampal MT receptors, even without altering systemic melatonin levels or normalizing CORT in either sex. The results of this study suggest critical insights into how prenatal environmental factors and therapeutic interventions shape physiological and behavioral outcomes.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Paeoniae Radix Rubra (PRR), the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. or Paeonia veitchii Lynch, has been widely used to promote blood circulation and eliminate blood stasis in Chinese clinical practice, but its effect on cerebral ischemia is still rarely reported.Aim of the study: The present study aimed to assess the potential therapeutic possibilities of the extract of PRR (PRRE) on cerebral ischemia, further exploring the underlying mechanism, and preliminary screening of the corresponding active components.Materials and methods: The neuroprotective effects of PRRE in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) injury and mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22 cell line) following oxidative stress were confirmed. The mechanism was investigated using immunohistochemical staining, western blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunofluorescence. The active components of PRRE were ana-lysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and molecular docking.Results: The in vivo study showed that PRRE reduced infarct volume and improved neurological deficits in rats, and the expression of GPX4, FTH1, Beclin1, LC3 II, andp-Akt was upregulated in the rat hippocampi. In addition, the vitro research indicated that PRRE can also alleviate H2O2-induced HT22 cell damage by regulating cytokines such as malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the ex-pressions of GPX4 and Beclin1 were observed to be elevated. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway was inhibited by LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Furthermore, the effective components of PRRE in regulating ferroptosis and autophagy are mainly defined as albiflorin, paeoniflorin, benzoyl paeoniflorin, ole-anolic acid, and hederagenin.Conclusion: PRRE exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischaemic injury by inhibiting ferroptosis and activating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. This study provides an experimental basis for the potential application of PRRE as a novel therapeutic drug, and PI3K/Akt-associated ferroptosis and autophagy as therapeutic targets for cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Trace elements generally contaminate wild fish, particularly in megacities, necessitating guided consumption practices. This study investigated the bioaccumulation of trace elements in wild fish from Chongqing City in June 2021. We evaluated their contamination and associated health risks to establish consumption guidance based on fish size. Our results indicate that the concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cr, and As were relatively high, with some fish exceeding the maximum residue limits. Herbivorous and pelagic fish generally exhibited lower bioaccumulation of most trace elements, except for Cr and As, which were higher in pelagic species. The contamination indices (Pi) for Cr, Pb and As were consistently above 0.2, indicating widespread contamination. The most contaminated fish typically measured around 19 cm in length and weighed approximately 90 g. Only the maximum target hazard quotients (THQ) for As, Cr, and Hg exceeded 1, with a notably high ratio of THQ(As) > 1, highlighting concerns over arsenic contamination. The THQ(As) remained below 1 for adults across all fish species, whereas for children, species such as Onychostoma sima, Pseudohemiculter dispar, and Parabramis pekinensis exceeded this threshold. Fish safe for adult consumption generally measured 13 cm in length and weighed 20 g, and for children, 16 cm and 25 g. Consequently, selecting larger fish is likely to reduce the consumption of contaminated fish, thereby decreasing health risks to the public. The centralization of contaminated fish with high risk in specific size range confirmed fish size could be used to gauge the contamination and health risk of fish.

AB  - A pervasive exposure to stressors and the consumption of fructose-containing beverages usually go hand-in-hand in everyday life. In contrast to their metabolic outcomes, their impact on the brain and behavior is still understudied. We examined the behavioral response to a novelty (open field test), the expression of biochemical indicators of neuronal activity (Egr1 and FosB/Delta FosB), the synaptic potentiation (CaMKII alpha and pCaMKIIThr286), the synaptic plasticity (synaptophysin, PSD95, gephyrin, and drebrin), and the GABAergic system (parvalbumin and GAD67), along with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and AMPK, in the medial prefrontal cortex of female Wistar rats subjected to liquid fructose supplementation (F), chronic unpredictable stress (S), or both (SF) over 9 weeks. The only hallmark of the F group was an increased expression of pCaMKIIThr286, which was also observed in the S group, but not in the SF group. The SF group did not show hyperactivity, a decreased expression of FosB, or an increased expression of parvalbumin, as the S group did. The SF group, as with the S group, showed a decreased expression of the GR, although the basal level of corticosterone was unchanged. The SF group showed, as de novo marks, thigmotactic behavior, increased drebrin, and decreased gephyrin expression. These findings suggest that the long-term consumption of fructose, which itself has subtle neurobehavioral consequences, in combination with stress prevents some of its effects, but also contributes to novel outcomes not seen in single treatments.

AB  - Revealing the molecular organization of anatomically precisely defined brain regions is necessary for refined understanding of synaptic plasticity. Although three-dimensional (3D) single-molecule localization microscopy can provide the required resolution, imaging more than a few micrometers deep into tissue remains challenging. To quantify presynaptic active zones (AZ) of entire, large, conditional detonator hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) boutons with diameters as large as 10 mu m, we developed a method for targeted volumetric direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). An optimized protocol for fast repeated axial scanning and efficient sequential labeling of the AZ scaffold Bassoon and membrane bound GFP with Alexa Fluor 647 enabled 3D-dSTORM imaging of 25 mu m thick mouse brain sections and assignment of AZs to specific neuronal substructures. Quantitative data analysis revealed large differences in Bassoon cluster size and density for distinct hippocampal regions with largest clusters in MF boutons. Pauli et al. develop targeted volumetric dSTORM in order to image large hippocampal mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) in brain slices. They can identify synaptic targets of individual MFBs and measured size and density of Bassoon clusters within individual untruncated MFBs at nanoscopic resolution.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: According to the Tang Dynasty classics Dietetic Material Medica and the Ming Dynasty classics Compendium of Materia Medica records, bear bile powder (BBP) has been used to treat a variety of diseases, such as febrile seizures, the pathogenesis of which is associated to neuroinflammation. However, the mechanism of BBP on alleviating neuroinflammation remains unclear. Aims of the study: Microglia can be activated by peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and mechanism of BBP in inhibiting LPS-induced microglia inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: The anti-microglia inflammatory effects and mechanism of BBP were assessed in LPS-treated BV2 microglial cells and in LPS-treated mice. The mRNA expression levels of the inflammatory factor and the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), takeda G-protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), inhibitor of NF-kappa B (I kappa B alpha), protein kinase B (AKT) in BV2 cells, mouse hippocampus and cortex were detected. The NF-kappa B transcription activity and NF-kappa B nuclear translocation were observed. Results: Our findings showed that BBP reduces branched process retraction and NO in LPS-treated BV2 cells, inhibits the protein expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. Moreover, we observed that BBP decreases tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 beta mRNA levels, deceases iNOS and COX-2 protein levels, increases TGR5 protein levels, suppresses the phosphorylation of AKT, NF-kappa B and I kappa B alpha protein in microglia both in vitro and in vivo. Further, we found that triamterene, the inhibitor of TGR5, abolishes the effects of BBP in LPS- treated BV2 cells. Conclusion: BBP inhibits LPS-induced microglia activation, and the mechanism of its action is partly through TGR5/AKT/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Oil seeds now make up the world's second-largest food source after cereals. In recent years, the medicinal- oil plant Camelina sativa has attracted much attention for its high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of saturated fatty acids as well as its resistance to abiotic stresses. Improvement of oil quality is considered an important trait in this plant. Erucic acid is one of the fatty acids affecting the quality of camelina oil. Altering the fatty acid composition in camelina oil through genetic manipulation requires the identification, isolation, and cloning of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. The Fatty Acid Elangase 1 (FAE1) gene encoded the enzyme beta-ketoacyl COA synthase (KCS), which is a key factor in the biosynthesis of erucic acid. In this study, isolation and cloning of the FAE1 from the Camelina sativa were performed to prepare an antisense structure. The fragments were isolated from the DNA source of the genomic Soheil cultivar with an erucic acid content of about 3% (in matured seeds) using PCR. After cloning FAE1 into the Bluescriprt II SK+ vector and sequencing, these fragments were used for the preparation of antisense structure in the pBI121 plant expression vector. The approved structure was transferred to the camelina plant via the Agrobacterium-mediated method. Also, the conditions of tissue culture and gene transfer were optimized. Moreover, the erucic acid content of the immature seeds of T0 transgenic plants was analyzed with gas chromatography (GC). Results showed significant changes in erucic acid levels of two control plants (0.88%), while two lines of the RFAE1 transgenic plants showed a decrease of approximately 0% in erucic acid level. It can be concluded that the antisense structure can be effective in reducing erucic acid.

AB  - Golden Gate assembly (GGA) can seamlessly generate full-length genes from DNA fragments. In principle, GGA could be used to design combinatorial mutation libraries for protein engineering, but creating accurate, complex, and cost-effective libraries has been challenging. We present GGAssembler, a graph-theoretical method for economical design of DNA fragments that assemble a combinatorial library that encodes any desired diversity. We used GGAssembler for one-pot in vitro assembly of camelid antibody libraries comprising >105 variants with DNA costs <0.007$ per variant and dropping significantly with increased library complexity. >93% of the desired variants were present in the assembly product and >99% were represented within the expected order of magnitude as verified by deep sequencing. The GGAssembler workflow is, therefore, an accurate approach for generating complex variant libraries that may drastically reduce costs and accelerate discovery and optimization of antibodies, enzymes and other proteins. The workflow is accessible through a Google Colab notebook at .

AB  - Evidence indicates that anxiety disorders arise from an imbalance in the functioning of brain circuits that govern the modulation of emotional responses to possibly threatening stimuli. The circuits under consideration in this context include the amygdala's bottom -up activity, which signifies the existence of stimuli that may be seen as dangerous. Moreover, these circuits encompass top -down regulatory processes that originate in the prefrontal cortex, facilitating the communication of the emotional significance associated with the inputs. Diverse databases ( e.g. , Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar) were searched for literature using a combination of different terms e.g. , "anxiety", "stress", "neuroanatomy", and "neural circuits", etc. A decrease in GABAergic activity is present in both anxiety disorders and severe depression. Research on cerebral functional imaging in depressive individuals has shown reduced levels of GABA within the cortical regions. Additionally, animal studies demonstrated that a reduction in the expression of GABA A/B receptors results in a behavioral pattern resembling anxiety. The amygdala consists of inhibitory networks composed of GABAergic interneurons, responsible for modulating anxiety responses in both normal and pathological conditions. The GABA A receptor has allosteric sites ( e.g. , alpha / gamma , gamma / beta , and alpha / beta ) which enable regulation of neuronal inhibition in the amygdala. These sites serve as molecular targets for anxiolytic medications such as benzodiazepine and barbiturates. Alterations in the levels of naturally occurring regulators of these allosteric sites, along with alterations to the composition of the GABA A receptor subunits, could potentially act as mechanisms via which the extent of neuronal inhibition is diminished in pathological anxiety disorders.

AB  - Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a syndromic disorder presenting with seizures and cognitive comorbidities. Although seizure etiology is increasingly understood, the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to cognitive decline and epilepsy progression remain less recognized. We have previously shown that adult hippocampal neurogenesis dramatically declines in MTLE patients with increased disease duration. Here, we investigate when multiple cognitive domains become affected during epilepsy progression and how human neurogenesis levels contribute to it. We find that intelligence, verbal learning, and memory decline at a critical period of 20 years disease duration. In contrast to rodents, the number of human immature neurons positively associates with auditory verbal, rather than visuospatial, learning and memory. Moreover, this association does not apply to mature granule neurons. Our study provides cellular evidence of how adult neurogenesis corresponds with human cognition and signifies an opportunity to advance regenerative medicine for patients with MTLE and other cognitive disorders.

AB  - Background: Blueberry anthocyanin extract (BAE) is a natural antioxidant flavonoid found in blueberries that has the potential to alleviate oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of BAE to mitigate arsenic-induced cognitive impairment; however, the underlying protective mechanisms remain elusive. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BAE in reducing arsenic-induced cognitive impairment and explored whether BAE's neuroprotective effects are related to its antioxidant and mitochondrial protective effects. Methods: Sixty male rats were exposed to sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, 10 mg/kg) with or without BAE (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM). Neuronal damage in rat hippocampi was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, electron microscopy, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining. Oxidative stress markers, including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were measured. Mitochondrial function was assessed by analysing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial dynamics. Results: Arsenic exposure significantly impaired learning and memory in rats, as evidenced by reduced performance in the MWM, whereas BAE treatment ameliorated these deficits. Furthermore, BAE alleviated arsenic-induced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, as well as alleviating increased oxidative stress, weakened antioxidant capacity, and imbalanced mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. In this study, we focused on the core of mitochondrial quality control mechanism-mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion and fission. We explored the protective mechanism of BAE against arsenic-induced nerve damage. Based on these, we proposed an innovative therapeutic strategy: using natural products to target and regulate mitochondrial quality control. Conclusion: This study indicated that BAE alleviates arsenic-induced neurotoxicity through its antioxidant and mitochondrial protective effects, effectively reducing arsenic-induced neurotoxicity and enhancing cognitive function.

AB  - Aging is associated with a decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function, which is critical for maintaining synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Activation of the NMDA receptor requires binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate and also the presence of co-agonist D-serine at the glycine site. The enzymatic conversion of L-serine to D-serine is facilitated by the enzyme serine racemase (SR). Subsequently, SR plays a pivotal role in regulating NMDA receptor activity, thereby impacting synaptic plasticity and memory processes in the central nervous system. As such, age-related changes in the expression of SR could contribute to decreased NMDA receptor function. However, age-associated changes in SR expression levels in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (mPFC, lPFC), and in the dorsal hippocampal subfields, CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG), have not been thoroughly elucidated. Therefore, the current studies were designed to determine the SR expression profile, including protein levels and mRNA, for these regions in aged and young male and female Fischer-344 rats. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in SR expression levels in the mPFC and all hippocampal subfields of aged rats compared to young rats. No sex differences were observed in the expression of SR. These findings suggest that the decrease in SR levels may play a role in the age-associated reduction of NMDA receptor function in brain regions crucial for cognitive function and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Background & aims: Liver fibrosis characterizes advanced chronic liver disease, and persistent activation of he-patic stellate cells (HSCs) is the primary cause of excessive hepatic fibrogenesis. CWHM12, an analog of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) amino acid sequence found in specific integrins, improves liver fibrosis; however, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify the cell signaling mechanisms of CWHM12 in activated HSCs.Methods: Immortalized human HSC lines, LX-2 and TWNT-1, were used to evaluate the effects of CWHM12 on intracellular signaling via the disruption of RGD-binding integrins.Results: CWHM12 strongly promoted phosphorylation and inhibited the nuclear accumulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), which is a critical effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of prolif-eration, suppression of viability, promotion of apoptosis, and induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in activated HSCs. Further investigations revealed that inhibition of TGF-beta was involved in the consequences of CWHM12. Moreover, CWHM12 suppressed focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation; consequently, Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, and serine-threonine kinase phosphorylation led to the translocation of YAP. These favorable effects of CWHM12 on activated HSCs were reversed by inhibiting FAK.Conclusions: These results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of RGD-binding integrins suppresses activated HSCs by blocking the Hippo signaling pathway, a cellular response which may be valuable in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.

AB  - Sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are critical to hippocampal function, and the same is true of gonadal steroids, but the interactions are unclear. We find that surgical removal of the gonads greatly reduces SPW rates in both sexes. Ripples are greatly reduced also. Testosterone treatment rescues SPW and ripple rates in males, and 17 beta-estradiol restores SPW rates in females. We also find that male SPW rates are higher than females but have less power. Furthermore, in intact females, SPW rates fluctuate with the stage of the ovarian cycle. These data demonstrate that hippocampal SPWs are significantly affected by gonadal removal, testosterone, and 17 beta-estradiol. In addition, there are sex differences. The data are consistent with past demonstrations that testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol play central roles in hippocampus and significantly expand the views of hormone action and SPW-Rs.

AB  - Rat offspring who are exposed to an amorphous formula of curcumin (CUR) from the embryonic stage have antianxiety-like behaviors, enhanced fear extinction learning, and increased synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In the present study, we investigated the links between genes with altered methylation status in the neurogenic niche and enhanced neural functions after CUR exposure. We conducted methylation and RNA sequencing analyses of the DG of CUR-exposed rat offspring on day 77 after delivery. Methylation status and transcript levels of candidate genes were validated using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting and realtime reverse-transcription PCR, respectively. In the CUR group, we confirmed the hypermethylation and downregulation of Gpr150, Mmp23, Rprml, and Pcdh8 as well as the hypomethylation and upregulation of Ppm1j, Fam222a, and Opn3. Immunohistochemically, reprimo-like+ hilar cells and protocadherin-8+ granule cells were decreased and opsin-3+ hilar cells were increased by CUR exposure. Both reprimo-like and opsin-3 were partially expressed on subpopulations of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67+ gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic interneurons. Furthermore, the transcript levels of genes involved in protocadherin-8-mediated N-cadherin endocytosis were altered with CUR exposure; this was accompanied by Ctnnb1 and Syp upregulation and Mapk14, Map2k3, and Grip1 downregulation, suggesting that CUR-induced enhanced synaptic plasticity is associated with cell adhesion. Together, our results indicate that functionally different genes have altered methylation and expression in different neuronal populations of the hippocampal neurogenic niche, thus enhancing synaptic plasticity after CUR exposure.

AB  - In medicine, C-reactive protein (CRP) has become established primarily as a biomarker, predicting patient prognosis in many indications. Recently, however, there has been mounting evidence that it causes inflammatory injury. As early as 1999, CRP was shown to induce cell death after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in rats and this was found to be dependent on complement. The pathological effect of CRP was subsequently confirmed in further animal species such as rabbit, mouse and pig. A conceptual gap was recently closed when it was demonstrated that ischemia in AMI or ischemia/hypoxia in the severe course of COVID-19 causes a drastic lack of energy in involved cells, resulting in an apoptotic presentation because these cells cannot repair/flip-flop altered lipids. The deprivation of energy leads to extensive expression on the cell membranes of the CRP ligand lysophosphatidylcholine. Upon attachment of CRP to this ligand, the classical complement pathway is triggered leading to the swift elimination of viable cells with the appearance of an apoptotic cell by phagocytes. They are being eaten alive. This, consequently, results in substantial fibrotic remodeling within the involved tissue. Inhibiting this pathomechanism via CRP-targeting therapy has been shown to be beneficial in different indications.

AB  - Actin cytoskeleton dynamics are essential regulatory processes in muscle development, growth, and regeneration due to their modulation of mechanotransduction, cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphological changes. Although the KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (Kank1) plays a significant role in cell adhesion dynamics, actin polymerization, and cell proliferation in various cells, the functional significance of Kank1 during the myogenic differentiation of progenitor cells has not been explored. Here, we report that Kank1 acts as a critical regulator of the proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. Kank1 was found to be expressed at a relatively high level in C2C12 myoblasts, and its expression was modulated during the differentiation. Depletion of Kank1 by siRNA (siKank1) increased the accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin). Furthermore, it facilitated the nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) by diminishing YAP1 phosphorylation in the cytoplasm, which activated the transcriptions of YAP1 target genes and promoted proliferation and cell cycle progression in myoblasts. Notably, depletion of Kank1 suppressed the protein expression of myogenic regulatory factors (i.e., MyoD and MyoG) and dramatically inhibited myoblast differentiation and myotube formation. Our results show that Kank1 is an essential regulator of actin dynamics, YAP1 activation, and cell proliferation and that its depletion impairs the myogenic differentiation of progenitor cells by promoting myoblast proliferation triggered by the F-actin-induced nuclear translocation of YAP1.

AB  - Mood alterations, anxiety, and cognitive impairments associated with adult-onset hypothyroidism often persist despite replacement treatment. In rodent models of hypothyroidism, replacement does not bring 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) brain levels back to normal. T(1)AM is a thyroid hormone derivative with cognitive effects. Using a pharmacological hypothyroid mouse model, we investigated whether augmenting levothyroxine (L-T-4) with T(1)AM improves behavioural correlates of depression, anxiety, and memory and has an effect on hippocampal neurogenesis. Hypothyroid mice showed impaired performance in the novel object recognition test as compared to euthyroid mice (discrimination index (DI): 0.02 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.06; t = 2.515, p = 0.02). L-T-4 and L-T-4+T(1)AM rescued memory (DI: 0.27 +/- 0.08 and 0.34 +/- 0.08, respectively), while T1AM had no effect (DI: 0.01 +/- 0.10). Hypothyroidism reduced the number of neuroprogenitors in hippocampal neurogenic niches by 20%. L-T-4 rescued the number of neuroprogenitors (mean diff = 106.9 +/- 21.40, t = 4.99, p(corr) = 0.003), while L-T-4+T(1)AM produced a 30.61% rebound relative to euthyroid state (mean diff = 141.6 +/- 31.91, t = 4.44, p(corr) = 0.004). We performed qPCR analysis of 88 genes involved in neurotrophic signalling pathways and found an effect of treatment on the expression of Ngf, Kdr, Kit, L1cam, Ntf3, Mapk3, and Neurog2. Our data confirm that L-T-4 is necessary and sufficient for recovering memory and hippocampal neurogenesis deficits associated with hypothyroidism, while we found no evidence to support the role of non-canonical TH signalling.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Artemisia annua L. (Asteraceae) has been used as an antipyretic and anti-parasitic drug in traditional medicine for more than 2000 years. It has also been prescribed to treat symptoms caused by deficiency of Yin, which might be observed in menopausal state from the point of view of traditional medicine. Aim of the study: We hypothesized that A. annua might be useful for treating menopausal disorders with less adverse effects than hormone replacement therapy. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate effects of A. annua on postmenopausal symptoms of ovariectomized (OVX) mice.Materials and methods: OVX mice were employed as a model for postmenopausal disorders. Mice were treated with a water extract of A. annua (EAA; 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg, p.o.) or 170-estradiol (E2; 0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) for 8 weeks. Open field test (OFT), novel object recognition task (NOR), Y-maze test, elevated plus maze test (EPM), splash test and tail suspension test (TST) were conducted to determine whether EAA could ameliorate postmenopausal symptoms. Phosphorylated levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-30 (GSK-30), 0-catenin and expression level of synaptophysin in the cortex and hippocampus were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Results: EAA treatment significantly increased the discrimination index in NOR, decreased the time in closed arm than in open arm in EPM, increased grooming time in splash test, and decreased immobility time in TST, as did E2 treatment. In addition, decreased phosphorylation levels of ERK, Akt, GSK-30, and 0-catenin and expression levels of synaptophysin in the cortex and hippocampus after OVX were reversed by administration of EAA and E2.Conclusion: These results suggest that A. annua can ameliorate postmenopausal symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, anhedonia, and depression by activating ERK, Akt, and GSK-30/0-catenin signaling pathway and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and that A. annua would be a novel treatment for postmenopausal symptoms.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: SuanZaoRen Decoction (SZRD), a famous herbal prescription, and has been widely proven to have positive therapeutic effects on insomnia, depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the anti-AD molecular mechanism of SZRD remains to be further investigated. Aim of the study: To elucidate the molecular mechanism of SZRD's improvement in AD's neuronal loss, synaptic damage and ferroptosis by regulating DJ-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Materials and methods: LC-MS/MS was used to detect the active ingredients from SZRD. APP/PS1 mice was treated with SZRD and a ferroptosis inhibitor (Liproxstatin-1), respectively. Upon the completion of behavioral tests, Nissl staining, FJB staining, Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy were preformed to evaluate the effects of SZRD on neuronal loss, synaptic damage, A beta deposition. Iron staining, transmission electron microscopy, and iron assay kit was performed to estimate the effects of SZRD on ferroptosis. SOD kit, MDA kit, GSH kit, and GSH/GSSG kit were utilized to measure the oxidative stress levels in the hippocampus. The protein expression of TfR1, FTH1, FTL, FPN1, DJ-1, Nrf2, GPX4, SLC7A11, and ACSL4 were detected by Western blot. Results: A total of 16 active ingredients were identified from SZRD extract. SZRD SZRD significantly alleviated learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. SZRD improved the hippocampal neuronal loss and degenerated neurons in APP/PS1 mice via inhibiting the A beta deposit. SZRD mitigated the hippocampal synaptic damage in APP/PS1 mice. SZRD inhibited iron accumulation, and alleviated the oxidative stress level in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Meanwhile, SZRD could up-regulate the protein expression level of FPN1, DJ-1, Nrf2, GPX4 and SLC7A11 in the hippocampus, and inhibit TfR1, FTH1, FTL, and ACSL4 protein expression. Conclusion: SZRD alleviated neuronal loss, synaptic damage and ferroptosis in AD via activating DJ-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

AB  - Colon cancer is a prevalent malignancy, while recent studies revealed the dys-regulation of Hippo signaling as the important driver for colon cancer progression. Several studies have indicated that post-translational modifications on YAP play crucial roles in both Hippo signaling activity and cancer progression. This raises a puzzling question about why YAP/TAZ, an auto-inhibitory pathway, is frequently over-activated in colon cancer, despite the suppressive cascade of Hippo signaling remaining operational. The protein stability of YAP is subject to a tiny balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes. Through correlation analysis of DUBs (deubiquitinases) expression and Hippo target gene signature in colon cancer samples, we found JOSD1 as a critical deubiquitinase for Hippo signaling and colon cancer progression. JOSD1 could facilitate colon cancer progression and in colon cancer, inhibition of JOSD1 via shRNA has been demonstrated to impede tumorigenesis. Furthermore, molecular mechanism studies have elucidated that JOSD1 enhances the formation of the Hippo/YAP transcriptome by impeding K48-linked polyubiquitination on YAP. ChIP assays have shown that YAP binds to JOSD1's promoter region, promoting its gene transcription. These results suggest that JOSD1 is involved in both activating and being targeted by the Hippo signaling pathway in colon cancer. Consequently, a positive regulatory loop between JOSD1 and Hippo signaling has been identified, underscoring their interdependence during colon cancer progression. Thus, targeting JOSD1 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing colon cancer.

AB  - Lead (Pb) poses a potential environmental risk factor for cognitive dysfunction during early life and childhood. Resveratrol is considered a promising antioxidant with respect to the prevention of cognitive deficits and act as a potent SIRT1 agonist. Here in, this study aims to investigate the profile of neurogenesis markers following Pb exposure and to determine the regulatory role of resveratrol in this process. We confirmed firstly the protective effects of resveratrol against Pb-induced impairments of hippocampal neurogenesis in Male SD rats. Pb exposure early in life caused the altered expression of Ki-67, NeuN, caspase-3 and SIRT1signaling, thereby resulting in spatial cognitive impairment of adolescent rats. As expected, resveratrol reduced cognitive damage and promoted neurogenesis in Pb-induced injury by regulation of SIRT1 pathway. Collectively, our study establishes the efficacy of resveratrol as a neuroprotective agent and providesa strong rationale for further studies on SIRT1-mediated mechanisms of neuroprotective functions.

AB  - To identify the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in the extracellular matrix degradation of chondrocytes induced by fluoride exposure. Environmental response genes (ERGs) of bone injury induced by fluoride exposure were obtained from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, and annotated by STRING for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The CCK-8 kit was used to measure the proliferation of ATDC5 cells. The malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) levels in ATDC5 cells were measured using oxidative stress detection kit. Western blot analysis was used to measure the p-MST1/2, p-LATS1/2, and p-YAP/YAP1 expression levels in the Hippo pathway and the COL2A1, ACAN and MMP13 expression levels in the cartilage matrix. Localizations of YAP1 and COL2A1 proteins in chondrocytes were performed using cell immunofluorescence. Continuous data from the multiple groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance, and then the differences between groups were tested with Dunnett's t-test, with the test level alpha = 0.05. The 145 ERGs of bone injury induced by fluoride exposure were identified, and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed Hippo signaling pathways significantly related to bone injury. A CCK-8 assay revealed that the viability of the ATDC5 cells was significantly decreased with increased fluorine concentration. The MDA content in 20 mg/L sodium fluoride (NaF) exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group, the T-SOD, T-AOC and GSH-PX activities in 15 and 20 mg/L NaF exposure groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Western blot results showed the protein levels of pMST1/2, p-LATS1/2 and p-YAP1 in 15 and 20 mg/L NaF exposure groups were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the YAP1 protein level in 20 mg/L NaF group was significantly higher than that in the control group. The COL2A1 and ACAN proteins in 20 mg/L NaF group were significantly decreased, while the MMP13 protein level in 15 and 20 mg/L NaF groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05). It was observed that the expression of YAP1 protein expression level in the cytoplasm decreased with the increased fluoride exposure, whereas that the expression level of YAP1 protein in the nucleus increased. Fluoride inhibited the proliferation of ATDC5 cells, induced oxidative stress, inhibited the activity of the Hippo pathway, and eventually led to cartilage matrix degradation.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is a feature in multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder. A notable aspect of MS brains is hippocampal demyelination, which is closely associated with cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Chitinase-3-like (CHI3L1), secreted by activated astrocytes, has been identified as a biomarker for MS progression. Our study investigates CHI3L1's function within the demyelinating hippocampus and demonstrates a correlation between CHI3L1 expression and cognitive impairment in patients with MS. Activated astrocytes release CHI3L1 in reaction to induced demyelination, which adversely affects the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells and impairs dendritic growth, complexity, and spine formation in neurons. Our findings indicate that the astrocytic deletion of CHI3L1 can mitigate neurogenic deficits and cognitive dysfunction. We showed that CHI3L1 interacts with CRTH2/receptor for advanced glycation end (RAGE) by attenuating 0-catenin signaling. The reactivation of 0-catenin signaling can revitalize neurogenesis, which holds promise for therapy of inflammatory demyelination.

AB  - In view of the current situation of low visibility at night and increasing poaching activities in wildlife reserves, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring equipped with thermal infrared (TIR) cameras has become a trend. To overcome the difficulties of small objects and low resolution in infrared images, this letter proposes a nonsalient object detection algorithm in infrared images based on deep learning. Based on Grid R-CNN, we designed a feature extraction network, improved the region proposal network by guided anchoring (GA-RPN), and introduced the slice inference mechanism. Our method makes the network selectively fuse multiscale features to generate high-quality proposals and improve detection accuracy.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Woohwangchungsimwon (WCW) is a traditional medicine used in East Asian countries to treat central nervous system disorders. Reported pharmacological properties include antioxidant effects, enhanced learning and memory, and protection against ischemic neuronal cell death, supporting its use in treating neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aim of the study: The study aims to assess the effects of co-treatment with WCW and donepezil on cognitive functions and serum metabolic profiles in a scopolamine-induced AD model. Materials and methods: Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured in amyloid beta-peptide25-35 (A beta 25-35)-induced SH-SY5Y cells. An AD model was established in ICR mice by intraperitoneal scopolamine administration. Animals underwent the step-through passive avoidance test (PAT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Hippocampal tissues were collected to examine specific protein expression. Serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results: Co-treatment with WCW and donepezil increased cell viability and reduced ROS production in A beta 25-35- induced SH-SY5Y cells compared to that with donepezil treatment alone. Co-treatment improved cognitive functions and was comparable to donepezil treatment alone in the PAT and MWM tests. Pathways related to tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and cysteine and methionine metabolism were altered by co-treatment. Levels of tyrosine and methionine, major serum metabolites in these pathways, were significantly reduced after co-treatment. Conclusions: Co-treatment with WCW and donepezil shows promise as a therapeutic strategy for AD and is comparable to donepezil alone in improving cognitive function. Reduced tyrosine and methionine levels after co-treatment may enhance cognitive function by mitigating hypertyrosinemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, known risk factors for AD. The serum metabolic profiles obtained in this study can serve as a foundation for developing other bioactive compounds using a scopolamine-induced mouse model.

AB  - In the current study, for the first time, we study mitophagy enhancer urolithin A and a combination of urolithin A+green tea extract EGCG against human A beta peptide-induced mitochondrial and synaptic, dendritic, inflammatory toxicities and behavioral changes in humanized homozygous amyloid beta knockin (hAbKI) mice of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our findings reveal significantly increased positive effects of urolithin A and a combination treatment of urolithin A+EGCG in hAbKI mice for phenotypic behavioral changes including motor coordination, locomotion/exploratory activity, spatial learning and working memory. mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial fusion, synaptic, mitophagy and autophagy genes were upregulated, and mitochondrial fission genes are downregulated in urolithin A and combine treatment in hAbKI mice; however, the effect is stronger in combined treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis of hippocampal brain sections shows similar findings of mRNA and protein levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction is significantly reduced in both treatment groups, but a stronger reduction is observed in combined treatment. Dendritic spines and lengths are significantly increased in both treatment groups, but the effect is stronger in combined treatment. The fragmented number of mitochondria is reduced, and mitochondrial length is increased, and mitophagosomal formations are increased in both the groups, but the effect is stronger in the combined treatment. The levels of amyloid beta (A beta) 40 and A beta 42 are reduced in both treatments, however, the reduction is higher for combined treatment. These observations suggest that urolithin A is protective against human A beta peptide-induced toxicities; however, combined treatment of urolithin A+EGCG is effective and stronger, indicating that combined therapy is promising to treat late-onset AD patients.

AB  - Arsenic (sodium arsenite: NaAsO2) is a potent carcinogen and a known risk factor for the onset of bladder carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms that govern arsenic-induced bladder carcinogenesis remain unclear. We used a physiological concentration of NaAsO2 (250 nM: 33 mu g/L) for the malignant transformation of normal bladder epithelial cells (TRT-HU1), exposed for over 12 months. The increased proliferation and colony-forming abilities of arsenic-exposed cells were seen after arsenic exposure from 4 months onwards. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis revealed that a total of 1558 and 1943 (padj < 0.05) genes were deregulated in 6-month and 12-month arsenic-exposed TRT-HU1 cells. The gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that cell proliferation and survival pathways, such as the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and Hippo signaling pathways, were significantly altered. Pathway analysis revealed that the enrichment of stem cell activators such as ALDH1A1, HNF1b, MAL, NR1H4, and CDH1 (p < 0.001) was significantly induced during the transformation compared to respective vehicle controls. Further, these results were validated by qPCR analysis, which corroborated the transcriptomic analysis. Overall, the results suggested that stem cell activators may play a significant role in facilitating the arsenic-exposed cells to gain a survival advantage, enabling the healthy epithelial cells to reprogram into a cancer stem cell phenotype, leading to malignant transformation.

AB  - Background: Cerebral ischemia stroke (CIS) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurological disorder characterized by high mortality rate and longterm cognitive deficits. Puerarin (Pue) exhibits neuroprotective properties against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury. Methods: The DNA demethylation-mediated neuroprotective effects of Pue were investigated in vivo using TTC staining, H&E staining, and TUNEL assays. In vitro, cell viability assays, DCFH-DA staining, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and JC-1 staining were employed to examine the alleviation of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Molecular docking and microscale thermophoresis (MST) were employed to analyze Pue's binding affinity to DNA methyltransferases 3A and 3B (DNMT3A/B). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) profiling identified Pue/DNMTs-regulated target genes, and dual-Luciferase reporter assay measured promoter activity of PI3K. The function of the PI3K/Akt pathway in CIR injury was verified using pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown. Results: Our findings demonstrate that Pue exerts neuroprotection against CIR injury by attenuating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction through DNA demethylation. Mechanistically, Pue directly binds to DNMT3A/B, inhibiting their enzymatic activity and reducing global 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels. Both knockdown of DNMT3A/B and pharmacological DNMT inhibition (SGI-1027) mimicked Pue's protective effects in OGD/R HT22 cells tMCAO rats. Integrated WGBS and RNA-seq analyses revealed that Pue treatment induced promoter demethylation and transcriptional upregulation of PI3K in hippocampi from tMCAO rats. Disruption of PI3K/Akt signaling, either with the pharmacological inhibitor (LY294002) or silencing PI3K, negated Puemediated neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Pue inhibits DNMT3A/B activation, leading to demethylation of the PI3K promoter and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, which mitigates CIR-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. This study elucidates a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying Pue's neuroprotective effects and highlights its therapeutic potential for ischemic stroke treatment.

AB  - This study was aimed to explore the expression and mechanism of the transcription factor YAP-TEAD in the Hippo signaling pathway under the regulation of non-coding Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) LINC00857 in the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, so as to provide a scientific research basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. In the study, the ovarian cancer cell lines (BT 549) were rolled into a control group (normal culture-defined as BT549/NC) and a response group (transfected with non-coding RNA LINC00857 cultured cells-defined as BT 549YAP cells). The expression and proliferation ability of the transcription factor YAP-TEAD in the two groups of cancer cells were analyzed and compared. The results showed that the YAP-TEAD expression rate was the highest in Bt549 cells; the YAP content grade (0.18) in BT 549-YAP cells was lower than BT 549/NC (0.2) after transfection (P< 0.05); and the apoptotic rate of the response group (80%) was higher than that of the control group (25%) after the intervention. With the extension of culture time, the expression of CCN1 mRNA decreased (P< 0.05), and CCN2 mRNA increased (P< 0.05). After 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours, the apoptosis rate of the reaction group at different time points was higher than that of the control group (P< 0.01). When YAP-TEAD was down-regulated, the in vitro proliferation ability of BT 549 YAP cells was weakened compared with BT 549/NC and parental cells. It was concluded that the non coding RNA LINC00857 can target the transcription factor YAP-TEAD in the Hippo signaling pathway to decrease its expression, thus inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, and promoting cell apoptosis.

AB  - Dysregulation of development, migration, and function of interneurons, collectively termed interneuronopathies, have been proposed as a shared mechanism for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and childhood epilepsy. Neuropilin-2 (Nrp2), a candidate ASD gene, is a critical regulator of interneuron migration from the median ganglionic eminence (MGE) to the pallium, including the hippocampus. While clinical studies have identified Nrp2 polymorphisms in patients with ASD, whether selective dysregulation of Nrp2-dependent interneuron migration contributes to pathogenesis of ASD and enhances the risk for seizures has not been evaluated. We tested the hypothesis that the lack of Nrp2 in MGE-derived interneuron precursors disrupts the excitation/inhibition balance in hippocampal circuits, thus predisposing the network to seizures and behavioral patterns associated with ASD. Embryonic deletion of Nrp2 during the developmental period for migration of MGE derived interneuron precursors (iCKO) significantly reduced parvalbumin, neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1. Consequently, when compared to controls, the frequency of inhibitory synaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal cells was reduced while frequency of excitatory synaptic currents was increased in iCKO mice. Although passive and active membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal cells were unchanged, iCKO mice showed enhanced susceptibility to chemically evoked seizures. Moreover, iCKO mice exhibited selective behavioral deficits in both preference for social novelty and goal-directed learning, which are consistent with ASD-like phenotype. Together, our findings show that disruption of developmental Nrp2 regulation of interneuron circuit establishment, produces ASD-like behaviors and enhanced risk for epilepsy. These results support the developmental interneuronopathy hypothesis of ASD epilepsy comorbidity.

AB  - IntroductionHypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) can be a challenging clinical problem. It is not fully elucidated where in the circulation the regulation of resistance takes place. It is often referred to as if it is in the arteries, but we hypothesized that it is in the venous side of the pulmonary circulation.MethodsIn an open thorax model, pigs were treated with a veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenator to either oxygenate or deoxygenate blood passing through the pulmonary vessels. At the same time the lungs were ventilated with extreme variations of inspired air from 5% to 100% oxygen, making it possible to make combinations of high and low oxygen content through the pulmonary circulation. A flow probe was inserted around the main pulmonary artery and catheters in the pulmonary artery and in the left atrium were used for pressure monitoring and blood tests. Under different combinations of oxygenation, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated.ResultsWith unchanged level of oxygen in the pulmonary artery and reduced inspired oxygen fraction lowering oxygen tension from 29 to 6.7 kPa in the pulmonary vein, PVR was doubled. With more extreme hypoxia PVR suddenly decreased. Combinations with low oxygenation in the pulmonary artery did not systematic influence PVR if there was enough oxygen in the inspired air and in the pulmonary veins.DiscussionThe impact of hypoxia occurs from the alveolar level and forward with the blood flow. The experiments indicated that the regulation of PVR is mediated from the venous side.
   A ventilator and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) are used for improving oxygenation in the daily clinic, but experimentally they can be used to remove oxygen.image

AB  - Cerebral ischemia is a major health risk that requires preventive approaches in addition to drug therapy. Physical exercise enhances neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, and has been widely used for functional rehabilitation after stroke. In this study, we determined whether exercise training before disease onset can alleviate the severity of cerebral ischemia. We also examined the role of exercise-induced circulating factors in these effects. Adult mice were subjected to 14 days of treadmill exercise training before surgery for middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found that this exercise pre-conditioning strategy effectively attenuated brain infarct area, inhibited gliogenesis, protected synaptic proteins, and improved novel object and spatial memory function. Further analysis showed that circulating adiponectin plays a critical role in these preventive effects of exercise. Agonist activation of adiponectin receptors by AdipoRon mimicked the effects of exercise, while inhibiting receptor activation abolished the exercise effects. In summary, our results suggest a crucial role of circulating adiponectin in the effects of exercise pre-conditioning in protecting against cerebral ischemia and supporting the health benefits of exercise.

AB  - Objective 1,2-Diacetylbenzene (DAB) induces cognitive and motor deficits, which are the most common symptoms of cancer (e.g., glioma), and gene expression plays an important regulatory role during the progression of memory and motor deficits. We aimed to assess the expression patterns and molecular activities of miRNAs in rats exposed to DAB.
   Methods We compared miRNA expressions in the hippocampal tissues of DAB-treated young and old rats with those in treatment-naive young or old controls as well as BV2 microglial cells and C6 cells to provide functional evidence of miRNA differences in young and old rats and to access molecular processes. miRNA expression profiles were obtained by microarray analysis and were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Gene ontology, KEGG enrichment analyses, and MIENTURNET were performed on genes targeted by miRNAs.
   Results Twelve miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (8 upregulated and 4 downregulated) in young DABtreated rats versus non-treated young rats, while 10 miRNAs (7 upregulated and 3 downregulated) were differentially expressed in old DAB-treated rats versus non-treated old rats. Expressions of miR-200a-3p, miR- 200b-3p, and miR-429 were significantly higher in young DAB-treated rats than in non-treated young rats, and those of miR-196a-5p and miR224-5p were significantly higher in old DAB-treated rats than in non-treated old rats (p < 0.001). rno-miR-200a- 3p, rnomiR-200b-3p, rno-miR- 200c- 3p & rno-miR-141-3p were involved in glioma-related genes (Zeb1 and 2). Furthermore, the expression levels of these miRNAs were significantly increased in C6 cells treated with DAB compared with non-treated C6 and BV2 microglial cells. In silico analyses showed that these miRNAs are associated with glioma-related pathways. Elevated miR-200a family and miR-196a expressions may play an important role in the development of glioma-induced memory and motor deficits.
   Conclusions Further work is needed to confirm whether this dose of DAB would eventually induce gliomas near the hippocampus and might manifest cognitive and motor deficits.

TI  - Identification of Neurensin-2 as a novel modulator of emotional behavior
T2  - MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
LA  - English
AB  - Among the hallmarks of major depressive disorders (MDD) are molecular, functional, and morphological impairments in the hippocampus. Recent studies suggested a key role for hippocampal GABAergic interneurons both in depression and in the response to its treatments. These interneurons highly express the chromatin-remodeler SMARCA3 which mediates the response to chronic antidepressants in an unknown mechanism. Using cell-type-specific molecular and physiological approaches, we report that SMARCA3 mediates the glutamatergic signaling in interneurons by repressing the expression of the neuronal protein, Neurensin-2. This vesicular protein associates with endosomes and postsynaptic proteins and is highly and selectively expressed in subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons. Upregulation of Neurensin-2 in the hippocampus either by stress, viral overexpression, or by SMARCA3 deletion, results in depressive-like behaviors. In contrast, the deletion of Neurensin-2 confers resilience to stress and induces AMPA receptor localization to synapses. This pathway which bidirectionally affects emotional behavior could be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders, and suggests novel therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with dysregulated immune and inflammatory responses. Emerging evidence indicates that peripheral immune activation is linked to neuroinflammation and AD pathogenesis. The present study focuses on determining the role of IL-21 in the pathogenesis of AD using human samples and the 5xFAD mice model. We find that the levels of IL-21 are increased in the periphery of both humans and mice in AD. In addition, the proportions of IL-21 target cells, Tfh and B plasma cells as well as activation of monocytes is increased in PBMCs from AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects as compared to age-matched controls, indicating immune activation. In contrast, the percentage of B1 cells that control inflammation is decreased. These changes are due to IL-21 as the expression of IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) is higher on all these cells in AD. Furthermore, treatment with recombinant IL-21 in AD mice also leads to similar alterations in Tfh, B, B1, and macrophages. The effect of IL-21 is not confined to the periphery since increased expression of IL-21R is also observed in both humans and mice hippocampus derived from the AD brains. In addition, mice injected with IL-21 display increased deposition of amyloid beta (A beta) plaques in the brain which is reduced following anti-IL-21R antibody that blocks the IL-21 signaling. Moreover, activation of microglia was enhanced in IL-21-injected mice. In keeping with enhanced microglial activation, we also observed increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-18 and IL-6 in IL-21-injected mice. The microglial activation and cytokines were both inhibited following IL-21R blockage. Altogether, IL-21 escalates AD pathology by enhancing peripheral and brain immune and inflammatory responses leading to increased A beta plaque deposition.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc., is a valuable herb commonly used in Chinese medicine clinics. Loganin is a major iridoid glycoside obtained from the traditional Chinese herb Corni Fructus. Loganin, which has been shown to improve depression-like behavior in mice exposed to acute stress, is probably a potential antidepressant candidate. Aim of the study: Loganin was evaluated for its effect on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depressive-like mice, and its action mechanisms were explored. Materials and methods: ICR mice were subjected to the CUMS stimulation method to induce depression. The therapeutic effect of loganin on depressive-like behavior was evaluated by a series of behavioral tests such as sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and open-field test (OFT). In addition, the serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) were measured using ELISA. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters were detected by high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were measured using western blot analysis. Results: The results showed that CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors in mice, as indicated by behavioral tests. Administration of loganin increased the sucrose preference in SPT, as well as decreased the immobility time in FST and TST. Loganin could also improve food intake, and increased crossing times in the OFT. In mechanism, loganin restored the secretion of monoamine neurotransmitters, ACTH and CORT to normal levels. In addition, loganin elevated the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. In conclusion, loganin exerts antidepressant-like effects in CUMS model mice through modulating monoamine neurotransmitters, ACTH, CORT and BDNF. Conclusion: Loganin effectively ameliorated depressive-like symptoms in CUMS-exposed mice by increasing 5-hy-droxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) levels, alleviating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, and increasing BDNF expression. In conclusion, the findings of the current study extensive evidence for the application of loganin in stress-associated disorders, specifically targeting depression.

AB  - Nicotine, an addictive component of cigarettes, causes cognitive defects, particularly when exposure occurs early in life. However, the exact mechanism through which nicotine causes toxicity and alters synaptic plasticity is still not fully understood. The aim of the current study is to examine how non-coding developmental regulatory RNA impacts the hippocampus of mice offspring whose mothers were exposed to nicotine. Female C57BL/6J mice were given nicotine water from one week before pregnancy until end of lactation. Hippocampal tissue from offspring at 20 days post-birth was used for LncRNA and mRNA microarray analysis. Differential expression of LncRNAs and mRNAs associated with neuronal development were screened and validated, and the CeRNA pathway mediating neuronal synaptic plasticity GM13530/miR-7119-3p/mef2c was predicted using LncBase Predicted v.2. Using protein immunoblotting, Golgi staining and behavioral tests, our findings revealed that nicotine exposure in offspring mice increased hippocampal NMDAR receptor, activated receptor -dependent calcium channels, enhanced the formation of NMDAR/nNOS/PSD95 ternary complexes, increased NO synthesis, mediated p38 activation, induced neuronal excitability toxicity. Furthermore, an epigenetic CeRNA regulatory mechanism was identified, which suppresses Mef2c-mediated synaptic plasticity and leads to modifications in the learning and social behavior of the offspring during adolescence. This study uncovers the way in which maternal nicotine exposure results in neurotoxicity in offspring.

AB  - Stress and trauma exposure contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in a subset of people. A large body of preclinical work has found that the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) family of G protein-coupled receptors regulate several behaviors that are part of the symptom clusters for both PTSD and MDD, including anhedonia, anxiety, and fear. Here, we review this literature, beginning with a summary of the wide variety of preclinical models used to assess these behaviors. We then summarize the involvement of Group I and IImGlu receptors in these behaviors. Bringing together this extensive literature reveals that mGlu5 signaling plays distinct roles in anhedonia, fear, and anxiety-like behavior. mGlu5 promotes susceptibility to stress-induced anhedonia and resilience to stress-induced anxiety-like behavior, while serving a fundamental role in the learning underlying fear conditioning. The medial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and ventral hippocampus are key regions where mGlu5, mGlu2, and mGlu3 regulate these behaviors. There is strong support that stress-induced anhedonia arises from decreased glutamate release and post-synaptic mGlu5 signaling. Conversely, decreasing mGlu5 signaling increases resilience to stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. Consistent with opposing roles for mGlu5 and mGlu2/3 in anhedonia, evidence suggests that increased glutamate transmission may be therapeutic for the extinction of fear learning. Thus, a large body of literature supports the targeting of pre- and post-synaptic glutamate signaling to ameliorate post-stress anhedonia, fear, and anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - The study investigates the influence of alumina nanoparticles (Al2O3 NPs) at varying sizes on the learning and memory of adult ICR mice over different exposure durations. The mice were administered saline or Al2O3 nanoparticles of 10 mu m, 50 nm, and 13 nm via nasal drip. Following administration, the Morris water maze test was conducted, along with assessments of inflammation, oxidative stress, hippocampal histopathology, and cell death-related proteins. Initially, after acute exposure, a trend emerged where learning and memory gradually declined as nanoparticle size decreased, with the most significant impact observed in the 13 nm Al2O3 group. Upon chronic exposure, there was a significant decline in learning and memory within the Al2O3 NPs groups compared to other groups, accompanied by neuronal loss, swelling, light staining, and disorganization. Concurrently, levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1(3 within 7 days, MDA after 7 days, and death-related proteins such as Cathepsin-B, c-caspase3, LC3-II, Beclin1, RIP, and Cathepsin-L showed a linear increase, while SOD and GSH-PX activity steadily decreased. Over time, learning capability decreased, correlating with a sharp reduction in TNF-alpha and SOD activity, a gradual increase in MDA, c-caspase3, and Beclin1 levels in the Al2O3 NPs group, as well as elevated Cathepsin-L, LC3-II, and RIP levels in the 13 nm Al2O3 group. Consequently, Al2O3 NPs significantly impaired learning and memory in a particle size-dependent manner through initial inflammation and oxidative stress after acute exposure, and time-dependent impairment via escalating oxidative stress and neuronal death.

AB  - Overly strong fear memories can cause pathological conditions. Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) has been viewed as an optimal drug target for CNS disorders, but its role in fear memory remains elusive. We find that a selective deficit of H3R in cholinergic neurons, but not in glutamatergic neurons, enhances freezing level during contextual fear memory retrieval without affecting cued memory. Consistently, genetically knocking down H3R or chemogenetically activating cholinergic neurons in the ventral basal forebrain (vBF) mimics this enhanced fear memory, whereas the freezing augmentation is rescued by re-expressing H3R or chemogenetic inhibition of vBF cholinergic neurons. Spatiotemporal regulation of H3R by a light-sensitive rhodopsin-H3R fusion protein suggests that postsynaptic H3Rs in vBF cholinergic neurons, but not presynaptic H3Rs of cholinergic projections in the dorsal hippocampus, are responsible for modulating contextual fear memory. Therefore, precise modulation of H3R in a cell -type-and subcellular-location-specific manner should be explored for pathological fear memory.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are important neuromodulators of synaptic plasticity that have been linked to learning from positive or negative outcomes or valence-based learning. In the hippocampus, both affect long-term plasticity but play different roles in encoding uncertainty or predicted reward. DA has been related to positive valence, from reward consumption or avoidance behavior, and 5-HT to aversive encoding. We propose DA produces overall LTP while 5-HT elicits LTD. Here, we compare two reward -modulated spike timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) rules to describe the action of these neuromodulators. We examined their role in cognitive performance and flexibility for computational models of the Morris water maze task and reversal learning. Our results show that the interplay of DA and 5-HT improves learning performance and can explain experimental evidence. This study reinforces the importance of neuromodulation in determining the direction of plasticity.

AB  - Deltamethrin (DM), a broad-spectrum insecticide, is widely used in the world. It can exert direct action on the central nervous system to produce neurotoxicity. Exposure to DM can lead to iron metabolism disorder, oxidative stress and learning and memory dysfunction. In our study, pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups and gavaged at doses of 0, 1, 4 or 10 mg/kg/d DM from gestational day (GD) 0 to postnatal day (PND) 21. We used behavioral experiments and Nissl staining to observe the hippocampal development and learning and memory function of male offspring. In order to further confirm the regulation mechanisms of DM, we detected ferrous ion, oxidative stress, ferroptosis related proteins, phospholipase C (PL-C)/inositol triphosphate 3 receptor (IP3R) signaling pathway, intracellular Ca2+ and calcineurin (CaN) content in vivo. In vitro,we selected HT-22 cells to be exposed to DM under the intervention of ferrostatin-1 and pifithrin-alpha. Our results showed that maternal exposure to DM reduced T-maze correctness and the number of hippocampal neurons, and increased shuttle box passive avoidance rate. Moreover, maternal exposure to DM increased the expression of ferrous ion, malondialdehyde (MDA) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) protein, and decreased the glutathione (GSH) level in the hippocampus, which was contributed to ferroptosis by p53-mediated solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis in the male offspring. Furthermore, the ferroptosis caused by DM exposure could active PL-C/IP3R signaling pathway and increase the intracellular Ca2+ and CaN level, leading to an imbalance of calcium homeostasis in the hippocampus. Thus, maternal exposure to DM during pregnancy and lactation could impair hippocampal learning and memory function of male offspring by p53-mediated ferroptosis.

AB  - Fish show variation in feeding habits to adapt to complex environments. However, the genetic basis of feeding preference and the corresponding metabolic strategies that differentiate feeding habits remain elusive. Here, by comparing the whole genome of a typical carnivorous fish (Leiocassis longirostris G & uuml;nther) with that of herbivorous fish, we identify 250 genes through both positive selection and rapid evolution, including taste receptor taste receptor type 1 member 3 (tas1r3) and trypsin. We demonstrate that tas1r3 is required for carnivore preference in tas1r3-deficient zebrafish and in a diet-shifted grass carp model. We confirm that trypsin correlates with the metabolic strategies of fish with distinct feeding habits. Furthermore, marked alterations in trypsin activity and metabolic profiles are accompanied by a transition of feeding preference in tas1r3-deficient zebrafish and diet-shifted grass carp. Our results reveal a conserved adaptation between feeding preference and corresponding metabolic strategies in fish, and provide novel insights into the adaptation of feeding habits over the evolution course.

Metataxonomics, metaproteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics were conducted on liver tissue and biofluids (gastrointestinal contents and blood) to elucidate the microbial mechanism related to metabolic disorders and liver injury. The hepatic inflammation occurred based on histomorphology after feeding a long-term grain-based high-energy diet, and the serum biochemical parameters and proinflammatory cytokines were significantly activated. Metaproteomics analysis indicated that the high-energy diet reduced anti-infection, immunity, anti-oxidant functions, and increased cell death and damage of rumen microbiome. Ruminal Ruminococcus_2, Solobacterium, and Syntrophococcu and jejunal Pirellula were potential microbial markers of liver disorders. The high-energy diet promoted hepatic inflammatory response and cytokine/chemokine-mediated signaling pathways located in the core of the functional genomic network. The high-energy diet increased indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate and decreased triterpenoids in the liver that were the potential biomarkers associated with metabolic liver disorders. Integrated multi-omics analyses showed interactions among the rumen and jejunum microbiota, circulating metabolites, and liver gene expression, suggesting a systemic immune response and liver disorder that signals through the microbiota-gut-liver axis.

AB  - Prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) is a significant contributor to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in offspring, which has been linked to an increased susceptibility to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later in life. Additionally, a high-fat diet (HFD) has been shown to exacerbate ASD-like behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we first noted in the rat model of IUGR induced by PCE that male PCE offspring exhibited typical ASD-like behaviors post-birth, in contrast to their female counterparts. The female PCE offspring demonstrated only reduced abilities in free exploration and spatial memory. Importantly, both male and female PCE offspring displayed ASD-like behaviors when exposed to HFD. We further observed that PCE + HFD offspring exhibited damaged intestinal mucus barriers and disturbed gut microbiota, resulting in an increased abundance of Escherichia coli (E. col degrees. The induced differentiation of colonic Th17 cells by E. coli led to an increased secretion of IL-17A, which entered the hippocampus through peripheral circulation and caused synaptic damage in hippocampal neurons, ultimately resulting in ASD development. Our strain transplantation experiment suggested that E. coli-mediated increase of IL-17A may be the core mechanism of ASD with a fetal origin. In conclusion, PCE and HFD are potential risk factors for ASD, and E. coli-mediated IL-17A may play a crucial role in fetal-originated ASD through the gut-brain axis.

AB  - Photobiomodulation therapy has been proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for retinal degenerative diseases. However, its effect on the regenerative capacity in mammalian retina and its intracellular signalling mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that photobiomodulation with 670 nm light stimu-lates Muller glia cell cycle re-entry and dedifferentiation into a progenitor-like state in both the uninjured and injured retina. We also find that 670 nm light treatment inhibits the Hippo pathway, which is activated in Muller glia following NaIO3- induced retinal injury. YAP, a major downstream effector of the Hippo signalling pathway was translocated into the nucleus of Muller glia along with YAP dephosphorylation in retina treated with 670 nm light. Deficiency of YAP attenuated Muller glia cell cycle re-entry and dedifferentiation. Our data reveal that the Hippo-YAP signalling pathway is associated with the photostimulatory effect on regenerative response in mammalian retina, and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases.

AB  - Using biodegradable blending materials is one of the most effective ways to address plastic pollution but it is hindered by its poor interfacial interaction along with high costs. Herein, an envirionmentally friendly filler, camellia seed powder (CSP)-a byproduct of camellia seed after defatting, is reported, which is first served as a compatibilizer in polylactic acid (PLA)/polybutylene succinate (PBS) blends without any other aids or complicated pretreatment, effectively toughening the PLA/PBS blends due to a better interfacial interaction. The results show that the toughness of composites increases with CSP content. With the addition of 30 phr CSP, its impact strength and elongation at break increase by 44.31% and 148.42%, respectively, as compared with the blend without CSP. The combined effects of improved interfacial bonding, reduced particle size of PBS and efficient stress transfer are responsible for the toughness enhancement. The compatibilization mechanism is proposed that COOH groups in PLA and PBS react with NH2 in CSP. The above finding of CSP as a compatibilizer provides a facile and inexpensive strategy in the fabrication of high-performance biodegradable materials.

AB  - Neuronal plasticity is a crucial mechanism for an adapting nervous system to change. It is shown to be regulated by perineuronal nets (PNNs), the condensed forms of the extracellular matrix (ECM) around neuronal bodies. By assessing the changes in the number, intensity, and structure of PNNs, the ultrastructure of the PNN mesh, and the expression of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs on these neurons, we aimed to clarify the role of an ECM glycoprotein, tenascin-C (TnC), in the dorsal hippocampus. To enhance neuronal plasticity, TnC-deficient (TnC-/-) and wild-type (TnC+/+) young adult male mice were reared in an enriched environment (EE) for 8 weeks. Deletion of TnC in TnC-/- mice showed an ultrastructural reduction of the PNN mesh and an increased inhibitory input in the dentate gyrus (DG), and an increase in the number of PNNs with a rise in the inhibitory input in the CA2 region. EE induced an increased inhibitory input in the CA2, CA3, and DG regions; in DG, the change was also followed by an increased intensity of PNNs. No changes in PNNs or synaptic expression were found in the CA1 region. We conclude that the DG and CA2 regions emerged as focal points of alterations in PNNs and synaptogenesis with EE as mediated by TnC.

AB  - Low frequency brain rhythms facilitate communication across large spatial regions in the brain and high frequency rhythms are thought to signify local processing among nearby assemblies. A heavily investigated mode by which these low frequency and high frequency phenomenon interact is phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). This phenomenon has recently shown promise as a novel electrophysiologic biomarker, in a number of neurologic diseases including human epilepsy. In 17 medically refractory epilepsy patients undergoing phase-2 monitoring for the evaluation of surgical resection and in whom temporal depth electrodes were implanted, we investigated the electrophysiologic relationships of PAC in epileptogenic (seizure onset zone or SOZ) and non-epileptogenic tissue (non-SOZ). That this biomarker can differentiate seizure onset zone from non-seizure onset zone has been established with ictal and pre-ictal data, but less so with interictal data. Here we show that this biomarker can differentiate SOZ from non-SOZ interictally and is also a function of interictal epileptiform discharges. We also show a differential level of PAC in slow-wave-sleep relative to NREM1-2 and awake states. Lastly, we show AUROC evaluation of the localization of SOZ is optimal when utilizing beta or alpha phase onto high-gamma or ripple band. The results suggest an elevated PAC may reflect an electrophysiology-based biomarker for abnormal/epileptogenic brain regions.

AB  - Air pollution triggers a tissue-specific inflammatory response. However, studies on the association between exposure to air pollutants and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) risk remain limited. Thus, we conducted this nationwide study to define the association between air pollution and CRS. We used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) and Taiwan Air Quality-Monitoring Database (TAQMD) to conduct a population-based cohort study. Study participants were recruited from the LHID, a data subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database that randomly sampled one million individuals. TAQMD has been an air pollutant database since 1998. In univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs of CRS in five air pollutants were accounted. We adjusted for age, sex, urbanization level, insurance fee, comorbidities, and pollutant levels in the multivariate model. The total number of participants enrolled in this study was 160,504. The average age was 40.46 +/- 14.62 years; males constituted 43.8% of the total participants. The percentages of alcoholism, tobacco dependence, and COPD were 1.5%, 2.8%, and 28.3%, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, urbanization level, insurance fee, and comorbidities, the highest levels of air pollutants, including PM2.5 (aHR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.06-1.22), NO2 (aHR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.00-1.15), and PM10 (aHR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.05-1.21) had a significantly greater CRS risk; we selected the lower concentration as the reference but did not correlate with CO. We found a significantly increased risk of CRS in residents with air pollutant exposure.

AB  - Background: With the intensification of global aging, slowing down the aging process has become a topic of significant interest. Brain aging, as one of the prominent changes in the aging process, urgently requires the exploration of new therapeutic methods to delay its progression. Gastrodia, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely recognized for its medicinal value, particularly in its pronounced neuroprotective effects. Although previous studies have demonstrated the protective effects of Gastrodin (GAS), an active compound in Gastrodia, on the mouse nervous system, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Objective: This study aims to investigate comprehensively the impact and mechanisms of GAS in delaying brain aging through the combined approach of network pharmacology and animal experiments, providing a theoretical basis for the clinical application of GAS in treating age-related decline. Methods: A D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mouse model was employed, and the anti-aging effects of GAS were evaluated through behavioral experiments and morphological observations. A "compound-target-pathway" network was constructed using network pharmacology. Gene and protein expression related to potential targets and pathways were verified and analyzed using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods. Results: GAS exposure significantly alleviated signs of brain aging in mice, including reduced body weight index, improved behavioral memory, mitigation of hippocampal morphological damage due to aging, and relief of oxidative stress levels in the mouse brain. Target screening through network pharmacology identified four key targets related to the AMPK/mTOR pathway and autophagy: AMPK, ULK1, ATG5, and Beclin1. Validation of the network pharmacology results using RT-qPCR and IHC confirmed that GAS upregulates cellular autophagy levels through the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway. Conclusion: GAS demonstrates a pronounced alleviating effect on age-related symptoms in D-galactose-induced brain aging mice by suppressing oxidative stress in the mouse brain. The mechanism involves the upregulation of cellular autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Remembering the location of a food or water source is essential for survival. Here, we reveal that spatial mem-ory for food location is reflected in ventral hippocampus (HPCv) neuron activity and is impaired by HPCv lesion. HPCv mediation of foraging-related memory involves communication to the lateral septum (LS), as either reversible or chronic disconnection of HPCv-to-LS signaling impairs spatial memory retention for food or water location. This neural pathway selectively encodes appetitive spatial memory, as HPCv-LS disconnection does not affect spatial memory for escape location in a negative reinforcement procedure, food intake, or social and olfactory-based appetitive learning. Neural pathway tracing and functional map-ping analyses reveal that LS neurons recruited during the appetitive spatial memory procedure are primarily GABAergic neurons that project to the lateral hypothalamus. Collective results emphasize that the neural substrates controlling spatial memory are outcome specific based on reinforcer modality.

AB  - Pyk2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase enriched in hippocampal neurons, which can be activated by calcium-dependent mechanisms. In neurons, Pyk2 is mostly localised in the cytosol and dendritic shafts but can translocate to spines and/or to the nucleus. Here, we explore the function of a new localisation of Pyk2 in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), a subdomain of ER-mitochondria surface that acts as a signalling hub in calcium regulation. To test the role of Pyk2 in MAMs' calcium transport, we used full Pyk2 knockout mice (Pyk2(-/-)) for in vivo and in vitro studies. Here we report that Pyk2(-/-) hippocampal neurons present increased ER-mitochondrial contacts along with defective calcium homeostasis. We also show how the absence of Pyk2 modulates mitochondrial dynamics and morphology. Taken all together, our results point out that Pyk2 could be highly relevant in the modulation of ER-mitochondria calcium efflux, affecting in turn mitochondrial function.

AB  - Isorhynchophylline (IRN), a component of traditional Chinese herb Uncaria rhynchophylla, possesses strong antioxidant activity. Ferroptosis induced by iron overload causes cell oxidative stress after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Therefore, this study aims to explore the effects of IRN on the ferroptosis following ICH. In this study, mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells were treated with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) alone or together with IRN, and we found IRN reduced the FAC-induced cell damage. Then, cells were treated with IRN following treatment with FAC after transfection with miR-122-5p inhibitor, and the results showed IRN reduced the FAC-induced decrease of miR-122-5p levels and relieved the ferroptosis by detecting ferroptotic marker proteins, iron ion concentration and oxidative stress level; after transfection with miR-122-5p inhibitor, the protective effects of IRN against FAC-induced ferroptosis in these cells were weakened. TP53 (also known as p53) was verified as a target of miR-122-5p by using dual luciferase reporter assay, and restoration of TP53 attenuated the effects of miR-122-5p on ferroptotic marker proteins expression, iron ion concentration and lipid ROS levels, as well as solute carrier family seven member 11 (SLC7A11) mRNA expression. SLC7A11 siRNA reversed the inhibitory effects of IRN on FAC-induced ferroptosis and oxidative stress levels. Subsequently, IRN increased the mNSS score, and decreased brain water content and EB content in ICH model. Moreover, IRN decreased ferroptosis and lipid ROS level, upregulated the expression of miR-122-5p and SLC7A11 mRNA, and inhibited TP53 expression. Our findings reveal that IRN protects neurocyte from ICH-induced ferroptosis via miR-122-5p/TP53/SLC7A11 pathway, which may provide a potential therapeutic mechanism for ICH.

AB  - TEAD1 and the mammalian Hippo pathway regulate cellular proliferation and function, though their regulatory function in 0 cells remains poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that while 0 cell-specific TEAD1 deletion results in a cell-autonomous increase of 0 cell proliferation, 0 cell-specific deletion of its ca-nonical coactivators, YAP and TAZ, does not affect proliferation, suggesting the involvement of other cofac-tors. Using an improved split-GFP system and yeast two-hybrid platform, we identify VGLL4 and MENIN as TEAD1 corepressors in 0 cells. We show that VGLL4 and MENIN bind to TEAD1 and repress the expression of target genes, including FZD7 and CCN2, which leads to an inhibition of 0 cell proliferation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TEAD1 plays a critical role in 0 cell proliferation and identify VGLL4 and MENIN as TEAD1 corepressors in 0 cells. We propose that these could be targeted to augment proliferation in 0 cells for reversing diabetes.

AB  - Blue light with a wavelength of 400-470 nm is the composition of the visible light. However, in recent years, blue light contributed the most significance to light pollution due to the artificial light at night. Previously, we have demonstrated that the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, an important pest in citrus production, has significant positive phototaxis with a light-emitting diode light of 400 nm. In this study, ACP with positive phototactic behavior to 400 nm light (PH) and non-phototactic behavior to 400 nm light (NP) were collected, individually. Transcriptome dynamics of head tissues of PH and NP groups were captured by using RNA-sequencing technology, respectively. Forty-three to 46 million clean reads with high-quality values were ob-tained, and 1773 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were detected. Compared with the NP group, there were 841 up-regulated DEGs and 932 down-regulated DEGs in the PH group. Eight pathways were significantly enriched in the PH group in the KEGG database, while 43 up-regulated pathways and 25 down-regulated pathways were significantly enriched in the PH group in the GO database. The DGE approach was reliable validated by real time quantitative PCR. Results indicated that the blue light acted as an abiotic stress causing physiological and biochemical responses such as oxidative stress, protein denaturation, inflammation and tumor development in ACPs. Additionally, the light was absorbed by photoreceptors of ACPs, and converted into electrical signal to regulate neuromodulation. This study provides basic information for understanding the molecular mechanisms of ACP in response to blue light and provides a reference for further studies to elucidate phototactic behavior.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the main form of dementia. Abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides in neurons and synapses cause neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. We have previously reported that ferroptosis and necroptosis were implicated in A beta(25-35) neurotoxicity, and their specific inhibitors had attenuating effects on cognitive impairment induced by A beta(25-35) neurotoxicity. Here, we aimed to examine the impact of ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibition following the A beta(25-35) neurotoxicity on the neuronal excitability of dentate gyrus (DG) and the possible involvement of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in their effects. After inducing A beta(25-35) neurotoxicity, electrophysiological alterations in the intrinsic properties and excitability were recorded by the whole-cell patch-clamp under current-clamp condition. Voltage-clamp recordings were also performed to shed light on the involvement of calcium channel currents. A beta(25-35) neurotoxicity induced a considerable reduction in input resistance (R-in), accompanied by a profoundly decreased excitability and a reduction in the amplitude of voltage-gated calcium channel currents in the DG granule cells. However, three days of administration of either ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a ferroptosis inhibitor, or Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a necroptosis inhibitor, in the entorhinal cortex could almost preserve the normal excitability and the Ca2+ currents. In conclusion, these findings suggest that ferroptosis and necroptosis involvement in EC amyloidopathy could be a potential candidate to prevent the suppressive effect of A beta on the Ca2+ channel current and neuronal function, which might take place in neurons during the development of AD.

AB  - Signal transduction enables cells to sense and respond to chemical and mechanical information in the extracellular environment. Recently, phase separation has emerged as a physical mechanism that can influence the spatial organization of signaling molecules and regulate downstream signaling. Although many molecular components of signaling pathways, including receptors, kinases, and transcription factors, have been observed to undergo phase separation, understanding the functional consequences of their phase separation in signal transduction remains an ongoing area of research. In this review, we will discuss recent studies investigating how cells potentially use phase separation to regulate different signaling pathways by initiating signaling, amplifying signaling, or inhibiting signaling. We will also discuss recent observations that suggest a role for phase separation in mechanosensing in the Hippo pathway and at focal adhesions.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) type dementia encompasses diverse cognitive deficits marked by free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines mediated progressive neurodegeneration and vascular damage including the blood-brain barrier. Subsequently, an imbalance in neurotransmitters, excitotoxicity, and synaptic loss provide impetus to AD pathogenesis and perpetuate brain dysfunctions. Cucurbitacin possesses several biological properties and has shown potential in cancer, diabetes, and brain disorders. In this study, neuroprotective effects of cucurbitacin B (CuB) were investigated using the intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ-ICV) AD prototype. Methods: Wistar rats (adult males) were injected STZ-ICV (3 mg/kg) bilaterally on day(s) 1 and 3. Rats were treated with CuB (25, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) or donepezil (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 28 days daily starting from day 1. Behavioral tests viz. locomotor activity, motor coordination, and memory functions were conducted at different time intervals. After behavioral tests, biochemical markers of oxidative mutilation, inflammatory cell demise, and neurotransmitters were assessed in the whole brain. Results: CuB attenuated STZ-ICV-induced decrease in spatial memory in novel object recognition task and long-term memory in passive avoidance test. CuB diminished protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and enhanced antioxidants in the brain of rats inoculated with STZ-ICV. A decline in inflammatory and cell death biomarkers was observed in rats treated with CuB and STZ-ICV. In neurotransmitter analysis, a decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity and glutamate levels indicated an increase in cholinergic and attenuation of excitatory transmission in the brain. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) levels were enhanced by CuB treatment in the STZ-ICV rat model. Histomorphometry analysis disclosed that CuB treatment caused an increase in viable neuron density in the cortex and hippocampus of rats against STZ-ICV neurotoxicity. Conclusions: It can be inferred that CuB can afford a decline in AD symptoms. CuB protects neurons against STZ-ICV toxicity that improved memory functions in rats.

AB  - Parasitic worms (helminths) establish chronic infection within mammalian hosts by strategically regulating their host's immune responses. Deciphering the mechanisms by which host non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) co-ordinate the activation and regulation of immune cells is essential to understanding host immunity and immune-related pathology. It is also important to comprehend how pathogens secrete specific ncRNAs to manipulate gene expression of host immune cells and influence their response to infection. To investigate the contribution of both host and helminth derived ncRNAs to the activation and/or regulation of innate immune responses during a parasite infection, we examined ncRNA expression in the peritoneal macrophages from mice infected with Fasciola hepatica. We discovered the presence of several parasitic-derived miRNAs within host macrophages at 6 hrs and 18 hrs post infection. Target prediction analysis showed that these Fasciola miRNAs regulate host genes associated with the activation of host pro-inflammatory macrophages. Concomitantly, there was a distinct shift in host ncRNA expression, which was significant at 5 days post-infection. Prediction analysis suggested that these host ncRNAs target a different cohort of host genes compared to the parasite miRNAs, although the functional outcome was predicted to be similar i.e. reduced pro-inflammatory response and the promotion of a reparative/tolerant phenotype. Taken together, these observations uncover the interplay between host and parasitic ncRNAs and reveal a complementary regulation of the immune response that allows the parasite to evade immune detection and promote tissue repair for the host. These findings will provide a new understanding of the molecular interaction between parasites and host.

AB  - The colostrum quality (immunoglobulin content) is one of the most challenging aspects for hyperprolific sows in the modern pig industry. The objective of this study was to evaluate relationships among sow body condition scores, litter characteristics, and colostrum IgG content in hyperprolific sows, using a digital Brix refractometer to measure IgG. Samples (5 ml) were collected from two hundred and eighty-seven sows within the first hour postpartum. Sow parameters and back fat thickness at farrowing (BFF) and weaning (BFW) were recorded. The results indicate a positive correlation between parity and IgG, as well as BFF and BFW. A negative correlation was found between the number of weaning piglets and BFW. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the number of mummified piglets and colostrum IgG. Finally, lactation duration was positively associated with BFF. In conclusion, the number of mummified piglets is a factor positively associated with colostrum IgG content in hyperprolific sows.

AB  - Luffa cylindrica (L.), is a medicinal plant aimed to investigate the efficacy of the alkaloid-rich fraction (ARF) extracted from L. cylindrica. The study employed behavioural analysis of rat using Morris water maze (MWM), biochemical analysis of apoptotic proteins, Immunohistochemistry of caspase 3 protein and network pharmacology approach. The ozone-induced group exhibited complex behavioral changes. Western blot analysis revealed altered expression of SOD2, Caspase 3, and Cytochrome C which play integral roles in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. Histopathological analysis of the hippocampus further supported the neuroprotective potential of L. cylindrica, demonstrating a reduction in neuropathological lesions and improved memory processes. Network Pharmacology showed the implication of GSK3 beta in neuronal damage. ARF showed promise in preventing further neuronal damage. In summary, this comprehensive study sheds light on its potential in neuroprotective applications by in vivo behavioral and molecular analyses. It provides a holistic understanding of the medicinal properties of ARF, encouraging further exploration for potential therapeutic interventions in neurological diseases.

AB  - Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) are only distributed in vascular plants, and are essential for the detoxification and vascular transport of heavy metals in plants. However, the HIPP gene family has not been thoroughly explored in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). In this study, we systematically identified 56C. sinensis CsHIPP genes from five groups and characterized their phylogeny, structures, and the features of the encoded proteins. The expression patterns of CsHIPP genes in various tissues of C. sinensis were investigated based on a previous RNA-seq data analysis. The expression patterns of CsHIPP genes were explored in cadmium (Cd)-treated C. sinensis roots using our RNA-seq data. Three CsHIPP genes (CsHIPP22, CsHIPP24, and CsHIPP36) with high expression levels in Cd-treated C. sinensis roots were selected as candidate genes associated with Cd tolerance. Overexpression of CsHIPP22, CsHIPP24, and CsHIPP36 in a yeast mutant (ycf1) rescued Cd-sensitive ycf1 yeast and increased the yeast resistance to Cd stress, implying that these three CsHIPPs might be involved in Cd tolerance. These findings will enable the roles of HIPPs in Cd absorption and detoxification to be better understood as well as improving our understanding of the Cd-resistance and Cd-accumulation mechanisms in tea plant.

AB  - Rahman syndrome (RMNS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, vision problems, bone abnormalities and dysmorphic facies. RMNS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the histone linker gene H1-4; however, mechanisms underlying impaired neurodevelopment in RMNS are not understood. All reported mutations associated with RMNS in H1-4 are small insertions or deletions that create a shared frameshift, resulting in a H1.4 protein that is both truncated and possessing an abnormal C-terminus frameshifted tail (H1.4 CFT). To expand understanding of mutations and phenotypes associated with mutant H1-4, we identified new variants at both the C- and N-terminus of H1.4. The clinical features of mutations identified at the C-terminus are consistent with other reports and strengthen the support of pathogenicity of H1.4 CFT. To understand how H1.4 CFT may disrupt brain function, we exogenously expressed wild-type or H1.4 CFT protein in rat hippocampal neurons and assessed neuronal structure and function. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed similar to 400 genes altered in the presence of H1.4 CFT. Neuronal genes downregulated by H1.4 CFT were enriched for functional categories involved in synaptic communication and neuropeptide signaling. Neurons expressing H1.4 CFT also showed reduced neuronal activity on multielectrode arrays. These data are the first to characterize the transcriptional and functional consequence of H1.4 CFT in neurons. Our data provide insight into causes of neurodevelopmental impairments associated with frameshift mutations in the C-terminus of H1.4 and highlight the need for future studies on the function of histone H1.4 in neurons.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a neurotoxicant that gradually accumulates in the human body with age. High Cd burden is correlated with adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and memory deficits in mammals. However, little knowledge is known about the mechanism by which Cd exposure impairs neurogenesis and cognition. Here, we investigated the roles of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE)-mediated calcium dyshomeostasis in Cd-induced AHN and memory deficits as well as therapeutic potential for the prevention of Cd-induced neurotoxicity. To achieve this goal, 8 weeks-old C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to different concentrations of cadmium chloride (0, 5, 10, 20 ppm) in drinking water for 8 weeks, we then examined the AHN, calcium homeostasis, SOCE channel and memory in Cd-exposed mice by using immunohistochemistry, calcium imaging, Y-maze and fear conditioning test. Our results indicated that chronic Cd exposure markedly increased Cd levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by almost 10-fold, and inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal adult neural stem cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, Cd exposure impaired the maturation of hippocampal neural stem cells without inducing gliosis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Cd exposure inhibited the proliferation of neuroblastoma via alteration of calcium signaling pathway, and attenuated SOCE channels played a pivotal role in mediating Cd-induced cytoplasmic calcium overload and depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores. Activation of SOCE by hyperforin, a natural derivative from medicinal plant, restored intracellular calcium homeostasis and improved AHN and memory in Cd-exposed mice. Together, this study provided novel insights into the mechanism that Cd exposure impaired AHN and memory by prompting neuronal SOCE-mediated calcium dyshomeostasis, and offered a new therapeutic approach for prevention of Cd-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Objectives Myocardial infarction (MI) commonly occurs in patients with coronary artery disease and have high mortality. Current clinical strategies for MI still limited to reducing the death of myocardial cells but failed to replace these cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of fibroblast growth factor 6 (FGF6) in enhancing the proliferative potential of cardiomyocytes (CMs) after ischemic injury via the Hippo pathway. Materials and Methods Expression of FGF6 protein was analysed in mice with MI induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Activation of the Hippo pathway and the proliferation potential were examined in ischemic CMs, treated with FGF6 protein or transfected with an adeno-virus carrying FGF6 sh-RNA. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were performed to assess the relationship between FGF6 and the Hippo pathway. Results We found that FGF6 expression was significantly increased in the MI mouse model. Knockdown of FGF6 synthesis resulted in poorer heart function after MI. By contrast, treatment with recombinant human FGF6 protein improved heart function, reduced infarct size, and promoted cardiac repair. Additionally, FGF6 restrains the activation of the Hippo pathway and subsequently promotes nuclear accumulation of YAP. This was largely counteracted by treatment with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor U0126.

AB  - Perinatal exposure to bifenthrin (BF) alters neurodevelopment. However, the most susceptible time period to BF exposure and the possible mechanisms are not clear. In the current study, pregnant female mice were treated with BF (0.5 mg/kg/d) at three different stages [gestational day (GD) 0-5, 6-15 and 16-birth (B)] and neurologic deficits were evaluated in offspring mice. BF exposure at GD 16-B significantly altered the locomotor activity and caused learning and memory impairments in 6-week-old offspring. Gestational BF exposure also caused neuronal loss in the region of cornu ammonis of hippocampi of 6-week-old offspring. Interestingly, neurobehavioral im-pairments and neuronal loss were not observed in offspring at 10-week-old. BF exposure at GD 16-B also decreased protein levels of VGluT1, NR1 and NR2A while increased the protein levels of NR2B and VGAT1, as well as the gene levels of Il-1 & beta;, Il-6 and Tnf-& alpha; in hippocampi of 6-week-old offspring. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gestational exposure to a low dose BF causes neurodevelopmental deficits that remit with the age and the late-stage of pregnancy is the most susceptible time window to BF exposure. Imbalance in excitatory/ inhibitory neuronal transmission, altered expression levels of NMDA receptors and increased neural inflamma-tion may be associated with BF prenatal exposure-triggered neurobehavioral impairments.

AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS), the most common substitute for bisphenol A in manufacturing, is associated with neurotoxicity, but its molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we studied the role of the BDNF-TrkB-CREB (brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin-related kinase B-CAMP response element-binding protein) signalling pathway in bisphenol S-induced neurotoxicity via methylation regulation in male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were treated with sesame oil or 2, 20 and 200 mg/kg body weight BPS for 28 consecutive days, and the hippocampus was extracted. We recorded the body weight, organ index, and hippocampal pathology and ultrastructure of the mice. The BDNF, TrkB, CREB, phosphorylated (p)-CREB, DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) levels were determined by qRT-PCR and/or Western blotting. BDNF promoter IV methylation level was detected by bisulfite sequencing PCR. BPS damaged the mouse hippocampus ultrastructure and reduced the number of synapses. Further, it increased the methylation rate of BDNF promoter IV; downregulated BDNF, CREB, p-CREB/CREB and DNMT1 expression; and upregulated DNMT3a and DNMT3b expression. Therefore, we speculate that the BDNF-TrkB-CREB pathway may be involved in BPS-induced neurotoxicity in male mice by regulating methylation.

AB  - Stroke is the third cause of death worldwide and a health problem, and current therapy continues to be very poor. It promotes an alteration associated with excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory processes, exacerbating the damage in the brain. Although cortical areas are the most affected by stroke, the hippocampus can be impacted in the long term through the pathways it connects with these areas, which are associated further with motor alterations; this encourages the search for new therapeutic approaches. Omega-5, being an antioxidant, participates in regulating oxidative stress. A recently designed nanoemulsified compound coupled with pomegranate seed oil (NanoPSO) maintains bioavailability in the body for longer. Omega-5 NanoPSO is more effective in different models of neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. Therefore, it is important to analyze the effect of omega-5 NanoPSO on ischemic damage through changes in the hippocampus, oxidative mechanisms, and behavioral outcomes. Male Wistar rats were used in five groups; three groups were subjected to an ischemic event through bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries. An ischemia group received omega-5 NanoPSO after injury, and another group received omega-5 NanoPSO performed two weeks before the ischemic event and three weeks after the surgical process. The control and sham groups did not show changes in the hippocampus and behavior. In the ischemia group, neuronal loss, oxidative stress, and a higher expression of astrocytes were maintained in the hippocampal region, and behavior was modified. In the post and pre-treatment group with omega-5 NanoPSO, we observed reduced damage, glial proliferation, and oxidative stress. It increased neuron survival in the hippocampal region and improved the locomotion. These results highlight its promise for use in clinical settings to treat patients suffering from ischemic brain injury.

AB  - Introduction: Aluminum is everywhere in nature and is a recognized neurotoxicant closely associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation occurs in the early stage of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanism by which aluminum induces neuroinflammation remains unclear. Material and methods: A 3-month subchronic aluminum exposure mouse model was established by drinking water containing aluminum chloride (AlCl3). Microglia BV2 cells and hippocampal neuron HT22 cells were treated with AlCl3 in vitro. BBG and YC-1 were used as intervention agents.Results: Aluminum could activate microglia and increase the level of extracellular ATP, stimulate P2X7 receptor, HIF-1 alpha, activate NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP-1, release more cytokine IL-1 beta, and induce an inflammatory response in nerve cells. There was a mutual regulatory relationship between P2X7 and HIF-1 alpha at mRNA and protein levels. The co-culture system of BV2-HT22 cells observed that conditioned medium from microglia treated with aluminum could aggravate neuronal morphological damage, inflammatory response and death. While BBG and YC-1 intervention could rescue these injuries to some extent.Conclusion: The P2X7-NLRP3 pathway was involved in aluminum-induced neuroinflammation and injury. P2X7 and HIF-1 alpha might mutually regulate and promote the progression of neuroinflammation, both BBG and YC-1 could relieve it.

AB  - Being one of the renal replacement therapies, peritoneal dialysis (PD) maintains around 15% of end-stage kidney disease patients' lives; however, complications such as peritoneal fibrosis and ultrafiltration failure during long-term PD compromise its application. Previously, we established a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)-induced peritoneal fibrosis porcine model, which helped to bridge the rodent model toward pre-clinical human peritoneal fibrosis research. In this study, the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was established to evaluate instant functional changes in the peritoneum in the pig model. Similar to observations from long-term PD patients, increasing small solutes transport and loss of sodium sieving were observed. Mechanistic investigation from both in vivo and in vitro data suggested that disruption of cytoskeleton induced by excessive reactive oxygen species defected intracellular transport of aquaporin 1, this likely resulted in the disappearance of sodium sieving upon PET. Functional interference of aquaporin 1 on free water transport would result in PD failure in patients.

AB  - Background: Evidence shows that microwaves radiation may have various biological effects on central nervous system. Role of electromagnetic fields in neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD, has been widely studied, but results of these studies are inconsistent. Therefore, the above effects were verified again and the mechanism was preliminarily discussed.Methods: Amyloid precursor protein (APP/PS1) and WT mice were exposed to long-term microwave radiation for 270 days (900 MHz, SAR: 0.25-1.055 W/kg, 2 h/day, alternately), and related indices were assessed at 90,180 and 270 days. Cognition was evaluated by Morris water maze, Y maze and new object recognition tests. Congo red staining, immunohistochemistry and ELISA were used to analyze Af3 plaques, Af340 and Af342 content. Differentially expressed proteins in hippocampus between microwave-exposed and unexposed AD mice were identified by proteomics.Results: Spatial and working memory was improved in AD mice after long-term 900 MHz microwave exposure compared with after sham exposure. Microwave radiation (900 MHz) for 180 or 270 days did not induce Af3 plaque formation in WT mice but inhibited Af3 accumulation in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in 2-and 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice. This effect mainly occurred in the late stage of the disease and may have been attributed to downregulation of apolipoprotein family member and SNCA expression and excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter rebalance in the hippocampus.Conclusions: The present results indicated that long-term microwave radiation can retard AD develop-ment and exert a beneficial effect against AD, suggesting that 900 MHz microwave exposure may be a potential therapy for AD.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), as an early stage of AD, is an important point for early warning of AD. Neuropathological studies have shown that AD pathology in pre-dementia patients involves the hippocampus and caudate nucleus, which are responsible for controlling cognitive mechanisms such as the spatial executive process (SEP). The aim of this study is to design a new method for early warning of MCI due to AD by dynamically evaluating SEP.
   Methods: We designed fingertip interaction handwriting digital evaluation paradigms and analyzed the dynamic trajectory of fingertip interaction and image data during "clock drawing" and "repetitive writing" tasks. Extracted fingertip interaction digital biomarkers were used to assess participants' SEP disorders, ultimately enabling intelligent diagnosis of MCI due to AD. A cross-sectional study demonstrated the predictive performance of this new method.
   Results: We enrolled 30 normal cognitive (NC) elderly and 30 MCI due to AD patients, and clinical research results showed that there may be neurobehavioral differences between the two groups in digital biomarkers captured during SEP. The early warning performance for MCI due to AD of this new method (areas under the curve (AUC)= 0.880) is better than that of the Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) neuropsychological scale (AUC = 0.856) assessed by physicians.
   Conclusion: Patients with MCI due to AD may have SEP disorders, and this new method based on dynamic evaluation of SEP will provide a novel human-computer interaction and intelligent early warning method for home and community screening of MCI due to AD.

AB  - Tachycines meditationis (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae: Tachycines) is a widely distributed insect in eastern Asia. This species is common in urban environments, and its unique omnivorous diet may contribute to its success in various habitats. However, molecular studies on the species are scarce. Here, we obtained the first transcriptome sequence of T. meditationis and performed preliminary analyses to test whether the evolution of coding sequences fits the expectations based on the species' ecology. We retrieved 476,495 effective transcripts and annotated 46,593 coding sequences (CDS). We analysed the codon usage and found that directional mutation pressure was the leading cause of codon usage bias in this species. This genome-wide relaxed codon usage pattern in T. meditationis is surprising, given the potentially large population size of this species. Moreover, despite the omnivorous diet, the chemosensory genes of this species do not exhibit codon usage deviating significantly from the genome-level pattern. They also do not seem to experience more gene family expansion than other cave cricket species do. A thorough search for rapidly evolved genes using the dN/dS value showed that genes associated with substance synthesis and metabolic pathways, such as retinol metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and fatty acid metabolism, underwent species-specific positive selection. While some results seem to contradict the species ecology, our transcriptome assembly provides a valuable molecular resource for future studies on camel cricket evolution and molecular genetics for feeding ecology in insects, in general.

AB  - Murtilla (Ugni molinae) is a shrub native to Chile that has undergone an incipient domestication process aimed at increasing its productivity. The reduction in intrinsic chemical defenses due to the domestication process has resulted in a decrease in the plant's ability to defend itself against mechanical or insect damage. In response to this damage, plants release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as a means of defense. To understand how domestication has impacted the production of VOCs in the first offspring of murtilla, we hypothesized that their levels would be reduced due to the induction of mechanical and herbivore damage. To test this hypothesis, we collected VOCs from four offspring ecotypes and three wild relatives of murtilla. We induced mechanical and herbivore damage in the plants and then enclosed them in a glass chamber, where we captured the VOCs. We identified 12 compounds using GC-MS. Our results showed that wild relative ecotypes had a higher VOC release rate of 624.6 mu g/cm(2)/day. Herbivore damage was the treatment that produced the highest release of VOCs, with 439.3 mu g/cm(2)/day in wild relatives. These findings suggest that herbivory triggers defenses through the emission of VOCs, and that domestication has influenced the production of these compounds in murtilla. Overall, this study contributes to bridging the gap in the incipient domestication history of murtilla and highlights the importance of considering the impact of domestication on a plant's chemical defenses.

AB  - Background Impaired pattern separation occurs in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis participates in pattern separation. Here, we investigated whether spatial memory discrimination impairment can be improved by promoting the hippocampal DG granule cell neogenesis-mediated pattern separation in the early stage of AD by electroacupuncture (EA).Methods Five familial AD mutations (5 x FAD) mice received EA treatment at Baihui and Shenting points for 4 weeks. During EA, mice were intraperitoneally injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg) twice a day. rAAV containing Wnt5a shRNA was injected into the bilateral DG region, and the viral efficiency was evaluated by detecting Wnt5a mRNA levels. Cognitive behavior tests were conducted to assess the impact of EA treatment on cognitive function. The hippocampal DG area A beta deposition level was detected by immunohistochemistry after the intervention; The number of BrdU(+)/CaR+ cells and the gene expression level of calretinin (CaR) and prospero homeobox 1(Prox1) in the DG area of the hippocampus was detected to assess neurogenesis by immunofluorescence and western blotting after the intervention; The gene expression levels of FZD2, Wnt5a, DVL2, p-DVL2, CaMKII, and p-CaMKII in the Wnt signaling pathway were detected by Western blotting after the intervention.Results Cognitive behavioral tests showed that 5 x FAD mice had impaired pattern separation (P < 0.001), which could be improved by EA (P < 0.01). Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that the expression of Wnt5a in the hippocampus was decreased (P < 0.001), and the neurogenesis in the DG was impaired (P < 0.001) in 5 x FAD mice. EA could increase the expression level of Wnt5a (P < 0.05) and promote the neurogenesis of immature granule cells (P < 0.05) and the development of neuronal dendritic spines (P < 0.05). Interference of Wnt5a expression aggravated the damage of neurogenesis (P < 0.05), weakened the memory discrimination ability (P < 0.05), and inhibited the beneficial effect of EA (P < 0.05) in AD mice. The expression level of Wnt pathway related proteins such as FZD2, DVL2, p-DVL2, CAMKII, p-CAMKII increased after EA, but the effect of EA was inhibited after Wnt5a was knocked down. In addition, EA could reduce the deposition of A beta plaques in the DG without any impact on Wnt5a.Conclusion EA can promote hippocampal DG immature granule cell neogenesis-mediated pattern separation to improve spatial memory discrimination impairment by regulating Wnt5a in 5 x FAD mice.

AB  - Ripples are a typical form of neural activity in hippocampal neural networks associated with the replay of episodic memories during sleep as well as sleep-related plasticity and memory consolidation. The emergence of ripples has been observed both dependent as well as independent of input from other brain areas and often coincides with dendritic spikes. Yet, it is unclear how input-evoked and spontaneous ripples as well as dendritic excitability affect plasticity and consolidation.Here, we use mathematical modeling to compare these cases. We find that consolidation as well as the emergence of spontaneous ripples depends on a reliable propagation of activity in feed-forward structures which constitute memory representations. This propagation is facilitated by excitable dendrites, which entail that a few strong synapses are sufficient to trigger neuronal firing. In this situation, stimulation-evoked ripples lead to the potentiation of weak synapses within the feed-forward structure and, thus, to a consolidation of a more general sequence memory. However, spontaneous ripples that occur without stimulation, only consolidate a sparse backbone of the existing strong feed-forward structure.Based on this, we test a recently hypothesized scenario in which the excitability of dendrites is transiently enhanced after learning, and show that such a transient increase can strengthen, restructure and consolidate even weak hippocampal memories, which would be forgotten otherwise. Hence, a transient increase in dendritic excitability would indeed provide a mechanism for stabilizing memories.
   Sequential activity of place cells in hippocampus has been found to be replayed during sleep. Such replay is believed to aid the consolidation of episodic memories. We here investigate replay of memories encoded by a feed-forward structure within a recurrent network as well as associated synaptic plasticity. Hereby, we vary both the external stimulation that triggers replay-sequences, as well as the excitability of active dendrites. With stimulation and highly excitable dendrites, we observe reliable replays and potentiation of both weak and strong synapses along the feed-forward structure. Without stimulation but with highly excitable dendrites, spontaneous replays emerge and only sufficiently strong synapses are further potentiated. Without highly excitable dendrites, the memory decays. However, with an intermediate period of increased dendritic excitability, the memory can be sufficiently restructured and strengthened to exhibit spontaneous replays and consolidation, even at lower dendritic excitability levels. These results indicate that a transient increase in dendritic excitability provides a mechanism both for restructuring and stabilizing hippocampal memories.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, has a high detection and exceeding rate in feed and is prone to causing symptoms such as loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, and diarrhoea in animals, which brings great harm to the aquaculture industry. The common mycotoxin adsorbents have low adsorption rates for DON, and the use of biological methods to remove DON in feeds has gradually become a research trend. One hundred and twenty crossbred barrows were randomly divided into four groups, which included the normal diet group (CON), normal diet + detoxifier group (Det), DON-polluted diet group (DON), and DON-polluted diet + DON detoxifier group (DON + Det); the experiment lasted for 28 d. The results showed that, compared with piglets fed a normal diet, those piglets fed DON-polluted diets significantly decreased their average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) during the 1-14 d and 1-28 d periods; the content of immunoglobulin G (IgG), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in serum was decreased; and the content of aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), diamine oxidase (DAO), and endotoxin (LPS) was increased in pigs fed DON-polluted diets; meanwhile, feeding piglets DON-polluted diets significantly reduced the levels of acetic acid, propionic acid, and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as gut microbiota health index (GMHI) in piglet faeces, but increased the relative abundance of Treponema, Prevotellaceae_UGG-001, Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group, Frisingicoccus and Sphaerochaeta. In contrast, the addition of a composite detoxifier effectively ameliorated the reduction in ADG and ADFI in piglets caused by DON-polluted diets. It suppressed the reduction in CAT, SOD, GSH-PX, IL-4, and IL-10 and the elevation of TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, MDA, LPS, and DAO in serum; the composite detoxifier also restrained the decrease in SCFA in piglet faeces and increased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group, UCG-009, and Eubacterium_siraeum_group bacteria. The composite detoxifier effectively mitigated the adverse effects of a DON-polluted diet on piglet growth performance, blood biochemical indices, and gut microbiota composition.

AB  - This study seeks to assess the impact of varying concentrations of lysophospholipids on the antioxidant capacity, digestive performance, and intestinal microbiota of L. vannamei. A total of 840 shrimp, with an average initial weight of 2.22 +/- 0.11 g, were randomly distributed across 28 aquaculture tanks (30 shrimp per tank), organized into 7 distinct treatment groups, each comprising 4 replicates. The control group (DL2) was administered a basal diet formula supplemented with 2% soy lecithin, whereas the experimental groups received lysophospholipids at varying concentrations of 0% (RL0), 0.1% (RL0.1), 0.5% (RL0.5), 1% (RL1), 1.5% (RL1.5), and 2% (RL2). The results revealed that the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) level in the RL0.1 group was significantly elevated compared to the DL2 and RL2 groups (p < 0.05). Furthermore, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activities were markedly higher in the RL1 and RL1.5 groups relative to other groups (p < 0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity exhibited a significant increase across all lysophospholipid-supplemented groups when compared to the DL2 group (p < 0.05). Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were notably elevated in the RL0.5, RL1.5, and RL2 groups relative to the other groups (p < 0.05). Regarding antioxidant-related genes in the hemocytes, the relative expression levels of Nrf1, Nrf2, GPx, SOD, CAT, and Hippo were significantly higher in the RL0.5 and RL1 groups compared to the DL2 group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the relative expression levels of GPx and SOD were significantly elevated in the RL2 group compared to the DL2 group (p < 0.05). In the intestinal tract, the activities of trypsin and alpha-amylase (AMS) were significantly elevated in the RL0.1, RL0.5, and RL1 groups compared to the DL2 group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the RL0.1 group demonstrated significantly higher lipase (LPS) activity than the other groups supplemented with lysophospholipids (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the relative expression levels of the trypsin and alpha-amylase genes were significantly increased in the RL1 and RL1.5 groups in comparison to the DL2 group (p < 0.05). Sequencing analysis of the intestinal microbiota indicated that the incorporation of lysophospholipids resulted in an enhancement of the composition and structure of the intestinal microbiota. The functional abundance of the intestinal microbiome was primarily enriched in metabolic pathways. Overall, the incorporation of lysophospholipids into the diet exerted a beneficial effect on the antioxidant capacity, digestive performance, and intestinal microbiota of L. vannamei, especially with the supplementation of 0.1% lysophospholipids.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD), a natural component extracted from Cannabis sativa L. exerts neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease characterized by impaired cognition and accumulation of amyloid-B peptides (A beta). Interactions between the gut and central nervous system (microbiota-gut-brain axis) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorder AD. At present investigations into the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective action of CBD in AD are not conclusive. The aim of this study was thus to examine the influence of CBD on cognition and involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis using a senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model. Data demonstrated that administration of CBD to SAMP8 mice improved cognitive function as evidenced from the Morris water maze test and increased hippocampal activated microglia shift from M1 to M2. In addition, CBD elevated levels of Bacteriodetes associated with a fall in Firmicutes providing morphologically a protective intestinal barrier which subsequently reduced leakage of intestinal toxic metabolites. Further, CBD was found to reduce the levels of hippocampal and colon epithelial cells lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known to be increased in AD leading to impaired gastrointestinal motility, thereby promoting neuroinflammation and subsequent neuronal death. Our findings demonstrated that CBD may be considered a beneficial therapeutic drug to counteract AD-mediated cognitive impairment and restore gut microbial functions associated with the observed neuroprotective mechanisms.

AB  - Excitatory synapses of principal hippocampal neurons are frequently located on dendritic spines. The dynamic strengthening or weakening of individual inputs results in structural and molecular diversity of dendritic spines. Active spines with large calcium ion (Ca2+) transients are frequently invaded by a single protrusion from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is dynamically transported into spines via the actin-based motor myosin V. An increase in synaptic strength correlates with stable anchoring of the ER, followed by the formation of an organelle referred to as the spine apparatus. Here, we show that myosin V binds the Ca2+ sensor caldendrin, a brain-specific homolog of the well-known myosin V interactor calmodulin. While calmodulin is an essential activator of myosin V motor function, we found that caldendrin acts as an inhibitor of processive myosin V movement. In mouse and rat hippocampal neurons, caldendrin regulates spine apparatus localization to a subset of dendritic spines through a myosin V-dependent pathway. We propose that caldendrin transforms myosin into a stationary F-actin tether that enables the localization of ER tubules and formation of the spine apparatus in dendritic spines.

AB  - The high-value utilization of Camellia oleifera, a major agroforestry waste, is critical for sustainable biomass management. This study presents a green integrated process for efficient lignin extraction and controllable nanoparticle synthesis via acidic solvent extraction and solvent-exchange nanotechnology. Two solvent systems were systematically optimized: HCl/1,4-dioxane achieved higher lignin purity (71.53%-73.52%) under optimal conditions (110 degrees C, 75 min, 90% solvent ratio), whereas p-TsOH/ethylene glycol low eutectic solvent (70 degrees C, 75 min, 65% ratio) yielded superior extraction efficiency (27.38%-28.74%). Subsequent solvent exchange enabled precise regulation of lignin nanoparticle morphology and size. Solvent polarity governed structural outcomes, with acetone producing elongated porous particles (153 +/- 1 nm, PDI = 0.322) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) generating uniform spheres (140 +/- 1 nm, PDI = 0.109). FTIR and zeta potential analyses revealed that tetrahydrofuran's hydrophobic effects enhanced surface electronegativity (-37.5 mV), conferring exceptional colloidal stability (<1% size increase over 30 days). Synergistic optimization of THF/water ratio (50%) and lignin concentration (0.7 mg/ml) produced ultrasmall nanoparticles (80 nm, PDI = 0.082). This work elucidates the multiscale mechanism of solvent polarity in lignin extraction-nanostructuring and establishes a low-carbon pathway for agroforestry waste valorization. The methodology demonstrates significant potential for advancing green material synthesis and nanotechnology applications through biomass-derived functional nanomaterials.<br /> (c) 2025 Author(s).

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of the ethyl acetate from Eucommia ulmoides leaves (EFEL) on PM2.5-induced cognitive impairment in BALB/c mice. EFEL improved PM2.5-induced cognitive decline by improving spontaneous alternative behavioral and long-term memory ability. EFEL increased ferric reducing activity power (FRAP) in serum. In addition, EFEL increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents and inhibited the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) in lung and brain tissues. EFEL also restored the mitochondrial function by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level, and ATP level in lung and brain tissues. EFEL ameliorated the cholinergic system by regulating the acetylcholine (ACh) content and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain tissue and the expression of AChE and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the whole brain and hippocampal tissues. EFEL reduced PM2.5-induced excessive expression of inflammatory protein related to the lung, whole brain, olfactory bulb, and hippocampus. Physiological compounds of EFEL were identified as 5-O-caffeolyquinic acid, rutin, quercetin, and quercetin glycosides. As a result, EFEL has anti-inflammation and anti-amnesic effect on PM2.5-induced cognitive impairment by regulating the inflammation and inhibiting the lung and brain tissue dysfunction, and its effect is considered to be due to the physiological compounds of EFEL.

AB  - Despite being essential for fertility, genome-defense-pathway genes often evolve rapidly. However, little is known about the molecular basis of this adaptation. Here, we characterized the evolution of a protein interaction network within the PIWI-interacting small RNA (piRNA) genome-defense pathway in Drosophila at unprecedented scale and evolutionary resolution. We uncovered the pervasive rapid evolution of a protein interaction network anchored at the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) paralog Rhino. Through cross-species high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid screening, we identified three distinct evolutionary protein interaction trajectories across similar to 40 million years of Drosophila evolution. While several protein interactions are fully conserved, indicating functional conservation despite rapid amino acid-sequence change, other interactions are preserved through coevolution and were detected only between proteins within or from closely related species. We also identified species-restricted protein interactions, revealing insight into the mechanistic diversity and ongoing molecular innovation in Drosophila piRNA production. In sum, our analyses reveal principles of interaction evolution in an adaptively evolving protein-protein interaction network, and support intermolecular interaction innovation as a central molecular mechanism of evolutionary adaptation in protein-coding genes.

AB  - IntroductionChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is strongly associated with significant impairment of quality of life (QoL) in children. The SN-5 questionnaire is an important assessment tool for pediatric CRS. This study aimed to evaluate potential prognostic factors for treatment of pediatric CRS within the Hebrew version of the SN-5 questionnaire.MethodsA prospective study in pediatric otolaryngology unit. Patients were treated either surgically or pharmacologically. Following informed consent, parents of pediatric CRS patients completed the translated and validated Hebrew version (SN-5H) prior to treatment and after three months. We analyzed the results of both treatment arms according to success (achieving minimal clinically important difference; MCID).Results102 children aged 5-12 years and their caregivers participated (74 CRS patients and 28 controls without CRS). SN-5H items scores were significantly higher in CRS patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). Baseline activity scores were higher, while baseline emotional scores were lower in MCID( +) CRS patients, compared to MCID(-) CRS patients (p < 0.05). High emotional stress and low activity scores at baseline were associated with poorer odds to achieve MCID.ConclusionsThe SN-5H questionnaire is invaluable tool for assessing pediatric CRS patients. Psychosocial aspects of CRS significantly affect QoL and should be addressed in the office pre-treatment. The SN-5H can aid in highlighting patients in need for further reassurance and psychosocial support to manage expectations, and to improve QoL.

AB  - Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures and neurobiological, physiological, mood, and cognitive consequences. In the last decade, the beneficial effects of regular physical exercise have been investigated in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy. However, data on its beneficial effects and underlying mechanisms are still insufficient. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of endurance training, applied before and after pilocarpine (Pilo) administration, on status epilepticus (SE) severity, and its relation to epileptogenesis deleterious consequences during the chronic epileptic phase. Long-term aerobic training, applied four weeks before SE and eight weeks after SE, elevated the threshold to induce SE and reduced spontaneous motor seizures. The protective effect of this alternative approach on seizure susceptibility resulted in improved memory responses, and alleviated comorbid depression in epileptic rats. The exercised epileptic rats had improved markers of oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation and increasing the levels of glutathione and activity of superoxide dismutase in the rat hippocampus. Aerobic training managed to ameliorate the neuroinflammation by decreasing the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that regular physical training predisposes the subjects to crucial plastic changes, leading to increased resistance to SE and the development of epileptogenesis.

AB  - Background: The metabolites derived from judicious dietary choices play a crucial role in the management and treatment of depression. Hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) functions as a receptor for various diet-derived metabolites. Although a growing body of evidence indicates these metabolites exert beneficial effects on depression, the precise mechanisms underlying these benefits require further investigation.Methods: We established a mouse model of corticosterone (Cor)-induced depression to evaluate the therapeutic potential of HCAR2 activation on depression. A series of behavioral experiments were conducted to investigate whether HCAR2 activation could alleviate depressive-like behaviors in mice. The neuroprotective effects of HCAR2 in the hippocampus were examined using Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in mouse serum were quantified, as well as the cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of hippocampal neurons co-cultured with primary microglia. Microglia-associated neuroinflammation was evaluated by quantifying pro-inflammatory cytokines using ELISA, and by assessing the polarization state of M1 microglia, including the mRNA expression levels of M1 markers and double fluorescence staining for inducible nitric oxide synthase/ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (iNOS/Iba1). The expression level of proteins in the protein kinase B-inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunits alpha and beta-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (AKT-IKK alpha beta-NF kappa B) pathway in primary microglia was analyzed using western blot. Transcriptomic changes in microglia induced by HCAR2 activation were examined through RNA sequencing. Mice were fed PLX5622 chow to deplete microglia in vivo.Results: Activation of HCAR2 by its agonist MK-6892 in a Cor-induced model of depression significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors, attenuated hippocampal neuronal injury, increased serum monoamine levels, reduced microglia-associated neuroinflammation, and inhibited the expression of proteins in the AKT-IKK alpha beta-NF kappa B pathway in primary microglia. Additionally, HCAR2 activation markedly enhanced hippocampal neuronal viability and decreased LDH activity in this co-culture system. Importantly, these protective effects were abolished in HCAR2 knockout mice. RNA sequencing revealed that HCAR2 activation induced changes in multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the depletion of microglia also eliminated the protective effects of MK-6892.Conclusion: Activation of HCAR2 can reduce depressive-like behaviors, neuronal injury, and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest these neuroprotective effects are, at least in part, mediated through modulation of microglial activity by HCAR2.

AB  - Evidence indicates a bidirectional link between depressive symptoms and neuroinflammation. This study evaluated chronic cannabidiol (CBD) treatment effects in male and female rats subjected to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model of depression. We analyzed the gene expression related to neuroinflammation, cannabinoid signaling, estrogen receptors, and specific microRNAs in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), CA1, and ventral subiculum (VS). UCMS influenced immobility in a sex-specific manner, increasing it in males and decreasing it in females, effects that were reversed by CBD. CBD also normalized the UCMS-induced upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the CA1 and VS in males. In both sexes, UCMS induced the upregulation of the nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NF-kappa B1) gene in the VS, which was unaffected by CBD. Additionally, CBD reversed CB1 downregulation in the VS of males but not in the vmPFC of either sex. In males, CBD restored the UCMS-induced downregulation of VS estrogen receptor genes ER alpha and ER beta. UCMS also altered miR-146a-5p expression, downregulating it in females (VS) and upregulating it in males (CA1), with no CBD effect. These findings highlight the sex-specific mechanisms of CBD's antidepressant effect, with hippocampal neuroinflammatory and estrogenic pathways playing a key role in males.

AB  - Widespread environmental contamination caused by huge amounts of wastes generated by human activities has become a critical global concern that requires urgent action. The black soldier fly (BSFL) has gradually been used to treat different wastes due to high efficiency and low cost. However, little information is available regarding the treatment of mixed wastes by BSFLs. The impact of BSFLs on conversion of cow manure (COM) and pig manure (PM) via the incorporation of wet distiller grains (WDG) was assessed. Results demonstrate that the waste reduction rate was increased by 20% by incorporating 45% WDG to COM and PM. The bioconversion rate of BSFLs in COM and PM also increased from 1.20 & PLUSMN; 0.02% and 0.92 & PLUSMN; 0.02% to 10.54 & PLUSMN; 0.06% and 10.05 & PLUSMN; 0.11%, respectively. Total nitrogen content and & delta;N-15/N-14 ratios of WDG + COM and WDG + PM were found to be significantly lower than those of COM and PM alone (p < 0.01). The organic matter changes during manure degradation were further analyzed by combing ultraviolet-visible spectrum (UV-vis) with excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy techniques and fluorescence area integration (FRI) method. The UV-vis spectra results indicate that the addition of WDG to manures resulted in the decreased aromaticity and molecular weight of the waste. EEM spectra demonstrated that the accumulative P-i,P-n values of regions III and V in COM, COM + WDG, PM, and PM + WDG were 58%, 49%, 52% and 63%, respectively. These results not only provide new insights into the potential of mixed wastes for BSFL treatment but also contribute to the basis for the formulation of effective management measurements that reduce and/or reuse these wastes.

AB  - Oleanolic acid (OA), asiatic acid (AA), and maslinic acid (MA) are ubiquitous isomeric triterpene phytochemicals with many pharmacological effects. To improve their application value, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce RAW264.7 cells and studied the differences in the anti-inflammatory effects of the triterpenes according to their structural differences. MTT, Griess, and immunofluorescence assays, ELISA, flow cytometry, and Western blotting, were performed. The release of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin (IL-6), was significantly inhibited by OA, AA, and MA at the same concentration, and AA and MA promoted the production of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. OA, AA, and MA inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappa B nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells. OA and AA inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P38, and JNK1/2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, OA increased LPS-induced Nrf2 expression and decreased Keap1 expression in RAW264.7 cells. OA, AA, and MA inhibited LPS-stimulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and alleviated mitochondrial membrane potential depletion. Overall, our data suggested that OA, AA, and MA exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. In particular, OA and AA take effects through the MAPKs, NF-kappa B, and Nrf2 signaling pathways.

AB  - Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are mesh-like structures on the surfaces of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory and other neurons, and consist of proteoglycans such as aggrecan, brevican, and neurocan. PNNs regulate the Excitatory/Inhibitory (E/I) balance in the brain and are formed at the closure of critical periods of plasticity during development. PNN formation is disrupted in Fragile X Syndrome, which is caused by silencing of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (Fmr1) gene and loss of its protein product FMRP. FXS is characterized by impaired synaptic plasticity resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability and E/I imbalance. Here, we investigate how PNN formation is altered in FXS. PNNs are reduced in Fmr1 KO mouse brain when examined by staining for the lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutin (WFA) and aggrecan. Examination of PNNs by WFA staining at P14 and P42 in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex shows that they were reduced in these brain regions at P14 but mostly less so at P42 in Fmr1 KO mice. However, some differential FMRP regulation of PNN development in these brain regions persists, perhaps caused by asynchrony in PNN development between brain regions in wild-type animals. During development, aggrecan PNN levels in the brain were reduced in all brain regions in Fmr1 KO mice. Aggrecan mRNA levels were unchanged at these times, suggesting that FMRP is normally an activator of aggrecan mRNA translation. This hypothesis is buttressed by the observations that FMRP binds aggrecan mRNA and that ribosome profiling data show that aggrecan mRNA is associated with reduced numbers of ribosomes in Fmr1 KO mouse brain, indicating reduced translational efficiency. Moreover, aggrecan mRNA poly(A) tail length is also reduced in Fmr1 KO mouse brain, suggesting a relationship between polyadenylation and translational control. We propose a model where FMRP modulates PNN formation through translational up-regulation of aggrecan mRNA polyadenylation and translation.

AB  - It has been revealed that hypothalamic neurons containing the peptide, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) can influence learning [1] and memory formation [2], but the cellular mechanisms by which they perform this function are not well understood. Here, we examine the role of MCH neural input to the hippocampus, and show in vitro that optogenetically increasing MCH axon activity facilitates hippocampal plasticity by lowering the threshold for synaptic potentiation. These results align with increasing evidence that MCH neurons play a regulatory role in learning, and reveal that this could be achieved by modulating plasticity thresholds in the hippocampus.

AB  - Cognitive impairments related to changes in deep gray matter and other brain regions occur in up to 70% of people with multiple sclerosis. But do such brain changes also occur in patients without significant cognitive impairment? Eighteen participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and fifteen healthy controls participated in this study. Cognitive status, depression, and fatigue were assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Inventory of Cognition (MUSIC), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). fMRI was recorded while a participant performed the modified attention network test (ANT). The effects of ANT executive attention network on hemodynamic activation of a priori defined regions of interest, including the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus, caudate nucleus, pallidum, and putamen were studied. The individual lesion load was estimated. For fMRI data analysis a general linear model with randomization statistics including threshold-free cluster enhancement as implemented in the FSL software was used. Participants with RRMS showed reduced activation of the executive attention network in the hippocampus, pallidum, and ACC. The thalamus was involved in both group activations but did not differ between groups. In summary, functional changes in the brain can also be demonstrated in RRMS patients without cognitive deficits. The affected brain regions can best be assigned to the attention network for executive control. This association could likely serve as a biological indicator of susceptibility to imminent cognitive impairment in MS.

AB  - The electrical and biological interfacial properties of invasive electrodes have a significant impact on the performance and longevity of neural recordings in the brain. In this study, we demonstrated rapid electrophoretic deposition and electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) on metal-based neural electrodes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and other characterizations confirmed the existence of a uniform and effectively reduced graphene oxide coating. Electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ErGO) coated Pt/Ir neural electrodes exhibited 15.2-fold increase in charge storage capacity (CSC) and 90% decrease in impedance with only 3.8% increase in electrode diameter. Patch clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging of primary rat hippocampus neurons cultured on ErGO demonstrated that there was no adverse impact on the functional development of neurons. Immunostaining showed a balanced growth of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and astrocytes. Acute recordings from the auditory cortex and chronic recordings (19 days) from the somatosensory cortex found ErGO coating improved the performance of neural electrodes in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and amplitude of signals. The proposed approach not only provides an in-depth evaluation of the effect of ErGO coating on neural electrodes but also widens the coating methods of commercial neural electrodes.

AB  - Synapses provide the main route of signal transduction within neuronal networks. Many factors regulate critical synaptic functions. These include presynaptic calcium channels, triggering neurotransmitter release, and postsynaptic ionotropic receptors, mediating excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. The key features of synaptic transmission and plasticity can be studied in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Here, we describe a protocol for the preparation and electrophysiological analysis of paired hippocampal neurons. This model system allows the selective genetic manipulation of one neuron in a simple neuronal network formed by only two hippocampal neurons. Bi-directionally analyzing synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity allows the analysis of both pre- and postsynaptic effects on synaptic transmission. For example, with one single paired network synaptic responses induced by both, a wild-type neuron and a genetically modified neuron can be directly compared. Ultimately, this protocol allows experimental modulation and hence investigation of synaptic mechanisms and thereby improves previously developed methods of studying synaptic transmission and plasticity in ex vivo cultured neurons.

AB  - Gelatin is a water-soluble natural polyampholyte with poor mucoadhesive properties. It has traditionally been used as a major ingredient in many pharmaceuticals, including soft and hard capsules, suppositories, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. The mucoadhesive properties of gelatin can be improved by modifying it through conjugation with specific adhesive unsaturated groups. In this study, gelatin was modified by reacting with crotonic, itaconic, and methacrylic anhydrides in varying molar ratios to yield crotonoylated-, itaconoylated-, and methacryloylated gelatins (abbreviated as Gel-CA, Gel-IA, and Gel-MA, respectively). The successful synthesis was confirmed using 1H NMR, FTIR spectroscopies, and colorimetric TNBSA assay. The effect of chemical modification on the isoelectric point was studied through viscosity and electrophoretic mobility measurements. The evolution of the storage (G') and loss (G'') moduli was employed to determine thermoreversible gelation points of modified and unmodified gelatins. The safety of modified gelatin derivatives was assessed with an in vivo slug mucosal irritation test (SMIT) and an in vitro MTT assay utilizing human pulmonary fibroblasts cell line. Two different model dosage forms, such as physical gels and spray-dried microparticles, were prepared and their mucoadhesive properties were evaluated using a flow-through technique with fluorescent detection and a tensile test with ex vivo porcine vaginal tissues and sheep nasal mucosa. Gelatins modified with unsaturated groups exhibited superior mucoadhesive properties compared to native gelatin. The enhanced ability of gelatin modified with these unsaturated functional groups is due to the formation of covalent bonds with cysteine-rich subdomains present in the mucin via thiol-ene click Michael-type addition reactions occurring under physiologically relevant conditions.

AB  - The biology and morphology of the uterus were explored at approximately one month postpartum for cows that were diagnosed with metritis (uterine disease; n = 18) or healthy (n = 17) at 7-10 days postpartum and either treated or untreated with ceftiofur hydrochloride (2 x 2 factorial). Cows were slaughtered at one month postpartum, and the uterine horns were flushed to identify cows with a purulent or clear (non-purulent) content. RNA was isolated from caruncular and inter-caruncular endometria for RNA sequencing. Light microscopy was used to quantify inflammation, and scanning electron microscopy was used to assess the closure of the luminal surface of the uterus and the morphology of uterine glands. Results were that postpartum antibiotic treatment did not affect the endpoints that were measured including gene expression and morphology of the uterus. The primary biological driver of uterine function and morphology was inflammation at one month postpartum (endometritis; purulent material in the uterine lumen). Inflammation decreased epithelial growth factor signaling pathway expression (Wnt, Hippo, and Hedgehog) and biological processes involved in the formation of ciliated cells. Based on morphology, epithelial cells closed open areas of a denuded uterine surface using a process that involved depolarization and cell movement (planar cell polarity). Non-canonical Wnt signaling drives planar cell polarity, and the loss of Wnt signaling may explain the slower tissue repair in cows with endometritis. Future studies and therapeutic treatments should consider uterine involution as a process of wound repair and tissue regeneration in the face of bacterial infection.
   Sentence Inflammation in the bovine uterus at one month postpartum decreases gene expression for Wnt, Hippo, and Hedgehog signaling pathways and slows developmental and regenerative processes in the endometrium.

AB  - Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a genetic disorder triggered by depolarizing muscle relaxants or halogenated inhalational anesthetics in genetically predisposed individuals who have a chronic elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) in their muscle cells. We have reported that the muscle dysregulation of [Ca2+](i) impairs glucose uptake, leading to the development of insulin resistance in two rodent experimental models. In this study, we simultaneously measured the [Ca2+](i) and glucose uptake in single enzymatically isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons from wild-type (WT) and MH-R163C mice. The [Ca2+](i) was recorded using a Ca2+-selective microelectrode, and the glucose uptake was assessed utilizing the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG. The MH-R163C hippocampal neurons exhibited elevated [Ca2+](i) and impaired insulin-dependent glucose uptake compared with the WT neurons. Additionally, exposure to isoflurane exacerbated these deficiencies in the MH-R163C neurons, while the WT neurons remained unaffected. Lowering [Ca2+](i) using a Ca2+-free solution, SAR7334, or dantrolene increased the glucose uptake in the MH-R163C neurons without significantly affecting the WT neurons. However, further reduction of the [Ca2+](i) below the physiological level using BAPTA decreased the insulin-dependent glucose uptake in both genotypes. Furthermore, the homogenates of the MH-R163C hippocampal neurons showed an altered protein expression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and GLUT4 compared with the WT mice. Our study demonstrated that the chronic elevation of [Ca2+](i) was sufficient to compromise the insulin-dependent glucose uptake in the MH-R163C hippocampal neurons. Moreover, reducing the [Ca2+](i) within a specific range (100-130 nM) could reverse insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).

AB  - This study examined the effects of cobalt supplementation, given from three months prepartum to nine months postpartum, on lactation performance, reproductive efficiency, blood biochemistry, colostrum immunoglobulin levels, and hormonal profiles in she-camels, along with the growth of their calves. Twenty Maghrabi she-camels, weighing 489 +/- 2.31 kg and aged 6-9 years, were used in this study. The camels were divided into four groups: one control group fed only the basal diet, and three treatment groups receiving 0.16, 0.32, and 0.48 mg of cobalt per kg of feed as cobalt glucoheptonate. Results indicated that cobalt supplementation significantly increased colostrum immunoglobulin concentrations (IgG, IgM, and IgA), as well as monthly milk yield and lactation period. Milk contents of total solids, protein, and lactose also improved in the supplemented groups, particularly at 0.32 mg/kg cobalt. Additionally, pre- and post-partum serum cobalt, vitamin B12, T3, T4, progesterone, and estradiol levels were higher in the cobalt-treated groups. Enhanced reproductive outcomes included shorter postpartum intervals to first estrus, reduced services per conception, and improved weaning weights and average daily gains of calves in all cobalt-supplemented groups. In conclusion, dietary cobalt supplementation at a level of 0.32 mg/kg from three months prepartum to nine months postpartum significantly enhanced the lactation and reproductive performance of Maghrabi she-camels, increased colostrum immunoglobulin levels, and positively affected the growth performance of their calves.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and moderate exercise holds promise in ameliorating the ongoing neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Here, we investigated whether exerciseenriched blood plasm could yield a beneficial therapeutic effect on AD pathologies and cognitive decline in transgenic AD (P301S) mice. In this investigation, a cohort of 2-month-old C57BL/6 mice were granted continuous access to either a running wheel or a fixed wheel for 6 weeks. After that, their plasmas were extracted and subsequently injected intravenously into 4.5-month-old P301S mice biweekly over a 6-week period. A comprehensive methodology was then employed, integrating behavioral tests, pathology assessments, and biochemical analyses to unveil the potential anti-dementia implications of exercise-enriched blood plasma in P301S mice. Upon systemic administration, the findings revealed a noteworthy attenuation of hippocampusdependent behavioral impairments in P301S mice. Conversely, blood plasma from sedentary counterparts exhibited no discernible impact. These effects were intricately associated with the mitigation of neuroinflammation, the augmentation of hippocampal adult neurogenesis, and a reduction of synaptic impairments following the administration of exercise-enriched blood plasma. These findings advance the proposition that administering exercise-enriched blood plasma may serve as an effective prophylactic measure against AD, opening avenues for further exploration and potential therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Although association between hearing impairment and dementia has been widely documented by epidemiological studies, the role of auditory sensory deprivation in cognitive decline remains to be fully understood. To address this issue we investigated the impact of hearing loss on the onset and time-course of cognitive decline in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that is the 3xTg-AD mice and the underlying mechanisms. We found that hearing loss induced by noise exposure in the 3xTg-AD mice before the phenotype is manifested caused persistent synaptic and morphological alterations in the auditory cortex. This was associated with earlier hippocampal dysfunction, increased tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and redox imbalance, along with anticipated memory deficits compared to the expected time-course of the neurodegenerative phenotype. Our data suggest that a mouse model of AD is more vulnerable to central damage induced by hearing loss and shows reduced ability to counteract noise-induced detrimental effects, which accelerates the neurodegenerative disease onset.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a purified form of tau protein kinase II (TPKII), mediates abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation through activation by its cofactor p25. The resulting Cdk5-p25 complex promotes the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta, contributing to elevated expression of the microglial marker Iba-1, an established feature of tauopathy-driven neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396/404 disrupts microtubule stability, leading to neuronal dysfunction, synaptic loss, and cognitive deficits. Notably, approximately 25% of children surviving cerebral malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa experience cognitive impairments, underscoring the urgent need for neuroprotective therapies. In this study, we employed an experimental cerebral malaria model to assess the therapeutic potential of four polycyclic derivatives, SR4-01 to SR4-04, as adjuncts to artemether. We evaluated their efficacy in attenuating Cdk5-p25-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396, with the goal of restoring neuronal architecture and cognitive function. Behavioral assessments included the Barnes maze for long-term memory, T-maze for short-term memory, and a novelty-based recognition task. Among the treatment groups, SR4-02 and SR4-04 demonstrated significant improvements in learning and memory compared to both artemether monotherapy and the SR4-01 and SR4-03 groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus and cortex showed reduced phospho-tau (Ser396) expression in the SR4-02 and SR4-04 groups. Golgi-Cox staining further revealed enhanced neuronal arborization in the CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus and in the cortex. Western blot analysis confirmed reduced Cdk5-p25-mediated tau phosphorylation in the SR4-04 treated group. Collectively, our findings suggest that SR4-02 and SR4-04 hold promise as adjunctive therapies for reducing tau pathology and restoring cognitive function in cerebral malaria-associated neurodegeneration.

AB  - The interaction between brain serotonin (5-HT) deficiency and environmental adversity may predispose females to excessive aggression. Specifically, complete inactivation of the gene encoding tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2) results in the absence of neuronal 5-HT synthesis and excessive aggressiveness in both male and female null mutant (Tph(2)(-/-)) mice. In heterozygous male mice (Tph2(+/-)), there is a moderate reduction in brain 5-HT levels, and when they are exposed to stress, they exhibit increased aggression. Here, we exposed female Tph2(+/-) mice to a five-day rat predation stress paradigm and assessed their emotionality and social interaction/aggression-like behaviors. Tph2(+/-) females exhibited excessive aggression and increased dominant behavior. Stressed mutants displayed altered gene expression of the 5-HT receptors Htr1a and Htr2a, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), and c fos as well as myelination-related transcripts in the prefrontal cortex: myelin basic protein (Mbp), proteolipid protein 1 (Plp1), myelin-associated glycoprotein (Mag), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (Mog). The expression of the plasticity markers synaptophysin (Syp) and cAMP response element binding protein (Creb), but not AMPA receptor subunit A2 (GluA2), were affected by genotype. Moreover, in a separate experiment, naive female Tph2(+/-) mice showed signs of enhanced stress resilience in the modified swim test with repeated swimming sessions. Taken together, the combination of a moderate reduction in brain 5-HT with environmental challenges results in behavioral changes in female mice that resemble the aggression-related behavior and resilience seen in stressed male mutants; additionally, the combination is comparable to the phenotype of null mutants lacking neuronal 5-HT. Changes in myelination-associated processes are suspected to underpin the molecular mechanisms leading to aggressive behavior.

AB  - Sauropus androgynus has become an essential plant in pharmaceutical formulations due to its beneficial antioxidant phytochemical components, participating in the antioxidant defense system and playing an important role in protecting human health. However, no research has been conducted on ruminant animals. This study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical profiles and biological potential of S. androgynus leaf extracts for ruminant health. Methanolic and hexanoic extracts from each commercially and noncommercially cultivated site were prepared over the course of five consecutive months. By means of HPLC-DAD, vitamins (ascorbic acid), essential oils (eugenol), tannins (gallic acid), cinnamic acids (caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, sinapic acid and ferulic acid), and flavonoids (catechin, rutin, myricetin, quercetin, apigenin, and kaempferol) were detected. Variations in phytochemical composition were depending on solvent type but not on cultivation site or sample period. Methanolic extracts contained more phytochemicals than hexanoic extracts. Ascorbic acid and rutin were discovered to be the two most abundant phytochemicals in the methanolic extract of S. androgynus leaf, followed by essential oils, cinnamic acids, and tannins. In comparison to hexanoic extract, methanolic extract of S. androgynus demonstrated to be more efficient against oxidation scavenging: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (IC50 = 13.14 +/- 0.055 (mg/mL)), nitric oxide (IC50 = 55.02 +/- 1.338 (mg/mL)) and superoxide (IC50 = 25.31 +/- 0.886 (mg/mL)), as well as alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 9.83 +/- 0.032 (mg/mL)). Similarly, methanolic was found to be more protective than hexanoic against oxidative damage in ruminant erythrocytes, with IC50 values (mg/mL) for hemoglobin oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and hemolysis of 11.96 +/- 0.011, 13.54 +/- 0.012, and 5.940 +/- 0.005, respectively. These findings suggested that the leaves of S. androgynus are a prospective source of phytochemical substances with health-promoting qualities for ruminant production.

AB  - Rapid and effective methods for tracing the geographic origin of wildlife samples are essential for tackling the illegal wildlife trade. Traditional morphological categorization methods are often inadequate as relying on the mitochondrial COXI barcode is insufficient for determining geographic populations. To address these limitations, we developed a bioinformatics-based pipeline for the rapid identification of traceable nuclear genome loci. This pipeline has been applied to the whole-genome sequence (WGS) data of China's flagship species, the snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus spp.). These species are known for sex-biased dispersal and hybrid speciation, which complicates genealogy tracing. Using phylogenetic principles, we employed the Robinson and Foulds (RF) distance and scanned over 1,850,726 population-specific loci, identifying five pairs that can trace genealogy origins rapidly and cost-effectively using PCR. Additionally, we found that relying only on mitochondrial genetic information is insufficient for rapid and accurate traceability to subspecies-level geographic populations. Our pipeline efficiently identifies loci and traces the geographic origin of snub-nosed monkey individuals, providing a valuable tool for species preservation and combating the wildlife trade. This approach can be extended to other species, aiding in the conservation of endangered wildlife and tracing criminal evidence.

AB  - The brain encodes the statistical regularities of the environment in a task-specific yet flexible and generalizable format. Here, we seek to understand this process by bridging two parallel lines of research, one centered on sensorimotor timing, and the other on cognitive mapping in the hippocampal system. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a fast-paced time-to-contact (TTC) estimation task, we found that the hippocampus signaled behavioral feedback received in each trial as well as performance improvements across trials along with reward-processing regions. Critically, it signaled performance improvements independent from the tested intervals, and its activity accounted for the trial-wise regression-to-the-mean biases in TTC estimation. This is in line with the idea that the hippocampus supports the rapid encoding of temporal context even on short time scales in a behavior-dependent manner. Our results emphasize the central role of the hippocampus in statistical learning and position it at the core of a brain-wide network updating sensorimotor representations in real time for flexible behavior.

AB  - Purpose Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBSs) are the de facto standard for representing objects in computer-aided design (CAD). The purpose of this paper is to discuss how to stick to this standard in all phases of the additive manufacturing (AM) workflow, from the CAD object to the final G-code, bypassing unnecessary polygonal approximations. Design/methodology/approach The authors use a commercial CAD system (Rhino3D along with its programming environment Grasshopper) for direct slicing of the model, offset generation and trimming. Circular arcs are represented as quadratic NURBSs and free-form geometry as quadratic or cubic polynomial B-splines. Therefore, circular arcs are directly expressible as G2/G3 G-code commands, whereas free-form paths are rewritten as a succession of cubic Bezier curves, thereby admitting exact translation into G5 commands, available in firmware for AM controllers, such as Marlin. Findings Experimental results of this paper confirm a considerable improvement in quality over the standard AM workflow, consisting of an initial polygonization of the object (e.g. via standard tessellation language), slicing this polygonal approximation, offsetting the polygonal sections and, finally, generating G-code made up of polyline trajectories (G1 commands). Originality/value A streamlined AM workflow is obtained, with a seamless transfer from the initial CAD description to the final G-code. By adhering to the NURBS standard at all steps, the authors avoid multiple representations and associated errors resulting from approximations.

AB  - The sense of direction is critical for survival in changing environments and relies on flexibly integrating self-motion signals with external sensory cues. While the anatomical substrates involved in head direction (HD) coding are well known, the mechanisms by which visual information updates HD representations remain poorly understood. Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in forming coherent representations of space in mammals and it encodes a variety of navigational variables, including HD. Here, we use simultaneous two-area tetrode recording to show that RSC HD representation is nearly synchronous with that of the anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (ADn), the obligatory thalamic relay of HD to cortex, during rotation of a prominent visual cue. Moreover, coordination of HD representations in the two regions is maintained during darkness. We further show that anatomical and functional connectivity are consistent with a strong feedforward drive of HD information from ADn to RSC, with anatomically restricted corticothalamic feedback. Together, our results indicate a concerted global HD reference update across cortex and thalamus.

AB  - Recent studies indicate a crucial role for neuronal glycogen storage and degradation in memory formation. We have previously identified alpha-amylase (alpha-amylase), a glycogen degradation enzyme, located within synaptic-like structures in CA1 pyramidal neurons and shown that individuals with a high copy number variation of alpha-amylase perform better on the episodic memory test. We reported that neuronal alpha-amylase was absent in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that this loss corresponded to increased AD pathology. In the current study, we verified these findings in a larger patient cohort and determined a similar reduction in alpha-amylase immunoreactivity in the molecular layer of hippocampus in AD patients. Next, we demonstrated reduced alpha-amylase concentrations in oligomer amyloid beta 42 (A beta(42)) stimulated SH-SY5Y cells and neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) with PSEN1 mutation. Reduction of alpha-amylase production and activity, induced by siRNA and alpha-amylase inhibitor Tendamistat, respectively, was further shown to enhance glycogen load in SH-SY5Y cells. Both oligomer A beta(42) stimulated SH-SY5Y cells and hiPSC neurons with PSEN1 mutation showed, however, reduced load of glycogen. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of alpha-amylase within synapses of isolated primary neurons and show that inhibition of alpha-amylase activity with Tendamistat alters neuronal activity measured by calcium imaging. In view of these findings, we hypothesize that alpha-amylase has a glycogen degrading function within synapses, potentially important in memory formation. Hence, a loss of alpha-amylase, which can be induced by A beta pathology, may in part underlie the disrupted memory formation seen in AD patients.

AB  - Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a nutrient-dense, climate-resilient pseudocereal with growing relevance to food and nutritional security. However, its potential remains underutilized due to suboptimal levels of key micronutrients. In this study, to apply CRISPR-Cas9 for the simultaneous enhancement of multiple nutrients in quinoa, marking a significant advancement in crop biofortification, we employed multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to target five genes involved in lysine transport, phytic acid biosynthesis, and vitamin C and E biosynthetic pathways. Both knockout and homology-directed knock-in strategies were applied to induce heritable mutations in genes such as CqAAP1, CqIPK1, CqGGP, and CqHPT. Homology-directed knock-in refers to a precise gene-editing method that uses a template to insert specific genetic changes at targeted sites in the genome. Edited lines exhibited significant improvements in seed nutrient concentrations, including lysine (+35 %), zinc (+43 %), vitamin C (+114 %), and vitamin E (+45 %), without yield or growth penalties. Wholetranscriptome profiling via RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) identified 1284 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05), predominantly associated with amino acid metabolism, redox regulation, and vitamin biosynthesis. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses confirmed the transcriptional activation of nutrient assimilation and antioxidant pathways. Integration of qRT-PCR with RNA-Seq confirmed the reliability of expression data. Structural validations of edits were performed using PCR, gel electrophoresis, and Sanger sequencing. Phenotypic assessments, including seed weight, morphology, and exploratory herbivory assays, confirmed agronomic stability. This study presents a technically validated framework for simultaneous nutritional trait stacking in quinoa using nucleic acid engineering tools. Our findings offer critical insights into the transcriptional plasticity of quinoa and establish a functional genomics platform for developing multi-nutrient biofortified crops to address hidden hunger and advance sustainable food systems.

AB  - Activation of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) pathway ameliorates secondary injury mechanisms after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI); therefore, we assessed the effect of a therapeutic IL-4 administration on secondary brain damage after experimental TBI. We subjected 100 C57/Bl6 wildtype mice to controlled cortical impact (CCI) and administered IL-4 or a placebo control subcutaneously 15 min thereafter. Contusion volume (Nissl staining), neurological function (hole board, video open field, and CatWalkXT((R))), and the immune response (immunofluorescent staining) were analyzed up to 28 days post injury (dpi). Contusion volumes were significantly reduced after IL-4 treatment up to 14 dpi (e.g., 6.47 +/- 0.41 mm(3) vs. 3.80 +/- 0.85 mm(3), p = 0.011 3 dpi). Macrophage invasion and microglial response were significantly attenuated in the IL-4 group in the acute phase after CCI (e.g., 1.79 +/- 0.15 Iba-1+/CD86+ cells/sROI vs. 1.06 +/- 0.21 Iba-1/CD86+ cells/sROI, p = 0.030 in the penumbra 3 dpi), whereas we observed an increased neuroinflammation thereafter (e.g., mean GFAP intensity of 3296.04 +/- 354.21 U vs. 6408.65 +/- 999.54 U, p = 0.026 in the ipsilateral hippocampus 7 dpi). In terms of functional outcome, several gait parameters were improved in the acute phase following IL-4 treatment (e.g., a difference in max intensity of 7.58 +/- 2.00 U vs. 2.71 +/- 2.44 U, p = 0.041 3 dpi). In conclusion, the early single-dose administration of IL-4 significantly reduces secondary brain damage in the acute phase after experimental TBI in mice, which seems to be mediated by attenuation of macrophage and microglial invasion.

AB  - Wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) display well-developed anoxia tolerance as one component of their capacity to endure prolonged whole-body freezing during the winter months. Under anoxic conditions, multiple cellular responses are triggered to efficiently cope with stress by suppressing gene transcription and promoting activation of mechanisms that support cell survival. Activation of the Hippo signaling pathway initiates a cascade of protein kinase reactions that end with phosphorylation of YAP protein. Multiple pathway components of the Hippo pathway were analyzed via immunoblotting, qPCR or DNA-binding ELISAs to assess the effects of 24 h anoxia and 4 h aerobic recovery, compared with controls, on liver and heart metabolism of wood frogs. Immunoblot results showed significant increases in the relative levels of multiple proteins of the Hippo pathway representing an overall activation of the pathway in both organs under anoxia stress. Upregulation of transcript levels further confirmed this. A decrease in YAP and TEAD protein levels in the nuclear fraction also indicated reduced translocation of these proteins. Decreased DNA-binding activity of TEAD at the promoter region also suggested repression of gene transcription of its downstream targets such as SOX2 and OCT4. Furthermore, changes in the protein levels of two downstream targets of TEAD, OCT4 and SOX2, established regulated transcriptional activity and could possibly be associated with the activation of the Hippo pathway. Increased levels of TAZ in anoxic hearts also suggested its involvement in the repair mechanism for damage caused to cardiac muscles during anoxia. In summary, this study provides the first insights into the role of the Hippo pathway in maintaining cellular homeostasis in response to anoxia in amphibians.

AB  - Accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) is a driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid precursor protein (App) knock-in mouse models recapitulate AD-associated A beta pathology, allowing elucidation of downstream effects of A beta accumulation and their temporal appearance upon disease progression. Here we have investigated the sequential onset of AD-like pathologies in App(NL-F) and App(NL-G-F) knock-in mice by time-course transcriptome analysis of hippocampus, a region severely affected in AD. Strikingly, energy metabolism emerged as one of the most significantly altered pathways already at an early stage of pathology. Functional experiments in isolated mitochondria from hippocampus of both App(NL-F) and App(NL-G-F) mice confirmed an upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation driven by the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and V, associated with higher susceptibility to oxidative damage and Ca2+-overload. Upon increasing pathologies, the brain shifts to a state of hypometabolism with reduced abundancy of mitochondria in presynaptic terminals. These late-stage mice also displayed enlarged presynaptic areas associated with abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicles and autophagosomes, the latter ultimately leading to local autophagy impairment in the synapses. In summary, we report that A beta-induced pathways in App knock-in mouse models recapitulate key pathologies observed in AD brain, and our data herein adds a comprehensive understanding of the pathologies including dysregulated metabolism and synapses and their timewise appearance to find new therapeutic approaches for AD.

AB  - Morphine withdrawal evokes neuronal apoptosis through mechanisms that are still under investigation. We have previously shown that morphine withdrawal increases the levels of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a proneurotrophin that promotes neuronal apoptosis through the binding and activation of the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR). In this work, we sought to examine whether morphine withdrawal increases p75NTR-driven signaling events. We employed a repeated morphine treatment-withdrawal paradigm in order to investigate biochemical and histological indicators of p75NTR-mediated neuronal apoptosis in mice. We found that repeated cycles of spontaneous morphine withdrawal promote an accumulation of p75NTR in hippocampal synapses. At the same time, TrkB, the receptor that is crucial for BDNF-mediated synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, was decreased, suggesting that withdrawal alters the neurotrophin receptor environment to favor synaptic remodeling and apoptosis. Indeed, we observed evidence of neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, including activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and increased active caspase-3. These effects were not seen in saline or morphine-treated mice which had not undergone withdrawal. To determine whether p75NTR was necessary in promoting these outcomes, we repeated these experiments in p75NTR heterozygous mice. The lack of one p75NTR allele was sufficient to prevent the increases in phosphorylated JNK and active caspase-3. Our results suggest that p75NTR participates in the neurotoxic and proinflammatory state evoked by morphine withdrawal. Because p75NTR activation negatively influences synaptic repair and promotes cell death, preventing opioid withdrawal is crucial for reducing neurotoxic mechanisms accompanying opioid use disorders.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that a large-scale brain network transforms others' pain into its vicarious representation in the observer, potentially modulating helping behavior. However, the neuromolecular basis of individual differences in vicarious pain and helping is poorly understood. We investigated the role of the endogenous mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system in altruistic costly helping. MOR density was measured using [11C]carfentanil. In a separate fMRI experiment, participants could donate money to reduce a confederate's pain from electric shocks. Participants were generally willing to help, and brain activity was observed in amygdala, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and thalamus when witnessing others' pain. Haemodynamic responses were negatively associated with MOR availability in emotion circuits. However, MOR availability positively associated with the ACC and hippocampus during helping. These findings suggest that the endogenous MOR system modulates altruism in the human brain.
   This PET-fMRI fusion study reveals that endogenous u-opioid receptor system modulates altruistic brain activity and its individual differences.

AB  - Cognitive impairment has been reported in patients with myocardial infarction despite a successful reperfusion therapy. Several modes of cell death are involved in brain damage during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Although apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis inhibitors provided neuroprotection against cerebral I/R injury, the effects of these cell death inhibitors on the brain following cardiac I/R injury have never been investigated. We hypothesized that apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis inhibitors attenuate brain damage following cardiac I/R injury. One-hundred and twenty-six male rats were used: 6 rats were assigned to sham operation and 120 rats were subjected to 30-min regional cardiac ischemia and 120-min reperfusion. Rats in cardiac I/R group were pretreated with either vehicle (n = 12) or one of cell death inhibitors. Rats treated with apoptosis, necroptosis, or ferroptosis inhibitor were subdivided into three different doses including low (L), medium (M), and high (H) doses (n = 12/group). Z-VAD, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) were used as apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis inhibitor, respectively. Rats were sacrificed at the end of reperfusion, and the brain was used to analyze dendritic spine density, Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related proteins, blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junction proteins, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and cell death. Our data showed that cardiac I/R led to brain damage and only apoptosis occurred in the hippocampus after cardiac I/R injury. In the cardiac I/R group, treatment with M-Z-VAD and all doses of Nec-1 decreased hippocampal apoptosis and amyloid beta aggregation, thereby reducing dendritic spine loss. M- and H-Fer-1 also reduced dendritic spine loss by suppressing ACSL4, TNF-alpha, amyloid beta, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, Bax/Bcl-2 was decreased in all treatment regimen except L-Z-VAD. Additionally, M-Z-VAD and M-Fer-1 partially attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction. Only L-Nec-1 preserved BBB proteins. In conclusion, cell death inhibitors prevented hippocampal dendritic spine loss caused by cardiac I/R injury through different mechanisms.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), limbic predominant TDP-43 proteinopathy (LATE), and amygdala-predominant Lewy body disease (LBD) are proteinopathies that, together with hippocampal sclerosis, progressively appear in the elderly affecting from 50% to 99% of individuals aged 80 years, depending on the disease. These disorders usually converge on the same subject and associate with additive cognitive impairment. Abnormal Tau, TDP-43, and alpha-synuclein pathologies progress following a pattern consistent with an active cell-to-cell transmission and abnormal protein processing in the host cell. However, cell vulnerability and transmission pathways are specific for each disorder, albeit abnormal proteins may co-localize in particular neurons. All these alterations are unique or highly prevalent in humans. They all affect, at first, the archicortex and paleocortex to extend at later stages to the neocortex and other regions of the telencephalon. These observations show that the phylogenetically oldest areas of the human cerebral cortex and amygdala are not designed to cope with the lifespan of actual humans. New strategies aimed at reducing the functional overload of the human telencephalon, including optimization of dream repair mechanisms and implementation of artificial circuit devices to surrogate specific brain functions, appear promising.

AB  - The positive effect of herbal supplements on aging and age-related disorders has led to the evolution of natural curatives for remedial neurodegenerative diseases in humans. The advancement in aging is exceedingly linked to oxidative stress. Enhanced oxidative stress interrupts health of humans in various ways, necessitating to find stress alleviating herbal resources. Currently, minimal scientifically validated health and cognitive booster resources are available. Therefore, we explored the impact of plant extracts in different combinations on oxidative stress, life span and cognition using the multicellular transgenic humanized C. elegans, and further validated the same in Mus musculus, besides testing their safety and toxicity. In our investigations, the final product-the HACBF (healthy ageing cognitive booster formulation) thus developed was found to reduce major aging biomarkers like lipofuscin, protein carbonyl, lipid levels and enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes. Further confirmation was done using transgenic worms and RT-PCR. The cognitive boosting activities analyzed in C. elegans and M. musculus model system were found to be at par with donepezil and L-dopa, the two drugs which are commonly used to treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. In the transgenic C. elegans model system, the HACBF exhibited reduced aggregation of misfolded disease proteins oc-synuclein and increased the health of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, levels of Acetylcholine and Dopamine contents respectively, the major neurotransmitters responsible for memory, language, learning behavior and movement. Molecular studies clearly indicate that HACBF upregulated major genes responsible for healthy aging and cognitive booster activities in C. elegans and as well as in M. musculus. As such, the present herbal product thus developed may be quite useful for healthy aging and cognitive boosting activities, and more so during this covid-19 pandemic.
