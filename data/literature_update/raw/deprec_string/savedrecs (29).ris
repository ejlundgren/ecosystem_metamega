AB  - P21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), as a member of the PAK family, has been implicated in various functions during somatic mitosis; however, less is known about its role during oocyte meiosis. Herein, we highlight the indispensable role of PAK1 in regulating spindle assembly and cell cycle progression during the first meiotic division of porcine oocytes. First, we found that the activated PAK1 expressed dynamically, and its subcellular localization was tightly associated with the spindle dynamics during meiosis in porcine oocytes. Specific inhibition of PAK1 activity by inhibitor targeting PAK1 activation-3 (IPA-3) led to impaired extrusion of the first polar body (PB1); with most of the IPA-3-treated oocytes arrested at germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and subjected to failure of bipolar spindle formation. However, the adverse effects caused by IPA-3 on oocytes could be restored by reducing disulfide bonds between PAK1 and IPA-3 with dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment. Furthermore, the co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PAK1 interacted directly with Aurora A and transforming acidic coiled coil 3 (TACC3), providing an additional explanation for the similar localization of Aurora A and activated PAK1. Additionally, inhibiting the activity of PAK1 decreased the expression of p-Aurora A and p-TACC3; however, the reduced activity of Aurora A and TACC3 could be restored by DTT. In conclusion, PAK1 plays a crucial role in the proper assembly of the spindle during the first meiotic division of porcine oocytes, and the regulation of PAK1 is associated with its effects on p-Aurora A and p-TACC3 expression.

AB  - The isocortex and hippocampal formation (HPF) in the mammalian brain play critical roles in perception, cognition, emotion, and learning. We profiled similar to 1.3 million cells covering the entire adult mouse isocortex and HPF and derived a transcriptomic cell-type taxonomy revealing a comprehensive repertoire of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron types. Contrary to the traditional view of HPF as having a simpler cellular organization, we discover a complete set of glutamatergic types in HPF homologous to all major subclasses found in the six-layered isocortex, suggesting that HPF and the isocortex share a common circuit organization. We also identify large-scale continuous and graded variations of cell types along isocortical depth, across the isocortical sheet, and in multiple dimensions in hippocampus and subiculum. Overall, our study establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian isocortex and hippocampal formation and begins to shed light on its underlying relationship with the development, evolution, connectivity, and function of these two brain structures.

AB  - There is growing attention on natural substances capable of stimulating the cholinergic system and of exerting antioxidant effects, as potential therapeutic agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the expected neuroprotective mechanisms of myrtenal (M) in an experimental model of dementia in rats. Dementia was induced in male Wistar rats by scopolamine (Sc) administration (0.1 mg/kg for 8 days and 20.0 mg/kg on day 9). The animals were divided into 5 groups (1) Controls; (2) Sc; (3) Sc + Myrtenal (40 mg/kg), (4) Sc + Galantamine (1 mg/kg); (5) Sc + Lipoic acid (30 mg/kg). Changes in recognition memory and habituation were evaluated via the Novel Object Recognition and Open Field tests. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, ACh levels, and changes in oxidative status of the brain were measured biochemically. The histological changes in two brain regions-cortex and hippocampus, were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Myrtenal improved recognition memory and habituation, exerted antioxidant effects and significantly increased ACh brain levels. Histologically, the neuroprotective capacity of myrtenal was also confirmed. For the first time, we have demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of myrtenal in an experimental model of dementia. Our study provides proof-of-concept for the testing of myrtenal, in association with standard of care treatments, in patients affected by cognitive decline.

AB  - Objective High-altitude hypoxia exposure often damages hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Nogo-A is an important axonal growth inhibitory factor. However, its function in high-altitude hypoxia and its mechanism of action remain unclear. Methods In an in vivo study, a low-pressure oxygen chamber was used to simulate high-altitude hypoxia, and genetic or pharmacological intervention was used to block the Nogo-A/NgR1 signaling pathway. Contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze behavioral tests were used to assess learning and memory in rats, and synaptic damage in the hippocampus and changes in oxidative stress levels were observed. In vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were used to assess oxidative stress and mitochondrial function with or without Nogo-A knockdown in Oxygen Glucose-Deprivation/Reperfusion (OGD/R) models. Results Exposure to acute high-altitude hypoxia for 3 or 7 days impaired learning and memory in rats, triggered oxidative stress in the hippocampal tissue, and reduced the dendritic spine density of hippocampal neurons. Blocking the Nogo-A/NgR1 pathway ameliorated oxidative stress, synaptic damage, and the learning and memory impairment induced by high-altitude exposure. Conclusion Our results demonstrate the detrimental role of Nogo-A protein in mediating learning and memory impairment under high-altitude hypoxia and suggest the potential of the Nogo-A/NgR1 signaling pathway as a crucial therapeutic target for alleviating learning and memory dysfunction induced by high-altitude exposure.

AB  - Very little is known about the range, diet and eco-ethology of the African striped hyena, compared to its sympatric hyena species; the spotted hyena. Here we present the results of bone assemblages collected in eight striped hyena dens located in a pastoralists' area in and near the Shompole conservancy, southern Kenya. We present the dens taxonomical representation; comparing domestic and wildlife prey and their prey age structure. This is to aid in making inferences on the striped hyena's prey acquisition, selection and mode of transportation. Ultimately, this is to highlight the species' interaction with pastoralists and some eco-ethological features of this little known near threatened species. Total wildlife proportions were higher than livestock. However, both wild and domestic ungulates are the major prey of the striped hyena and carnivores constitute a greater proportion of its non-ungulate prey. Striped hyena appears to predate on younger livestock when their dens are located closer to human settlements than those away from human occupied areas. Juveniles and old adults of wild ungulates dominated the striped hyena dens than the prime adults and this was reversed in the case of livestock ungulates.

AB  - Two new species of cestodes were described from the Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii (Muller and Henle) (Rhinopristiformes: Rhinobatidae), from coastal waters off Argentina in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Rhinebothrium quequense n. sp. (Rhinebothriidea) differs from its congeners by a combination of morphological characters, including the total number of loculi, the absence of loculi at the level of bothridial constriction, the number of testes per proglottid, and the number of proglottids per worm. Caulobothrium pieroi n. sp. ("Tetraphyllidea") can be distinguished from the other members of the genus by the following set of morphological features including the presence of stalked bothridia with apical sucker, the number of loculi per bothridium, the number of testes per proglottid, and the number of proglottids per worm. The discovery of R. quequense n. sp. and C. pieroi n. sp. in the Brazilian guitarfish not only increases the number of rhinebothriideans and "tetraphyllideans" in the southwestern Atlantic, but also expands the elasmobranchs list to include P. horkelii for the first time as a new host record for cestodes globally. In addition, this is not only the first report of a species of Rhinebothrium in rhinobatids in the region, but it is also the first Caulobothrium species infecting a rhinopristiform batoid.

AB  - Axonal sprouting of dentate gyrus (DG) afferents after entorhinal cortex (EC) lesion is a model preparation to assess lesion-induced functional reorganization in a denervated target structure. Following a unilateral EC lesion, the surviving contralateral entorhinal projection, termed the crossed temporodentate pathway (CTD), and the heterotypic septal input to the DG, the septodentate pathway (SD), undergo extensive axonal sprouting. We explored whether EC lesion alters the capacity of the SD pathway to influence CTD-evoked granule cell excitability in the DG. We recorded extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) after CTD stimulation alone and paired SD-CTD stimulation. Male rats were given unilateral EC lesions or sham operations; evoked fEPSPs in the DG were recorded at 4-, 15-, and 90-days post-entorhinal lesion to assess functional reorganization of the CTD and SD pathways. We found significantly increased fEPSP amplitudes in cases with unilateral lesions compared to sham-operates at 15- and 90-days post lesion. Within each time point, paired SDCTD stimulation resulted in significantly depressed fEPSP amplitudes compared to amplitudes evoked after CTD stimulation alone and this effect was solely seen in cases with EC lesion. In cases where granule cell discharge was observed, SD stimulation increased discharge amplitude elicited by the CTD stimulation at 90-days postlesion. These findings demonstrate that synaptic remodeling following unilateral cortical lesion results in a synergistic interaction between two established hippocampal afferents that is not seen in uninjured brains. This work may be important for models of neurodegenerative disease and neural injury that target these structures and associated hippocampal circuitry.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates a pivotal role for chronic inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. G protein-coupled formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) mediates pro-inflammatory or anti-/pro-resolving effects upon stimulation with biased agonists. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a new FPR2 ureidopropanamide agonist, compound MR-39, on neuroinflammatory processes in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) derived from control (WT) and knockout FPR2-/- mice (KO) exposed to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS). Higher LPS-induced cytokine expression and basal release were observed in KO FPR2 cultures than in WT cultures, suggesting that a lack of FPR2 enhances the OHCs response to inflammatory stimuli. Pretreatment with MR-39 abolished some of the LPS-induced changes in the expression of genes related to the M1/M2 phenotypes (including Il-1 beta, Il-6, Arg1, Il-4, Cd74, Fizz and Cx3cr1) and TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-4 release in tissue derived from WT but not KO mice. Receptor specificity was confirmed by adding the FPR2 antagonist WRW4, which abolished the abovementioned effects of MR-39. Further biochemical data showed an increase in the phospho-p65/total p65 ratio after LPS stimulation in hippocampal tissues from both WT and KO mice, and MR-39 only reversed this effect on WT OHCs. LPS also increased TRAF6 levels, which are critical for the TLR4-mediated NF-kappa B pro-inflammatory responses. MR-39 attenuated the LPS-evoked increase in the levels of the NLRP3 and caspase-1 proteins in WT but not KO hippocampal cultures. Since NLRP3 may be involved in the pyroptosis, a lytic type of programmed cell death in which the main role is played by Gasdermin D (GSDMD), we examined the effects of LPS and/or MR-39 on the GSDMD protein level. LPS only increased GSDMD production in the WT tissues, and this effect was ameliorated by MR-39. Collectively, this study indicates that the new FPR2 agonist efficiently abrogates LPS-induced neuroinflammation in an ex vivo model, as evidenced by a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and release as well as the downregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome-related pathways.

AB  - Avian influenza A virus H5N1 is a highly pathogenic and persistently a major threat to global health. Vaccines and antibodies targeting hemagglutinin (HA) protein are the primary management strategies for the epidemic virus. Although camelids possess unique immunological features, the immune response induced by specific antigens has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Herein, we immunized an alpaca with the HA antigen of the H5N1 virus and performed single-cell transcriptome profiling for analysis of longitudinal peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) behavior using single-cell sequencing technology (scRNA-seq). We revealed multiple cellular immunities during the immunization. The monocytes continued to expand after immunization, while the plasma cells reached their peak three days after the second antigen stimulation. Both monocytes and B cells were stimulated by the HA antigen and produced cell-type-specific cytokines to participated in the immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the HA-specific immunological dynamics of alpaca PBMCs at the single-cell level, which is beneficial for understanding the anti-viral immune system and facilitating the development of more potent vaccines and antibodies in camelid animals.

AB  - We investigated the alterations of hippocampal and reticulo-thalamic (RT) GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and their synaptic re-organizations underlying the prodromal local sleep disorders in the distinct rat models of Parkinson's disease (PD). We demonstrated for the first time that REM sleep is a predisposing state for the high-voltage sleep spindles (HVS) induction in all experimental models of PD, particularly during hippocampal REM sleep in the hemiparkinsonian models. There were the opposite underlying alterations of the hippocampal and RT GABAergic PV+ interneurons along with the distinct MAP2 and PSD-95 expressions. Whereas the PD cholinopathy enhanced the number of PV+ interneurons and suppressed the MAP2/PSD-95 expression, the hemiparkinsonism with PD cholinopathy reduced the number of PV+ interneurons and enhanced the MAP2/PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus. Whereas the PD cholinopathy did not alter PV+ interneurons but partially enhanced MAP2 and suppressed PSD-95 expression remotely in the RT, the hemiparkinsonism with PD cholinopathy reduced the PV+ interneurons, enhanced MAP2, and did not change PSD-95 expression remotely in the RT. Our study demonstrates for the first time an important regulatory role of the hippocampal and RT GABAergic PV+ interneurons and the synaptic protein dynamic alterations in the distinct rat models of PD neuropathology.

AB  - Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Here, we use a multi-omics approach to uncover the molecular factors underlying this heterogeneity. Transcriptomic analysis of 84 PNEN specimens, drawn from two cohorts, is substantiated with proteomic profiling and identifies four subgroups: Proliferative, PDX1-high, Alpha cell-like and Stromal/Mesenchymal. The Proliferative subgroup, consisting of both well- and poorly differentiated specimens, is associated with inferior overall survival probability. The PDX1-high and Alpha cell-like subgroups partially resemble previously described subtypes, and we further uncover distinctive metabolism-related features in the Alpha cell-like subgroup. The Stromal/Mesenchymal subgroup exhibits molecular characteristics of YAP1/WWTR1(TAZ) activation suggestive of Hippo signaling pathway involvement in PNENs. Whole-exome sequencing reveals subgroup-enriched mutational differences, supported by activity inference analysis, and identifies hypermorphic protooncogene variants in 14.3% of sequenced PNENs. Our study reveals differences in cellular signaling axes that provide potential directions for PNEN patient stratification and treatment strategies.

AB  - Optogenetics is a combination of optical and genetic technologies used to activate or, conversely, inhibit specific cells in living tissues. The possibilities of using optogenetics approaches for the treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are being actively researched. In recent years, it has become clear that one of the most important players in the development of AD is astrocytes. Astrocytes affect amyloid clearance, participate in the development of neuroinflammation, and regulate the functioning of neural networks. We used an adeno-associated virus carrying the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter driving the optogenetic channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) gene to transduce astrocytes in primary mouse hippocampal cultures. We recorded the bioelectrical activity of neural networks from day 14 to day 21 of cultivation using multielectrode arrays. A single optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes at 14 day of cultivation (DIV14) did not cause significant changes in neural network bioelectrical activity. Chronic optogenetic stimulation from DIV14 to DIV21 exerts a stimulatory effect on the bioelectrical activity of primary hippocampal cultures (the proportion of spikes included in network bursts significantly increased since DIV19). Moreover, chronic optogenetic stimulation over seven days partially preserved the activity and functional architecture of neuronal network in amyloidosis modeling. These results suggest that the selective optogenetic activation of astrocytes may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for combating AD.

AB  - In the case of incomplete episodic memory retrieval, semantic knowledge may play a vital role compared to random memory errors in filling in memory gaps (semantic substitution). Stress impairs (episodic) memory retrieval via stress hormones (mainly cortisol) targeting the hippocampus. This preregistered neuroimaging study aimed to examine the neural mechanisms of the interplay between episodic memories and prior knowledge during the reconstruction of a past scenario under elevated cortisol levels in men. During encoding, sixty men prepared a virtual apartment for having guests over by using button presses to interact with household objects (e. g., toasting a slice of bread) that were placed congruently to semantic knowledge (e.g., a coffee machine in the kitchen) or incongruently (e.g., a toaster in the bathroom). One day later, participants received (order randomized, double-blind) either 20 mg of cortisol (n = 30) or a placebo (n = 30) before a recognition task. After identifying objects as old, we included a room recall using a forced-choice question in which room the objects were remembered. For incongruent objects this allowed us to differentiate the involvement of episodic, semantic, or random memory. Cortisol did not impair general recognition memory. The manipulation of stimuli during encoding, as being congruent and interactable (relevant to the goal) appears to be predictive of later accurate room recall. Semantic substitution in case of episodic memory failure was associated with anterior parahippocampal and gyrus rectus activation. Cortisol administration increased hippocampal activation during semantic substitution, suggesting a compensatory effect. The results characterized the neural correlates of semantic substitution and speak for an intertwined view of episodic memory and semantic knowledge, which is further shaped by the stress hormone cortisol.

AB  - Background/objectives: The porcine intestinal epithelium plays a fundamental role as a defence interface against pathogens. Its alteration can cause severe inflammatory conditions and diseases. Hyperosmotic stress under physiological conditions and upon pathogen challenge can cause malabsorption. Different cell types counteract the osmolarity increase by accumulating organic osmolytes such as betaine, taurine, and myo-inositol through specific transporters. Betaine is known for protecting cells from hyperosmotic stress and has positive effects when fed to pigs. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the modulation of osmolyte transporters gene expression in IPEC-J2 during osmolarity changes and assess the effects of betaine. Methods: IPEC-J2 were seeded in transwells, where differentiate as a polarized monolayer. Epithelial cell integrity (TEER), oxidative stress (NO) and gene expression of osmolyte transporters, tight junction proteins (TJp) and pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Results: Cells treated with NaCl hyperosmolar medium (500 mOsm/L) showed a TEER decrease at 3 h and detachment within 24 h, associated with an osmolyte transporters reduction. IPEC-J2 treated with mannitol hyperosmolar medium (500 mOsm/L) upregulated taurine (TauT), myo-inositol (SMIT) and betaine (BGT1) transporters expression. A decrease in TJp expression was associated with a TEER decrease and an increase in TNF alpha, IL6, and IL8. Betaine could attenuate the hyperosmolarity-induced reduction in TEER and TJp expression, the NO increase and cytokines upregulation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the expression of osmolyte transporters in IPEC-J2, which was upregulated upon hyperosmotic treatment. Betaine counteracts changes in intracellular osmolarity by contributing to maintaining the epithelial barrier function and reducing the inflammatory condition. Compatible osmolytes may provide beneficial effects in therapies for diseases characterized by inflammation and TJp-related dysfunctions.

AB  - As current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) lack disease-modifying interventions, novel therapies capable of restraining AD progression and maintaining better brain function have great significance. Anti-inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) hold promise as a disease-modifying biologic for AD. This study directly addressed this issue by examining the effects of intranasal (IN) administrations of hiPSC-NSC-EVs in 3-month-old 5xFAD mice. IN administered hiPSC-NSC-EVs incorporated into microglia, including plaque-associated microglia, and encountered astrocyte soma and processes in the brain. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptomic changes indicative of diminished activation of microglia and astrocytes. Multiple genes linked to disease-associated microglia, NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-inflammasome and interferon-1 (IFN-1) signalling displayed reduced expression in microglia. Adding hiPSC-NSC-EVs to cultured human microglia challenged with amyloid-beta oligomers resulted in similar effects. Astrocytes also displayed reduced expression of genes linked to IFN-1 and interleukin-6 signalling. Furthermore, the modulatory effects of hiPSC-NSC-EVs on microglia in the hippocampus persisted 2 months post-EV treatment without impacting their phagocytosis function. Such effects were evidenced by reductions in microglial clusters and inflammasome complexes, concentrations of mediators, and end products of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the expression of genes and/or proteins involved in the activation of p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase and IFN-1 signalling, and unaltered phagocytosis function. The extent of astrocyte hypertrophy, amyloid-beta plaques, and p-tau were also reduced in the hippocampus. Such modulatory effects of hiPSC-NSC-EVs also led to better cognitive and mood function. Thus, early hiPSC-NSC-EV intervention in AD can maintain better brain function by reducing adverse neuroinflammatory signalling cascades, amyloid-beta plaque load, and p-tau. These results reflect the first demonstration of the efficacy of hiPSC-NSC-EVs to restrain neuroinflammatory signalling cascades in an AD model by inducing transcriptomic changes in activated microglia and reactive astrocytes.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the effect of cryoprotectant glycerol addition in different phases of sperm equilibration on sperm motility and viability parameters of thawed ram spermatozoa. The purpose of this study was to compare two strategies of glycerol addition for sperm cryo-preservation. The first strategy included the use of a glycerol-free extender for the procedure of glycerol-free equilibration and chilling, with the glycerolation of the extender by 6% glycerol shortly before sperm slow freezing. The second strategy included the use of a freezing extender already glycerolated by 6% glycerol before the equilibration and chilling of sperm and following slow freezing. The obtained results were statistically significant and demonstrated that the glycerol-free equilibration with the addition of glycerol at least 10 min before freezing is the best strategy for cryopreservation of Wallachian ram sperm. This represents a perspective strategy in the cryopreservation process for local sheep breeds and indicates a potential strategy to test for ram cryopreservation in a generalized manner.This study investigated the effect of glycerol added in different phases of sperm equilibration on CASA and flow cytometry parameters of thawed ram spermatozoa. Sperm was collected from adult Wallachian rams. The freezing extender was glycerol-free ANDROMED((R)) (Minitub GmbH, Tiefenbach, Germany) supplied by 6% exogenous glycerol at different stages of the cryopreservation process. The purpose of this study was to compare two strategies of glycerol addition for sperm cryopreservation. The first strategy included the use of a glycerol-free extender for the procedure of glycerol-free equilibration and chilling, with the glycerolation of the extender by 6% glycerol shortly before sperm slow freezing (GFA). The second strategy included the use of a freezing extender already glycerolated by 6% glycerol before the equilibration and chilling of sperm and following slow freezing (GA). Sperm samples were analyzed after equilibration (but before freezing) and after thawing (at T0, T1 h, and T2 h time points). iSperm((R)) mCASA (Aidmics Biotechnology Co., LTD., Taipei, Taiwan) was used for the evaluation of sperm kinematics. Flow cytometry was used to measure sperm viability (plasma membrane/acrosome intactness) and mitochondrial membrane potential. The obtained results significantly demonstrated that the glycerol-free equilibration with the addition of glycerol shortly before freezing is a perspective strategy for cryopreservation of Wallachian ram sperm.

AB  - The circadian clock refers to the formation of a certain rule in the long-term evolution of an organism, which is an invisible 'clock' in the body of an organism. As one of the largest TF families in higher plants, the MYB transcription factor is involved in plant growth and development. MYB is also inextricably correlated with the circadian rhythm. In this study, the transcriptome data of the tea plant 'Baiyeyihao' were measured at a photoperiod interval of 4 h (24 h). A total of 25,306 unigenes were obtained, including 14,615 unigenes that were annotated across 20 functional categories within the GO classification. Additionally, 10,443 single-gene clusters were annotated to 11 sublevels of metabolic pathways using KEGG. Based on the results of gene annotation and differential gene transcript analysis, 22 genes encoding MYB transcription factors were identified. The G10 group in the phylogenetic tree had 13 members, of which 5 were related to the circadian rhythm, accounting for 39%. The G1, G2, G8, G9, G15, G16, G18, G19, G20, G21 and G23 groups had no members associated with the circadian rhythm. Among the 22 differentially expressed MYB transcription factors, 3 members of LHY, RVE1 and RVE8 were core circadian rhythm genes belonging to the G10, G12 and G10 groups, respectively. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect and validate the expression of the gene transcripts encoding MYB transcription factors associated with the circadian rhythm.

AB  - Background: The highly oncogenic avian alpha herpes virus known as Marek's disease virus (MDV) raises concerns about its potential oncogenicity in humans. In this article, authors examine the potential epidemic risks associated with MDV, taking into account the current epidemic and epizootic situation in the Russian Federation, with a particular focus on the modern practices of pig and poultry farming. Given its oncogenic properties, MDV remains a cause for concern in the field of avian herpesviruses.
   Methods: The study was conducted in 2010-2022 in poultry farms Russian Federation, Republic of Belarus and the Republic of Kazakhstan where authors monitored the rate of vesicular enteritis and MDV. In total, 155 epizootics were examined, including the analysis of 62 epizootics of vesicular enteritis and the population of the studied area exceeded 1 million people.
   Results: The authors of the study found that vesicular enteritis, distributed over poultry farms in the Russia since 2011, and its safety for the population remains unknown. The increasing incidence of vesicular enteritis was also accompanied by various health issues in contact persons and veterinary personnel, as well as abnormal and in sync increases in infectious laryngotracheitis and MDV in young birds.
   Conclusion: Authors come to the conclusion that the consequences of COVID-19 are accompanied by a deficiency of folic acid, which in turn leads to a risk of developing diseases associated with DNA viruses.It is concluded that MDV may contribute to the development of reproductive and breast cancers, highlighting the need for increased awareness and attention to the health risks associated with poultry farming and further research in this area.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide. AD does not have a cure and most drug development efforts in the AD field have been focused on targeting the amyloid pathway based on the "amyloid cascade hypothesis". However, in addition to the amyloid pathway, substantial evidence also points to dysregulated neuronal calcium (Ca2+) signaling as one of the key pathogenic events in AD, and it has been proposed that pharmacological agents that stabilize neuronal Ca2+ signaling may act as disease-modifying agents in AD. In previous studies, we demonstrated that positive allosteric regulators (PAMs) of the Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump might act as such Ca2+ stabilizing agents. In the present study, we report the development of a novel SERCA PAM agent, compound NDC-1173. To test the effectiveness of this compound, we performed behavioral studies with the APP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse model. We also evaluated effects of this compound on expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the SERCA pump is a potential novel therapeutic drug target and that NDC-1173 is a promising lead molecule for developing disease-modifying agents in AD.

AB  - Weaning piglets usually suffer from severe diarrhea (commonly known as postweaning diarrhea, PWD) along with intestinal motility disorder. Intestinal peristalsis is mainly regulated by the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus (LM-MP). To understand the relationship between intestinal LM-MP function and the development of PWD, we compared the intestinal electrical activity, and the transcriptional profile of the LM-MP between 21-day-old piglets (just weaned, n=7) and 24-day-old piglets (suffered the most severe weaning stress, n=7). The results showed that 24-day-old piglets exhibited different degrees of diarrhea. A significant increase in the slow-wave frequency in the ileum and colon was observed in 24-day-old piglets, while c-kit expression in the intestinal LM-MPs was significantly decreased, indicating that PWD caused by elevated slow-wave frequency may be associated with loss of c-kit. The real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that intestinal LM-MPs in 24-day-old piglets may undergo inflammation and oxidative stress. Significant increases in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and decreases in thioredoxin suggest that weaning may lead to DNA damage in the LM-MP of 24-day-old piglets. In addition, activating transcription factor 3 was significantly upregulated, indicating nerve damage in the LM-MP of 24-day-old piglets. The transcriptomic results showed that most of the differentially expressed genes in the ileal LM-MP after weaning were downregulated and closely related to the cell cycle process. Subsequent RT-qPCR analysis showed that the relative expression of p21 was upregulated, while the expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was downregulated in the ileal and colonic LM-MP of 24-day-old piglets, suggesting that weaning may inhibit cell proliferation and cause G1/S cell cycle arrest in ileal and colonic LM-MP. In conclusion, weaning may lead to cell cycle arrest by causing DNA damage in the LM-MP, impairing intestinal motility regulation, and ultimately leading to diarrhea in piglets.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of pathological tau and amyloid-P (AP) drive synaptic loss and cognitive decline. The injection of misfolded tau aggregates extracted from human AD brains drives templated spreading of tau pathology within WT mouse brain. Here, we assessed the impact of AP copathology, of deleting loci known to modify AD risk (Ptk2b, Grn, and Tmem106b) and of pharmacological intervention with an Fyn kinase inhibitor on tau spreading after injection of AD tau extracts. The density and spreading of tau inclusions triggered by human tau seed were unaltered in the hippocampus and cortex of APPswe/PSEN1 Delta E9 transgenic and AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in mice. In mice with human tau sequence replacing mouse tau, template matching enhanced neuritic tau burden. Human AD brain tau-enriched preparations contained aggregated AP, and the AP coinjection caused a redistribution of AP aggregates in mutant AD model mice. The injection-induced AP phenotype was spatially distinct from tau accumulation and could be ameliorated by depleting AP from tau extracts. These data suggest that AP and tau pathologies propagate by largely independent mechanisms after their initial formation. Altering the activity of the Fyn and Pyk2 (Ptk2b) kinases involved in AP-oligomer-induced signaling, or deleting expression of the progranulin and TMEM106B lysosomal proteins, did not alter the somatic tau inclusion burden or spreading. However, mouse aging had a prominent effect to increase the accumulation of neuritic tau after injection of human AD tau seeds into WT mice. These studies refine our knowledge of factors capable of modulating tau spreading.

AB  - (1) Aims: To test a newly designed helical-wire hook electrode implanted in the bladder wall to induce contraction and promote voiding. (2) Methods: In three minipigs with a created lesion of the sacral spinal cord, four electrodes were implanted in the bladder wall, ventral to the trigone. Stimulation tests were conducted initially in conscious pigs, and later after general anesthesia. (3) Results: Electrical stimulation in the conscious animals on postoperative days 4 and 7 at 40 Hz was limited to 10 mA, because of abdominal, leg, and anal contractions with animal discomfort; bladder contractions were not induced. Electrical stimulation on postoperative days 9 and 28 at 60 mA under anesthesia induced sustained vesical wall contractions with bladder pressure variations, but without voiding. Simultaneous abdominal contractions occurred, with strong leg and anal contractions. Subsequent stimulation with a single set of electrodes or at 20 Hz induced less vesical pressure response. At autopsy, the electrodes had not migrated, and extraction forces were high, at 7.9 +/- 0.9 Newtons (n = 12). (4) Conclusions: Our 28-day study has confirmed the utility of the new electrode design, preventing migration from the bladder wall and making it suitable for long-term electrode implants.

AB  - The paper explores enhancing the mechanical behavior of stochastic lattice structures through a semi-controlled design approach. By leveraging the Gibson-Ashby model and predefined geometric routines, the study aims to optimize the mechanical response of lattice structures under compressive stress. Transitioning from stochastic to semi-controlled tessellation using Rhinoceros 7 software enables more predictable deformation behavior. Design parameters such as node formation, strut thickness, and lattice generation patterns are correlated with relative density to regulate stiffness and strength. Experimental validation using Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile (ASA) filament demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design model. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding internal mechanics by introducing a novel design approach to control geometry and topology arrangement in shaping lattice properties. By introducing a semi-controlled mechanism, the study seeks to improve the reliability and uniformity of mechanical responses in lattice structures. The findings highlighted the benefits of semi-controlled design approaches in achieving tailored mechanical properties. Specimens were compression tested in quasi-static uniaxial loading and showed that structures created with parabolic distribution dimensioned by hp=0.5hv originated the most reliable and most vital mechanical response compared with other design models, including typical Voronoi distribution. The improved mechanical response in between proposed design models constantly progressed by about 15% on average consecutively, starting from the parabolic distribution dimensioned by hp=1.0hv as the weakest ranked, up to the best one, dimensioned by hp=0.5hv, even better than the typical Voronoi distribution. The proposed design model has introduced an entirely novel approach that significantly enhances the product's volume tessellation using routines that guarantee the validity of geometric and topologic entities. Uniaxial compression tests on lattice blocks highlighted the effect of the proposed approach on the mechanical properties of these structures, having shown particularly crucial repeatability and stability. Overall, the paper contributes to advancing the field of lightweight lattice structures through the novel design methodology and material characterization.

AB  - Nanobodies, a unique subclass of antibodies first discovered in camelid animals, are composed solely of a single heavy chain's variable region. Their significantly reduced molecular weight, in comparison to conventional antibodies, confers numerous advantages in the treatment of various diseases. As research and applications involving nanobodies expand, the quantity of identified nanobodies is also rapidly growing. However, the existing antibody databases are deficient in type and coverage, failing to satisfy the comprehensive needs of researchers and thus impeding progress in nanobody research.In response to this, we have amalgamated data from multiple sources to successfully assemble a new and comprehensive nanobody database. This database has currently included the latest nanobody data and provides researchers with an excellent search and data display interface, thus facilitating the progression of nanobody research and their application in disease treatment.In summary, the newly constructed Nanobody Library and Archive System may significantly enhance the retrieval efficiency and application potential of nanobodies. We envision that Nanobody Library and Archive System will serve as an accessible, robust and efficient tool for nanobody research and development, propelling advancements in the field of biomedicine.Database URL: https://www.nanolas.cloud

AB  - Weaning piglets usually suffer from severe diarrhea (commonly known as postweaning diarrhea, PWD) along with intestinal motility disorder. Intestinal peristalsis is mainly regulated by the longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus (LM-MP). To understand the relationship between intestinal LM-MP function and the development of PWD, we compared the intestinal electrical activity, and the transcriptional profile of the LM-MP between 21-day-old piglets (just weaned, n=7) and 24-day-old piglets (suffered the most severe weaning stress, n=7). The results showed that 24-day-old piglets exhibited different degrees of diarrhea. A significant increase in the slow-wave frequency in the ileum and colon was observed in 24-day-old piglets, while c-kit expression in the intestinal LM-MPs was significantly decreased, indicating that PWD caused by elevated slow-wave frequency may be associated with loss of c-kit. The real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that intestinal LM-MPs in 24-day-old piglets may undergo inflammation and oxidative stress. Significant increases in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and decreases in thioredoxin suggest that weaning may lead to DNA damage in the LM-MP of 24-day-old piglets. In addition, activating transcription factor 3 was significantly upregulated, indicating nerve damage in the LM-MP of 24-day-old piglets. The transcriptomic results showed that most of the differentially expressed genes in the ileal LM-MP after weaning were downregulated and closely related to the cell cycle process. Subsequent RT-qPCR analysis showed that the relative expression of p21 was upregulated, while the expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was downregulated in the ileal and colonic LM-MP of 24-day-old piglets, suggesting that weaning may inhibit cell proliferation and cause G1/S cell cycle arrest in ileal and colonic LM-MP. In conclusion, weaning may lead to cell cycle arrest by causing DNA damage in the LM-MP, impairing intestinal motility regulation, and ultimately leading to diarrhea in piglets.

AB  - Drug withdrawal is associated with abstinence symptoms including deficits in cognitive functions that may persist even after prolonged discontinuation of drug intake. Cognitive deficits are, at least partially, caused by alterations in synaptic plasticity but the precise molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully identified. In the present study, changes in proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of selected brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum) from rats abstaining for six months after cessation of chronic treatment with morphine were determined by label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomic analysis. Interestingly, prolonged morphine withdrawal was found to be associated especially with alterations in protein phosphorylation and to a lesser extent in protein expression. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis revealed enrichment in biological processes related to synaptic plasticity, cytoskeleton organization, and GTPase activity. More specifically, significant changes were observed in proteins localized in synaptic vesicles (e.g., synapsin-1, SV2a, Rab3a), in the active zone of the presynaptic nerve terminal (e.g., Bassoon, Piccolo, Rims1), and in the postsynaptic density (e.g., cadherin 13, catenins, Arhgap35, Shank3, Arhgef7). Other differentially phosphorylated proteins were associated with microtubule dynamics (microtubule-associated proteins, Tppp, collapsin response mediator proteins) and the actin-spectrin network (e.g., spectrins, adducins, band 4.1-like protein 1). Taken together, a six-month morphine withdrawal was manifested by significant alterations in the phosphorylation of synaptic proteins. The altered phosphorylation patterns modulating the function of synaptic proteins may contribute to long-term neuroadaptations induced by drug use and withdrawal.

AB  - The mammalian adult brain contains two neural stem and precursor (NPC) niches: the subventricular zone [SVZ] lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone [SGZ] in the hippocampus. From these, SVZ NPCs represent the largest NPC pool. While SGZ NPCs typically only produce neurons and astrocytes, SVZ NPCs produce neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout life. Of particular importance is the generation and replacement of oligodendrocytes, the only myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS). SVZ NPCs contribute to myelination by regenerating the parenchymal oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) pool and by differentiating into oligodendrocytes in the developing and demyelinated brain. The neurosphere assay has been widely adopted by the scientific community to facilitate the study of NPCs in vitro. Here, we present a streamlined protocol for culturing postnatal and adult SVZ NPCs and OPCs from primary neurosphere cells. We characterize the purity and differentiation potential as well as provide RNA-sequencing profiles of postnatal SVZ NPCs, postnatal SVZ OPCs and adult SVZ NPCs. We show that primary neurospheres cells generated from postnatal and adult SVZ differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes concurrently and at comparable levels. SVZ OPCs are generated by subjecting primary neurosphere cells to OPC growth factors fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA). We further show SVZ OPCs can differentiate into oligodendrocytes in the absence and presence of thyroid hormone T3. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the identities of each cell population and revealed novel immune and signalling pathways expressed in an age and cell type specific manner.

AB  - Alteration of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) coexisted with stress-generated brain disorders, including depression. Herein, we investigated the effect of SCFAs in a treatment-resistant depression (TRD) model of rat. Rats were exposed to chronic-unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) injections to generate a TRD-like phenotype. The cecal contents of these animals were engrafted into healthy-recipient rats and allowed to colonize for 4 weeks (TRD-FMT group). Blood, brain, colon, fecal, and cecal samples were collected for molecular studies. Rats exposed to CUMS + ACTH showed TRD-like phenotypes in sucrose-preference (SPT), forced swim (FST), and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. The TRD-FMT group also exhibited anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Administration of SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate at 67.5, 25, and 40 mM, respectively) for 7 days exerted robust antidepressant and antianxiety effects by restoring the levels of SCFAs in plasma and fecal samples, and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6), serotonin, GABA, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the hippocampus and/or frontal cortex of TRD and TRD-FMT animals. SCFAs treatment elevated the expression of free-fatty acid receptors 2/3, BDNF, doublecortin, and zonula-occludens, and reduced the elevated plasma levels of kynurenine and quinolinic acid and increased mucus-producing goblet cells in TRD and TRD-FMT animals. In 16S sequencing results, decreased microbial diversity in TRD rats corresponds with differences in the genus of Faecalibacterium, Anaerostipes, Allobaculum, Blautia, Peptococcus, Rombustia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, Solobacterium, Subdolibacterium, and Eubacterium ventriosum. SCFAs may impart beneficial effects via modulation of tryptophan metabolism, inflammation, neurotransmitters, and microbiota-gut-brain axis in TRD rats.

AB  - The huge amount of fish farmed around the world (about 90 million tons in 2020) requires equally large quantities of feed, which is in a great part of animal origin, as it comes from the capture of aquatic species of little commercial value, such as herring, sardines, and krill. Over the years, this crucial natural resource has been decreasing, calling for alternative sources based on plant products that are cheaper and have fewer fluctuations in price and quantity. However, a plant-based diet causes intestinal inflammation, even in fish that are herbivores, such as carp, one of the most cultivated and consumed cyprinids in the world. Zebrafish is a cyprinid that is widely used as a model for biomedical research and more recently for aquaculture. In this study, it was used to develop intestinal inflammation and evaluate the effects of tannins, polyphenols with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunostimulating properties, in counteracting the intestinal proinflammatory effects of a plant-based diet. The results show that tannins can improve the zebrafish intestinal inflammation caused by a terrestrial-plant-based diet.
   The current study evaluated the effects of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins from chestnut and quebracho wood, respectively (TSP, Silvafeed((R))), on zebrafish with intestinal inflammation induced by a plant-based diet (basal diet). Four experimental diets were prepared as follows: the basal diet + 0 TSP, the basal diet + TSP at 0.9 g/kg of feed, the basal diet + TSP at 1.7 g/kg of feed, and the basal diet + TSP at 3.4 g/kg of feed. Eighty-four zebrafish (Danio rerio) were fed for 12 days with the experimental diets. In zebrafish fed the basal diet, intestine integrity appeared to be altered, with damaged intestinal villi, high immunoexpression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and high expression of the cox2, interleukin 1 (il-1b), interleukin 8 (cxcl8-l1), and tnf alpha genes. The tannin treatment partially restored intestinal morphology and downregulated the expression of cytokines. The best activity was detected with 1.7 and 3.4 g/kg of feed. In the guts of all groups, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the most represented phyla. The most represented genera were Plesiomonas and Sphingomonas, belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum; Cetobacterium, belonging to the Fusobacteria phylum; and Lactobacillus, belonging to the Firmicutes phylum. No significant differences were detected among groups, except for a slight decrease in the Fusobacteria phylum and slight increases in the Shewanella and Bacteroides genera with TSP. In conclusion, these results suggest that tannins can improve the zebrafish intestinal inflammation caused by a terrestrial-plant-based diet in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional bowel disease, associated with a high risk of depression and anxiety. The brain-gut axis plays an important role in the pathophysiological changes involved in IBS; however, an effective treatment for the same is lacking. The natural compound costunolide (COS) has been shown to exert gastroprotective, enteroprotective, and neuroprotective effects, but its therapeutic effects in IBS are unclear. Our study explored the effect of COS on intestinal dysfunction and depressive behaviour in stress-induced IBS mice. Mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress to trigger IBS, and some were administered COS. Behavioural tests, histochemical assays, western blotting, and measurement of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the colon and hippocampus were applied to monitor the physiological and molecular consequences of COS treatment in IBS mice. COS administration relieved intestinal dysfunction and depression-like behaviours in IBS mice. Improvements in low-grade colon inflammation and intestinal mucosal permeability, inhibition of the activation of mast cells, upregulation of colonic Occludin expression, and downregulation of Claudin 2 expression were also observed. COS was also found to upregulate GluN2A, BDNF, p-ERK1/2, and p-CREB expression and 5-HT levels in hippocampal cells but inhibited 5-HT metabolism. Molecular docking showed that COS could form hydrogen bonds with the serotonin transporter (SERT) to affect the reuptake of 5-HT in the intercellular space. In conclusion, COS alleviates intestinal dysfunction and depressive behaviour in stress-induced IBS mice by inhibiting mast cell activation in the colon and regulating 5-HT metabolism in the central nervous system.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The increasing observation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in wildlife species has raised the concern of its impact on the animal health and the potential of zoonotic transmission. The molecular types of MRSA and S. aureus in wild animals has been found to mix with several molecular types from humans and livestock, indicating a dynamics of S. aureus transmission between these animals and humans. Thus, it is important to investigate the epidemiological relationship of MRSA between zoo animals and humans. To investigate the prevalence and transmission of S. aureus in non-human primates and their living environment, we conducted this study on all the non-human primates in a zoo park located in eastern China. Fecal samples from non-human primates and samples from their living environments were selectively enriched and conducted for S. aureus isolation. The whole genome analysis showed that these two MRSA t034/CC398 isolates were found from a monkey fecal sample and its living environment. The virulence factor analysis showed that these two MRSA isolates carried virulence factors relating to the cell adherence, biofilm formation, toxins, and human-associated immune evasion cluster. The further phylogenetic analysis revealed that these two MRSA isolates have a close genomic relationship with the human-associated clinical isolates from China, which indicates a potential risk of bidirectional transfer of MRSA between monkeys and humans.
   Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the important antibiotic resistant pathogens causing infections in humans and animals. The increasing observation of MRSA in wildlife species has raised the concern of its impact on animal health and the potential of zoonotic transmission. This study investigated the prevalence of S. aureus in fecal samples from non-human primates in a zoo located in Jiangsu, China, in which 6 out of 31 (19.4%) fecal samples, and 2 out of 14 (14.3%) indoor room floor swab samples were S. aureus-positive. The antibiotic susceptibility tests of the eight isolates showed that the two isolates were resistant to both penicillin and cefoxitin, the three isolates were resistant only to penicillin, while three isolates were susceptible to all detected antibiotics. The two isolates resistant to cefoxitin were further identified as MRSA by the presence of mecA. Five different spa types were identified including t034 of two MRSA isolates from Trachypithecus francoisi, t189 of two methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates from Rhinopithecus roxellana, t377 of two MSSA isolates from Colobus guereza, and two novel spa types t19488 and t19499 from Papio anubis. Whole genome sequencing analysis showed that MRSA t034 isolates belonged to ST398 clustered in clonal complex 398 (CC398) and carried the type B phi Sa3 prophage. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the two MRSA t034/ST398 isolates were closely related to the human-associated MSSA in China. Moreover, two MRSA isolates contained the virulence genes relating to the cell adherence, biofilm formation, toxins, and the human-associated immune evasion cluster, which indicated the potential of bidirectional transfer of MRSA between monkeys and humans. This study is the first to report MRSA CC398 from monkey feces in China, indicating that MRSA CC398 could colonize in monkey and have the risk of transmission between humans and monkeys.

AB  - BackgroundFor diving, marine predators, accelerometer and magnetometer data provides critical information on sub-surface foraging behaviours that cannot be identified from location or time-depth data. By measuring head movement and body orientation, accelerometers and magnetometers can help identify broad shifts in foraging movements, fine-scale habitat use and energy expenditure of terrestrial and marine species. Here, we use accelerometer and magnetometer data from tagged Australian sea lions and provide a new method to identify key benthic foraging areas. As Australian sea lions are listed as endangered by the IUCN and Australian legislation, identifying key areas for the species is vital to support targeted management of populations.MethodsFirstly, tri-axial magnetometer and accelerometer data from adult female Australian sea lions is used in conjunction with GPS and dive data to dead-reckon their three-dimensional foraging paths. We then isolate all benthic phases from their foraging trips and calculate a range of dive metrics to characterise their bottom usage. Finally, k-means cluster analysis is used to identify core benthic areas utilised by sea lions. Backwards stepwise regressions are then iteratively performed to identify the most parsimonious model for describing bottom usage and its included predictor variables.ResultsOur results show distinct spatial partitioning in benthic habitat-use by Australian sea lions. This method has also identified individual differences in benthic habitat-use. Here, the application of high-resolution magnetometer/accelerometer data has helped reveal the tortuous foraging movements Australian sea lions use to exploit key benthic marine habitats and features.ConclusionsThis study has illustrated how magnetometer and accelerometer data can provide a fine-scale description of the underwater movement of diving species, beyond GPS and depth data alone, For endangered species like Australian sea lions, management of populations must be spatially targeted. Here, this method demonstrates a fine-scale analysis of benthic habitat-use which can help identify key areas for both marine and terrestrial species. Future integration of this method with concurrent habitat and prey data would further augment its power as a tool for understanding the foraging behaviours of species.

AB  - In eusocial organisms, cooperative brood care within a colony represents a situation where the ancestral parental care duties have shifted away from the reproductive parent(s) towards their offspring. The shift to alloparental care was often instrumental in the initial emergence of eusociality, as it ultimately contributed to the establishment of the reproductive division of labour. Remarkably, eusocial taxa such as ants and termites, which still display an ancestral independent colony foundation phase, must go through an obligatory parental care period, as a temporary subsocial family unit. In termites specifically, an incipient colony inherently remains a woodroach family unit until alloparental care is established. Colony foundation success can then be limited by a series of factors that may include environmental, behavioural, symbiotic and physiological constraints. In this study, 450 incipient termite colonies (Coptotermes gestroi) were established to investigate the timing of physiological changes in founders during the transition from biparental to alloparental care. Results showed that the finite initial internal nutritional resources that alates carry during the dispersal flight are a primary limiting factor for successful colony establishment. The Coptotermes queen and king must rapidly establish (<150 days) their first cohort of offspring to reach alloparental care or simply run out of resources and die. Alates, therefore, carry just enough internal resources to produce the first few alloparents (< 15 workers) to prime the system towards colony ergonomic growth, with a definitive shift to solely reproductive functions. Eusocial insect primary reproductive traits were optimized for three successive functions within the life cycle of a colony: alate dispersal (sexual reproduction), colony foundation (parental care) and colony growth (increased egg production towards colony maturity). However, results suggest that trade-offs involving these functions appear to primarily favour dispersal ones (quantity vs. quality of alates), as founder(s) carry minimal resources and have no room for parental care inefficiency and as they then fully rely on their alloparents for further reproductive output. The transition towards alloparental care during colony foundation of eusocial insects may, therefore, reflect on the initial evolutionary transition from ancestral subsociality to eusociality.

AB  - Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) results in cognitive impairment, with mitochondrial dysfunction identified as a key contributor. The opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive mitophagy, particularly under stress conditions. Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide (Dl-NBP) has been shown to ameliorate cognitive impairment caused by CCH. However, whether Dl-NBP exerts its effects by inhibiting mPTP opening and mitigating excessive mitophagy remains unclear. In this study, we established a rat model of CCH through permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and explored the neuroprotective effects of Dl-NBP and its underlying mechanisms. The neuroprotective effects of Dl-NBP were evaluated using the Morris water maze test, and protein expression levels related to mPTP, apoptosis, and mitophagy were assessed through Western blotting and immunofluorescence. The ultrastructural changes in mitochondrial morphology and mitophagosomes were observed using transmission electron microscopy. We found that CCH led to cognitive impairment in rats, along with increased expression of p53, cytochrome-c, cleaved-Caspase3, LC3II/LC3I, Beclin1, P62, PINK1, and Parkin in the hippocampal tissue. Additionally, CCH caused an accumulation of mitophagosomes in the hippocampal tissue, although it did not affect Cyclophilin D (CypD) expression levels. However, Dl-NBP reversed these changes, except for CypD. Taken together, these findings suggest that Dl-NBP may improve cognitive impairment in CCH rats, potentially through the reduction of hippocampal neuron apoptosis by inhibiting mPTP opening and excessive mitophagy. Dl-NBP may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating cognitive impairment associated with CCH.

AB  - In contrast to cats and dogs, here we report that the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine is emetic and corresponding agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine behave as antiemetics in the least shrew model of vomiting. Yohimbine (0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) caused vomiting in shrews in a bell-shaped and dose-dependent manner, with a maximum frequency (0.85 +/- 0.22) at 1 mg/kg, which was accompanied by a key central contribution as indicated by increased expression of c-fos, serotonin and substance P release in the shrew brainstem emetic nuclei. Our comparative study in shrews demonstrates that clonidine (0, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and dexmedetomidine (0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) not only suppress yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p.)-evoked vomiting in a dose-dependent manner, but also display broad-spectrum antiemetic effects against diverse well-known emetogens, including 2-Methyl-5-HT, GR73632, McN-A-343, quinpirole, FPL64176, SR141716A, thapsigargin, rolipram, and ZD7288. The antiemetic inhibitory ID50 values of dexmedetomidine against the evoked emetogens are much lower than those of clonidine. At its antiemetic doses, clonidine decreased shrews' locomotor activity parameters (distance moved and rearing), whereas dexmedetomidine did not do so. The results suggest that dexmedetomidine represents a better candidate for antiemetic potential with advantages over clonidine.

AB  - Power ultrasound is widely used in industrial production, medical equipment, aerospace, and other fields. Currently, there are two main types of commonly used power generation devices: piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers and magnetostrictive ultrasonic transducers. However, in certain situations with limited external dimensions, the applications of existing power ultrasound devices are limited. In nature, leaf-cutting ants excite vibrations through their tiny organs. Inspired by the vibratory organs of leaf-cutting ants, a new type of biomimetic ultrasonic vibrator (BUV) comprising a scraper, dentate disc, and fixture system was proposed, fabricated, and tested in this study. The experimental results showed that the BUV could operate in the frequency range of 16.8-19 kHz. Within the working frequency range, the vibration of the BUV was stable and the amplitude of the vibration displacement was greater than 22 mu m. The operating frequency band of the BUV was broader than those of the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive ultrasonic transducers. In addition, the BUV can cut soft rubber and pig tissues with sufficient output power and load-carrying capacity. The BUV, as a new type of power ultrasonic excitation device, is expected to be applied in high-power micro operating scenarios, such as minimally invasive surgical instruments.

AB  - Brain sensory processing is not passive, but is rather modulated by our internal state. Different research methods such as non-invasive imaging methods and intracranial recording of the local field potential (LFP) have been used to study to what extent sensory processing and the auditory cortex in particular are modulated by selective attention. However, at the level of the single-or multi-units the selective attention in humans has not been tested. In addition, most previous research on selective attention has explored externally-oriented attention, but attention can be also directed inward (i.e., internal attention), like spontaneous self-generated thoughts and mind-wandering. In the present study we had a rare opportunity to record multi-unit activity (MUA) in the auditory cortex of a patient. To complement, we also analyzed the LFP signal of the macro-contact in the auditory cortex. Our experiment consisted of two conditions with periodic beeping sounds. The participants were asked either to count the beeps (i.e., an "external attention" condi-tion) or to recall the events of the previous day (i.e., an "internal attention" condition). We found that the four out of seven recorded units in the auditory cortex showed increased firing rates in "external attention" compared to "internal attention" condition. The begin-ning of this attentional modulation varied across multi-units between 30-50 msec and 130-150 msec from stimulus onset, a result that is compatible with an early selection view. The LFP evoked potential and induced high gamma activity both showed attentional modulation starting at about 70-80 msec. As the control, for the same experiment we recorded MUA activity in the amygdala and hippocampus of two additional patients. No major attentional modulation was found in the control regions. Overall, we believe that our results provide new empirical information and support for existing theoretical views on selective attention and spontaneous self-generated cognition.

AB  - The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is famous as the target of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the active ingredient of marijuana. Suppression of CB1 is frequently suggested as a drug target or gene therapy for many conditions (e.g., obesity, Parkinson's disease). However, brain networks affected by CB1 remain elusive, and unanticipated psychological effects in a clinical trial had dire consequences. To better understand the whole brain effects of CB1 suppression we performed in vivo imaging on mice under complete knockout of the gene for CB1 (cnr1(-/-)) and also under the CB1 inverse agonist rimonabant. We examined white matter structural changes and brain function (network activity and directional uniformity) in cnr1(-/-) mice. In cnr1(-/-) mice, white matter (in both sexes) and functional directional uniformity (in male mice) were altered across the brain but network activity was largely unaltered. Conversely, under rimonabant, functional directional uniformity was not altered but network activity was altered in cortical regions, primarily in networks known to be altered by THC (e.g., neocortex, hippocampal formation). However, rimonabant did not alter many brain regions found in both our cnr1(-/-) results and previous behavioral studies of cnr1(-/-) mice (e.g., thalamus, infralimbic area). This suggests that chronic loss of cnr1 is substantially different from short-term suppression, subtly rewiring the brain but largely maintaining the network activity. Our results help explain why pathological mutations in CB1 (e.g., chronic pain) do not always provide insight into the side effects of CB1 suppression (e.g., clinical depression), and thus urge more preclinical studies for any drugs that suppress CB1.

AB  - Chronic wounds are marked by an extended healing period during which damaged tissues fail to undergo orderly and timely repair. Examples of chronic wounds encompass venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic foot ulcers. The process of wound healing is complex and dynamic, relying on the interplay and response among various cells and mediators. In this study, four marketed wound dressing products based on cotton gauzes impregnated with different semisolid products (namely Betadine (R) 10%, Connettivina (R) Bio Plus Fitostimoline (R) Plus, and Non-Ad (R) gauzes) have been characterized for their physicochemical properties and ex vivo behaviors. More in detail, the pH and rheological features of semisolid formulations impregnating the gauzes were analyzed along with their ability to adhere to the gauzes. The most promising ones were selected and compared in ex vivo experiments on fresh pig skin. The pH measurements showed an acidic environment for all the tested solutions, albeit with variations in mean values, ranging from 2.66 to 4.50. The outcomes of rheological studies demonstrated that all the semisolid preparations impregnating the gauzes exhibited a pseudoplastic behavior, with significant differences in the pseudoplasticity index across the preparations, which is likely to influence their ability to adhere to the gauze. A rheological study in oscillatory mode revealed rheological behavior typical of a viscous solution only for the cream impregnating non-paraffin gauzes. The other products exhibited rheological behavior typical of a weak gel, which is expected to be advantageous as regards the capability of the semisolid preparation to create and maintain the space within the wound and to provide protection to the injured tissue. Results of ex vivo experiments demonstrated that Fitostimoline (R) Plus was more effective than Connettivina (R) Bio Plus in promoting both skin hydration and energy.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThree kinds of diet containing chicken protein isolate (CPI), bovine milk protein isolate (BMPI), and soy protein isolate (SPI), respectively, were designed to investigate the influences of proteins on cognitive levels and related mechanisms in mice. RESULTSA Morris water maze (MWM) test showed that the SPI group had a higher cognitive level than the BMPI group. Immunohistochemical staining and chemical analysis of the hippocampus showed that the SPI group had higher synaptophysin expression, doublecortin-positive cell proportion, superoxide dismutase activity, and lower malondialdehyde content compared with the BMPI group. The same parameters in the CPI group were between those of the BMPI and SPI groups. Microbiome sequencing indicated that the three groups differed significantly at the phylum, genus, and species levels, with higher microbial alpha diversity in the CPI and SPI groups. The association of intestinal microbiota with cognitive improvement was also assessed. The present study suggests that soy protein may increase cognitive function by the gut-brain axis. CONCLUSIONIn contrast with CPI and BMPI, SPI had a better effect on improving the cognitive level in mice, which was achieved through the regulation of hippocampal neural growth, oxidative stress, and intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attracting attention in the fields of medicine, food, and agriculture because of their broad-spectrum antibacterial properties, low resistance, and low-residue in the body. However, the low yield and instability of the prepared AMP drugs limit their application. In this study, we designed a tetramer of the AMP CC34, constructed and transfected two recombinant expression vectors with pGAPZ & alpha;A containing a haploid CC34 and tetraploid CC34 (CC34-4js) into Pichia pastoris to explore the effect of biosynthesized peptides. The results showed that CC34 and CC34-4js expression levels were 648.2 and 1105.3 mg/L, respectively, in the fermentation supernatant of P. pastoris. The CC34-4js tetramer showed no antibacterial activity, could be cleaved to the monomer using formic acid, and the hemolytic rate of the polyploid was slightly lower than that of monomeric CC34. The average daily gain, average daily feed intake, feed conversion ratio and immune organ index of rats fed CC34 and CC34-4js showed no differences. In conclusion, CC34-4js exhibited a higher yield and lower hemolysis in P. pastoris than those of CC34. Finally, CC34 and CC34-4js enterokinase lysates showed similar antibacterial activity and both expressed peptides potentially improved the growth performance and organ indices of rats.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to etiopathogenesis and progression of heart failure (HF). The underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Transcription factor FOXM1 plays an essential role in cardiovascular development. The present study explores its role in mitochondrial bioenergetics in postmitotic cardiomyocytes (CMs). FOXM1 is significantly upregulated in ischemic heart tissues from humans, mice, and pigs. CM-specific Foxm1-knockout mice exhibit dilated cardiomyopathy features associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of Foxm1-knockout mice reveal robust, specific downregulation of gene programs important for mitochondrial energetics and homeostasis. Analysis of proteome and ubiquitinome data reveal that FOXM1 deficiency in CMs promotes LKB1 ubiquitination and impairs the AMPK signaling and energy metabolism pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identifies that E3 ligase MKRN1 promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination of LKB1 on Lys146, which in turn, inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway and impairs energy homeostasis in mice with HF. CM-specific Mkrn1 knockout ameliorates cardiac dysfunction by rejuvenating the impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics induced by FOXM1 deficiency. FOXM1 overexpression preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics and protects against myocardial I/R injury in both rodent and porcine models. In conclusion, FOXM1 is actively involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics during HF. FOXM1 may be a potential promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and HF.

TI  - VisionMol: a novel virtual reality tool for protein molecular structure visualization and manipulation
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Motivation & Results Virtual reality (VR) technology holds significant potential for applications in biomedicine, particularly in the visualization and manipulation of protein molecular structures. To facilitate the study of protein molecules and enable the state-of-the-art VR hardware, we developed a novel VR software named VisionMol, which allows users to engage in immersive exploration and analysis of 3D molecular structures using a range of VR platforms (such as Rhino X Pro, Meta's Oculus Quest Pro/3) as well as personal computers. Built on the Unity engine and programmed using C#, VisionMol incorporates custom scripts to enable a variety of molecular operations. Users can rotate, scale, and translate molecular models using gestures, controllers, or other input devices. Furthermore, VisionMol offers rich visualization and interactive features, including multi-model molecular display, distance measurement between molecular components, and molecular alignment and docking.Summary These capabilities facilitate a more intuitive understanding of molecular interactions and chemical properties. The real-time interactive effects and clear visual representations allow users to delve deeper into the relationships between molecular structures and their properties, thereby accelerating research progress and promoting scientific discovery. We believe that this VR-based protein molecule analysis has significant application value in several fields, including biomedicine, life science education, drug design and optimization, biotechnology, and engineering applications.Availability and implementation The code is at https://github.com/WangLabforComputationalBiology/VisionMol.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alzheimer's disease (AD) was considered to be a neurodegenerative disease that caused cognitive impairment. Reactive Oxidative stress (ROS) was considered to be one of a major cause of the onset and progression of AD. Platycodin D (PD), a representative saponin from Platycodon grandiflorum, has conspicuous antioxidant activity. However, whether PD could protect nerve cell against oxidative injury remains unknown.Aim of study: This study investigated the regulatory effects of PD on neurodegeneration caused by ROS. To determine whether PD could play its own antioxidant role in neuronal protection.Materials and methods: First, PD(2.5, 5 mg/kg) ameliorated the memory impairment induced by AlCl3 (100 mg/ kg) combined with D-galactose (D-Gal) (200 mg/kg) in mice, using the radial arm maze (RAM) test, and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE). Next, the effects of PD (0.5, 1, and 2 mu M) on okadaic-acid (OA) (40 nM) -induced apoptosis and inflammation of HT22 cells were investi-gated. Mitochondrial ROS production was measured by fluorescence staining. The potential signaling pathways were identified through Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The role of PD in regulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was assessed using siRNA silencing of genes and an ROS inhibitor.Results: In vivo, PD improved memory in mice, and recovered the morphological changes of brain tissue and nissl bodies. In vitro experiment, PD increased cell viability (p < 0.01; p < 0.05;p < 0.001), decreased apoptosis (p < 0.01), reduced excessive ROS and MDA, rised SOD and CAT content(p < 0.01; p < 0.05). Morover, it can block the inflammatory response caused by ROS. Be important, PD strengthen antioxidant ability by elevating AMPK activation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, molecular docking suggested a good likelihood of PD-AMPK binding.Conclusion: AMPK activity is vital for the neuroprotective effect of PD, suggesting that PD may be a potential pharmaceutical agent to treat ROS-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - PurposeEnterocytozoon bieneusi is the most prevalent microsporidian parasite and has wide host diversity, including animals and humans. However, there are a limited number of studies on the presence, molecular epidemiology, and genotyping of E. bieneusi in camels worldwide. Currently, no data are available on the occurrence, distribution, and genotypes of E. bieneusi in wrestling camels in T & uuml;rkiye. This study aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding E. bieneusi in wrestling camels in T & uuml;rkiye.MethodsIn this study, a total of 110 fecal samples from camels in various provinces of T & uuml;rkiye were investigated to reveal the presence of E. bieneusi, and the subsequent zoonotic potential of isolates was assessed at the genotype level by PCR-sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene region.ResultsThree fecal specimens were detected as E. bieneusi positive, and the overall prevalence was 2.72%. Further sequence analyses revealed a novel genotype hereby named camelEb from wrestling camels in the Aydin (n = 1) and Mugla (n = 2) provinces of T & uuml;rkiye. In the phylogenetic analyses, the camelEb genotype clustered into group 6 with other genotypes reported from camels.ConclusionThis is the first report on the presence of E. bieneusi in wrestling camels, suggesting that camels could also serve as a potential reservoir or carrier for E. bieneusi in T & uuml;rkiye.

AB  - Luteolin is a natural flavone with neurotrophic effects observed on different neuronal cell lines. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of luteolin on hNSCs fate determination and the LPS-induced neuroinflammation in a mouse model of depression with astrocytogenesis defect. hNSCs were cultured in basal cell culture medium (control) or medium supplemented with luteolin or AICAR, a known inducer of astrogenesis. A whole-genome transcriptomic analysis showed that luteolin upregulated the expressions of genes related to neurotrophin, dopaminergic, hippo, and Wnt signaling pathways, and downregulated the genes involved in p53, TNF, FOXO, and Notch signaling pathways. We also found that astrocyte-specific gene GFAP, as well as other genes of the key signaling pathways involved in astrogenesis such as Wnt, BMP, and JAK-STAT pathways were upregulated in luteolin-treated hNSCs. On the other hand, neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis-related genes, TUBB3, NEUROD 1 and 6, and MBP, were downregulated in luteolin-treated hNSCs. Furthermore, immunostaining showed that percentages of GFAP+ cells were significantly higher in luteolin- and AICAR-treated hNSCs compared to control hNSCs. Additionally, RT-qPCR results showed that luteolin upregulated the expressions of GFAP, BMP2, and STAT3, whereas the expression of TUBB3 remained unchanged. Next, we evaluated the effects of luteolin in LPS-induced mice model of depression that represents defects in astrocytogenesis. We found that oral administration of luteolin (10 mg/Kg) for eight consecutive days could decrease the immobility time on tail suspension test, a mouse behavioral test measuring depression-like behavior, and attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory responses by significantly decreasing IL-6 production in mice brain-derived astrocytes and serum, and TNF alpha and corticosterone levels in serum. Luteolin treatment also significantly increased mature BDNF, dopamine, and noradrenaline levels in the hypothalamus of LPS-induced depression mice. Though the behavioral effects of luteolin did not reach statistical significance, global gene expression analyses of mice hippocampus and brain-derived NSCs highlighted the modulatory effects of luteolin on different signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Altogether, our findings suggest an astrocytogenic potential of luteolin and its possible therapeutic benefits in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However, further studies are required to identify the specific mechanism of action of luteolin.

AB  - Background and Objective: Motion analysis is crucial for effective and timely rehabilitative interventions on people with motor disorders. Conventional marker -based (MB) gait analysis is highly time-consuming and calls for expensive equipment, dedicated facilities and personnel. Markerless (ML) systems may pave the way to less demanding gait monitoring, also in unsupervised environments (i.e., in telemedicine). However,scepticism on clinical usability of relevant outcome measures has hampered its use. ML is normally used to analyse treadmill walking, which is significantly different from the more physiological overground walking. This study aims to provide end -users with instructions on using a single -camera markerless system to obtain reliable motion data from overground walking, while clinicians will be instructed on the reliability of obtained quantities. Methods: The study compares kinematics obtained from ML systems to those concurrently obtained from marker -based systems, considering different stride counts and subject positioning within the capture volume. Results: The findings suggest that five straight walking trials are sufficient for collecting reliable kinematics with ML systems. Precision on joint kinematics decreased at the boundary of the capture volume. Excellent correlation was found between ML and MB systems for hip and knee angles (0.92 < R-2 < 0.96), with slightly lower correlations observed for ankle plantar-dorsiflexion. The Bland-Altman analysis indicated the largest bias for hip flexion/extension ([0.2(degrees), 10.9(degrees)]) and the smallest for knee joint ([0.1(degrees), 0.8(degrees)]) when comparing MB-PiG and MB-JC approaches. For MB-JC vs. ML-JC comparison, the largest bias was for the ankle joint ([1.2(degrees), 11.8(degrees)]), while the smallest was for the hip joint ([0.2(degrees), 7.3(degrees)]). Conclusion: Single -camera markerless motion capture systems have great potential in assessing human joint kinematics during overground walking. Clinicians can confidently rely on estimated joint kinematics while walking, enabling personalized interventions and improving accessibility to remote evaluation and rehabilitation services, as long as: (i) the camera is positioned to capture someone walking back and forth at least five times with good visibility of the entire body silhouette; (ii) the walking path is at least 2 m long; and (iii) images captured at the boundaries of the camera image plane should be discarded.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds are of great importance for communication within biological systems. For the experimental investigation of the functions of volatiles, methods for experimental manipulation are needed. Based on scent-release methods from pheromone research, we describe a simple and cheap method for scent manipulation using silicone rubber (i.e. a silicone septum). Volatile compounds are applied to the septum by soaking the septa for 1 h in a solvent/volatile solution. After removal of the septum from the solution and a drying period of 1 h to allow for evaporation of the solvent, the silicone emits the volatiles at a continuously decreasing rate for a minimum of 24 h. In this study, we measure the variability of the emission and quantify the emission of 22 common floral scent compounds at four different time points and in four different soaking concentrations. Our results show that for the same compound and soaking concentration, variability of volatile emission was low, showing the method leads to repeatable emission rates and can be fine-tuned to the desired emission rate. We provide a calculation tool based on linear regression to allow an experimenter to calculate soaking concentration for each of the 22 compounds to achieve a desirable emission from the septa, as well as to estimate the emission rate of a volatile from the septa after a given time.

AB  - Aim. In vitro analysis of the inhibitory activity of dry ethanol extracts of some Artemisia spp. growing in the Novosibirsk region for SARS-CoV-2 replication.
   Materials and Methods. The laboratory strain SARS-CoV-2/human/RUS/Nsk-FRCFTM-1/2020 was passed on Vero cell culture. Dry ethanol extracts of plant parts (stems, flowers, leaves) of six types of Artemisia were prepared. The types used were: A. vulgaris L.; A. glauca (Pall. Ex Willd.); A. dracunculus L. (from three growth locations); A. absinthium L.; A. frigida Willd.; and A. sieversiana Ehrh. ex Willd. Dry extracts were dissolved in DMSO. In vitro analysis of the inhibitory activity of extracts against SARS-CoV-2 (an infectious titer of 10(3) TCID50/ml) replication was performed in a Vero E6 cell culture. To do this, the method of direct inactivation (neutralization) of virions, as well as schemes of "preventive" and "therapeutic" of cells, were used. Comparison samples were dry ethanol extracts of Inonotus obliquus, Syzygium aromaticum L. and Camellia sinensis L.
   Results. Extracts of leaves of Artemisia spp. proved to be most effective in direct inactivation of virions. By equal and decreasing activity these are the species: A. vulgaris; A. dracunculus*; A. absinthium; A. dracunculus***; A. dracunculus**; A. frigid; A. glauca; and A. sieversiana with a 50% effective concentration of range 1.10 +/- 0.24 - 11.72 +/- 2.89 mu g/ml. Extracts of flowers of A. vulgaris, A.glauca, A. dracunculus*, A. dracunculus**, A. dracunculus***, A. frigida and A. sieversiana also contain biologically active substances which act both destructively on virions and after the virus has entered cells. For extracts of stems consistently high values of EC50 were found for A. glauca (6.84 +/- 1.35; 7.81 +/- 2.00 and 14.06 +/- 3.06 mu g/ml) according to the results of three experimental schemes.
   Conclusion. The results obtained can become the basis for the development of inexpensive domestic drugs for the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19.

AB  - Insect pests, particularly seed-feeding flies, can cause serious damage to the fruits of many wild orchid species. Evidence of fly damage has been observed in 55 orchid species, belonging to 25 genera, distributed throughout Japan. Although some authors suggested that the observed increase in fly damage to orchids in recent years is related to the introduction of exotic species, the timing and route of spread remain unclear. We examined herbarium specimens of seven orchid species, collected between 1923 and 2016, to collect coarctate pupae and empty puparia, with minimal damage to the specimens. Genomic DNA was then extracted from the insect tissue and species were identified using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 barcode regions. Long amplicons (660 base pairs [bp]) were obtained from 45.2% of samples and short amplicons (162 bp) were obtained from 90.3% of samples. In total, 51 of 62 samples had nucleotide sequences homologous to Japanagromyza tokunagai, with specimens distributed across collection years and geographic locations. Therefore, the severe damage to Japanese orchids observed in recent years is not related to the recent introduction of an exotic species; it may be related to a rapid increase in a native species. This work highlights the value of herbaria as important resources for elucidating the history and distribution of parasitic insects.

AB  - Cryoprotectants are required to reduce damage caused to the cells due to low temperatures during the cryopreservation. Antifreeze proteins (AFP) have a well-known role in cell membrane protection, while resveratrol is a potent antioxidant. This study assessed the effect of the association of resveratrol concentrations and AFP I in a ram semen extender. Pooled semen of four rams was allocated into six treatments in a factorial arrangement: (CONT, only the semen extender); only AFP I (ANT: 0.1 pg/mL of AFP I), only resveratrol, one treatment with two levels (10 pM/mL or 50 pM/mL of resveratrol); and two treatments with the interactions, with one AFP I and one of the two levels of resveratrol (0.1 pg/mL of AFP I with 10 pM/mL resveratrol; 0.1 pg/mL of AFP I with 50 pM/mL resveratrol). No interaction between factors was observed on sperm kinetics, plasma membrane integrity, hypo-osmotic test, and mitochondrial activity parameters. There was a high probability (P = 0.06) of reducing sperm cells with functional membrane percentage in the hypo-osmotic test and increasing the percentage of sperm with high mitochondrial activity (P = 0.07) was observed in AFP presence. An interaction of AFP and resveratrol was observed in non-capacitated sperm (P = 0.009), acrosomal reaction (P = 0.034), and sperm binding (P = 0.04). In conclusion, the association of resveratrol and AFP did not improve the quality of frozen-thawed semen and even promoted deleterious effects compared to their single addition in the semen extender. The supplementation of 50 pM/mL of resveratrol improved the outcomes of frozen-thawed ram sperm, being a potential cryoprotectant.

AB  - Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is an important process that suppresses tumor development, but the molecular mechanisms of OIS are still under investigation. It is known that BRAFV600E-mutated melanocytes can overcome OIS and develop melanoma, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Using an established OIS model of primary melanocytes transduced with BRAFV600E, YAP activity was shown to be induced in OIS as well as in melanoma cells compared to that in normal epidermal melanocytes. This led to the assumption that YAP activation itself is not a factor involved in the disruption of OIS. However, its role and interaction partners potentially change. As Wnt molecules are known to be important in melanoma progression, these molecules were the focus of subsequent studies. Interestingly, activation of Wnt signaling using AMBMP resulted in a disruption of OIS in BRAFV600E-transduced melanocytes. Furthermore, depletion of Wnt6, Wnt10b or beta-catenin expression in melanoma cells resulted in the induction of senescence. Given that melanoma cells do not exhibit canonical Wnt/beta-catenin activity, alternative beta-catenin signaling pathways may disrupt OIS. Here, we discovered that beta-catenin is an interaction partner of YAP on DNA in melanoma cells. Furthermore, the beta-catenin-YAP interaction changed the gene expression pattern from senescence-stabilizing genes to tumor-supportive genes. This switch is caused by transcriptional coactivation via the LEF1/TEAD interaction. The target genes with binding sites for LEF1 and TEAD are involved in rRNA processing and are associated with poor prognosis in melanoma patients. This study revealed that an alternative YAP-Wnt signaling axis is an essential molecular mechanism leading to OIS disruption in melanocytes.

AB  - Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), ubiquitous in soil and fresh and saltwater sources have been identified in the microbiome of humans and many animals. MTB endogenously produce magnetic nanocrystals enabling them to orient and navigate along geomagnetic fields. Similar magnetite deposits have been found throughout the tissues of the human brain, including brain regions associated with orientation such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, the origins of which remain unknown. Speculation over the role and source of MTB in humans, as well as any association with the brain, remain unanswered. We performed a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of 34 healthy females as well as grey matter volume analysis in magnetite-rich brain regions associated with orientation and navigation with the goal of identifying specific MTB that could be associated with brain structure in orientation and navigation regions. We identified seven MTB in the human gut microbiome: Magnetococcus marinus, Magnetospira sp. QH-2, Magnetospirillum magneticum, Magnetospirillum sp. ME-1, Magnetospirillum sp. XM-1, Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, and Desulfovibrio magneticus. Our preliminary results show significant negative associations between multiple MTB with bilateral flocculonodular lobes of the cerebellum and hippocampus (adjusted for total intracranial volume, uncorrected P<0.05). These findings indicate that MTB in the gut are associated with grey matter volume in magnetite-rich brain regions related to orientation and navigation. These preliminary findings support MTB as a potential biogenic source for brain magnetite in humans. Further studies will be necessary to validate and elucidate the relationship between these bacteria, magnetite concentrations, and brain function.

AB  - The impact of estrogen on brain function, especially in individuals with diabetes, remains uncertain. This study aims to compare cerebral glucose metabolism levels in intact rats, ovariectomized (OVX) rats, and 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-treated OVX diabetic female rats. Sixteen rats were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg/ kg streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes (intact, n = 6; OVX, n = 6; OVX+E2-treated, n = 4). Additionally, 18 rats received an equivalent solvent dose via intraperitoneal injection (intact, n = 6; OVX, n = 6; OVX+E2-treated, n = 6). After 4 weeks of STZ or solvent administration, positron emission tomography scans with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) injection were employed to assess cerebral glucose metabolism. The diabetic rats exhibited substantial reductions in F-18-FDG uptake across all brain regions (all P < 0.01), in contrast to the control rats. Moreover, intact and OVX + E2-treated diabetic female rats displayed more pronounced decreases in cerebral glucose metabolism in the amygdala and hippocampus compared to OVX diabetic female rats (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that diabetes creates an environment wherein estrogen exacerbates neuropathology and intensifies neuronal activity.

AB  - Uncontrollable bleeding is the main cause of death during surgical trauma and accidental injuries. To halt the bleeding caused by arterial rupture is still challenging due to the high pressure and velocity of arterial blood flow. Enzyme-responsive hydrogels have emerged as promising solutions for hemostasis after arterial rupture, largely due to their high hemostatic efficiency and specificity. However, the existing enzyme-re-sponsive hydrogels suffer from weak cross-linking. Here, we report the design of a hemostatic material with nanoporous, combining a transglutaminase enzyme reaction and Schiff base reaction, for percutaneous injection. Here, we show that the resulting burst pressure of the hemostatic material was 134 +/- 10 mmHg, which is significantly greater than the normal systolic blood pressure. Most importantly, the material was able to efficiently stop the bleeding a pig and rat arterial vessel models, with a ~10 s gelling time and without the need for the hemostatic clamps on both ends of the vessel injury. Furthermore, the hemostatic material functioned as an anti-adhesion barrier in a rat liver model. The present study describes an ef-fective, injectable hydrogel solution for the rapid and minimally invasive hemostatic treatment of bleeding diseases in parenchymal organs. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - DEAD-box RNA helicase Vasa is required for gonad development and fertility in multiple animals. Vasa is implicated in many crucial aspects of Drosophila oogenesis, including translation regulation, primordial germ cell specification, piRNA silencing of transposable elements, and maintenance of germline stem cells (GSCs). However, data about Vasa functions in Drosophila spermatogenesis remain controversial. Here we showed that loss-of-function vasa mutations led to failures of GSC maintenance in the testes, a severe loss of total germ cell content, and a cessation of male fertility over time. Defects in GSC maintenance in vasa mutant testes were not associated with an increasing frequency of programmed cell death, indicating that a premature loss of GSCs occurred via entering differentiation. We found that Vasa is implicated in the positive regulation of rhino expression both in the testes and ovaries. The introduction of a transgene copy of rhino, encoding a nuclear component of piRNA pathway machinery, in vasa mutant background allowed us to restore premeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, including the maintenance of GSCs and the development of spermatogonia and spermatocytes. However, piRNA-guided repression of Stellate genes in spermatocytes of vasa mutant testes with additional rhino copy was not restored, and male fertility was disrupted. Our study uncovered a novel mechanistic link involving Vasa and Rhino in a regulatory network that mediates GSC maintenance but is dispensable for the perfect biogenesis of Su(Ste) piRNAs in testes. Thus, we have shown that Vasa functions in spermatogenesis are essential at two distinct developmental stages: in GSCs for their maintenance and in spermatocytes for piRNA-mediated silencing of Stellate genes.

AB  - It is very crucial to select appropriate plant lighting sources to supplement light for plants according to their different requirements for light during different growth periods. However, LED-driven plant lighting sources confront the challenges of long-term operation stability and modular light color switching requirements. Herein, red emitting, far-red emitting, and patterned multi-color emitting phosphor-sapphire composite (PSC) samples were fabricated by co-sintering CaAlSiN3:Eu2+/Gd2.4Lu0.6Ga4AlO12:Cr3+ and low-melting glass powder on sapphire plates. The phase, microstructure, and luminescent properties of these PSC specimens were systematically investigated. Notably, after 34 days of continuous operation, the luminescence intensity of the fabricated high power plant lighting LED device can maintain 93% of its initial integrated intensity, benefitting from robust resistance to light irradiation and thermal shock. Moreover, the emitting color of these modular high power LED devices can be easily switched by using different PSC samples depending on the light color need of the plants. All these results indicate that the PSC samples reported in this paper have merits of easy fabrication, low cost and long-lifetimes, showing promising applications in the field of plant growth lighting.

AB  - The present study aimed at identifying the training needs of the veterinary officers serving under different state governments. Three states of the sub-tropical region of the country namely Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir were chosen purposively for their accessibility and ease in communication. A total of 120 veterinary officers were selected i.e., 40 from each state. A Schedule was developed that consisted of 44 statements across different domains viz clinical care, diagnostics, managemental practices, extension activities. The responses were recorded by assigning scores as 3, 2 & 1 for most needed, needed and least needed respectively. The results revealed that most of the training needs were associated with management of infertility and reproductive health in livestock (Mean Obtained Score: MOS 2.57), followed by sample collection, storage, and transportation procedure in disease diagnosis (MOS 2.57) and disease diagnosis through ultrasonography and radiography (MOS 2.56). Under the specific domains viz. clinical care, diagnostics, managemental practices, extension related activities, training needs were concentrated in the domains of management of infertility and reproductive health in dairy cows and buffaloes (MOS 2.57), sample collection, storage and transportation for disease diagnosis (MOS 2.57), handling the outbreaks ( MOS 2.43), technical and popular writing skills (MOS 2.39), stress and time management (MOS 2.45), and biosafety measures (MOS 2.34) respectively. To meet the training needs the study suggests organizing formal and informal trainings and creating better training resources in the reported niche areas. Focusing on improving the training experience can help in augmenting the skills of veterinarians, which indirectly helps to realize the objective of empowering the animal husbandry sector.

AB  - Radiation-induced neurocognitive dysfunction (RIND) has attracted a lot of attention lately due to the significant improvement of the survival of cancer patients after receiving cranial radiotherapy. The detailed mechanisms are not completely understood, but extensive evidence supports an involvement of the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis, which may result from radiation-induced depletion of neural stem cells (NSCs) as well as the damage to neurogenic niches. As an important component of neurogenic niches, vascular cells interact with NSCs through different signaling mechanisms, which is similar to the characteristics of radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE). But whether RIBE is involved in neurogenesis inhibition contributed by the damaged vascular cells is unknown. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of RIBEs in non-irradiated bystander NSCs induced by irradiated bEnd.3 vascular endothelial cells in a co-culture system. The results show that compared with the NSCs cultured alone, the properties of NSCs were significantly affected after co-culture with bEnd.3 cells, and further change was induced without obvious oxidative stress and apoptosis when bEnd.3 cells were irradiated, manifesting as a reduction in the proliferation, neurosphere-forming capability and differentiation potential of NSCs. All these results suggest that the damaged vascular endothelial cells may contribute to neurogenesis inhibition via inducing RIBEs in NSCs, thus leading to RIND.

AB  - Background: The use of medicinal plant ingredients is one of the goals of developing potential drugs for treating depression. Compelling evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory medicines may block the occurrence of depression. We studied the effect of a natural compound, emodin, on the development of psychosocial stress-induced depression and the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: Chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) for 7 weeks was performed to replicate psychosocial stress in rats. The sucrose preference test, force swimming test, and open field test were used to evaluate their behaviors. The differentially expressed proteins in the hippocampus were analyzed using proteomics. Nissl staining and Golgi staining were used to detect the loss of neurons and synapses, immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the activation of microglia, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were also performed.
   Results: Hippocampal inflammation with up-regulated 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) was observed in the depressed rats after CUMS exposure. The upregulation of 5-LO was caused by decreased miR-139-5p. To observe the effect of emodin, we screened out depression-susceptible (DeS) rats during CUMS and treated them with emodin (80 mg/kg/day). Two weeks later, emodin prevented the depression behaviors in DeS rats along with a series of pathological changes in their hippocampi, such as loss of neurons and spines, microglial activation, increased interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the activation of 5-LO. Furthermore, we demonstrated that emodin inhibited its excess inflammatory response, possibly by targeting miR-139-5p/5-LO and modulating glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2.
   Conclusion: These results provide important evidence that emodin may be a candidate agent for the treatment of depression and established a key role of miR-139-5p/5-LO in the inflammation of depression.

AB  - BackgroundPregnancy affects learning and memory in women. Thus, to investigate the effects of pregnancy, the authors examined the brain electrophysiology of pregnant mice.MethodsUsing the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on isolated brain slices, we detected and compared the electrophysiological changes in the hippocampal CA1 (HIP CA1) region, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and basolateral amygdala (BLA) among 15 pregnant and 15 nonpregnant mice.ResultsIn pregnant mice, there was a trend toward an increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (p = 0.092) and a trend toward a decrease in the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) (p = 0.071) in the HIP CA1. In the BLA, both the amplitudes of mEPSCs and mIPSCs were significantly reduced (p = 0.004 and 0.042, respectively). In the mPFC, the amplitudes of mEPSCs and hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih), as well as the frequencies of mIPSCs, were higher compared to nonpregnant mice (p = 0.035, 0.009, and 0.038, respectively).ConclusionsIn pregnant mice, the electrophysiological change in neurons in the mPFC and BLA might contribute to the cognitive and emotional changes during pregnancy. A trend toward electrophysiological change in the HIP CA1 revealed that the mechanism of cognitive change during pregnancy might differ from that of other conditions.

AB  - We assessed numbers and biomass of species hunted and sold for wild meat in 12 park-adjacent settlements in the Fazao Malfakassa National Park (FMNP), Togo. From hunter interviews and market carcass counts, 33 species, 28 from hunter interviews and 26 from market surveys were taken, respectively. A total of 2605 animals were recorded in the study, 18 species during the wet season (740 animals) and 26 species in the dry season (1865 animals). In markets, 754 carcasses of 19 species were traded during the wet season, and 1896 carcasses of 24 species in the dry season. Most species were relatively small-bodied mammals (62% of total numbers of animals reported), the rest large ungulates. Species were generally of minor conservation concern (LC or NT) with only three EN and NE. From the gathered field data, we estimated that an average of 9095 +/- 5613 animals per study village were hunted per year, amounting to a biomass of 198,334 +/- 191,930 kg. Despite efforts to protect the wildlife within the FMNP, reported level of hunting, particularly of large ungulates within the park, the reported level of hunting is likely to have severe consequences on the long-term viability of this important protected area.

AB  - While phyllostomid bats show an impressive range of feeding habits, most of them emit highly similar echolocation calls. Due to the presence of an often prominent noseleaf, it has long been assumed that all phyllostomids emit echolocation calls exclusively through the nostrils rather than through the mouth. However, photo evidence documents also phyllostomid bats flying with an opened mouth. We hypothesized that all phyllostomid species emit echolocation calls only through the nostrils and therefore fly consistently with a closed mouth, and that observations of an open mouth should be a rare and random behavior among individuals and species. Using a high-speed camera and standardized conditions in a flight cage, we screened 40 phyllostomid species. Behavior varied distinctly among the species and mouth posture shows a significant phylogenetic signal. Bats of the frugivorous subfamilies Rhinophyllinae and Carolliinae, the nectarivorous subfamilies Glossophaginae and Lonchophyllinae, and the sanguivorous subfamily Desmodontinae all flew consistently with open mouths. So did the animalivorous subfamilies Glyphonycterinae, Micronycterinae and Phyllostominae, with the notable exception of species in the omnivorous genus Phyllostomus, which consistently flew with mouths closed. Bats from the frugivorous subfamily Stenodermatinae also flew exclusively with closed mouths with the single exception of the genus Sturnira, which is the sister clade to all other stenodermatine species. Further, head position angles differed significantly between bats echolocating with their mouth closed and those echolocating with their mouths opened, with closed-mouth phyllostomids pointing only the nostrils in the direction of flight and open-mouth phyllostomids pointing both the nostrils and mouth gape in the direction of flight. Ancestral trait reconstruction showed that the open mouth mode is the ancestral state within the Phyllostomidae. Based on the observed behavioral differences, we suggest that phyllostomid bats are not all nasal emitters as previously thought and discuss possible reasons. Further experiments, such as selectively obstructing sound emission through nostrils or mouth, respectively, will be necessary to clarify the actual source, plasticity and ecological relevance of sound emission of phyllostomid bats flying with their mouths open.

AB  - The central dogma explaining epileptic seizures largely revolves around the classic theory of "excitability-inhibition"imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission. Cholinergic neurons play a significant role in epilepsy; however, these neuronal populations are molecularly and structurally heterogeneous. Here, we show a subpopulation of subiculum-projecting septal cholinergic neurons that promote seizure development. Functionally, this subpopulation is suppressed during seizures. Selective manipulation of the septo-subicular cholinergic circuit bidirectionally regulates the development of hippocampal seizures. Notably, cholinergic signaling enhances subicular astrocytic caspase-1-mediated neuroinflammation via M3 muscarinic receptors, increasing excitatory synaptic transmission and promoting seizure development. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of the septo-subicular cholinergic circuits facilitates seizure development via astrocytic inflammation. Our findings provide insight into the cholinergic mechanism involved in epilepsy and suggest targeted therapeutic strategies for epilepsy treatment, focusing on the specific cholinergic neuronal subpopulation.

AB  - The capability to respond to wounding is a process shared by organisms of different kingdoms that can result in the regeneration of whole-body parts or lost structures or organs. Filamentous fungi constitute a rich food source that ensures survival and reproduction of their predators and are therefore continuously exposed to mechanical damage. Nevertheless, our understanding of how fungi respond to wounding and predators is scarce. Fungi like plants and animals respond to injury recognizing Damage- and Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs/MAMPs) that activate Ca2+ and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase dependent signaling for the activation of defense mechanisms. During herbivory, plants, in addition to activating pathways related to injury, activate specific responses to combat their predators. Using a transcriptional approach, we studied the capacity of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma atroviride to activate specific responses to injury and attack by different arthropods. Attack by Drosophila melanogaster inhibited the transcriptional activation of genes required for hyphal regeneration, and the fungal innate immune and chemical defense responses. We also provide mechanistic insight of this inhibition involving components of the D. melanogaster salivary glands that repress the expression of a set of genes and block hyphal regeneration.

AB  - The Maillard reaction products, as a kind of glycosylation-based reaction, possess the metal-chelating ability. In this study, the white shrimp hydrolysate (WH) and xylooligosaccharides (XOS) were used to prepare the Maillard reaction product-zinc complex (WH-XOS-MR-Zn) with zinc ions. The Maillard reaction conditions, such as pH level, temperature, reaction time, and the ratio of XOS to WH, were selected by testing the products' zinc-chelating capacity, while the optimized conditions (zinc-chelating capacity = 64.8%, pH = 7, 110 degrees C, 180 min, XOS : WH = 2) were finally determined. The interactions between WH-XOS-MR and zinc were confirmed and characterized by various kinds of techniques and triggered new peaks of fluorescent signals. The addition of zinc in WH-XOS-MR induced the proportion changes of secondary structures, including the decrease of beta-sheets (8.16%) and the increase of beta-turns (5.9%) and random coils (2.23%). The addition of zinc changed the morphological surface appearance of WH-XOS-MR and the crystal signal was completely covered in the WH-XOS-MR-Zn complex involved in the chelation with carbonyl and amino groups. The high-dose and medium-dose of the WH-XOS-MR-Zn complex showed higher promotive effects on zinc absorption (11.89 and 11.05 umol L-1, respectively) and medium-dose recovered values of AKP (liver and serum: 7.15 and 12.53 U mL-1), SOD (liver, kidney and serum: 59.84, 7.86 and 13.61 U mL-1) and GSH-Px (203.22 U per mgprot), damage to testicular tissues, damage to the intact neuron cells in the hippocampus region (CA1: 54 to 61, CA3: 67 to 136, DG: 219-353), and intestinal inflammation compared with the zinc-deficient mice. These findings showed therapeutic benefits of Maillard products on intestinal health and cellular structures.

AB  - The Tibetan antelope is an endangered species suffering from poaching and habitat fragmentation. The intestinal flora and metabolites play a crucial role in the physiological homeostasis of hosts, which are influenced by various environmental factors like seasonal variation. In this particular research, our main goal was to explore the alterations in the metabolism and gut microbiota of Tibetan antelopes between the cold season (XB) and warm season (DA), using untargeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analyses. The findings indicated that Tibetan antelopes had a higher alpha-diversity of intestinal microbes during the cold season than during the warm season. Principal co-ordinate analysis revealed notable seasonal discrepancies in the function and structure of intestinal microbes in Tibetan antelopes. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly increased during the cold season compared to during the warm season. Furthermore, the Tibetan antelope's primary metabolic functions of the intestinal micro-organisms were significantly higher during the cold season. The untargeted metabolomics analysis results showed a total of 532 metabolites that were significantly different between the cold season and warm season groups. These metabolites were found to be enriched in a total of 62 metabolic pathways. Among the most significant pathways of enrichment were the purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism. The levels of related metabolites in those pathways were remarkably higher in the warm season compared to the cold season. The comprehensive analysis of 16S rRNA and the metabolome reveals there is a significant correlation between differential microbiota and differential metabolites. Therefore, the gut microbiota changes caused by seasonal changes influenced the metabolites as well. This research reveals the function of seasonal changes in the intestinal flora and metabolites in the adaptation of Tibetan antelopes to environmental fluctuations and supplies a theoretical basis for instructing the protection management of Tibetan antelopes.

AB  - The improvement of crop resistance to insect using endophytic fungi is an environmentally friendly and sustainable strategy for agricultural pest control. Clarifying the efficacy and mechanism of endophytic fungi in improving crop resistance to pest offers the opportunity for biological control. In this study, changes in the transcriptome and defense compounds of wheat inoculated with endophytic fungal strains (i.e., YC and BB) were evaluated, and the efficacy of endophytic fungi in improving wheat resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi was studied. The results showed that the numbers of upregulated differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in wheat plants inoculated with endophytic fungal strains YC and BB were higher than those of the downregulated DEGs, irrespective of R. padi infestation. Defense-related metabolic pathways, such as plant hormone signal transduction and secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched. Endophytic fungal strains YC and BB significantly increased jasmonic acid, DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), total flavone, and tannin contents in wheat plants (P < 0.05) but decreased salicylic acid content. Variations in the contents of defense compounds were significantly correlated with decreased feeding, development, and reproduction of R. padi fed on wheat plants inoculated with strains YC and BB (|r| = 0.68-0.91, P < 0.05). The results suggested that endophytic fungi significantly decreased the feeding efficiency and population fitness [YC: (-11.13%) - (-22.07%); BB: (-10.98%) - (-22.20%)] of R. padi by altering the phytohormone pathway and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in wheat plants. This study helps in understanding of the efficacy of endophytic fungi in improving wheat resistance to insect and will be conducive to integrated pest management.

AB  - The toxicity of acetaminophen (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP)) is the most frequent cause of drug-induced liver damage. Galium aparine L. (GA) is traditionally used to treat jaundice. We aimed to investigate the hep-atoprotective potential of GA in the APAP-induced hepatic encephalopathy (HE) rat model. Qualitative phyto-chemical characterization of GA was performed by LC/Q-TOF/MS analysis. Wistar rats were pretreated with GA (250 and 500 mg/kg b.wt. per oral) for five days. On the 6th day, the rats were exposed to APAP (1500 mg/kg b. wt. oral gavage) and behavioral tests (open field and passive avoidance tests) were applied on the 7th and 8th days. The animals were killed, and biochemical and histopathological parameters were assessed in blood and hepatic specimens. GA pretreated rats exhibited a significant reduction in APAP-induced liver damage, evidenced by the reduction in liver necrosis and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin (BIL). GA demonstrated an anxiolytic effect, as seen in the acquisition trial and grooming behavior. The short-term memory performances of animals were not changed in all groups, suggesting that APAP intoxication did not affect hippocampal function. These results show that GA extract markedly exerts hepatoprotective ac-tivity, while its effect on hepatic encephalopathy was limited.

AB  - Neurotrophins are a collection of structurally and functionally related proteins. They play important roles in many aspects of neural development, survival, and plasticity. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to different levels of central nervous tissue destruction and cellular repair through various compensatory mechanisms promoted by the injured brain. Many studies have shown that neurotrophins are key modulators of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, blood-brain barrier permeability, memory capacity, and neurite regeneration. The expression of neurotrophins following TBI is affected by the severity of injury, genetic polymorphism, and different post-traumatic time points. Emerging research is focused on the potential therapeutic applications of neurotrophins in managing TBI. We conducted a comprehensive review by organizing the studies that demonstrate the role of neurotrophins in the management of TBI.

AB  - Learning novel experiences reorganizes hippocampal neuronal circuits, represented as coordinated reactivation patterns in post-experience offline states for memory consolidation. This study examines how awake synchronous events during a novel run are related to post-run reactivation patterns. The disruption of awake sharp-wave ripples inhibited experience-induced increases in the contributions of neurons to post -experience synchronous events. Hippocampal place cells that participate more in awake synchronous events are more strongly reactivated during post-experience synchronous events. Awake synchronous neuronal patterns, in cooperation with place-selective firing patterns, determine cell ensembles that undergo pronounced increases and decreases in their correlated spikes. Taken together, awake synchronous events are fundamental for identifying hippocampal neuronal ensembles to be incorporated into synchronous reactivation during subsequent offline states, thereby facilitating memory consolidation.

AB  - The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor transmits and triggers viral infections that have deleterious effects on honey bee colonies worldwide. We performed a manipulative experiment in which worker bees collected at emergence were exposed to Varroa for 72 h, and their proteomes were compared with those of untreated control bees. Label-free quantitative proteomics identified 77 differentially expressed A. mellifera proteins (DEPs). In addition, viral proteins were identified by orthogonal analysis, and most importantly, Deformed wing virus (DWV) was found at high levels/intensity in Varroa-exposed bees. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the main pathways affected included peroxisomal metabolism, cyto-/exoskeleton reorganization, and cuticular proteins. Detailed examination of individual DEPs revealed that additional changes in DEPs were associated with peroxisomal function. In addition, the proteome data support the importance of TGF-beta signaling in Varroa-DWV interaction and the involvement of the mTORC1 and Hippo pathways. These results suggest that the effect of DWV on bees associated with Varroa feeding results in aberrant autophagy. In particular, autophagy is selectively modulated by peroxisomes, to which the observed proteome changes strongly corresponded. This study complements previous research with different study designs and suggests the importance of the peroxisome, which plays a key role in viral infections.

AB  - Social insect colonies are characterized by an efficient division of labor, allowing high-value individuals (i.e., reproductives and brood) to be sheltered from tasks associated with increased risk of pathogen exposure, such as foraging or corpse disposal. This social organization helps limit the transmission of disease throughout the colony. Further, individuals can actively respond to imminent disease threats by altering their behaviors as a means of social immunity. In subterranean termites, although workers typically avoid detected pathogens, they can be attracted to pathogen cues when a nestmate is infected. Infected termites are usually groomed, but they may instead be cannibalized if the infection has already become lethal. The mechanisms governing these changes in behavior are unclear. We set out to examine immediate changes in individual behaviors, investigating the role that the infected individual plays in communicating its infection status to nestmates. We also assessed gradual changes in social organization after the re-introduction of an infected termite to the colony. Our results reveal that infected termites likely do not signal their infection status to nestmates through shaking behaviors and reduced movements, suggesting the occurrence of other mechanisms used in communicating infection. We also found that infected termites do not self-isolate and may travel to the densest part of the colony, where they can potentially benefit from grooming by large groups of nestmates. These results provide new insights into how individual changes in immune behaviors contribute to overall colony health, highlighting that, at early stages of infection, termites favor a rescuing strategy rather than isolation and/or cannibalization.

AB  - Aberrant expression of kinesin family member 4A (KIF4A), which is associated with tumor progression, has been reported in several types of cancer. However, its expression and the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating the transcription of KIF4A in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain largely unclear. Here, we found that high KIF4A expression was positively correlated with tumor stage and poor prognosis in ESCC patients. KIF4A silencing significantly inhibited the growth and migration of ESCC cells, arrested cell cycle, and induced apoptosis. Interestingly, KIF4A expression was positively related to the expression of YAP in human ESCC tissues. YAP knockdown or disrupting YAP/TEAD4 interaction by verteporfin repressed KIF4A expression. Also, KIF4A knockdown significantly inhibited the cell growth induced by YAP overexpression. Mechanistically, YAP activated KIF4A transcriptional expression by TEAD4-mediated direct binding to KIF4A promoter. Finally, KIF4A knockdown and verteporfin treatment synergistically inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models. Together, these results indicated that KIF4A, a novel target gene of YAP/TEAD4, may be a progression and prognostic biomarker of ESCC. Targeting drugs for KIF4A combined with YAP inhibitor may be a novel therapeutic strategy for ESCC.

AB  - The establishment of human expanded potential stem cell (hEPSC) presents a unique cellular platform for translational research in kidney organoids. We generated SIX2 reporter and doxycycline (DOX)-inducible YAP overexpression in hEPSC lines using CRISPR-Cas9. Chemical compounds and DOX were added to the culture medium to induce Hippo-YAP signaling, respectively. The hEPSC line containing the SIX2-mCherry reporter gene accurately reflected SIX2 expression in vitro, enabling the real-time tracking of kidney organoid development. A comparative analysis revealed that inhibiting the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway before nephron progenitor cell (NPC) generation effectively increased the number of NPCs, resulting in a more nephron-like structure. However, prolonged inhibition hindered the further maturation of the kidney organoids, leading to differentiation stagnation. Therefore, activating YAP before NPC generation facilitates their maturation, offering effective induction strategies improving kidney organoid differentiation efficiency.

AB  - Guanosine has been reported to elicit antidepressant-like responses in rodents, but if these actions are associated with its ability to afford neuroprotection against glutamate-induced toxicity still needs to be fully understood. Therefore, this study investigated the antidepressant-like and neuroprotective effects elicited by guanosine in mice and evaluated the possible involvement of NMDA receptors, glutamine synthetase, and GLT-1 in these responses. We found that guanosine (0.05 mg/kg, but not 0.01 mg/kg, p. o.) was effective in producing an antidepressant-like effect and protecting hippocampal and prefrontocortical slices against glutamate-induced damage. Our results also unveiled that ketamine (1 mg/kg, but not 0.1 mg/kg, i. p, an NMDA receptor antag-onist) effectively elicited antidepressant-like actions and protected hippocampal and prefrontocortical slices against glutamatergic toxicity. Furthermore, the combined administration of sub-effective doses of guanosine (0.01 mg/kg, p. o.) with ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, i. p.) promoted an antidepressant-like effect and augmented glutamine synthetase activity and GLT-1 immunocontent in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. Our results also showed that the combination of sub-effective doses of ketamine and guanosine, at the same protocol schedule that exhibited an antidepressant-like effect, effectively abolished glutamate-induced damage in hippocampal and prefrontocortical slices. Our in vitro results reinforce that guanosine, ketamine, or sub-effective concentrations of guanosine plus ketamine protect against glutamate exposure by modulating glutamine syn-thetase activity and GLT-1 levels. Finally, molecular docking analysis suggests that guanosine might interact with NMDA receptors at the ketamine or glycine/D-serine co-agonist binding sites. These findings provide support for the premise that guanosine has antidepressant-like effects and should be further investigated for depression management.

AB  - The ex vivo treatment of a limited volume of blood with gaseous oxygen-ozone (O2-O3) mixtures and its rapid reinfusion into the patient is a widespread medical procedure. O3 instantly reacts with the blood's antioxidant systems, disappearing before reinfusion, although the molecules formed act as messengers in the organism, inducing multiple antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. An appropriate dose of O3 is obviously essential to ensure both safety and therapeutic efficacy, and in recent years, the low-dose O3 concept has led to a significant reduction in the administered O3 concentrations. However, the molecular events triggered by such low concentrations in the blood still need to be fully elucidated. In this basic study, we analysed the molecular modifications induced ex vivo in sheep blood by 5 and 10 mu g O3/mL O2 by means of a powerful metabolomics analysis in association with haemogas, light microscopy and bioanalytical assays. This combined approach revealed increased oxygenation and an increased antioxidant capacity in the O3-treated blood, which accorded with the literature. Moreover, original information was obtained on the impact of these low O3 concentrations on the metabolic pathways of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleotides, with the modified metabolites being mostly involved in the preservation of the oxidant-antioxidant balance and in energy production.

AB  - Simple Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing global concern. Effective alternatives that could replace and reduce antimicrobial treatments in farming have therefore become crucial for animal, human and environmental health. In swine farming, weaning is a stressful phase where piglets can develop multifactorial enteric disorders that require antibiotic treatments. Functional nutrition could thus represent a valuable alternative to reduce and tackle antibiotic resistance. This study assesses the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri on in-feed supplementation in weaned piglets. After weaning, piglets were allotted to four experimental groups fed a basal diet (CTRL) and a basal diet supplemented with 2 x 10(8) CFU/g of L. plantarum (PLA), L. reuteri and a combination of the two strains (P+R) for 28 days. Zootechnical performance and diarrhoea occurrence were recorded. Microbiological and serum metabolism analyses of faeces and blood samples were performed. Supplemented groups with lactobacilli showed a lower occurrence of diarrhoea and improved faecal consistency compared to the control. The PLA group registered the lowest diarrhoea frequency during the 28-day experimental period. The results suggest that dietary administration of L. plantarum and L. reuteri could prevent the occurrence of diarrhoea in weaned piglets. The effects of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri and their combination were assessed in weaned piglets. Three hundred and fifty weaned piglets (Landrace x Large White), balanced in terms of weight and sex, were randomly allotted to four experimental groups (25 pens, 14 piglets/pen). Piglets were fed a basal control diet (CTRL, six pens) and a treatment diet supplemented with 2 x 10(8) CFU/g of L. plantarum (PLA, 6 pens), 2 x 10(8) CFU/g L. reuteri (REU, six pens) and the combination of both bacterial strains (1 x 10(8) CFU/g of L. plantarum combined with 1 x 10(8) CFU/g of L. reuteri, P+R, 7 pens) for 28 days. Body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly. Diarrhoea occurrence was assessed weekly by the faecal score (0-3; considering diarrhoea >= 2). At 0 and 28 days, faecal samples were obtained from four piglets per pen for microbiological analyses and serum samples were collected from two piglets per pen for serum metabolic profiling. Treatments significantly reduced diarrhoea occurrence and decreased the average faecal score (0.94 +/- 0.08 CTRL, 0.31 +/- 0.08 PLA, 0.45 +/- 0.08 REU, 0.27 +/- 0.08 P+R; p < 0.05). The PLA group registered the lowest number of diarrhoea cases compared to other groups (20 cases CTRL, 5 cases PLA, 8 cases REU, 10 cases P+R; p < 0.01). After 28 days, the globulin serum level increased in PLA compared to the other groups (24.91 +/- 1.09 g/L CTRL, 28.89 +/- 1.03 g/L PLA, 25.91 +/- 1.03 g/L REU, 25.31 +/- 1.03 g/L P+R; p < 0.05). L. plantarum and L. reuteri could thus be considered as interesting functional additives to prevent diarrhoea occurrence in weaned piglets.

AB  - Administration of multiple subanesthetic doses of ketamine increases the duration of antidepressant effects relative to a single ketamine dose, but the mechanisms mediating this sustained effect are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ketamine's rapid and sustained effects on affective behavior are mediated by separate and temporally distinct mechanisms. The rapid effects of a single dose of ketamine result from increased activity of immature neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus without an increase in neurogenesis. Treatment with six doses of ketamine over two weeks doubled the duration of behavioral effects after the final ketamine injection. However, unlike ketamine's rapid effects, this more sustained behavioral effect did not correlate with increased immature neuron activity but instead correlated with increased numbers of calretinin-positive and doublecortin-positive immature neurons. This increase in neurogenesis was associated with a decrease in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, a known inhibitor of neurogenesis. Injection of a BMP4-expressing lentivirus into the dentate gyrus maintained BMP signaling in the niche and blocked the sustained - but not the rapid - behavioral effects of ketamine, indicating that decreased BMP signaling is necessary for ketamine's sustained effects. Thus, although the rapid effects of ketamine result from increased activity of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus without requiring an increase in neurogenesis, ketamine's sustained effects require a decrease in BMP signaling and increased neurogenesis along with increased neuron activity. Understanding ketamine's dual mechanisms of action should help with the development of new rapid-acting therapies that also have safe, reliable, and sustained effects.

AB  - The severe bleeding complications of long-term antiplatelet therapy limit its broader application in the treatment or prevention of thrombosis-associated diseases. This risk is particularly serious when facing emergency surgeries where rapid restoration of normal platelet function is required. Timely reversal of the effects of antiplatelet agents becomes crucial in such scenarios. Despite the widespread use of clopidogrel and prasugrel for their potent antiplatelet activity, the absence of specific and effective reversal agents remains a notable challenge. The pharmacological activity of clopidogrel and prasugrel is mediated by sulfhydryl-containing active metabolites, which form disulfide bonds with P2Y(12) receptors on the surface of platelets to inhibit their aggregation. Taking advantage of this action mechanism of these "irreversible" antiplatelet drugs, click chemistry-functionalized mesoporous silica (SiO2-Mal) nanotraps are fabricated to capture the antiplatelet drugs' active metabolites and restore hemostasis. Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the SiO2-Mal nanotraps is conducted using mouse, rabbit, and pig animal models, highlighting their potential application as a functional reversal agent for clinically relevant thienopyridine antiplatelet drugs, believed until now to be irreversible in their inhibition of platelet activity.

AB  - The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus plays a key role in memory formation, and it is known to be modulated by septal projections. By performing electrophysiology and optogenetics, we evaluated the role of cholinergic modulation in the processing of afferent inputs in the DG. We show that mature granule cells (GCs), but not adult-born immature neurons, have increased responses to afferent perforant path stimuli upon cholinergic modulation. This is due to a highly precise reconfiguration of inhibitory circuits, differentially affecting Parvalbumin and Somatostatin interneurons, resulting in a nicotinic-dependent perisomatic disinhibition of GCs. This circuit reorganization provides a mechanism by which mature GCs could escape the strong inhibition they receive, creating a window of opportunity for plasticity. Indeed, coincident activation of perforant path inputs with optogenetic release of acetylcholine produces a long-term potentiated response in GCs, essential for memory formation.

AB  - Background Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) plays a critical role in the central nervous system (CNS), including hippocampal synaptic plasticity, maintenance of excitatory synaptic transmission, fear regulation, as well as long-term potentiation (LTP). Results In this study, we found that Lrp4 was highly expressed in layer II of the piriform cortex. Both body weight and brain weight decreased in Lrp4(ECD/ECD) mice without TMD (Transmembrane domain) and ICD (intracellular domain) of LRP4. However, in the piriform cortical neurons of Lrp4(ECD/ECD) mice, the spine density increased, and the frequency of both mEPSC (miniature excitatory postsynaptic current) and sEPSC (spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current) was enhanced. Intriguingly, finding food in the buried food-seeking test was prolonged in both Lrp4(ECD/ECD) mice and Lrp4 cKO (conditional knockout of Lrp4 in the piriform cortex) mice. Conclusions This study indicated that the full length of LRP4 in the piriform cortex was necessary for maintaining synaptic plasticity and the integrity of olfactory function.

AB  - Simple Summary: At present, it is particularly important to reduce costs and improve economic efficiency in farm production. However, in intensive production, the situation of insufficient milk production in sows and the poor growth of piglets has become increasingly serious. In this context, how to increase sow milk production and improve piglet growth is the primary goal of researchers. Some studies have shown that feeding MSG to sows can enhance the growth of newborn pigs, but some researchers suspect that the addition of MSG is not safe for sows. Therefore, this experiment aims to study the impact of MSG on sows and piglets. Our research results prove that MSG is safe and effective, can reduce costs, improve economic benefits, and is suitable for intensive production. In most current farm operations, lactating sows need to overcome reproductive and environmental stresses that have resulted in poor sow production performance and piglet growth. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of in-feed supplementation of monosodium glutamate (MSG) in sows during late gestation lactation in regard to litter performance. The study subjects were 12 multi-parity sows (Landrace x Large White), farrowing sows with an average parity of four (three with three parities, seven with four parities, and two with five parities). They were randomly divided into the following two diet groups: the basal diet as a control (CON) group based on corn and soybean meal; and the basal diet + 2% MSG group. The experimental time ranged from 109 days before delivery to 21 days after delivery. There were six sows in each group, and each sow served as the experimental unit. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in body weight (BW), back fat (BF) thickness and estrus interval between sows supplemented with 2% MSG in their diets before and after farrowing and during weaning (p > 0.05). However, MSG-treated sows tended to increase BW loss at farrowing more than the CON group (p = 0.093) but lost less weight during lactation than the CON group (p = 0.019). There were no significant differences in the body condition scores (BCSs) and BF loss of the two groups of sows before and after farrowing and at weaning (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the weight of newborn piglets between the two groups of sows (p > 0.05). The weaning weight (p = 0.020) and average daily gain (ADG) (p = 0.045) of suckling piglets were higher in the MSG treated group compared to the CON group. The daily milk production of sows in the MSG treatment group was higher compared to the CON group (p = 0.045). The protein concentration of milk at week 3 (p = 0.060) and fat concentration of milk at week 5 (p = 0.095) of the MSG-supplemented sows tended to increase more than the CON group. In summary, the dietary inclusion of MSG supplementation had a beneficial effect on the late gestating sows and their piglet's growth and milk production. Our research has shown that the addition of 2% MSG in late gestation and lactation diet would be beneficial for both sow and piglet production.

AB  - Po-210 (polonium), one of the most toxic naturally occurring radionuclides, is well-known as a common natural radionuclide in fish species. Human consumption of Po-210-contaminated fish could result in a significant internal dose. This study determined by alpha spectrometry the Po-210 activity in sixteen selected fish species with different living behaviors (pelagic, demersal), trophic positions (herbivores, carnivores, omnivorous), and masses in Dong Thai Lake, Hanoi, Vietnam. The min, max, and average of the Po-210 concentration of sixteen fish species were 0.80 +/- 0.44, 12.7 +/- 0.20, and 3.54 +/- 0.31 Bq kg(-1), respectively. Regarding the different living behaviors, trophic positions, and masses, the results showed trending of Po-210(pelagic) > Po-210(demersal); Po-210(herbivores) < Po-210(carnivores) < Po-210(omnivorous) and Po-210(<0.2 kg) > Po-210(0.2- 1 kg) > Po-210>1(kg), respectively. The Po-210 concentrations in muscle tissue were greater in fish species with a small mass, omnivorous trophic position, and pelagic living behavior relative to demersal fish with a larger mass that were herbivores or carnivores. In addition, the results showed an uneven distribution of Po-210 activities in atmospheric aerosols, terrestrial soils, surface waters, and lake sediments in the study area. The primary source of Po-210 could be supplied from atmospheric aerosols and/or terrestrial soils in the study area. The Po-210 annual effective dose for adults due to fish consumption has been calculated with a range from 20 to 400 mu Sv y(-1) and 111 mu Sv. y(-1) on average, and it is far below the allowable limits of 1000 mu Sv y(-1.)

AB  - Network theory has led to important insight into statistical-mechanical aspects of systems showing scaling complexity. I apply this approach to simulate the behavior of animal space use under the influence of memory and site fidelity. Based on the parsimonious Multi-scaled random walk model (MRW) an emergent property of self-reinforcing returns to a subset of historic locations shows how a network of nodes grows into an increased hierarchical depth of site fidelity. While most locations along a movement path may have a low revisit probability, habitat selection is maturing with respect to utilization of the most visited patches, in particular for patches that emerge during the early phase of node development. Using simulations with default MRW properties, which have been shown to produce space use in close statistical compliance with utilization distributions of many species of mammals, I illustrate how a shifting spatio-temporal mosaic of habitat utilization may be described statistically and given behavioral-ecological interpretation. The proposed method is illustrated with a pilot study using black bear Ursus americanus telemetry fixes. One specific parameter, the Characteristic Scale of Space Use, is here shown to express strong resilience against shifting site fidelity. This robust result may seem counter-intuitive, but is logical under the premise of the MRW model and its relationship to site fidelity, whether stable or shifting spatially over time. Thus, spatial analysis of the dynamics of a gradually drifting site fidelity using simulated scenarios may indirectly cast light on the dynamics of movement behavior as preferred patches are shifting over time. Both aspects of complex space use, network topology and dynamically drifting dispersion of site fidelity, provide in tandem important descriptors of behavioral ecology with relevance to habitat selection.

AB  - We present a novel application using unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS; drones) for structure-from-motion three-dimensional (3-D) photogrammetry of multiple, free-living animals simultaneously. Pinnipeds reliably haul out on shore for pupping and breeding each year, accompanied by dramatic female-to-pup mass transfer over a short lactation period and males lose mass while defending mating territories. This provides a tractable study system for validating the use of UAS as a non-invasive tool for tracking energy dynamics in wild populations. UAS imagery of grey seals Halichoerus grypus was collected at Saddle Island, Nova Scotia. A multirotor UAS was piloted in 360-degree orbits around relatively dense animal aggregations and georeferenced images were used for construction of a 3-D point cloud, orthomosaic and Digital Surface Model for animal volumetric measurements. Directly following UAS survey, a subset of adult females were hand-measured (morphometrics, blubber depth, n = 21 handlings [15 were unique animals]) and female-pup pairs were weighed (adult females: n = 32 [24]; pups: n = 33 [23]) to validate that UAS 3-D photogrammetric models provided accurate animal volume and mass estimates. UAS two-dimensional body length measurements were sensitive to animal recumbency and posture. The new UAS 3-D photogrammetric method overcame these constraints, and aerial-derived body volume measurements were equivalent to those collected from the ground. UAS body volume measurements precisely predicted 'true' body mass (mean absolute error, adult female: 3.8 kg, 2.1% body mass; pup: 4.1 kg, 9.8%), and exhibited a stronger relationship with total body mass than with blubber volume. The method was applied to 673 free-living animals to characterize volume and mass dynamics across lactation and breeding for a much larger sample size than would be possible using traditional ground methods. Indeed, 1-46 animals (M +/- SE: 9.2 +/- 1.2) were modelled concurrently within the focal area of a UAS flight. Application of the method also captured significant inter-annual variation in body volume/mass dynamics, and female-to-pup energy transfer efficiencies were lower when there was low sea ice extent. The UAS 3-D photogrammetric method presented in this study is likely to be broadly applicable to other species, and the ability to measure whole groups of free-living animals at once makes strides towards 'weighing populations'.

AB  - The integration of renewable energy with circular economy strategies offers effective pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing local energy independence. This study analyses three real-world projects implemented in Spain that exemplify this synergy. LIFE Smart Agromobility converts pig manure into biomethane to power farm vehicles, using anaerobic digestion and microalgae-based upgrading systems. Smart Met Value refines biogas from a wastewater treatment plant in Guadalajara to produce high-purity biomethane for the municipal fleet, demonstrating the viability of energy recovery from sewage sludge. The UNDERGY project addresses green hydrogen storage by repurposing a depleted natural gas reservoir, showing geochemical and geomechanical feasibility for seasonal underground hydrogen storage. Each project utilises regionally available resources to produce clean fuels-biomethane or hydrogen-while mitigating methane and CO2 emissions. Results show significant energy recovery potential: biomethane production can replace a substantial portion of fossil fuel use in rural and urban settings, while hydrogen storage provides a scalable solution for surplus renewable energy. These applied cases demonstrate not only the technical feasibility but also the socio-economic benefits of integrating waste valorisation and energy transition technologies. Together, they represent replicable models for sustainable development and energy resilience across Europe and beyond.

AB  - Engrams, or the physical substrate of memory, recruit heterogeneous cell types. Targeted reactivation of neurons processing discrete memories drives the behavioral expression of memory, though the underlying landscape of recruited cells and their real-time responses remain elusive. To understand how artificial stimulation of fear affects intra-hippocampal neuron-astrocyte dynamics as well as their behavioral consequences, we express channelrhodopsin-2 in an activity -dependent manner within dentate gyrus neurons while recording both cell types with fiber photometry in hippocampal ventral CA1 across learning and memory. Both cell types exhibit shock responsiveness, with astrocytic calcium events uniquely modulated by fear conditioning. Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampus-mediated engram recapitulates coordinated calcium signatures time locked to freezing, mirroring those observed during natural fear memory recall. Our findings reveal cell -type -specific dynamics in the hippocampus during freezing behavior, emphasizing neuronalastrocytic coupling as a shared mechanism enabling both natural and artificially induced memory retrieval and the behavioral expression of fear.

AB  - Exposure to stressful conditions such as forced swim stress (FSS) induces antinociception. Previous reports determined that dopamine receptors in the CA1 hippocampal area are important in chronic pain processing. Considering that neural mechanisms behind acute and chronic pain differ significantly, in this study, we have investigated the role of dopamine receptors within the CA1 region in the FSS-induced antinociceptive response in the acute pain induced by the tail-flick test in the rat. The cannula was implanted unilaterally in the CA1 region of the animal brain. Animals received drugs or vehicles 5 min before FSS exposure. SCH23390 as the D1-like dopamine receptor (D1R) antagonist and Sulpiride as the D2-like dopamine receptor (D2R) antagonist were microinjected into the CA1 area at three doses (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/0.5 mu l vehicle); the vehicle groups received saline instead of SCH23390 and dimethyl sulfoxide instead of Sulpiride. After exposure to FSS, the tail-flick test was done. The findings of this study revealed that FSS significantly attenuates nociceptive response during the tail-flick test (P < 0.0001). Moreover, intra-CA1 microinjection of SCH23390 and Sulpiride significantly reduces the FSS-induced antinociception in the inducing acute pain (P < 0.0001). The comparison of effective dose of 50% for D1R and D2R antagonists showed that both receptors in the CA1 almost equally reduce the FSS-induced antinociception in the tail-flick test. The result of this study supports the hypothesis, that the dopaminergic system in CA1 is involved in triggering a stress-induced antinociceptive response in acute pain conditions.

AB  - Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is one of the treatment options for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). To ana-lyze the efficacy of VNS in children of DRE with structural etiology, we conducted a cohort study includ-ing 95 patients of DRE with structural etiology who underwent VNS treatment. Patients were followed up every 3 months at the outpatient department or via a remote programming platform. The median follow-up period was 2.6 years (range 1.0-4.6 years). The respective responder rates at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up were 40.0% (38/95), 52.6% (50/95), 56.0% (47/84), and 59.7% (37/62). The respective seizure-free rates at 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up were 8.4% (8/95), 9.5% (8/84), and 9.7% (6/62). The patients were divided into four groups based on etiologies: malformations of cortical development (n = 26), post-encephalitic lesions (n = 36), perinatal brain injury lesions (n = 31), and hippocampal scle-rosis (n = 2). The respective responder rates at 12 months of follow-up in these groups were 53.8% (14/26), 52.8% (19/36), 51.6% (16/31), and 50.0% (1/2). There were no significant differences in gender, age at onset, age at stimulator implantation, epilepsy duration prior to VNS implantation, number of anti-seizure medications ever tried before VNS treatment, pulse amplitude of VNS, specific structural eti-ologies, lobe distribution or hemispheric side of structural lesions between responders and non-responders. Of the 95 patients, 8 (8.4%) underwent lesion surgery or hemispherectomy before VNS implantation, and 6/8 (75%) of these patients had a >50% reduction in seizure frequency. One patient who had a corpus callosotomy before VNS implantation had no response to VNS treatment. In conclusion, VNS is an effective treatment in children of DRE with structural etiology. There was no significant differ-ence in VNS efficacy in patients with different structural etiologies. Vagus nerve stimulation treatment may also control seizures well in some patients with poor outcomes after lesion resection or hemi-spherectomy before VNS implantation.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To determine the characteristics of olfactory dysfunction in patients with temporal lobe epi-lepsy (TLE). Methods: Odor identification was assessed using the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J, full score 12 points) in 65 patients with TLE and in 74 controls. Results: The mean OSIT-J score was significantly lower in patients with TLE (mean +/- SD = 8.1 +/- 2.8; med-ian = 9) than in the control subjects (mean +/- SD = 10.6 +/- 1.1; median = 11) (P < 0.005). Olfactory dysfunc-tion (hyposmia/anosmia) was associated with bilateral seizure foci and older age of onset in TLE. Patients who underwent temporal lobectomy for hippocampal sclerosis did not show significant decline after long-term recovery. The Indian ink part of OSIT-J was useful for the detection of olfactory deficits in patients with TLE (sensitivity = 47%, specificity = 93%). Patients with TLE tended to have preserved olfac-tory ability for stimulating odors and for familiar odors of daily life. Significance: We observed characteristic odor identification deficits for individual odors used in OSIT-J. Our study findings provide deeper insight into the underlying mechanism of olfactory function in patients with TLE and may be beneficial in the clinical management of these patients.

AB  - The spontaneous dynamics of the brain modulate its function from moment to moment, shaping neural computation and cognition. Functional MRI (fMRI), while classically used as a tool for spatial localization, is increasingly being used to identify the temporal dynamics of brain activity. fMRI analyses focused on the temporal domain have revealed important new information about the dynamics underlying states such as arousal, attention, and sleep. Dense temporal sampling - either by using fast fMRI acquisition, or multiple repeated scan sessions within individuals - can further enrich the information present in these studies. This review focuses on recent developments in using fMRI to identify dynamics across brain states, particularly vigilance and sleep states, and the potential for highly temporally sampled fMRI to answer these questions.

AB  - AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs) are rapidly inserted into synapses undergoing plasticity to increase synaptic transmission, but it is not fully understood if and how AMPAR-containing vesicles are selectively trafficked to these synapses. Here, we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from their endogenous loci in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and characterized the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1-containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced structural plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F-actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of synaptic activity.

AB  - Hypertension is not merely a vascular disorder but a significant risk factor for neural impairment. Moreover, healthcare for the hypertensive population with environmental or occupational pollutants has become an issue of increasing concern in public health. As a traditional neurotoxic heavy metal, Pb exposure results in neuroinflammation as well as neurodegenerative diseases. The current study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in hypertensive mice exposed to Pb. We demonstrated that hypertension exacerbated Pb-induced neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and hypothalamus, as evidenced by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (CD206 and IL-10). Additionally, hypertension enhanced the neuroinflammatory response in microglia, as indicated by similar changes in cytokine expression in an in vitro cell model. Importantly, we found that TREM2, a key regulator of microglial inflammation, was downregulated in hypertensive mice with Pb exposure. This decline in TREM2 expression was associated with increased proteolysis of TREM2 by a disintegrin and metalloproteases 10 (ADAM10) as well as a disintegrin and metalloproteases 17 (ADAM17), in which ADAM17 was verified as the main cleavage enzyme in terms of TREM2 proteolytic cleavage in hypertensive mice following Pb exposure. Furthermore, we identified miR-26a-5p as a potential regulator of ADAM17 expression, suggesting a potential mechanism for the downregulation of TREM2 in this context. Our findings provided new insights into the complex interplay between hypertension, Pb exposure, and neuroinflammation as well as highlight the potential role of TREM2, ADAM17, and miR-26a-5p as therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation in hypertensive populations with Pb exposure.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the health risk attributable to the consumption of mercury-contaminated fish for the urban and non-urban populations living in the Roraima state, Amazon, Brazil. Seventy-five fish specimens distributed across twenty different species, comprising four trophic levels (i.e., herbivore, omnivore, detritivore, and carnivore), were collected at four locations in the Branco River Basin. The fish samples were sent to the Toxicology Laboratory at Evandro Chagas Institute to determine the total-Hg levels by using the cold vapor atomic system (CVAAS). The total-Hg levels ranged from 0 to 3.159 mu g/g. The average concentration in non-carnivorous species (n = 32) was 0.116 mu g/g, and among carnivorous fish (n = 43), it was 0.869 mu g/g. The weighted average of contamination levels for all samples was 0.545 mu g/g. The health risk assessment was conducted according to the methodology proposed by the World Health Organization and different scenarios of human exposure were considered, based on three levels of fish consumption (low: 50 g/day; moderate: 100 g/day and high: 200 g/day). Women of childbearing age ingest 5 to 21 times more mercury than the dose considered safe by the U.S. EPA and intake a dose from 2 to 9 times higher than the safe dose proposed by FAO/WHO. Children under 5 years of age ingest from 18 to 75 times the dose proposed by the U.S. EPA and from 8 to 32 more mercury than the limit proposed by FAO/WHO. In summary, regardless of the level of fish consumption, type of residency (urban or non-urban), and the subset of the population analyzed, anyone who consumes fish from the locations sampled is at high risk attributable to mercury ingestion, with the only exception of adult men, who consume an average of 50 g of fish per day.

AB  - In contrast to mercury, an extremely toxic element, selenium is an essential micronutrient, which by complexing with mercury can mitigate its toxicity. In this regard, we quantified mercury and selenium concentrations in samples (n = 309) of fish tissues and analyzed the Se:Hg molar ratio and HBVSe as toxicological risk biomarkers. The data indicated that mercury levels in planktivorous fish (0.630 +/- 0.202 mg kg(-1)) and carnivorous fish (1.196 +/- 0.513 mg kg(-1)) were above the Brazilian limits considered safe for daily consumption. The highest selenium concentrations were observed in planktivores (0.272 +/- 0.093 mg kg(-1)) and the lowest in herbivores (0.099 +/- 0.092 mg kg(-1)). Molar ratios greater than one and positive HBVSe values were found in 42% of the fish samples (n = 131). As a result, we found that (i) the trophic level influences the risk of mercury exposure through the intake of fish in the diet; (ii) the approach presented in our study (model II) involves greater rigor concerning intake and exposure via fish consumption, since it considers the antagonistic Se:Hg ratio; and (iii) selenium can attenuate mercury toxicity, but safe thresholds vary depending on the species.

AB  - Animals and humans are exposed to various residues that can have a detrimental impact on health, including carcinogenic potential, endocrine disruption, or fatal toxicity. The toxic burden can be evaluated in several biological samples, with serum being one of the preferred and most convenient options. In this study, we have applied and validated a method for detecting several hundred toxins in serum samples. This technique involved a single-step QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) extraction followed by analysis using gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. With this methodology, we could detect and quantify up to 353 compounds, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and rodenticides, using just 250 & mu;L of serum. Among them, 92% could be measured at concentrations below 1.25 ng/mL, making it ideal for biomonitoring. We applied this method to samples collected from camels (n = 40) and humans (n = 25). We detected naproxen, ketoprofen, paracetamol, levamisole, and some POPs in these samples. This study validated the ability to simultaneously detect a broad range of compounds in small volumes of serum.

AB  - Vascular endothelial dysfunction is the initial step in atherosclerosis (AS). AS tends to occur at vascular bifurcations and curves, and endothelial cells(ECs) are highly susceptible to injury due to mechanical forces induced by disturbed flow (DF) with inconsistent blood flow directions. However, the pathogenesis of endothelial cell dysfunction in AS remains unclear and needs further study. Here, we found that Piezo1 expression was significantly increased in DF- and oxidized low-density lipoprotein(ox-LDL)-treated HUVECs in vitro and a model of atherosclerotic plaque growth in ApoE-/- mice fed a Western diet. Furthermore, Piezo1 upregulated autophagy levels in the HUVECs model, which was reversed by Piezo1 knockdown with a lentivirus-mediated shRNA system. Mechanistically, the level of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway, was significantly elevated in the DF- and ox-LDL-induced HUVECs model, and this effect was further inhibited by Piezo1 knockdown. Moreover, the Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 inhibited the protein level of microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3-II(LC3-II) and increased the protein level of sequestosome1(p62/SQSTM1) in a dose-dependent manner, while significantly promoting the protein expression and nuclear translocation of YAP. The YAP inhibitor CA3 weakened Yoda1-mediated inhibition of autophagy. Our results suggest that Piezo1 may regulate endothelial autophagy by promoting YAP activation and nuclear translocation, thereby contributing to vascular endothelial dysfunction.

AB  - Sewage sludge and livestock (chicken, swine and cattle) manure samples were collected from the Yanmenguan Cattle Herbivorous Livestock Area to compare the potential ecological and human health risks caused by heavy metals contained in them. In this study, the Class II level of Quality Control of Imported Organic Fertilizers is selected as the limit standard value of heavy metals. Based on the mean content values, no heavy metal in cattle manure was higher than the limit standard value; the content of Cu in swine manure was higher than the limit of Cu; the content of Zn in sewage sludge, chicken manure and swine manure were all higher than the limit of Zn; and the content of Cr in sewage sludge and chicken manure were all higher than the limit of Cr. Results indicated that sewage sludge and livestock manure all had high contents of Zn, Cu and Cr. The mean pollution index (PI) suggested that Cu, Zn, As and Cr in sewage sludge and livestock manures all induced potential ecological risks. According to the mean Nemerow's synthetic pollution index (PN) values, swine manure had the highest potential ecological risk for agricultural use. Daily exposure to Cu, Zn and Cr was higher than other heavy metals from sewage sludge and livestock manures, and heavy metal exposure was always higher for children than adults, with ingestion as the main pathway. Non-carcinogenic risk was caused mainly by Cu and Cr, based on the higher hazard quotient (HQ) values for adults and children. There was no non-carcinogenic risk for all people, except exposure of Cu from swine manure for children, which was 1.76 times higher than the threshold value of 1. According to the mean hazard index (HI) values, only swine manure had a non-carcinogenic risk for children. As the carcinogenic risk index (Risk) values were continuously greater for As than Cd, As had a higher carcinogenic risk than Cd. There was no carcinogenic risk for any single heavy metal, although As exposure from sewage sludge was found to have an inapparent carcinogenic risk for both adults and children. Regarding the RISK value, sewage sludge had an unacceptable carcinogenic risk for adults and children, and swine manure had an unacceptable risk for children only. In general, for both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, ingestion was the main pathway, and children were more sensitive than adults. Comparing the four kinds of organic waste, cattle manure was the safest for agricultural use in terms of ecological and human health risks. In multiple comparisons, swine manure was significantly different regarding potential ecological risk and non-carcinogenic risk, and sewage sludge was significantly different regarding carcinogenic risk.

AB  - Termites are eusocial insects known to use a variety of pheromones in tasks necessary for maintenance of their societies. As such, olfaction and pheromone communication in termites has been an object of intense study; trail-following pheromones (TFPs) and sex-pairing pheromones (SPPs), for example, have been identified in many termite species. In contrast, the molecular basis of olfactory detection is understudied in the group. Here, we present chemosensory genes of three species of termites belonging to three distinct lineages, Neotermes cubanus (Kalotermitidae), Prorhinotermes simplex (Rhinotermitidae), and Inquilinitermes inquilinus (Termitidae). Using antennal transcriptome screening of termite workers, we identified the chemosensory genes, which allowed us to perform phylogenetic analysis. We found a comparatively large repertoires of odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), odorant binding proteins (OBPs), chemosensory proteins (CSPs), and sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). The evolutionary analysis of termite chemosensory genes revealed Isoptera-specific expansions with a 1:1 orthologous pattern, indicating the existence of conserved olfactory functions. Our findings on basal eusocial insects will further enhance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of eusociality and the evolution of olfactory communication in termites.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYPs) are a superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substances in insects. In this study, the identification of putative P450 proteins was done and the elimination of the repeated sequences resulted in 57 proteins from Gastropacha populifolia, 63 proteins from Dendrolimus punctatus, and 53 proteins from Dendrolimus tabulaeformis. The putative P450 proteins were aligned together with seven other insect species based on five conserved domains. A total of ten co-orthologous groups were identified. Interestingly, one co-orthologous gene, CYP4g15 in CYP4 clan, was identified and its 3D structure analysis showed that the highly conserved sites of the predicted motifs were close to the active sites of P450. Furthermore, this study revealed that insect CYP4g15 and two bacteria cytochrome P450 were monophyletic. This suggests that insects CYP4g15 are not only functionally conserved but also an ancient gene originating from different bacteria species.

AB  - Chondrichthyans are now widely adopted as models for examining the development and evolution of the stem gnathostome body plan. The fins of some cartilaginous fish are recognized for their plesiomorphic form and mode of muscular development, i.e., epithelial extension. Despite detailed molecular and descriptive examinations of these developmental mechanisms, there has been little contemporary examination of the ontogeny and morphology of the musculature in chondrichthyans including that of the paired fins. This gap represents a need for further examination of the developmental morphology of these appendicular musculatures to gain insight into their evolution in gnathostomes. The elephant shark is a Holocephalan, the sister group of all other chondrichthyans (Holocephali: Callorhinchus milii). Here, we use nano-CT imaging and 3D reconstructions to describe the development of the pelvic musculature of a growth series of elephant shark embryos. We also use historical descriptions from the nineteenth century and traditional dissection methods to describe the adult anatomy. This combined approach, using traditional methods and historical knowledge with modern imaging techniques, has enabled a more thorough examination of the anatomy and development of the pelvic musculature revealing that chimaeroid musculatures are more complex than previously thought. These data, when compared to extant and extinct sister taxa, are essential for interpreting and reconstructing fossil musculatures as well as understanding the evolution of paired fins.

AB  - BackgroundHigh-resolution sound and movement recording tags offer unprecedented insights into the fine-scale foraging behaviour of cetaceans, especially echolocating odontocetes, enabling the estimation of a series of foraging metrics. However, these tags are expensive, making them inaccessible to most researchers. Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs), which have been widely used to study diving and foraging behaviour of marine mammals, offer a more affordable alternative. Unfortunately, data collected by TDRs are bi-dimensional (time and depth only), so quantifying foraging effort from those data is challenging.MethodsA predictive model of the foraging effort of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) was developed to identify prey capture attempts (PCAs) from time-depth data. Data from high-resolution acoustic and movement recording tags deployed on 12 sperm whales were downsampled to 1 Hz to match the typical TDR sampling resolution and used to predict the number of buzzes (i.e., rapid series of echolocation clicks indicative of PCAs). Generalized linear mixed models were built for dive segments of different durations (30, 60, 180 and 300 s) using multiple dive metrics as potential predictors of PCAs.ResultsAverage depth, variance of depth and variance of vertical velocity were the best predictors of the number of buzzes. Sensitivity analysis showed that models with segments of 180 s had the best overall predictive performance, with a good area under the curve value (0.78 +/- 0.05), high sensitivity (0.93 +/- 0.06) and high specificity (0.64 +/- 0.14). Models using 180 s segments had a small difference between observed and predicted number of buzzes per dive, with a median of 4 buzzes, representing a difference in predicted buzzes of 30%.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a fine-scale, accurate index of sperm whale PCAs from time-depth data alone. This work helps leveraging the potential of time-depth data for studying the foraging ecology of sperm whales and the possibility of applying this approach to a wide range of echolocating cetaceans. The development of accurate foraging indices from low-cost, easily accessible TDR data would contribute to democratize this type of research, promote long-term studies of various species in several locations, and enable analyses of historical datasets to investigate changes in cetacean foraging activity.

AB  - Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of semantic knowledge in the context of anterior temporal lobe atrophy (left > right). Core features of svPPA include anomia and single-word compre-hension impairment. Despite growing evidence supporting treatment for anomia in svPPA, there is a paucity of research investigating neural mechanisms supporting treatment -induced gains and generalization to untrained items. In the current study, we examined the relation between the structural integrity of brain parenchyma (tissue inclusive of gray and white matter) at pre-treatment and treatment outcomes for trained and untrained items in a group of 19 individuals with svPPA who completed lexical retrieval treatment. Two structural neuroimaging approaches were used: an exploratory, whole-brain, voxel-wise approach and an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. Based on previous research, bilateral temporal (inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri), parietal (supramarginal and angular gyri), frontal (inferior and middle frontal gyri) and medial temporal (hippo -campus and parahippocampal gyri) ROIs were selected from the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Analyses revealed improved naming of trained items and general-ization to untrained items following treatment, providing converging evidence thatindividuals with svPPA can benefit from treatment for anomia. Better post-treatment naming accuracy was associated with the structural integrity of inferior parietal cortex and the hippocampus. Specifically, improved naming of trained items was related to the left supramarginal (phonological processing) and angular gyri (phonological and semantic processing), and improved naming of trained and untrained items was related to the left hippocampus (episodic, context-based memory). Future research should examine treat-ment outcomes in relation to pre-treatment functional and structural connectivity as well as changes in network dynamics following speech-language intervention to further elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying treatment response in svPPA and related disorders.

AB  - Background: Some patients who initially fail epilepsy surgery later become seizure-free, but it is not clear how the clinical characteristics of the patients or post-operative modifications of anti-seizure medication (ASM) regimens contribute to late seizure remission.Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery at the University of Washington Regional Epilepsy Center between 2007 and 2017, including patients receiving neocortical resection, temporal lobectomy, and hippocampal laser interstitial therapy (LITT) ablation. We assessed seizure freedom, ASM changes, seizure frequency at the first and last follow-up, and type of lesion. Two-tailed Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analyses.Results: Two hundred and fifteen patients undergoing epilepsy surgery between 2007 and 2017 had both first and last follow-ups. Ninety-eight (46%) were not seizure-free at the first follow-up (mean 1.1 years post-operative). By the last follow-up (mean 4.7 years post-operative), 20% of those not initially seizure free had become so. Those who were seizure-free at the last visit had lower median seizures per month in the first post-operative year (0.21 versus 0.95 per month in those not seizure-free, p < 0.001). There was also a significantly higher proportion of patients with cavernomas who were seizure-free at the last visit (25% vs. 1% of those not seizure-free at the last visit; p = 0.001), but no other differences in clinical characteristics. Of the 98 patients who had seizures at the first follow-up, 63% underwent post-operative modification of their ASM regimens. The rate of late seizure freedom was similar for patients with or without ASM changes: 21% were seizure-free at the last visit with ASM changes and 19% without ASM changes. There were no significant differences in which ASMs were changed between those who became seizure-free and those who did not, but patients who were subjected to further medical management were less likely to have had mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) than those who were not. A number of patients not initially seizure-free who underwent ASM changes achieved seizure freedom as long as 10 years post-surgery. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of patients who initially fail epilepsy surgery will have late seizure remission. Those with cavernous hemangiomas were more likely to achieve late remission from seizures as were those with lower rates of seizures in the first year after surgery. The chances of achieving remission were similar in those with or without modification of their ASM regimens, but those with preoperative MTS were more likely to achieve late seizure freedom without medication changes. At the individual level, patients may still achieve seizure freedom with ASM changes as long as ten years after the initial surgery.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Although epilepsy has previously been associated with behavioral changes, no previous study has utilized the behavioral models of the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) to investigate the impact of epilepsy on behavior. Therefore, the objective of this cross-sectional study is to examine the potential relationship between epilepsy and the neurobehavioral systems of the RST.Methods: Using the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory-Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ), this crosssectional study assessed the behavioral systems of the RST in a sample of 27 epilepsy patients and 27 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals. The RST-PQ was designed to assess the different behavioral systems of the RST. The behavioral approach system (BAS) is responsible of the approach behavior, in high values related to risk seeking and addictive behavior and in low values well related to depression. The behavioral inhibition system (BIS) is well related to anxiety in high levels, and the fight flight freeze system (FFFS) is responsible for the avoidance behavior. Results: After adjusting for age, no significant differences were found in demographic information (gender and marital status) between the general population and epilepsy patients. Gender distribution was similar, with 55.6% females in both groups. Marital status also showed no significant difference, with 74% single in the control group and 63% in the epilepsy group. Significant differences were observed in the behavioral systems of the RST. The epilepsy group had higher scores compared with the control group in several areas. BAS reward activity had a median score of 23 in the epilepsy group and 21 in the control group (p = 0.001). BAS goal drive persistence (p = 0.04), BAS impulsivity (p = 0.014), FFFS (p = 0.002), and BIS (median score of 77 in the epilepsy group and 66 in the control group) also showed significant differences, with p = 0.001. These significant differences remained consistent before and after matching the control group, indicating their robustness. The only exception was BAS reward activity, which did not show a significant difference after matching, with p = 0.106 and p = 0.051 before and after matching, respectively. Conclusions: The study suggests a potential positive association between epilepsy and the BIS, potentially mediated by the hippocampus. The relationship between epilepsy and the BAS, as well as the FFFS, may also be influenced by the BIS. These findings have clinical implications, but further research is needed to confirm these relationships.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) tend to accumulate excessive amounts of fluoride (F) compared to other plants. However, the specific mechanisms of F tolerance or detoxification in tea plants remain insufficiently understood. This study employed ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) to identify critical metabolites involved in F detoxification across two distinct tea plant cultivars with varying F accumulation capacities. Notably, malic acid and citric acid emerged as key metabolites that differentially accumulated under F-stressed conditions. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis indicated that C. sinensis aluminum (Al)-activated malate transporter genes CsALMT9 and CsALMT14 may be implicated in the response to F stress in C. sinensis. Further investigations revealed that CsALMT14 localized to the plasma membrane and exhibited significant transcriptional induction upon exposure to F toxicity. Moreover, heterologous expression of CsALMT14 enhanced F tolerance by mitigating F accumulation in transgenic yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, silencing of CsALMT14 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and virusinduced gene silencing reduced the content of malic acid but increased the accumulation of citric acid in tea plants, which might be attributed to the down-regulated expression of malic acid synthesis- and citric acid degradation-related genes. These findings suggest that CsALMT14 confers tolerance to F toxicity through F efflux and regulation of malic acid and citric acid metabolism-related gene expression, thereby providing a novel strategy for F detoxification in tea plants.

AB  - In a recent article [1], Quiroga argues that there is no pattern separation in the human hippocampus based on data from human single-neuron studies. Quiroga argues instead that the hippocampus codes memories by coactivation of invariant and context-independent engrams. We believe that both pattern separation and completion are important components of human memory, and that overlooked empirical studies and theoretical considerations fundamentally challenge the arguments posed.

AB  - Objectives The present study was to evaluate the bioaccumulation of heavy metals and possible human health risk from contaminated seafood resources from the Cochin Estuarine System, Southwest coast of India. Methods Water, sediment, fish, and shellfish samples were collected from the Cochin Estuarine System during the monsoon and non-monsoon period and were analyzed for heavy metals. Human health risk from contaminated fishes was analyzed using deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment methods. Results Water, sediment, and biota exhibited elevated concentrations of heavy metals during non-monsoon periods. Zinc was the most abundant metal, while cadmium had the lowest concentration among the three mediums. The presence of cadmium in the estuary posed a moderate to very high ecological risk. Zinc, cadmium, and chromium exceeded the toxicity threshold outlined in the sediment quality guidelines. All metals except cadmium showed significant variation between species and season (p < 0.05). Chromium and zinc correlated positively with fish size, while Cu, Cd, Mn, and Ni showed a negative correlation (p < 0.05). Chromium had the highest accumulation in herbivores, and Cd was highest in filter feeders. Cadmium and lead exceeded the standards of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India and the Food and Agriculture Organization. The estimated daily intake and target hazard quotient of individual metals were found to be very low. In the Monte Carlo simulation, the 95th percentile of the hazard index (0.80) indicates that consumers are close to experiencing non-carcinogenic health risks. The cancer risk for cadmium (2.15E-3) and chromium (3.90E-4) suggests that consumers may be vulnerable to long-term risk. Cadmium was found to be the most influencing metal in the risk analysis. Conclusion The results indicate the need for regular monitoring and risk assessment of heavy metals, especially lead, cadmium, and chromium, in seafood resources across coastal areas to ensure food security.

AB  - Septic shock is a life-threatening clinical condition characterized by a robust immune inflammatory response to disseminated infection. Little is known about its impact on the transcriptome of distinct human tissues. To address this, we performed RNA sequencing of samples from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, heart, lung, kidney and colon of seven individuals who succumbed to sepsis and seven uninfected controls. We identified that the lungs and colon were the most affected organs. While gene activation dominated, strong inhibitory signals were also detected, particularly in the lungs. We found that septic shock is an extremely heterogeneous disease, not only when different individuals are investigated, but also when comparing different tissues of the same patient. However, several pathways, such as respiratory electron transport and other metabolic functions, revealed distinctive alterations, providing evidence that tissue specificity is a hallmark of sepsis. Strikingly, we found evident signals of accelerated ageing in our sepsis population.

AB  - To avoid risks, organisms must recognize threatening heterospecies from non-threatening ones via acoustic cues from a distance. With land-use change, humans have encroached considerably into natural areas. Therefore, it is beneficial to animals to use acoustic cues to discriminate between different levels of threats posed by humans. Our study aims at testing this discriminatory ability in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), animals that have been for long history subjected to human interaction. We tested whether eighteen semi-captive elephants could discriminate between voices of their own mahouts (i.e., who take care of the elephants exclusively) and of other mahouts (unfamiliar individuals). The results showed that elephants responded successfully to the commands from their own mahouts, with an average response rate as high as 78.8%. The more years the mahouts had been as their caretakers, the more the elephant showed active responses toward the commands. Female elephants responded to the commands more frequently and faster than males. Also younger elephants responded more frequently and faster than older elephants. We argue that Asian elephants can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans by acoustic cues alone. Proximity with humans may be a factor, as fundamental as domestication, for animals to develop heterospecies discriminatory ability.

AB  - Simple Summary: Escherichia coli is one of the most common pathogens that causes piglet diarrhea, which poses a significant threat to the pig industry. Immunizing piglets through feedback feeding (i.e., feeding a homogenate of intestinal contents and tissues from E. coli-infected piglets to sows) has become a common strategy for preventing E. coli-induced diarrhea in suckling piglets. The uneven maternal antibody levels in sows after feedback feeding may be the main reason for the erratic effectiveness of this treatment. Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) is a kind of probiotic with excellent properties that can increase the levels of IgG and IgA in serum or milk. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of B. subtilis on the specific immune response of sows to E. coli and the diarrhea rate in their offspring. The data indicated that feeding B. subtilis to sows subjected to feedback feeding during late pregnancy and lactation could enhance their specific maternal immune response, which, in turn, could lead to better passive immunity in their offspring, resulting in an increased number of surviving weaned piglets, litter weight gain from birth to weaning, immunity, intestinal barrier function, and intestinal flora composition, as well as a decreased rate of diarrhea induced by E. coli. To investigate the effects of B. subtilis on the specific immune response of lactating sows to E. coli and the diarrhea rate in suckling piglets, thirty large white sows with similar farrowing dates were randomly divided into two groups: a feedback feeding (i.e., feeding a homogenate of intestinal contents and tissues from E. coli-infected piglets to sows; FB) group and a feedback feeding with B. subtilis (FB + BS) group. Serum, colostrum, and intestinal tissues from sows and piglets were collected to assess the immune response and intestinal barrier function at weaning. T and B cells from Peyer's patches (PPs) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) in lactating mice (with treatments consistent with the sows') were isolated to explore the underlying mechanism. The results showed that, compared with the FB group, the reproductive performance of sows and the growth performance of their offspring were effectively improved in the FB + BS group. Moreover, the levels of IgG/IgA and those of IgG/IgA against E. coli in the serum and colostrum of sows in the FB+BS group were increased (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the ratio of CD4+/CD8+, CD4+CXCR5+PD1+, and B220+IgA+ cells in MLNs and PPs, and the IgA levels in the mammary glands of mice, were also increased in the FB + BS group (p < 0.05). Notably, in suckling piglets in the FB + BS group, the diarrhea rate was decreased (p < 0.05), and the intestinal barrier function and intestinal flora composition at weaning were significantly improved. Overall, these results indicated that B. subtilis feed supplementation combined with feedback feeding in pregnant and lactating sows can reduce diarrhea in suckling piglets by enhancing the maternal immune response against E. coli and intestinal barrier function in their offspring, improving survival rates and pre-weaning growth.

AB  - Humans and other animals learn to extract general concepts from sensory experience without extensive teaching. This ability is thought to be facilitated by offline states like sleep where previous experiences are systemically replayed. However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams suggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying previous experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical architecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM), and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary, objective functions. We train the model on standard datasets of natural images and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on sleep states, memory replay, and dreams, and suggests a cortical implementation of GANs.

AB  - In a previous study, silkworm larvae were used as a novel model to assess the biotoxicity of ILs, which showed that ILs could cause significant physiological and biochemical changes in midguts and silk glands of the larvae, and result in the death of larvae. In order to investigate the toxicity of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazole chloride ([C(8)mim]Cl) to the larvae at molecular level, RNA-sequencing technology was used to construct transcriptomic profiles of midguts and silk glands in this work. Results showed that a lot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were effectively screened out through bioinformatics software based on the transcriptome data and reference genome. To give more detail, 5118 and 2211 DEGs (926 and 822 DEGs) were obtained in the midguts (silk glands) when the larvae were exposed to [C(8)mim]Cl for 6 and 12 h, respectively, relative to the controls. In addition, gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested that the DEGs could be divided into three categories (i.e., biological process, cellular component, and molecular function), and were involved in multiple organelle functions and complex biological processes. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in a variety of pathways, such as signal transduction, apoptosis, glycolysis, peroxisome, autophagy, hippo signaling pathway, arginine and proline metabolism. Results of quantitative realtime PCR and histopathological observation indicated that molecular mechanism of the larvae against [C(8)mim]Cl toxicology may be attributed to cell apoptosis regulation via both the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor-initiated pathway. Thus, these results provided useful data for exploring the toxicity of ILs to insects at molecular level.

AB  - Germinal centers (GCs) are transient structures in the secondary lymphoid organs, where B cells undergo affinity maturation to produce high affinity memory and plasma cells. The lifetime of GC responses is a critical factor limiting the extent of affinity maturation and efficiency of antibody responses. While the average lifetime of overall GC reactions in a lymphoid organ is determined experimentally, the lifetime of individual GCs has not been monitored due to technical difficulties in longitudinal analysis. In silico analysis of the contraction phase of GC responses towards primary immunization with sheep red blood cells suggested that if individual GCs had similar lifetimes, the data would be consistent only when new GCs were formed until a very late phase after immunization. Alternatively, there could be a large variation in the lifetime of individual GCs suggesting that both long and short-lived GCs might exist in the same lymphoid organ. Simulations predicted that such differences in the lifetime of GCs could arise due to variations in antigen availability and founder cell composition. These findings identify the potential factors limiting GC lifetime and contribute to an understanding of overall GC responses from the perspective of individual GCs in a primary immune response.

AB  - Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been adopted to help non-experts identify insect species from field images. However, the application of these methods on the rapid identification of tiny congeneric species moving across heterogeneous background remains difficult. To improve rapid and automatic identification in the field, we customized an existing CNN-based method for a field video involving two Phyllotreta beetles. We first performed data augmentation using transformations, syntheses, and random erasing of the original images. We then proposed a two-stage method for the detection and identification of small insects based on CNN, where YOLOv4 and EfficientNet were used as a detector and a classifier, respectively. Evaluation of the model revealed that one-step object detection by YOLOv4 alone was not precise (Precision = 0.55) when classifying two species of flea beetles and background objects. In contrast, the two-step CNNs improved the precision (Precision = 0.89) with moderate accuracy (F-measure = 0.55) and acceptable speed (ca. 5 frames per second for full HD images) of detection and identification of insect species in the field. Although real-time identification of tiny insects remains a challenge in the field, our method aids in improving small object detection on a heterogeneous background.

AB  - Mechanisms underlying visual imagery, the ability to create vivid mental representations of a scene in the absence of sensory input, remain to be fully understood. Some previous studies have proposed that visual imagery might be related to visual short-term memory (STM), with a common mechanism involving retention of visual information over short periods of time. Other observations have shown a strong relationship between visual imagery and functional activity in the hippocampus and primary visual cortex, both regions also associated with visual STM. Here we examined the relationship of visual imagery to STM and hippocampal and primary visual cortex volumes, first in a large sample of healthy people across a large age range (N = 229 behavioural data; N = 56 MRI data in older participants) and then in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (N = 19 in each group compared to 19 age-matched healthy controls).
   We used a variant of the "What was where?" visual object-location binding task to assess the quality of remembered information over short delays. In healthy people, no evidence of a relationship between the vividness of visual imagery and any visual STM performance parameter was found. However, there was a significant positive correlation between visual imagery and the volumes of the hippocampus and primary visual cortex. Although visual STM performance was significantly impaired in patients with Alzheimer's disease, their vividness of visual imagery scores were comparable to those of age-matched elderly controls and patients with Parkinson's disease. Despite hippocampal volumes also being reduced in Alzheimer's patients, there appeared to be no impact on their self-reported visual imagery. In conclusion, visual imagery was not significantly related to visual STM performance, either in healthy controls or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease but it was related to hippocampal and visual cortex volume in healthy people.

AB  - We are unresponsive during slow-wave sleep but continue monitoring external events for survival. Our brain wakens us when danger is imminent. If events are non-threatening, our brain might store them for later consideration to improve decision-making. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether novel vocabulary consisting of simultaneously played pseudowords and translation words are encoded/stored during sleep, and which neural-electrical events facilitate encoding/storage. An algorithm for brain-state-dependent stimulation selectively targeted word pairs to slow-wave peaks or troughs. Retrieval tests were given 12 and 36 hr later. These tests required decisions regarding the semantic category of previously sleep-played pseudowords. The sleep-played vocabulary influenced awake decision-making 36 hr later, if targeted to troughs. The words' linguistic processing raised neural complexity. The words' semantic-associative encoding was supported by increased theta power during the ensuing peak. Fast-spindle power ramped up during a second peak likely aiding consolidation. Hence, new vocabulary played during slow-wave sleep was stored and influenced decision-making days later.

AB  - Various therapeutic interventions have been studied and found to be effective in reducing the stereotypical behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There has been increasing interest in using animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) as an alternative approach to therapeutic rehabilitation for children with ASD, and many studies have reported that AAI has significant benefits for the cognitive, psychological, and social behavior of children with ASD. The present study was designed to examine the effects of a 16 weeks therapeutic horseback riding program on social interaction and communication skills in children with autism. Eighty-four children diagnosed with ASD, aged between 6 and 12 years old, were recruited for this study. All selected participants met the DSM-V criteria, and a total of sixty-one participants (N = 61) completed the study. A quasi-experimental design with an experimental group and control group was implemented for this study, taking measurements at pre-test, interim-test, and post-test to monitor the behavior changes in social and communication throughout the 16-week intervention. Repeated measures ANOVA and the independent sample t-test were used for data analysis, to assess the difference between the experimental group and control group. The results indicated that the THR program had positive influences on overall social skills and communication, based on the SSIS and the ABLLS-R scores, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). A notable improvement in the overall social interaction score was observed from the interim-testing point to post-test. In addition, participants in the therapeutic horseback riding (THR) group achieved significant improvements on six out of seven items in their communication evaluations. In conclusion, after 16 weeks of intervention, the THR program significantly enhanced the subdomains of social and communication skills in the areas of social interaction, communication, responsibility, and self-control, compared to the control group.

AB  - Regulation of interpersonal distance or "personal space" (PS; the space near the body into which others cannot intrude without eliciting discomfort) is a largely unconscious channel of non-verbal social communication used by many species including humans. PS abnormalities have been observed in neuropsychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia. However, the neurophysiological basis of these abnormalities remains unknown. To investigate this question, in this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected while individuals with psychotic disorders (PD; n = 37) and demographically-matched healthy control (HC) subjects (n = 60) viewed images of faces moving towards or away from them. Responses of a frontoparietal-subcortical network of brain regions were measured to the approaching versus the withdrawing face stimuli, and resting-state fMRI data were also collected. PS size was measured using the classical Stop Distance Procedure. As expected, the PD group demonstrated a significantly larger PS compared to the HC group (P = 0.002). In both groups, a network of parietal and frontal cortical regions showed greater approach-biased responses, whereas subcortical areas (the striatum, amygdala and hippocampus) showed greater withdrawal-biased responses. Moreover, within the PD (but not the HC) group, approach-biased activation of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and functional connectivity between the IPC and the ventral/limbic striatum were significantly correlated with PS size. This study provides evidence that PS abnormalities in psychotic illness involve disrupted function and connectivity of the PS network. Such brain-behavior relationships may serve as objective treatment targets for novel interventions for schizophrenia and related psychotic illnesses.

AB  - oxygen species (ROS), which are formed under the action of ionizing radiation and inflammation factors, react with lipids and lead to the formation of toxic metabolites; one of the most active among them is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). It modifies cell proteins by lysine, histidine, and cysteine residues and disrupts their functions. The purpose of this research is to assess the number of neurons containing 4-HNE-modified proteins two months after gamma-irradiation of the head at doses of 2, 8, and 20 Gy and determine the development of neuroinflammation at this period. Mouse brain cells were isolated by centrifugation through Percoll solution after brain tissue treatment with accutase. The number of neurons and neurons containing 4-HNE-modified proteins, as well as the number of cells of resting and activated microglia, were analyzed using flow cytometry; the level of expression of proinflammatory cytokine TNF alpha gene in the hippocampus was analyzed using RT-PCR. It is shown that 14.3 +/- 2.3% of neurons in the brains of control mice contain 4-HNE-modified proteins. Their number increased to 23.1 +/- 2.6 and 34.8 +/- 4.9% (p < 0.05) two months after irradiation of the head of mice at doses of 8 and 20 Gy. An increase in the proportion of activated microglia in isolated brain cells and the level of TNF alpha gene expression in the hippocampus in this period indicates the development of neuroinflammation. Therefore, in addition to direct damage during irradiation, neurons are exposed to ROS and toxic metabolites of lipid peroxidation, which are formed both during irradiation and during neuroinflammation developing in the long-term period after radiation exposure. The results of this research make it possible to consider the increase in the amount of 4-HNE-modified proteins in neurons as a marker of oxidative damage to these brain cells.

AB  - Glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission controls excitation and inhibition of postsynaptic neurons, whereas activity of ion channels modulates neuronal intrinsic excitability. However, it is unclear how excessive neuronal excitation affects intrinsic inhibition to regain homeostatic stability under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Here, we report that a seizure-like sustained depolarization can induce short-term inhibition of hippocampal CA3 neurons via a mechanism of membrane shunting. This depolarization-induced shunting inhibition (DShI) mediates a non-synaptic, but neuronal intrinsic, short-term plasticity that is able to suppress action potential generation and postsynaptic responses by activated ionotropic receptors. We demonstrate that the TRESK channel significantly contributes to DShI. Disruption of DShI by genetic knockout of TRESK exacerbates the sensitivity and severity of epileptic seizures of mice, whereas overexpression of TRESK attenuates seizures. In summary, these results uncover a type of homeostatic intrinsic plasticity and its underlying mechanism. TRESK might represent a therapeutic target for antiepileptic drugs.

AB  - Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a non-Hebbian synaptic mechanism that adjusts synaptic strength to maintain network stability while achieving optimal information processing. Among the molecular mediators shown to regulate this form of plasticity, synaptic signaling through retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor, RAR alpha, has been shown to be critically involved in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic transmission in both hippocampus and sensory cortices. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism through which postsynaptic RA and RAR alpha regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release during prolonged synaptic inactivity at mouse glutamatertic synapses. We show that RAR alpha binds to a subset of dendritically sorted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA splice isoforms and represses their translation. The RA-mediated translational de-repression of postsynaptic BDNF results in the retrograde activation of presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors, facilitating presynaptic homeostatic compensation through enhanced presynaptic release. Together, our study illustrates an RA-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling pathway through which postsynaptic protein synthesis during synaptic inactivity drives compensatory changes at the presynaptic site.

AB  - Accelerated long-term forgetting has been studied and demonstrated in adults with epilepsy. In contrast, the question of long-term consolidation (delays > 1 day) in children with epilepsy shows conflicting results. However, childhood is a period of life in which the encoding and long-term storage of new words is essential for the development of knowledge and learning. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate long-term memory consolidation skills in children with self-limited epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (SeLECTS), using a paradigm exploring new words encoding skills and their long-term consolidation over one-week delay. As lexical knowledge, working memory skills and executive/attentional skills has been shown to contribute to long-term memory/new word learning, we added standardized measures of oral language and executive/attentional functions to explore the involvement of these cognitive skills in new word encoding and consolidation. The results showed that children with SeLECTS needed more repetitions to encode new words, struggled to encode the phonological forms of words, and when they finally reached the level of the typically developing children, they retained what they had learned, but didn't show improved recall skills after a one-week delay, unlike the control participants. Lexical knowledge, verbal working memory skills and phonological skills contributed to encoding and/or recall abilities, and interference sensitivity appeared to be associated with the number of phonological errors during the pseudoword encoding phase. These results are consistent with the functional model linking working memory, phonology and vocabulary in a fronto-temporo-parietal network. As SeLECTS involves perisylvian dysfunction, the associations between impaired sequence storage (phonological working memory), phonological representation storage and new word learning are not surprising. This dual impairment in both encoding and long-term consolidation may result in large learning gap between children with and without epilepsy. Whether these results indicate differences in the sleep-induced benefits required for long-term consolidation or differences in the benefits of retrieval practice between the epilepsy group and healthy children remains open. As lexical development is associated with academic achievement and comprehension, the impact of such deficits in learning new words is certainly detrimental.

AB  - The "odyssey plot" was used to visualize referral delays in epilepsy surgery. Participants were 36 patients (19 males; 13-67 years, median 27 years) with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) who underwent resection surgery. The "referral odyssey plot" included five clinical episodes: seizure onset (T1), first visits to a non-epileptologist (T2) and to an epileptologist (T3), first admission to our epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) (T4), and resection surgery (T5). For each patient, we identified the first seizure type: the physician who first diagnosed focal aware seizure (FAS), focal impaired awareness seizure (FIAS), focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (FBTCS), and radiologically suspected HS. Within the overall delay (T1-T5, median 18 years; interquartile range [IQR] 14), non-epileptologist's delay (T2-T3, 11.5 years; IQR 12.25) was far (p < 0.0001) longer than patient's (T1-T2, 0 year; IQR 2.25), epileptologist's (T3-T4, 1 year; IQR 4), or after-EMU delay (T4-T5, 1 year; IQR 1). FAS onset cases had significantly longer T1-T2 (N = 5, median 7 years; IQR 6) than FIAS (N = 22, 0 year; IQR 1, p < 0.005) or FBTCS onset cases (N = 9, 0 year; IQR 0, p < 0.001). FAS was correctly diagnosed first by non-epileptologists in 17.9%, by out-patient epileptologists in 35.7%, and at the EMU in 46.4%. FIAS was correctly diagnosed first by non-epileptologists in 94.4% and by out-patient epileptologists in 5.6%. Non-epileptologists diagnosed FBTCS in all cases. HS was diagnosed by non-epileptologists in 13.9%, by out-patient epileptologists in 47.2%, and at the EMU in 38.9%. Early referral to epileptologists is most critical for early surgery. Early utilization of the EMU is highly recommended because FAS is often overlooked by outpatient epileptologists. The odyssey plot will be useful to improve the healthcare system for other types of epilepsy.

AB  - Neuroinflammation plays a protective role in the brain; however, in neurological diseases such as epi-lepsy, overactivated neuroinflammation, along with overexpression of inflammatory mediators, can cause neuronal tissue damage, which can trigger seizures due to loss of ionic or neurotransmitter home-ostasis. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, early growth response factor 3 (Egr3), and GABA A receptors in the hippocampus of naive audiogenic mutant tremor mice, and stimulated tremor mice after a seizure. Gene expression of Il-10, Il-6, Tnf-a, Ccl2, Ccl3, Egr3, Gabra1, and Gabra4 from hippocampal samples of naive and stimulated tremor mice were mea-sured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Relative to resistant mice, Ccl3 gene expression was increased and Il6 was decreased in the hippocampus of naive tremor mice. Thirty minutes after a seizure, Ccl3 and Il-10 mRNA expression were decreased (p < 0.0001; p = 0.0034, respectively) while Il6 was increased (p = 0.0052) in stimulated tremor mice, relative to naive animals. In addition, Egr3, Gabra1, and Gabra4 mRNA expression was decreased in the hippocampus of naive tremor mice, relative to resistant mice, which increased 30 minutes after a seizure (p = 0.0496; p = 0.0447, and p = 0.0011, respectively), relative to naive animals. In conclusion, overexpression of Ccl3 in the hippocampus of naive tremor mice, followed by downregulation soon after seizure in stimu-lated tremor mice, could be involved in changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in epilepsy. Il-10 may be involved in hippocampal downregulation of GABA A receptors of naive tremor mice, char-acterizing an important mechanism in audiogenic seizures triggering. Hippocampal alterations of proin-flammatory cytokines, Egr3, and GABA A receptors in tremor mice reinforce them as an alternative tool to modeling temporal lobe epilepsy.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Glucose metabolism is altered in epilepsy, and this may contribute to seizure generation. Recent research has shown that metabolic therapies including the ketogenic diet and medium chain triglycerides can improve energy metabolism in the brain. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP) is an intermediate of glycol-ysis and when administered exogenously is anticonvulsant in several rodent seizure models and may alter glucose metabolism. Here, we showed that F16BP elevated the seizure threshold in the acute 6 -Hz mouse seizure model and investigated if F16BP could restore impairments in glucose metabolism occurring in the chronic stage of the pilocarpine mouse model of epilepsy. Two weeks after the pilo-carpine injections, mice that experienced status epilepticus (SE, "epileptic") and did not experience SE (no SE, "nonepileptic") were injected with vehicle (0.9% saline) or F16BP (1 g/kg in 0.9% saline) daily for 5 consecutive days. At 3 weeks, mice were injected with [U-13C6]-glucose and the % enrichment of 13C in key metabolites in addition to the total levels of each metabolite was measured in the hippocampal formation and liver. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased total GABA in the hippocampal formation, regardless of whether mice had experienced SE. In the hippocampal formation, F16BP prevented reduc-tions in the % 13C enrichment of citrate, succinate, malate, glutamate, GABA and aspartate that occurred in the chronic stage of the pilocarpine model. Interestingly, % 13C enrichment in glucose-derived metabolites was reduced in the liver in the chronic stage of the pilocarpine model. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was also beneficial in the liver, preventing reductions in % 13C enrichment of lactate and alanine that were asso-ciated with SE. This study confirmed that F16BP is anticonvulsant and can improve elements of glucose metabolism that are dysregulated in the chronic stage of the pilocarpine model, which may be due to reduction of spontaneous seizures. Our results highlight that F16BP may be therapeutically beneficial for epilepsies refractory to treatment. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) has been associated with memory impairments, which are typically linked to hippocampal and mesial temporal cortex lesions. Considering the presence of extensive bidirectional frontotemporal connections, it can be hypothesized that executive dysfunction in TLE is modulated by the lateralization of the epileptic foci. Material and Methods: A comprehensive neuropsychological executive functions protocol was administered to 63 participants, including 42 individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (20 with right-TLE and 22 with left-TLE) and 21 healthy controls aged 20-49. Results: The results indicate that TLE patients exhibit poorer executive performance compared to healthy controls in working memory (F(2,60) = 4.18, p <.01), planning (F(2,60) = 4.71, p <.05), set shifting (F(2,60) = 10.1, p <.001), phonetic verbal fluency (F(2,60) = 11.71, p <.01) and semantic verbal fluency (F(2,60) = 9.61, p <.001. No significant differences were found in cognitive inhibition. Furthermore, right-TLE patients showed lower performance than left-TLE in set shifting (F(1,61) = 6.45, p <.05), while no significant differences were observed in working memory, planning, inhibition, and verbal fluency. Conclusions: This research emphasize the importance of considering the lateralization of the temporal lobe focus to achieve a more accurate neuropsychological characterization. The cognitive differences between left and right TLE patients highlight the need for individualized approaches in their treatment and care.

AB  - An analysis of changes in the role of mammals in the infection of humans with hydrophobia in Russia for the period 1534-2017 is presented. Human deaths when dealing with dogs have continually been recorded since the 16th century. The share of dogs in human hydrophobia infection reached 85% from the end of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century. In the 1960s and 1970s, it decreased to 30-35%, but in the early 21st century, it increased again to 43%. The role of cats in infecting humans has been reliably traced since the late 19th century, and it has increased from 2 to 18% over the last 130 years. The epidemic value of foxes is cyclical. In the late 18th century, fox rabies in Russia was not known. People died from hydrophobia after fox bites in the early 19th century, but since 1825 cases of human hydrophobia due to contacts with foxes were no more recorded. Foxes again started infecting people only from the 1940s. In some years from the 1970s to the 1990s, foxes were the source of hydrophobia in 50-52% cases. In the 21st century, the role of foxes in human infection has decreased to 16%, but the value of that predator in animal infection increased to almost 50%. The wolf has infected people throughout the historical record. Before World War II, the epidemic value of the wolf reached 19%, but since the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century, the death of people caused by wolf bites has varied within 2-7% cases. The raccoon dog started infecting people after World War II (0.4%). Its epidemic role has slowly increased and reached 11% in the 21st century. The corsak, the badger, the marten, the ferret, and the Arctic Fox rarely infect people, but they have participated in the epidemic process for at least 50 years, while the Arctic Fox has for 100 years. Over the territory of Russia, only two cases of human death have been recorded from hydrophobia after a bat bite, one in 1985 and the other in 2008. Cattle have infected humans throughout the observable past five centuries, but not too often, 0.3-2% cases. Small livestock, horses, and pigs have been extremely rare as an epidemic danger for at least the last 130 years. In Russia, people have never been infected with rabies received from insectivores, while that obtained from rodents has been recorded only three times: two from gophers and one from a squirrel.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the main pathogen causing porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVD/PCVADs), and infection of the host induces immunosuppression. Since quercitrin (QUE) has anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, it is worth exploiting in animal diseases. In this study, the interventional effects and the molecular mechanism of QUE on PCV2-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in 3D4/2 cells and the modulation of histone acetylation modifications were investigated. The ROS production was measured by DCFH-DA fluorescent probes. HAT and HDAC enzyme activity were determined by ELISA. Histone acetylation, oxidative stress and inflammation-related gene expression levels were measured by q-PCR. Histone H3 and H4 (AcH3 and AcH4) acetylation, oxidative stress and inflammation-related protein expression levels were measured by Western blot. The results showed that QUE treatment at different concentrations on PCV2-infected 3D4/2 cells was able to attenuate the production of ROS. Moreover, QUE treatment could also intervene in oxidative stress and decrease the enzyme activity of HAT and the mRNA expression level of HAT1, while it increased the enzyme activity of HDAC and HDAC1 mRNA expression levels and downregulated histone H3 and H4 (AcH3 and AcH4) acetylation modification levels. In addition, QUE treatment even downregulated the mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, I kappa B, AKT and p38, but upregulated the mRNA expression levels of IL-10, SOD, GPx1, p65, Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1. As to protein expression, QUE treatment downregulated the levels of iNOS, p-p65 and IL-8 as well as the phosphorylation expression of I kappa B and p38, while it upregulated the levels of HO-1 and NQO1. It was shown that QUE at 25, 50 or 100 mu mol/L regulated p38MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways by downregulating cellular histone acetylation modification levels while inhibiting the NF-kappa B inflammatory signaling pathway and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway, thus regulating the production of inflammatory and antioxidant factors and exerting both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

AB  - Human-animal conflict in Assam, India's north-eastern state, is rising continuously. Because it occurs year-round, it damages agricultural productivity and kills people and animals, including elephants. When a herd of wild elephants emerges from a deep forest and enters human-inhabited territory around the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) in Assam, an alert must be sounded for the neighbourhood residents and forest workers to prevent conflicts. Another concern is that many wild animals die near the KNP while crossing the national highway NH-37 which traverses the area. During floods, animals flee to the highlands for food and shelter. An automated animal identification and warning system near the KNP may reduce human-animal confrontations. This paper reports the design of a system that attempts to address the above concerns. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based strategies are utilized to recognize wild animals from live video sequences, provide warnings to avoid encounters, and protect humans and animals. Deep learning models and YoloV5 with the SENet attention layer are used to recognize wild animals in real-time. This model is trained using a public and customized dataset of animal species. Cameras attached to the cloud-based AI system take photographs from several KNP locations to confirm the model. The model's 96% accuracy in animal photographs and videos taken day and night and in feed from contemporaneous location has shown its utility. The model also improves reliability by 1-13% over previous methods.

AB  - The role of oxytocin-related genes in social-cognitive function has been previously established, but structural brain mechanisms underlying this link remain poorly understood. Utilizing a substantial dataset from the UK Biobank (N z 30,000), this research determined associations between variations in ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within three oxytocin pathway genes (i.e., the oxytocin/neurophysin I prepropetide gene, the cluster of differentiation 38 glycoprotein gene, the oxytocin receptor gene) and whole-brain gray matter volume. Carriers of the AA or AG genotypes of the oxytocin receptor gene rs237851 SNP exhibited significantly larger hippocampal volume than carriers of the GG genotype. These results support the link between variations in the oxytocin receptor gene and hippocampal structure, with possible impact on social-cognitive function such as social recognition memory.

AB  - The intrinsic pain inhibitory mechanisms can be activated by fear, anxiety, and stress. Stressful experiences produce analgesia, referred to as stress-induced analgesia (SIA). Major components of the limbic system, including the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus, are involved in the SIA. In this study, we tried to understand the role of dopamine receptors in the cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus in the forced swim stress (FSS)-induced analgesia. Stereotaxic surgery was unilaterally performed on 129 adult male Wistar rats weighing 220-280 g. SCH23390 (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/0.5 mu l saline) or sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/0.5 mu l DMSO), as D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively, were microinjected into the CA1 area, 5 min before exposure to FSS for a 6-min period. The vehicle groups received saline or DMSO instead of SCH23390 or sulpiride, respectively. The formalin test was done using formalin injection (50 mu l; 2.5%) into the plantar surface of the rat's hind paw immediately after exposure to FSS. The results demonstrated that FSS produces analgesia during the early and late phases of the formalin test. However, intra-CA1 microinjection of SCH23390 or sulpiride attenuated the FSS-induced analgesia in both phases of the formalin test. This study provides new insight into the role of D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors in the CA1 area in the FSS-induced analgesia during persistent inflammatory pain.

AB  - The functional organisation of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has long been described on the basis of cognitive processes such as recollection or familiarity. However, this view has recently been challenged, and researchers have proposed decomposing cognitive phenomena into representations and operations. According to the representational view, representations, such as scenes for the hippocampus and objects for the perirhinal cortex, are critical in understanding the role of MTL regions in cognition. In the present study, 51 healthy young participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while completing a visual-discrimination task. Subsequently, half of the participants performed a patch-cue recognition procedure in which "Rec" responses are believed to reflect the operation of pattern completion, whereas the other half performed a wholeitem remember/know procedure. We replicated the previously-reported demonstration that hippocampal involvement in pattern completion is preferential for scenes as compared with objects. In contrast, the perirhinal cortex was more recruited for object processing than for scene processing. We further extended these results to the operations of strength-signal memory and visual discrimination. Finally, the modulation of hippocampal engagement in pattern completion by representational content was found to be specific to its anterior segment. This observation is consistent with the proposal that this segment would process broad/global representations, whereas the posterior hippocampus would perform sharp/local representations. Taken together, these results favour the representational view of MTL functional organisation, but support that this specialisation differs along the hippocampal long-axis.

AB  - Background: Previous research has demonstrated that neuroinflammation is a key element in the progress of epilepsy. Nevertheless, it is currently unidentified which inflammatory factors and proteins increase or decrease the risk of epilepsy. Methods: We adopted Mendelian randomization techniques to explore the causal relationship between circulating inflammatory factors and proteins and various epilepsy. Our principal approach was inverse variance weighting, supplemented by several sensitivity analyses to guarantee the robustness of our findings. Results: Studies have identified associations between epilepsy and specific inflammatory factors and proteins: three inflammatory factors and six proteins are linked to epilepsy in general; one inflammatory factor and four proteins are associated with focal epilepsy with no documented lesions; two inflammatory factors and three proteins are related to focal epilepsy, excluding cases with hippocampal sclerosis; two inflammatory factors and two proteins are connected to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; two inflammatory factors and five proteins are linked to juvenile absence epilepsy; four inflammatory proteins are associated with childhood absence epilepsy; two inflammatory factors are related to focal epilepsy overall; two inflammatory factors and two proteins are connected to generalized epilepsy; and two inflammatory proteins are linked to generalized epilepsy with tonicclonic seizures. Additionally, six inflammatory factors may play a downstream role in focal epilepsy. Conclusion: Our study uncovers various inflammatory factors and proteins that influence the risk of epilepsy, offering instructive insights to the diagnosis and therapy of the condition.

AB  - Orexins are excitatory neuropeptides, mainly produced by neurons located in the lateral hypothalamus, which project to many brain areas. The orexinergic system plays a fundamental role in arousal, sleep/wakefulness, feeding, energy homeostasis, motivation, reward, stress and pain modulation. As a prominent part of the limbic system, the hippocampus has been involved in formalin-induced nociception modulation. Moreover, hippocampus regions express both orexin-1 (OX1) and orexin-2 (OX2) receptors. The present study investigated the role of OX2 receptors (OX2R) within the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus in the mediation of lateral hypothalamus-induced antinociception. Fifty-three male Wistar rats were unilaterally implanted with two separate cannulae into the lateral hypothalamus and CA1. Animals were pretreated with intra-CA1 TCS OX2 29 as an OX2R antagonist before intra-lateral hypothalamus administration of carbachol (250 nM) as a muscarinic agonist for chemical stimulation of orexinergic neurons. Formalin test was used as an animal model of persistent pain, following intra-lateral hypothalamus carbachol microinjection. Results showed that the chemical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus significantly attenuated formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviors during both phases of the formalin test, and administration of TCS OX2 29 into the CA1 blocked these antinociceptive responses in both phases, especially in the late phase. These findings suggest that OX2 receptors in the CA1 partially mediate the lateral hypothalamus-induced antinociceptive responses in persistent inflammatory pain.

AB  - Major depression disorder (MDD) has become a common life-threatening disorder. Despite the number of studies and the introduced antidepressants, MDD remains a major global health issue. Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) is traditionally used for food and medical purposes. This study investigated the chemical profile and the antidepressant-like effect of the Carthamus tincto-rius hot water extract in male mice and its mechanism using a transcriptomic analysis. The antidepressant effect of hot water extract (50 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) was investigated in mice versus the untreated group (saline) and positive control group (fluoxetine 10 mg/kg). Hippocampus transcriptome changes were investigated to understand the Carthamus tinctorius mechanism of action. The GCMS analysis of Carthamus tinctorius showed that hot water extract yielded the highest amount of oleamide as the most active ingredient. Neuro-behavioral tests demonstrated that the safflower treatment significantly reduced immobility time in TST and FST and improved performance in the YMSAT compared to the control group. RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant differential gene expression pattern in several genes such as Ube2j2, Ncor1, Tuba1c, Grik1, Msmo1, and Casp9 related to MDD regulation in 50 mg/kg safflower treatment as compared to untreated and fluoxetine-treated groups. Our findings demonstrated the antidepressant-like effect of safflower hot water extract and its bioactive ingredient oleamide on mice, validated by a significantly shortened immobility time in TST and FST and an increase in the percentage of spontaneous alternation.

AB  - Evidence suggests that some patients with isolated hippocampal damage appear to present with selective preservation of unfamiliar face recognition relative to other kinds of visual test stimuli (e.g., words). Bird and Burgess (2008) formulated a review and secondary analysis of a group of 10 cases all tested on a clinical assessment of word and face recognition memory (RMT, Warrington, 1984), which confirmed the key memory dissociation at the group level. The current work provides an updated secondary analysis of such cases with a larger published sample (N 1/4 52). In addition to group -level analyses, we also re-evaluate evidence using a single case statistical approach (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2005), enabling us to determine how many would make criteria for a 'classical dissociation' (Crawford, Garthwaite, & Gray, 2003). Overall, group -level analyses indicated the key pattern of significant differences confined to words was limited to small control sample comparisons. When using the large control sample provided by Bird and Burgess (2008), hippocampal cases as a group were significantly poorer for both classes of items. Furthermore, our single -case approach indicated few had a performance pattern of a relative difference across face > word categories that would meet statistical significance; namely within individual differences across categories that would warrant a significant 'classical dissociation'. Moreover, these analyses also found several cases with a 'classical dissociation' in the reverse direction: namely preserved recognition of words. Such analyses serve to demonstrate the need for a more conservative statistical approach to be undertaken when reporting selective 'preservation' of a category in recognition memory. Whilst material specificity has important implications for understanding the role of the hippocampus in memory, our results highlight the need for statistical methods to be unquestionably rigorous before any claims are made. Lastly, we highlight other methodological issues critical to group analyses and make suggestions for future work. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ProSAAS is one of the most abundant proteins in the brain and is processed into several smaller peptides. One of which, BigLEN, is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor, GPR171. Recent work in rodent models has shown that a small-molecule ligand for GPR171, MS15203, increases morphine antinociception and is effective in lessening chronic pain. While these studies provide evidence for GPR171 as a possible pain target, its abuse liability has not yet been assessed and was evaluated in the current study. We first mapped the distribution of GPR171 and ProSAAS throughout the reward circuit of the brain using immunohistochemistry and showed that GPR171 and ProSAAS are localized in the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex. In the major dopaminergic structure, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), GPR171 appeared to be primarily localized in dopamine neurons while ProSAAS is outside of dopamine neurons. Next, MS15203 was administered to mice with or without morphine, and VTA slices were stained for the immediate early gene c-Fos as a marker of neuronal activation. Quantification of c-Fos-positive cells revealed no statistical difference between MS15203 and saline, suggesting that MS15203 does not increase VTA activation and dopamine release. The results of a conditioned place preference experiment showed that treatment with MS15203 produced no place preference indicating a lack of reward-related behavior. Taken together this data provides evidence that the novel pain therapeutic, MS15203, has minimal reward liability. Therefore, GPR171 deserves further exploration as a pain target. Significance statement: MS15203, a drug that activates the receptor GPR171, was previously shown to increase morphine analgesia. The authors use in vivo and histological techniques to show that it fails to activate the rodent reward circuitry, providing support for the continued exploration of MS15203 as a novel pain drug, and GPR171 a novel pain target.

AB  - Scene imagery features prominently when we recall autobiographical memories, imagine the future and navigate around in the world. Consequently, in this study we sought to better understand how scene representations are supported by the brain. Processing scenes involves a variety of cognitive processes that in the real world are highly interactive. Here, however, our goal was to separate semantic and spatial constructive scene processes in order to identify the brain areas that were distinct to each process, those they had in common, and the connectivity between regions. To this end, participants searched for either semantic or spatial constructive impossibilities in scenes during functional MRI. We focussed our analyses on only those scenes that were possible, thus removing any error detection that would evoke reactions such as surprise or novelty. Importantly, we also counterbalanced possible scenes across participants, enabling us to examine brain activity and connectivity for the same possible scene images under two different conditions. We found that participants adopted different cognitive strategies, which were reflected in distinct oculomotor behaviour, for each condition. These were in turn associated with increased engagement of lateral temporal and parietal cortices for semantic scene processing, the hippocampus for spatial constructive scene processing, and increased activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that was common to both. Connectivity analyses showed that the vmPFC switched between semantic and spatial constructive brain networks depending on the task at hand. These findings further highlight the well-known semantic functions of lateral temporal areas, while providing additional support for the previously-asserted contribution of the hippocampus to scene construction, and recent suggestions that the vmPFC may play a key role in orchestrating scene processing.

AB  - Damage to the medial temporal lobe (MTL), which is traditionally considered to subserve memory exclusively, has been reported to contribute to impaired face perception. However, it remains unknown how exactly such brain lesions may impact face representations and in particular facial shape and surface information, both of which are crucial for face perception. The present study employed a behavioral-based image reconstruction approach to reveal the pictorial representations of face perception in two amnesic patients: DA, who has an extensive bilateral MTL lesion that extends beyond the MTL in the right hemisphere, and BL, who has damage to the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Both patients and their respective matched controls completed similarity judgments for pairs of faces, from which facial shape and surface features were subsequently derived and synthesized to create images of reconstructed facial appearance. Participants also completed a face oddity judgment task (FOJT) that has previously been shown to be sensitive to MTL cortical damage. While BL exhibited an impaired pattern of performance on the FOJT, DA demonstrated intact performance accuracy. Notably, the recovered pictorial content of faces was comparable between both patients and controls, although there was evidence for atypical face representations in BL particularly with regards to color. Our work provides novel insight into the face representations underlying face perception in two well-studied amnesic patients in the literature and demonstrates the applicability of the image reconstruction approach to individuals with brain damage.

AB  - Purpose: Thirty percent of epilepsy patients are drug-resistant (DR) and, in adults, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of DR- epilepsy. Patients with TLE exhibit a neuroinflammatory response associated with blood-brain barrier dysfunction. In this context, the main aim of our study was to evaluate peripheral levels and central expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in TLE patients and assess their association with drug resistance and inflammatory markers. Methods: Three groups of patients were included, 41 DR-TLE patients, 10 non-DR-TLE patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC). MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were assessed by ELISA in sera in all patients, and by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in a subgroup of DR-TLE patients and 3 controls. Peripheral and central cells phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively, while cytokines were determined in the two compartments by ELISA. Results: Central expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, and peripheral expression of TIMP-1, were higher in DR-TLE patients than in controls, while peripheral levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were higher in DR-TLE patients compared with non-DRE-TLE patients. MMP-9 levels in serum increased with seizure severity and decreased after successful epilepsy surgery. MMP-9 levels in the serum of DR-TLE patients were positively correlated with several markers of peripheral inflammation, which was not the case in the groups of non-DR-TLE patients and healthy controls. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression in the hippocampus of DR-TLE patients correlated positively with various markers of central inflammation. Negative correlations between their peripheral levels and central expression were observed. Conclusion: MMP-9 and TIMP-1 are markers that seem to be associated to the central and peripheral inflammatory reaction occurring in DR-TLE patients. The significant negative correlations between central and peripheral markers are interesting to note, and further studies need to be carried out to fully understand the complex regulation of these proteins during DR epilepsy.

AB  - Tau pathology is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, but how pathological tau accumulation alters the glutamate receptor dynamics driving synaptic dysfunction is unclear. Here, we determined the impact of tau pathology on AMPAR expression, density, and subcellular distribution in the hippocampus of P301S mice using immunoblot, histoblot, and quantitative SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling (SDS-FRL). Histoblot and immunoblot showed differential regulation of GluA1 and GluA2 in the hippocampus of P301S mice. The GluA2 subunit was downregulated in the hippocampus at 3 months while both GluA1 and GluA2 subunits were downregulated at 10 months. However, the total amount of GluA1-4 was similar in P301S mice and in age-matched wild-type mice. Using quantitative SDS-FRL, we unraveled the molecular organization of GluA1-4 in various synaptic connections at a high spatial resolution on pyramidal cell spines and interneuron dendrites in the CA1 field of the hippocampus in 10-month-old P301S mice. The labeling density for GluA1-4 in the excitatory synapses established on spines was significantly reduced in P301S mice, compared to age-matched wild-type mice, in the strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare but unaltered in the stratum oriens. The density of synaptic GluA1-4 established on interneuron dendrites was significantly reduced in P301S mice in the three strata. The labeling density for GluA1-4 at extrasynaptic sites was significantly reduced in several postsynaptic compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the three dendritic layers in P301S mice. Our data demonstrate that the progressive accumulation of phospho-tau is associated with alteration of AMPARs on the surface of different neuron types, including synaptic and extrasynaptic membranes, leading to a decline in the trafficking and synaptic transmission, thereby likely contributing to the pathological events taking place in AD.

AB  - To understand the neural basis of episodic memory it is necessary to appreciate the significance of the fornix. This pathway creates a direct link between those temporal lobe and medial diencephalic sites responsible for anterograde amnesia. A collaboration with Andrew Mayes made it possible to recruit and scan 38 patients with colloid cysts in the third ventricle, a condition associated with variable fornix damage. Complete fornix loss was seen in three patients, who suffered chronic long-term memory problems. Volumetric analyses involving all 38 patients then revealed a highly consistent relationship between mammillary body volume and the recall of episodic memory. That relationship was not seen for working memory or tests of recognition memory. Three different methods all supported a dissociation between recollective-based recognition (impaired) and familiaritybased recognition (spared). This dissociation helped to show how the mammillary body-anterior thalamic nuclei axis, as well as the hippocampus, is vital for episodic memory yet is not required for familiarity-based recognition. These findings set the scene for a reformulation of temporal lobe and diencephalic amnesia. In this revised model, these two regions converge on overlapping cortical areas, including retrosplenial cortex. The united actions of the hippocampal formation and the anterior thalamic nuclei on these cortical areas enable episodic memory encoding and consolidation, impacting on subsequent recall.

AB  - Psychiatric illnesses, including depression and anxiety, are highly comorbid with epilepsy (for review see Josephson and Jette (Int Rev Psychiatry 29:409-424, 2017), Salpekar and Mula (Epilepsy Behav 98:293-297, 2019)). Psychiatric comorbidities negatively impact the quality of life of patients (Johnson et al., Epilepsia 45:544-550, 2004; Cramer et al., Epilepsy Behav 4:515-521, 2003) and present a significant challenge to treating patients with epilepsy (Hitiris et al., Epilepsy Res 75:192-196, 2007; Petrovski et al., Neurology 75:1015-1021, 2010; Fazel et al., Lancet 382:1646-1654, 2013) (for review see Kanner (Seizure 49:79-82, 2017)). It has long been acknowledged that there is an association between psychiatric illnesses and epilepsy. Hippocrates, in the fourth-fifth century B.C., considered epilepsy and melancholia to be closely related in which he writes that "melancholics ordinarily become epileptics, and epileptics, melancholics" (Lewis, J Ment Sci 80:1-42, 1934). The Babylonians also recognized the frequency of psychosis in patients with epilepsy (Reynolds and Kinnier Wilson, Epilepsia 49:1488-1490, 2008). Despite the fact that the relationship between psychiatric comorbidities and epilepsy has been recognized for thousands of years, psychiatric illnesses in people with epilepsy still commonly go undiagnosed and untreated (Hermann et al., Epilepsia 41(Suppl 2):S31-S41, 2000) and systematic research in this area is still lacking (Devinsky, Epilepsy Behav 4(Suppl 4):S2-S10, 2003). Thus, although it is clear that these are not new issues, there is a need for improvements in the screening and management of patients with psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy (Lopez et al., Epilepsy Behav 98:302-305, 2019) and progress is needed to understand the underlying neurobiology contributing to these comorbid conditions. To that end, this chapter will raise awareness regarding the scope of the problem as it relates to comorbid psychiatric illnesses and epilepsy and review our current understanding of the potential mechanisms contributing to these comorbidities, focusing on both basic science and clinical research findings.

AB  - The telencephalon has undergone remarkable diversification and expansion throughout vertebrate evolution, exhibiting striking variations in structural and functional complexity. Nevertheless, fundamental features are shared across vertebrate taxa, such as the presence of distinct regions including the pallium, subpallium, and olfactory structures. Teleost fishes have a uniquely "everted" telencephalon, which has confounded comparisons of their brain regions to other vertebrates. Here we combine spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA-sequencing to generate a spatially-resolved transcriptional atlas of the Mchenga conophorus cichlid fish telencephalon. We then compare cell-types and anatomical regions in the cichlid telencephalon with those in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. We uncover striking transcriptional similarities between cell-types in the fish telencephalon and subpallial, hippocampal, and cortical cell-types in tetrapods, and find support for partial eversion of the teleost telencephalon. Ultimately, our work lends new insights into the organization and evolution of conserved cell-types and regions in the vertebrate forebrain.
   Single nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics reveal a detailed picture of the cichlid fish forebrain. Comparisons with atlases in other vertebrates uncover striking transcriptional similarities and lend new insights into forebrain evolution.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy frequently accompanies Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Notably, people with temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis may face an increased susceptibility to MDD, as evidence indicates the involvement of the limbic system in the development of emotional symptoms. Objectives: To determine the prevalence and predictors of depression in temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) and compare them to those of other epilepsy types. Methods: A sample of 293 epilepsy patients, including 159 non-TLE-HS and 134 TLE-HS, were recruited from three hospitals. Of these, 215 completed a two-section electronic survey. The first section collected demographic and epilepsy data, while the second used the Arabic version of the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Results: Of 215 patients, 104 (48%) had TLE-HS-38 with right TLE-HS (37%), 56 with left TLE-HS (54%), and 10 with bilateral TLE-HS (10%). The prevalence and severity of depression was assessed with an NDDI-E score of 15 or higher identified 35 patients (16%) with MDD. Valproic acid and lamotrigine were associated with higher NDDI-E scores. No such associations were found for levetiracetam or carbamazepine. Polytherapy in TLE-HS showed a significant correlation with daily poor concentration. Conclusion: We explored the differences in depression prevalence between TLE-HS and other epilepsy types and concluded they are minimal but slightly higher in TLE-HS. Predictors of depression such as seizure frequency and disease duration influenced MDD prevalence in TLE-HS. Lamotrigine and valproate were linked to higher NDDI-E scores.

AB  - Epilepsy continues to pose significant social and economic challenges on a global scale. Existing therapeutic approaches predominantly revolve around neurocentric mechanisms, and fail to control seizures in approximately one-third of patients. This underscores the pressing need for novel and complementary treatment approaches to address this gap. An increasing body of literature points to a role for glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Notably, microglial cells, which serve as pivotal inflammatory mediators within the epileptic brain, have received increasing attention over recent years. These immune cells react to epileptogenic insults, regulate neuronal processes, and play diverse roles during the process of epilepsy development. Additionally, astrocytes, another integral non-neuronal brain cells, have garnered increasing recognition for their dynamic contributions to the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Their complex interactions with neurons and other glial cells involve modulating synaptic activity and neuronal excitability, thereby influencing the aberrant networks formed during epileptogenesis. This review explores the alterations in microglial and astrocytic function and their mechanisms of communication following an epileptogenic insult, examining their contribution to epilepsy development. By comprehensively studying these mechanisms, potential avenues could emerge for refining therapeutic strategies and ameliorating the impact of this complex neurological disease.

AB  - Despite the need for successful navigation, humans vary greatly in their ability to navigate, and these individual differences may relate to variation in brain structure. While prior research provides support for a correlation between hippocampal volume and navigation ability in both navigation experts and in older individuals, this relationship is under scrutiny for healthy, young adults. We assessed 99 healthy young adults' ability to navigate in a virtual, desktop maze and correlated their performance with total hippocampal gray matter volume. For a subset of these individuals, we further segmented the medial temporal lobedincluding regions of the hippocampusdinto anatomically-distinct subregions to uniquely examine the association between volumes of hippocampal subfields and navigation. Given the need to distinguish between similar-looking maze hallways and partially overlapping routes, young adults with stronger pattern separation ability may perform better in this task. Thus, we theorized that successful navigation would positively correlate with hippocampal CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfield volumes due to these regions' role in pattern separation. CA1 and entorhinal cortex (ERC) are both associated with rodent spatial memory, too, suggesting a possible relationship between their volumes and navigation performance. Consistent with our hypotheses, we observed a positive relationship between volumes of hippocampal subfields and wayfinding accuracy, while ERC and parahippocampal cortex volumes correlated with navigation efficiency. However, when analyzing total hippocampal volume, a nuanced interpretation is warranted. We found evidence of Simpson's Paradox, where total hippocampal volume and navigation accuracy displayed no correlation in males, a negative correlation in females, yet a positive correlation when considering the full sample of males and females combined. Furthermore, no significant relationship was observed between total hippocampal volume and path efficiency. Given these findings, we urge caution in interpreting the results because these associations differ by analysis techniques (including voxel-based morphometry),after sex stratification, and with anterior and posterior hippocampal subdivisions. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the relationship between brain volume and navigation ability for young adults but also emphasizes the need for methodological con- sistency across studies with respect to boundary definitions, neuroimaging techniques, statistical methods, and factors that give rise to individual differences.

AB  - Chemical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) induces analgesia by forming neural circuitries with multiple brain regions. The involvement of hippocampal dopaminergic receptors in the LH stimulation-induced antinociception in specific pain models in animals has been documented. However, because the neural circuitries involved in the mediation of orofacial pain are not the same as those that mediate the other types of pain, the present study aims to detect the role of dopamine receptors within the dentate gyrus (DG) in the antinociceptive responses induced by LH stimulation in an animal model of orofacial pain. Male Wistar rats (220-250 g) were implanted with two separate cannulae into the LH and DG on the same side. D1- or D2-like dopamine receptor antagonist, SCH23390, or sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g) were microinjected into the DG, five minutes before intra-LH injection of carbachol (250 nM). The animals were then injected with formalin 1% (50 mu L; sc) into the upper lip lateral to the nose and subjected to the orofacial formalin test. Intra-DG administration of SCH23390 or sulpiride attenuated the antinociceptive responses induced by intra-LH microinjection of carbachol during the orofacial formalin test. The findings of the current study suggest that chemical stimulation of the LH modulates orofacial pain, possibly through activation of the DG dopaminergic neurons. Due to the high incidence and prevalence of orofacial pain in the general population, understanding how such neuronal circuitry modulates nociceptive processing will advance the search for novel therapeutics.

AB  - Post-translational modifications of proteins via palmitoylation, a thioester linkage of a 16-carbon fatty acid to a cysteine residue, reversibly increases their affinity for cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in membranes, changing their function. Little is known about how altered palmitoylation affects function at the systemic level and contributes to CNS pathology. However, recent studies suggested a role for the downregulation of palmitoyl acetyltransferase (DHHC) 21 gene expression in the development of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)-like syndrome. Here, we sought to investigate how susceptibility (sucrose preference below 65%) or resilience (sucrose preference > 65%) to stress-induced anhedonia affects DHHC gene expression in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice during the phase of spontaneous recovery from anhedonia. Because MDD is a recurrent disorder, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying not only the symptomatic phase of the disease but also a state of temporary remission. Indeed, molecular changes associated with the application of pharmacotherapy at the remission stage are currently not well understood. Therefore, we used a mouse model of chronic stress to address these questions. The stress protocol consisted of rat exposure, social defeat, restraint stress, and tail suspension. Mice from the stress group were not treated, received imipramine via drinking water (7 mg/kg/day), or received intraperitoneal injections of dicholine succinate (DS; 25 mg/kg/day) starting 7 days prior to stress and continuing during a 14-day stress procedure. Controls were either untreated or treated with either of the two drugs. At the 1st after-stress week, sucrose preference, forced swim, novel cage, and fear-conditioning tests were carried out; the sucrose test and 5-day Morris water maze test followed by a sacrifice of mice on post-stress day 31 for all mice were performed. Transcriptome Illumina analysis of hippocampi was carried out. Using the RT-PCR, the hippocampal gene expression of Dhhc3, Dhhc7, Dhhc8, Dhhc13, Dhhc14, and Dhhc21 was studied. We found that chronic stress lowered sucrose preference in a subgroup of mice that also exhibited prolonged floating behavior, behavioral invigoration, and impaired contextual fear conditioning, while auditory conditioning was unaltered. At the remission phase, no changes in the sucrose test were found, and the acquisition of the Morris water maze was unchanged in all groups. In anhedonic, but not resilient animals, Dhhc8 expression was lowered, and the expression of Dhhc14 was increased. Antidepressant treatment with either drug partially preserved gene expression changes and behavioral abnormalities. Our data suggest that Dhhc8 and Dhhc14 are likely to be implicated in the mechanisms of depression at the remission stage, serving as targets for preventive therapy.

AB  - Epilepsy is characterized by an imbalance in neurotransmitter activity; an increased excitatory to an inhibitory activity. Acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin, and norepinephrine (NE) may modulate neural activity via several mechanisms, mainly through its receptors/transporter activity and alterations in the extracellular potassium (K+) concentration via K+ ion channels. Seizures may disrupt the regulation of inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels and alter the receptor/transporter activity. However, there are limited data present on the immunoreactivity pattern of these neurotransmitter receptors/transporters and K+ channels in chronic models of epilepsy, which therefore was the aim of this study. Changes in the immunoreactivity of epileptogenesis-related neurotransmitter receptors/transporters (M2, 5-HT2B, and NE transporter) as well as Kir channels (Kir3.1 and Kir6.2) were determined in the cortex, hippocampus and medulla of adult Wistar rats by utilizing a Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindling chronic epilepsy model. Increased immunoreactivity of the NE transporter, M2, and 5-HT2B receptors was witnessed in the cortex and medulla. While the immunoreactivity of the 5-HT2B receptor was found increased in the cortex and medulla, it was decreased in the hippocampus, with no changes observed in the M2 receptor in this region. Kir3.1 and Kir6.2 staining showed increase immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortex, but channel contrasting findings in the hippocampus and medulla. Our results suggest that seizure kindling may result in significant changes in the neurotransmitter system which may contribute or propagate to future epileptogenesis, brain damage and potentially towards sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Further studies on the pathogenic role of these changes in neurotransmitter receptors/transporters and K+ channel immunoreactivity may identify newer possible targets to treat seizures or prevent epilepsy-related comorbidities.

AB  - The long-term survival of African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) in the Bia Goaso Forest Block (BGFB) is threatened due to a lack of spatially explicit data on their movement patterns and corridors to guide conservation actions. The aim of this study is to model potential connectivity between core habitats in the BGFB. First, seven key variables influencing elephants' choice of corridors were mapped as rasters and ranked using the analytical hierarchy process. Suitability indices were then assigned to the variables based on their relative influence on corridor choice. A total resistance raster was calculated using the weighted sum method. Finally, the Linkage Mapper was used to map potential corridors between pairs of protected areas. Nine potential corridors were identified, with Euclidean distances ranging from 3.89 to 13.50 km, cost-weighted distances from 13.20 to 34.75 km and least-cost path from 4.10 to 16.23 km. The Bia Game Production-Krokosua Hills and Bia NP-Bia North corridors, with centrality scores of 19.16 Amps and 13.14 Amps, respectively, were identified as the most critical corridors in maintaining connectivity. Krokosua, Bia Tano, Ayum, Bonkoni and Bosam Bepo forest reserves, with centrality scores ranging from 36 to 69 Amps, were identified as the critical core areas for maintaining connectivity. This result provides the first comprehensive geospatial dataset on habitat connectivity in the BGFB, which will inform conservation efforts and guide the effective management of habitat corridors to restore population connectivity and support elephant conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary NOD receptors mediate adaptive immune responses and immune tolerance. In this study, the results demonstrated that early pregnancy increased expression of NOD1, CIITA, NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRP7. However, early pregnancy inhibited NAIP expression in maternal lymph nodes. There is immune regulation of the lymph nodes, which is necessary during ovine gestation. NOD receptors (NLRs) mediate adaptive immune responses and immune tolerance. Nevertheless, it is not clear if gestation modulates the NLR signaling pathway in lymph nodes of ewes. In this study, lymph nodes of ewes were collected at day 16 of the estrous cycle, and at days 13, 16 and 25 of gestation (n = 6 for each group). RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to analyze the expression of the NLR family, including NOD1, NOD2, CIITA, NAIP, NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRP7. The data showed that early gestation enhanced expression of NOD1, CIITA, NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRP7 mRNA, as well as proteins at day 16 of gestation, and the expression levels of NOD2, CIITA, NLRP1 and NLRP7 were higher at days 13 and 25 of gestation than day 16 of the estrous cycle. However, NOD1 expression was lower on days 13 and 25 of gestation compared to day 16 of the estrous cycle, and early gestation suppressed NAIP expression. In summary, early pregnancy modulated expression of the NLR family in ovine lymph nodes, which participates in immune regulation, and this modulation may be necessary for pregnancy establishment in ewes.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that crocin rescues stress-induced depressive symptoms in mice via stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. Glutamate modulators mainly involving N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) have highlighted a role in neural development, synaptic plasticity, and depression. The research presented here was designed to appraise the interaction between NMDAR agents and crocin on depressive-related behaviors in the NMRI male mice exposed to acute restraint stress (ARS) for a period of 4 h. The mice were submitted to the splash test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test to evaluate depressive-like behavior. The ARS decreased the grooming duration in the splash test and increased immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test, suggesting a depressive-like phenotype. NMDA (0.25 and 0.5 mu g/mouse, intracerebroventricular) did not alter depression-related profiles in both non-acute restraint stress (NARS) and ARS mice, while the same doses of NMDAR antagonist D-AP5 potentiated the antidepressive-like activities in the ARS mice compared with the NARS mice. Moreover, a low dose of NMDA did not change depression-related parameters in the crocin-treated NARS or ARS mice, while D-AP5 enhanced the crocin response in the NARS and ARS mice. Isobologram analysis noted a synergism between crocin and D-AP5 on antidepressive-like behavior in the NARS and ARS mice. Collectively, the combination of crocin and D-AP5 was shown to mitigate depression symptoms and can be potentially used for the treatment of depression disorders.

AB  - Disrupted mitochondrial fission/fusion balance is consistently involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), a mitochondrial kinase, has been reported to prevent mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. However, to the best of our knowledge, the contribution of PINK1 to A beta-induced mitochondrial fission/fusion has not been reported. In the present study, we showed that PINK1 deficiency promoted mitochondrial fission and fusion, aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction, and promoted neuroinflammatory cytokine factor production induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of A beta(25-35) in rats. In vitro experiments have also showed that A beta(25-35) caused more severe cell injury in PINK1-knockdown PC12 cells. These cells suffered more extensive death when exposed to proinflammatory cytokines. Lastly, we found that PINK1 overexpression significantly inhibited mitochondrial fusion, improved mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced neuroinflammatory cytokine production induced by A beta(25-35). The current study suggests the involvement of PINK1 in A beta(25-35)-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and that PINK1 may be a potential target for therapies aimed at enhancing neuroprotection to ameliorate A beta(25-35)- induced insults.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder of complex etiology. Despite decades of antipsychotic drug development and treatment, the mechanisms underlying cellular drug effects remain incompletely understood. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based disease and pharmacological modelling offer new avenues for drug development. In this study, we explored the development of two- and three-dimensional neural progenitor cultures and the impact of different antipsychotics in a schizophrenia model. Four human iPSC lines, including two carrying a de novo ZMYND11 gene mutation associated with schizophrenia, were differentiated into hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs), cultured either in monolayers or as 3D spheroids. While in monolayers the proliferation of the NPCs was similar, spheroids showed significant differences in scattered cell number and outgrowth size between schizophrenia mutant and wild-type NPCs. Since there is only limited information about the effects of antipsychotic agents on neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, we investigated the effects of three molecules, representing three subgroups of antipsychotics, in the 2D and 3D NPC models. Our findings suggest that cell adhesion may play a crucial role in the molecular disease pathways of schizophrenia, highlighting the value of spheroid models for mechanistic and drug development studies. These studies may significantly help our understanding of the effects of schizophrenia on neural development and the response of progenitors to antipsychotic medications.

AB  - Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenolic antioxidant derived from different plant products, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effect. However, the effect of resveratrol on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) still lacks systematic research. This study aims to elucidate the potential mechanism of resveratrol against CRS disease through network pharmacology and further verify it through biological experiments in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs). The potential targets and pathways of RES against CRS disease were predicted by network pharmacology and molecular docking. Furthermore, the inflammation of HNEpCs was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The method of ELISA was used to detect changes in inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-related factors. The RT-qPCR method was adopted to analyze the changes of genes in related signaling pathways. As a result, 33 potential targets related to the effect of RES against CRS disease were obtained. According to the results of network pharmacology, it was shown that the effect of RES against CRS disease was closely related to the inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. A variety of results from cell experiments verified that RES can effectively inhibit the inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of LPS-induced HNEpCs. Together, the present study systematically clarified the possible mechanisms of RES in the treatment of CRS and provided new ideas for the drug research of this disease.

AB  - The Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mouse is a validated and robust preclinical model of mitochondrial diseases (specifically Leigh syndrome), that displays a narrow window of relative phenotypical normality, despite its inherent mitochondrial complex I dysfunction and severe phenotype. Preclinical observations related to psychiatric comorbidities that arise in patients with mitochondrial diseases and indeed in Leigh syndrome are, however, yet to be investigated in this model. Strengthening this narrative is the fact that major depression and bipolar disorder are known to present with deficits in mitochondrial function. We therefore screened the behavioural profile of male and female Ndufs4 KO mice (relative to heterozygous; HET and wildtype; WT mice) between postnatal days 28 and 35 for locomotor, depressive- and anxiety-like alterations and linked it with selected brain biomarkers, viz. serotonin, kynurenine, and redox status in brain areas relevant to psychiatric pathologies (i.e., prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum). The Ndufs4 KO mice initially displayed depressive-like behaviour in the tail suspension test on PND31 but not on PND35 in the forced swim test. In the mirror box test, increased risk resilience was observed. Serotonin levels of KO mice, compared to HET controls, were increased on PND36, together with increased tryptophan to serotonin and kynurenine turnover. Kynurenine to kynurenic acid turnover was however decreased, while reduced versus oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) was increased. When considering the comorbid psychiatric traits of patients with mitochondrial disorders, this work elaborates on the neuropsychiatric profile of the Ndufs KO mouse. Secondly, despite locomotor differences, Ndufs4 KO mice present with a behavioural profile not unlike rodent models of bipolar disorder, namely variable mood states and risktaking behaviour. The model may elucidate the bio-energetic mechanisms underlying mood disorders, especially in the presence of mitochondrial disease. Studies are however required to further validate the model's translational relevance.

AB  - Despite increased research during the past years, many characteristics of resting behavior in elephants are still unknown. For example, there is only limited data suggesting elephants express longer lying bouts and increased total nightly lying durations on soft substrates as compared to hard surfaces. Additionally, it has not been investigated how frequently elephants change body sides between lying bouts. Here we present these characteristics based on observations of nighttime lying behavior in 10 zoo elephants (5 African Loxodonta africana and 5 Asian Elephas maximus elephants) living in five different European facilities. We found that elephants housed on soft substrates have significantly increased total lying durations per night and longer average lying bouts. Furthermore, at 70%-85% of all bouts, a consistently higher frequency of side change between lying bouts occurred on soft substrates, leading to an overall equal laterality in resting behavior. Deviations from this pattern became evident in elephants living on nonsand flooring or/and in nondominant individuals of nonfamily groups, respectively. Based on our findings, we consider elephants to normally have several lying bouts per night with frequent side changes, given an appropriate substrate and healthy social environment.

AB  - Navigation is one of the most fundamental cognitive skills for the survival of fish, the largest vertebrate class, and almost all other animal classes. Space encoding in single neurons is a critical component of the neural basis of navigation. To study this fundamental cognitive component in fish, we recorded the activity of neurons in the central area of the goldfish telencephalon while the fish were freely navigating in a quasi-2D water tank embedded in a 3D environment. We found spatially modulated neurons with firing patterns that gradually decreased with the distance of the fish from a boundary in each cell's preferred direction, resembling the boundary vector cells found in the mammalian subiculum. Many of these cells exhibited beta rhythm oscillations. This type of spatial representation in fish brains is unique among space-encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage.

AB  - This research sought to purify C-phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis and investigate its potential in enhancing the quality parameters and in vivo fertility of ram semen subjected to cooled storage at 5 degrees C, when using a skim milk (SM) based semen extender. The purification process of C-PC involved cold maceration, pre-purification using chitosan and activated charcoal, followed by purification through aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) and ion-exchange chromatography. Afterward, fifty ejaculates were collected from 4 fertile Bouja & acirc;d rams and extended using the SM extender at 37 degrees C, enriched with 0 mu g/mL (control), 1.2 mu g/mL, 2.4 mu g/mL, 3.6 mu g/mL, or 4.8 mu g/mL of C-PC. The diluted semen was subsequently cooled to 5 degrees C using a controlled cooling process, with a gradual cooling rate of approximately 0.5 degrees C per minute, and its quality parameters were evaluated after 0, 4, 8, and 24 h of cooling storage. Then, its fertilization ability after 4 h of cooling storage was evaluated using artificial insemination. The adopted purification process yielded a grade analytical purity of 4.06. Additionally, semen extended in SM with a 2.4 mu g/mL C-PC supplement displayed significant (P < 0.0001) enhancement in total motility, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity, straight-line velocity, average path velocity, viability and lipid peroxidation of ram semen at 0, 4, 8, and 24 h of cooling storage. These improvements were observed in direct comparison to both the control group and the other C-PC concentrations. Regarding fertility rates, semen extended in SM with a 2.4 mu g/mL C-PC recorded a 76 % rate, a notable increment from the 63 % observed in ewes inseminated by semen extended in SM alone, although the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). These findings underscore the promising potential of C-PC as a natural supplement for enhancing semen quality, warranting further investigations.

AB  - Introduction: One of the mechanisms of epileptgenesis is impairment of inhibitory neural circuits. Several studies have compared neural changes among subtypes of gamma-aminobutyric acid-related (GABAergic) neurons after acquired epileptic seizure. However, it is unclear that GABAergic neural modifications that occur during acquisition process of epileptic seizure. Methods: Male rats were injected with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ kindling: n = 30) or saline (control: n = 15) every other day to observe the development of epileptic seizure stages. Two time points were identified: the point at which seizures were most difficult to induce, and the point at which seizures were most easy to induce. The expression of GABAergic neuron-related proteins in the hippocampus was immunohistochemically compared among GABAergic subtypes at each of these time points. Results: Bimodal changes in seizure stages were observed in response to PTZ kindling. The increase of seizure stage was transiently suppressed after 8 or 10 injections, and then progressed again by the 16th injection. Based on these results, we defined 10 injections as a short-term injection period during which seizures are less likely to occur, and 20 injections as a long-term injection period during which continuous seizures are likely to occur. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that hippocampal glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) expression was increased after short-term kindling but unchanged after long-term kindling. Increased GAD65 expression was limited to somatostatin-positive (SOM+) cells among several GABAergic subtypes. By contrast, GAD, GABA, GABAAR alpha 1, GABABR1, and VGAT cells showed no change following short- or long-term PTZ kindling. Conclusion: PTZ kindling induces bimodal changes in the epileptic seizure stage. Seizure stage is transiently suppressed after short-term PTZ injection with GAD65 upregulation in SOM+ cells. The seizure stage is progressed again after long-term PTZ injection with GAD65 reduction to baseline level.

AB  - The Ostrich occupies a unique position as the largest bird on the planet. Like other ratites, it has been reputed to have a phylogenetically primitive lung. We used macroscopy, light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy as well as silicon rubber casting to elucidate the functional design of its lung and compare it with what is already documented for the avian species. The neopulmonic region was very small and poorly developed. The categories of the secondary bronchi (SB) present and their respective numbers included laterodorsal (8-10), lateroventral (4-5), medioventral (4-6) and posterior (16-24). The lateral aspects of the laterodorsals were covered with a transparent collapsible membrane internally lined with a squamous to cuboidal epithelium. The bulk of these SB were in close proximity to intercostal spaces and the intercostal muscles and were thought to be important in the propulsion of gases. The lung parenchyma was rigid, with the atria well supported by septa containing smooth muscles, connective tissue interparabronchial septa were absent, and blood capillaries were supported by epithelial bridges. There were two categories of epithelia bridges: the homogenous squamous type comprising two leaflets of type I cells and the heterogeneous type consisting of a type I pneumocyte and type II cell. Additional type two cells were found at the atrial openings as well as the walls of the infundibulae and the air capillaries. The atria were shallow and opened either directly into several air capillaries or into a few infundibulae. The presence of numerous type II cells and the absence of interparabronchial connective tissue septa may imply that the ostrich lung could be capable of some degree of compliance.

AB  - Simple Summary : This study investigates the impact of substituting blood plasma with autolyzed yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), both with and without an immunomodulator (1,3/1,6 beta-glucans), in the diets of nursery-phase piglets. The research involved 240 piglets in the nursery phase, and assessed their zootechnical performance, intestinal health, immune responses, and energy metabolism under four dietary treatments. The findings revealed that diets including autolyzed yeast, with or without the immunomodulator, enhance feed conversion rates and reduce the need for medications compared to those containing only blood plasma. Additionally, this substitution positively influenced the piglets' immune and metabolic health, as evidenced by changes in triglyceride levels and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, and modulated the intestinal microbiota, indicating a beneficial role in piglet nutrition. These results suggest that autolyzed yeast, with or without immunomodulators, could be a viable alternative to blood plasma in piglet diets, offering health and performance benefits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of the autolyzed yeast (AY) Saccharomyces cerevisiae with or without an immunomodulator (1,3/1,6 beta-glucans) as a total/partial substitute for blood plasma (BP) in the diet of post-weaning piglets; zootechnical performance, intestinal health and microbiota, immune responses and energy metabolism were assessed. A total of 240 castrated male and female piglets, with a mean age of 22 days and mean initial weight of 5.24 +/- 0.82 kg, were randomly divided into blocks of four treatments with 12 replicates. The dietary inclusions were blood plasma (BP), autolyzed yeast (AY), autolyzed yeast + immunomodulator (AYI) and 50% BP and 50% AY (BPAY). In pre-initial phase II (29-35 days), piglets fed AY showed better feed conversion (FCR = 1.358) than the piglets in the BP (1.484), AYI (1.379) and BPAY (1.442) groups, i.e., 8.49% (0.126), 1.52% (0.021) and 4.50% (0.084), respectively (p = 0.0293). In the total period (21-42 days), better FCR was observed in the AYI (1.458) group, i.e., 4.64% (0.071), 1.15% (0.017) and 4.58% (0.070), than in the BP (1.529), AY (1.475) and BPAY (1.528) groups, respectively (p = 0.0150). In piglets fed AY (n = 3) and BPAY (n = 2), there was a reduction in the number of medications, i.e., 82.35% (-14n) and 88.23% (-15n), respectively (p = 0.0001), compared with that in the BP group (n = 17). In the AY group (73.83 mg/dL), AYI group (69.92 mg/dL), and BPAY group (69.58 mg/dL), piglets exhibited increases in triglyceride levels of 79.32%, 69.83%, and 69.00%, respectively, in comparison to those in the BP group, which had triglyceride levels of 41.17 mg/dL (p = 0.0400). The beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration in the AY group (79.96 ng/mu L) was lower by 31.95%, 22.64%, and 5.89% compared to the BP group (117.50 ng/mu L), AYI group (103.36 ng/mu L), and BPAY group (84.67 ng/mu L), respectively (p = 0.0072). In the AYI group, there was modulation of the microbiota, with an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Collinsella and Bulleidia. AY, associated or not associated with an immunomodulator, is a potential substitute for BP in diets for piglets in the nursery phase, with positive effects on immune, metabolic, and intestinal microbial performance.

AB  - Utilization of injectable hydrogels stands as a paradigm of minimally invasive intervention in the context of intervertebral disc degeneration treatment. Restoration of nucleus pulposus (NP) function exerts a profound influence in alleviating back pain. This study introduces an innovative class of injectable shear-thinning hydrogels, founded on quaternized chitosan (QCS), gelatin (GEL), and laponite (LAP) with the capacity for sustained release of the anti-inflammatory drug, celecoxib (CLX). First, synthesis of Magnesium-AluminumLayered double hydroxide (LDH) was achieved through a co-precipitation methodology, as a carrier for celecoxib and a source of Mg ions. Intercalation of celecoxib within LDH layers (LDH-CLX) was verified through a battery of analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDAX, TGA and UV-visible spectroscopy confirmed a drug loading efficiency of 39.22 +/- 0.09 % within LDH. Then, LDH-CLX was loaded in the optimal GEL-QCSLAP hydrogel under physiological conditions. Release behavior (15 days profile), mechanical properties, swelling ratio, and degradation rate of the resulting composite were evaluated. A G* of 15-47 kPa was recorded for the hydrogel at 22-40 degrees C, indicating gel stability in this temperature range. Self-healing properties and injectability of the composite were proved by rheological measurements. Also, ex vivo injection into intervertebral disc of sheep, evidenced in situ forming and NP cavity filling behavior of the hydrogel. Support of GELQCS-LAP/LDH-CLX (containing mg2+ ions) for viability and proliferation (from -94 % on day 1 to -134 % on day 7) of NP cells proved using MTT assay, DAPI and Live/Dead assays. The hydrogel could significantly upregulate secretion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG, from 4.68 +/- 0.1 to 27.54 +/- 1.0 mu g/ml), when LHD-CLX3% was loaded. We conclude that presence of mg2+ ion and celecoxib in the hydrogel can lead to creation of a suitable environment that encourages GAG secretion. In conclusion, the formulated hydrogel holds promise as a minimally invasive candidate for degenerative disc repair.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zuojinwan (ZJW) is a traditional Chinese medicine compound, which is often used clinically to treat gastritis and has anti-inflammatory activity. It was found that ZJW is involved in sup-pressing the expression of inflammatory factors, and neuroinflammation is thought to be associated with the development of depression.Aim of the study: In this study, we investigated whether ZJW could exert antidepressant effects by regulating MyD88 ubiquitination in depressed mice and attempted to elucidate the possible mechanisms. Materials and methods: Six active compounds of Zuojinwan (ZJW) were identified by HPLC. Then, the effects of ZJW on depression-like behavior in mice were investigated by constructing a chronic unpredictable mild stim-ulation (CUMS) mouse model. Meanwhile, the effect of ZJW on hippocampal neurons was investigated by Nissl staining. In addition, western blotting, PCR, ELISA, co-immunoprecipitation and immunostaining were used to explore whether ZJW could inhibit neuroinflammation through SPOP/MyD88/NF-kappa B pathway and thus produce antidepressant effects. Finally, we constructed the AAV-Sh-SPOP virus vector to silence SPOP and verify the mechanism of ZJW's antidepressant action.Results: ZJW could dramatically ameliorate the depressive behavior induced by CUMS stimulation and alleviate hippocampal neuronal damage. CUMS stimulation resulted in decreased SPOP expression, impaired MyD88 ubiquitination, and activation of downstream NF-kappa B signaling, which could be reversed by ZJW. In addition, ZJW could significantly ameliorate the abnormal activation of microglia, and the excessive levels of pro-inflammatory factors were inhibited. By blocking the expression of SPOP, we found that ZJW exerted anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects mainly by promoting the ubiquitination of MyD88 and inhibiting the activation of downstream inflammatory signals.Conclusion: In conclusion, ZJW possesses alleviating effects on depression induced by CUMS stimulation.

AB  - Purpose: This study sought to evaluate the impact of surgical extent on seizure outcome in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (DR-TLE) with temporal encephaloceles (TE).Methods: This was a single-institution retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for DR-TLE with TE between January 2008 and December 2020. The impact of surgical extent on seizure outcome was evaluated. In a subset with dominant DR-TLE, the impact of surgical extent on neuropsychometric outcome was evaluated.Results: Thirty-four patients were identified (female, 56%; median age at surgery, 43 years). TE were frequently overlooked on initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with encephaloceles only detected after repeat or expert re-review of MRI, additional multi-modal imaging, or intra-operatively in 31 (91%). Sixteen (47%) underwent limited resections, including encephalocele resection only (n = 5) and encephalocele resection with more extensive temporal corticectomy sparing the amygdala and hippocampus (n = 11). The remainder (n = 18, 53%) underwent standard anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy (ATLAH). Limited resection was performed more frequently on the left (12/17 vs. 4/17, p = 0.015). Twenty-seven patients (79%) had a favourable outcome (Engel I/II), and 17 (50%) were seizure-free at the last follow-up (median seizure-free survival of 27.3 months). There was no statistically significant difference in seizure-free outcomes between limited resection and ATLAH. In dominant DR-TLE, verbal memory decline was more likely after ATLAH than limited resection (3/4 vs. 0/9, p = 0.014).Conclusion: Expert re-review of imaging and multi-modal advanced imaging improved TE identification. There was no statistical difference in seizure-free outcomes based on surgical extent. Preservation of verbal memory supports limited resection in dominant temporal cases.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The detection of right temporal lobe dysfunction with nonverbal memory tests has remained difficult in the past. Reasons for this might be the potential influence of other biasing cognitive functions such as executive functions or the verbalisability of nonverbal material. The aim of this study was to investigate three classic nonverbal memory tests by identifying their neuroanatomical correlates with lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) and by probing their independence from verbal encoding abilities and executive functions.In a cohort of 119 patients with first-time cerebrovascular accident, memory perfor-mance was assessed in the Nonverbal Learning and Memory Test for Routes (NLMTR), the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), and the Visual Design Learning Test (VDLT). Calculating multivariate LSM, we identified crucial brain structures for these three nonverbal memory tests. Behavioural analyses were performed to assess the impact of executive functions and verbal encoding abilities with regression analyses and likelihood-ratio tests.LSM revealed for the RCFT mainly right-hemispheric frontal, insular, subcortical, and white matter structures and for the NLMTR right-hemispheric temporal (hippocampus), insular, subcortical, and white matter structures. The VDLT did not reach significance in LSM analyses. Behavioural results showed that amongst the three nonverbal memory tests the impact of executive functions was most pronounced for RCFT, and the impact of verbal encoding abilities was most important in VDLT. Likelihood-ratio tests confirmed that only for NLMTR did the goodness of fit not significantly improve by adding executive functions or verbal encoding abilities.These results suggest that amongst the three nonverbal memory tests the NLMTR, as a spatial navigation test, could serve as the most suitable marker of right-hemispheric temporal lobe functioning, with the right hippocampus being involved only in this test.In addition, the behavioural results propose that only NLMTR seems mostly unaffected by executive functions and verbal encoding abilities.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Spray-drying is one of the most popular techniques in the food industry for converting liquid material from a fluid state into a form of dried particles to produce encapsulated or instant products. Instant products are considered as convenient foods; moreover, the goal of encapsulation is to close the bioactive compounds in a shell, preventing them from being affected by environmental factors. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of spray-drying conditions, in particular three inlet temperatures, on the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of powders obtained from Camelina Press Cake Extract (CPE). The CPE was spray-dried at 140 degrees C, 160 degrees C and 180 degrees C. The solubility, Carr and Hausner Indexes, tapped densities and water activity of the powders were analyzed. The structural changes were also detected using FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, the characteristics of the initial and reconstituted samples and their rheological properties were evaluated. The antioxidant potential, total polyphenols and flavonoids content, free amino acids, and the Maillard reaction products contents in the spray-dried powders were also evaluated. The results indicate a cascade of changes between the initial and reconstituted samples, and important changes in the bioactive potential of samples. The inlet temperature significantly influenced the solubility, flowability and particle sizes of the powders, as well as Maillard products formation. The results of the rheological measurements illustrate the changes after the reconstitution of extracts. This study indicates the optimal parameters of CPE spray-drying, those that yield favorable physicochemical and functional values, which may open up a promising path for CPE valorization, indicating its potential and the possibilities of its use.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze statistically derived threshold values of volumetric MRI and 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET asymmetry, independent of normative data, for non-invasive detection/exclusion of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).Methods: We retrospectively analyzed amygdalohippocampal volumetry and temporal FDG PET metabolism in 33 patients (age: 29.27 +/- 8.56 years) who underwent surgery following Stereo-EEG implantation and had postsurgical seizure freedom lasting >12 months. The temporal lobe epilepsy group and the extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE) group were compared. Percentage volume loss (PVL) was calculated from manually traced amygdalohippocampal volumetry whereas percentage metabolic loss (PML) was calculated from PET using amygdalohippocampal trace and temporal neocortical Brodmann areas (BA) template.Results: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified a cutoff hippocampal PVL of 4.21% as the minimum indicating probable hippocampal involvement in seizure onset, with sensitivity of 88.89% and the specificity of 100% (p < 0.001). Region of interest (ROI)-based PML values in PET imaging showed a significant correlation with the presence of TLE in the TLE group of patients and its absence in the ETLE group of patients. Region of interest curve analysis yielded PML cutoffs of 5.77% and 8.36%, respectively, for the hippocampus and BA 38 (temporopolar neocortex) to detect TLE with the sensitivity of 72.7% and specificity of 77.8%.Conclusion: We describe statistical thresholds for asymmetry analysis of hippocampal volumetry and FDG PET to improve detection of TLE. These threshold parameters warrant further validation in prospective studies. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) is a well-established risk factor for many psychiatric and medical disorders, including substance use disorders (SUDs). The relationship between ELS and SUDs is complex and there are likely multiple pathways from ELS to adverse substance use outcomes. The association between ELS and substance use emerges in adolescence. Adolescence is a critical period in development during which substance exposure markedly increases risk for SUDs. Therefore, this review focuses on the literature supporting the hypothesis that ELS increases risk for the development of SUDs through its influence on adolescent substance use. We discuss studies substantiating the role of ELS in adolescent substance use and explore how internalizing and externalizing psychopathology may be antecedents of substance use in adolescence. We examine clinical work suggesting ELS sculpts the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis and developing brain-particularly subcortical brain regions that underlie stress response, mesocorticolimbic brain systems associated with reward sensitivity, and prefrontal regions that underlie executive control-in a way that increases risk for adolescent substance use and SUDs. We further explore how substance use during adolescence alters structure and function of these same systems, and how brain changes following ELS and adolescent substance use may independently, additively, or interactively contribute to risk for addiction. We conclude by discussing how the current literature can inform interventions aimed at reducing risk for SUDs in individuals with a history of ELS.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders cover a range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction and cognitive deficits. Phenolic compound applications have been restricted due to their poor solubility, bioavailability, and low stability. This paper aimed to explore the neuroprotective effects of sumac and gallic acid-loaded nanophytosomes (GNP) on oxidative stress-induced cognitive impairment and Nrf2/Keap1 gene expression in the autism model. Valproic acid (VPA) was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 500 mg/kg to female rats during gestational 12.5 days (E12.5). The prenatal VPA-exposed rats were divided into five groups, including VPA, VPA treated with sumac, gallic acid (GA), sumac-loaded nanophytosome (SNP), and GNP at doses of 20 mg/kg for 4 weeks (n = 6). A novel object test was conducted and antioxidant parameters and Nrf2/Keap1gene expression were evaluated in the hippocampus. According to the obtained results, the rat model of autism exhibited recognition memory impairment. We observed an increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) enzyme activity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and glutathione (GSH) levels. Furthermore, sumac and GNP improved recognition memory deficits and increased GPx, GRx, SOD, and CAT activities, GSH and TAC levels, and Nrf2/Keap1gene expression in the hippocampal area. Our results also suggested that SNP and GNP ameliorate VPA-induced learning and memory deficits more efficiently than sumac extract and pure GA by reducing oxidative stress, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, and Keap1/Nrf2 gene expression. The present study demonstrated that the utilization of SNP and GNP significantly improved recognition memory deficits.

AB  - How memories are organized in the brain influences whether they are remembered discretely versus linked with other experiences or whether generalized information is applied to entirely novel situations. Here, we used scFLARE2 (single-chain fast light-and activity-regulated expression 2), a temporally precise tagging system, to manipulate mouse lateral amygdala neurons active during one of two 3 min threat experiences occurring close (3 h) or further apart (27 h) in time. Silencing scFLARE2-tagged neurons showed that two threat experiences occurring at distal times are dis-allocated to orthogonal engram ensembles and remembered discretely, whereas the same two threat experiences occurring in close temporal proximity are linked via co-allocation to overlapping engram ensembles. Moreover, we found that co-allocation mediates memory generalization applied to a completely novel stimulus. These results indicate that endogenous temporal evolution of engram ensemble neuronal excitability determines how memories are organized and remembered and that this would not be possible using conventional immediate-early gene-based tagging methods.

AB  - Currently, the effects of the differences between day and night temperatures (DIFs) on tea plant are poorly understood. In order to investigate the influence of DIFs on the growth, photosynthesis, and metabolite accumulation of tea plants, the plants were cultivated under 5 degrees C (25/20 degrees C, light/dark), 10 degrees C (25/1 degrees C, light/dark), and 15 degrees C (25/10 degrees C, light/dark). The results showed that the growth rate of the new shoots decreased with an increase in the DIFs. There was a downward trend in the photosynthesis among the treatments, as evidenced by the lowest net photosynthetic rate and total chlorophyll at a DIF of 15 degrees C. In addition, the DIFs significantly affected the primary and secondary metabolites. In particular, the 10 degrees C DIF treatment contained the lowest levels of soluble sugars, tea polyphenols, and catechins but was abundant in caffeine and amino acids, along with high expression levels of theanine synthetase (TS3) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT). Furthermore, the transcriptome data revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, flavone/flavonol biosyntheses, flavonoid biosynthesis, etc. Therefore, we concluded that a DIF of 10 degrees C was suitable for the protected cultivation of tea plants in terms of the growth and the quality of a favorable flavor of tea, which provided a scientific basis for the protected cultivation of tea seedlings.

AB  - Human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) can potentially treat neurological diseases, but their low survival and proliferation rates after transplantation remain challenging. In our study, we preincubated hNSCs with the human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to obtain closer to the physiological brain environment and to assess NSC fate and their therapeutic abilities in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. We observed significant changes in the differentiation, migratory, and secretory potential of CSF-treated hNSCs, as well as their elevated neuroprotective potential after co-culture with ischemically damaged by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) organotypic rat hippocampal slices culture (OHC) in comparison to the cells cultured in the standard conditions. Next, we investigated their survival and anti-inflammatory abilities in an in vivo ouabain-induced stroke model. This study highlighted and confirmed the critical importance of nutritional supplementation in maintaining NSC culture and enhancing its therapeutic properties.

AB  - Camellia oil, a nutritionally rich edible oil derived from Camellia oleifera seeds, is predominantly stored as triacylglycerol (TAG) during fruit maturation. However, a limited understanding of the genetic and regulatory mechanisms governing Camellia oil accumulation has hindered efforts to optimize its yield. In this study, three C. oleifera diacylglycerol acyltransferase (CoDGAT) genes were identified and characterized, wherein CoDGAT1 emerged as the primary contributor to seed TAG biosynthesis, functioning within the endoplasmic reticulum and increasing seed oil content by 64.4% in transgenic plant. Through weighted gene coexpression network analysis, we identified WRINKLED1 (CoWRI1) as a candidate transcriptional regulator of CoDGAT1. Both genes exhibited significant upregulation during seed maturation. Mechanistically, CoWRI1 activated CoDGAT1 by directly binding to AW-box motifs in its promoter, thereby promoting TAG accumulation. Additionally, CoWRI1 expression was suppressed by salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and darkness, suggesting that phytohormones and environmental signals modulate TAG accumulation through the WRI1-DGAT1 pathway. These findings provide an important basis for improving Camellia oil production through biotechnological manipulation of DGAT1 and WRI1 genes.

AB  - Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has become increasingly utilized in the zoo and aquarium fields to treat ailments in various species; however, its use in teleosts and elasmobranchs is relatively underrepresented in the literature. This study examined the efficacy of PBMT as an adjunct treatment to reduce the healing time of dermal abrasions in cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus). Ten cownose rays were included in this study and separated into control (n = 5) and treatment groups (n = 5). Animals in both treatment and control groups received intramuscular injections of enrofloxacin every 72 h to provide broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Cownose rays in the treatment group additionally received PBMT using the Companion (R) CTC-12 unit using the large, noncontact head. Control group rays were subjected to identical handling without the use of PBMT. A total of 196 Joules were delivered at a power of 2 W based on a dose of 5 J/cm(2) at each session. Observational analysis revealed a lack of appreciable difference in healing time between the treatment and control groups in the aforementioned settings; however, it is recommended that PBMT protocols should be re-evaluated if there is little to no response in healing after three to four sessions. PBMT use on acute superficial dermal abrasions in cownose rays was well-tolerated in this study and may have utility in a multimodal treatment approach to wound healing. This study also produced a wound scoring metric based on photographs captured at each treatment. Future studies should utilize increased fluence (J/cm(2)) and irradiance (W/cm(2)) and incorporate synchronous histological analysis and increased sample size.

AB  - The activation of STAT3 is a crossroads of cellular regulation, induced in its canonical pathway by phosphorylation on a critical tyrosine residue (Y705). The existence of a STAT3 non-canonical signaling mechanisms, induced by phosphorylation at serine 727 (S727), has been recently identified in vitro. After cytoplasmic activation, non-canonical STAT3 could move to the level of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs). We have previously shown that LPS injections in mouse model induce STAT3 canonical pathway, leading to its nuclear translocation and to neuroinflammation. However, the effects of LPS on activation of the non-canonical pathway and its consequences on protein complexes of MERCs remain to be determined. In an in vivo LPS mouse model, we found that systemic inflammation induces in hippocampus the non-canonical STAT3 pathway. LPS-induced STAT3 affects specifically MERC protein BAP31, and that of a mitochondrial membrane protein known to interact with it, TOM40. These findings shed light on the role of STAT3 on mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum interaction under inflammatory conditions, offering new perspectives for targeting mitochondrial function and STAT3 activation in disease contexts.

AB  - The striatum is especially vulnerable to HIV-1 infection, with medium spiny neurons (MSNs) exhibiting marked synaptodendritic damage that can be exacerbated by opioid use disorder. Despite known structural defects in MSNs co-exposed to HIV-1 Tat and opioids, the pathophysiological sequelae of sustained HIV-1 exposure and acute comorbid effects of opioids on dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing (D1 and D2) MSNs are unknown. To address this question, Drd1-tdTomato- or Drd2-eGFP-expressing reporter and conditional HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice were interbred. MSNs in ex vivo slices from male mice were assessed by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and filled with biocytin to explore the functional and structural effects of progressive Tat and acute morphine exposure. Although the excitability of both D1 and D2 MSNs increased following 48 h of Tat exposure, D1 MSN firing rates decreased below control (Tat-) levels following 2 weeks and 1 month of Tat exposure but returned to control levels after 2 months. D2 neurons continued to display Tat-dependent increases in excitability at 2 weeks, but also returned to control levels following 1 and 2 months of Tat induction. Acute morphine exposure increased D1 MSN excitability irrespective of the duration of Tat exposure, while D2 MSNs were variably affected. That D1 and D2 MSN excitability would return to control levels was unexpected since both subpopulations displayed significant synaptodendritic degeneration and pathologic phospho-tau-Thr205 accumulation following 2 months of Tat induction. Thus, despite frank morphologic damage, D1 and D2 MSNs uniquely adapt to sustained Tat and acute morphine insults.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lignosus rhinocerus (Cooke) Ryvarden (also known as Tiger Milk mushroom, TMM), is a basidiomycete belonging to the Polyporaceae family. It has been documented to be used by tradi-tional Chinese physicians and indigenous people in Southeast Asia to treat a variety of illnesses, such as gastritis, arthritis, and respiratory conditions, as well as to restore patients' physical well-being. TMM has also been used in folk medicine to treat cancer. For example, people from the indigenous Kensiu tribe of northeast Kedah (Malaysia) apply shredded TMM sclerotium mixed with water directly onto breast skin to treat breast cancer, while Chinese practitioners from Hong Kong, China prescribe TMM sclerotium as a treatment for liver cancer. L. rhinocerus has previously been demonstrated to possess selective anti-proliferative properties in vitro, however pre-clinical in vivo research has not yet been conducted.Aim of study: This study aimed to examine the anti-tumor activities of L. rhinocerus TM02 (R), using two different sample preparations [cold water extract (CWE) and fraction] via various routes of administration (oral and intraperitoneal) on an MCF7-xenograft nude mouse model. This study also investigated the inhibitory effect of TM02 (R) CWE and its fractions against COX-2 in vitro using LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages, on the basis of the relationship between COX-2 and metastasis, apoptosis resistance, as well as the proliferation of cancer cells. Materials and methods: The first preparation, L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) sclerotium powder (TSP) was dissolved in cold water to obtain the cold water extract (CWE). It was further fractionated based on its molecular weight to obtain the high (HMW), medium (MMW) and low (LMW) molecular weight fractions. The second preparation, known as the TM02 (R) rhinoprolycan fraction (TRF), was obtained by combining the HMW and MMW fractions. TSP was given orally to mimic the daily consumption of a supplement; TRF was administered intraperitoneally to mimic typical tumorous cancer treatment with a rapid and more thorough absorption through the peritoneal cavity. Another experiment was conducted to examine changes in COX-2 activity in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macro-phages after a 1-h pre-treatment with CWE, HMW, and MMW.Results: Our results revealed that intraperitoneal TRF-injection (90 mu g/g BW) for 20 days reduced initial tumor volume by similar to 64.3% (n = 5). The percentage of apoptotic cells was marginally higher in TRF-treated mice vs. control, suggesting that induction of apoptosis as one of the factors that led to tumor shrinkage. TSP (500 mu g/g BW) oral treatment (n = 5) for 63 days (inclusive of pre-treatment prior to tumor inoculation) effectively inhibited tumor growth. Four of the five tumors totally regressed, demonstrating the effectiveness of TSP ingestion in suppressing tumor growth. Although no significant changes were found in mouse serum cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-5, IL-6 and CCL2), some increasing and decreasing trends were observed. This may suggest the immunomodulatory potential of these treatments that can directly or indirectly affect tumor growth. Pre-treatment with CWE, HMW and MMW significantly reduced COX-2 activity in RAW264.7 macrophages upon 24 h LPS-stimulation, suggesting the potential of L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) extract and fractions in regulating M1/M2 polarization.Conclusion: Based on the findings of our investigation, both the rhinoprolycan fraction and crude sclerotial powder from L.
   rhinocerus TM02 (R) demonstrated tumor suppressive effects, indicating that they contain substances with strong anticancer potential. The antitumor effects of L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) in our study highlights the potential for further explorations into its mechanism of action and future development as a prophylactic or adjunct thera-peutic against tumorous cancer.

AB  - This simulation study explores the potential of a novel fa & ccedil;ade design with integrated control system comprising a dynamic photovoltaic (PV) facade integrated with dimming lighting control to enhance the work environment in office buildings and achieve energy-efficient solutions. Parametric modeling using the Grasshopper plug-in for Rhino software 7, coupled with energy simulation through the Honeybee environmental plug-in for the EnergyPlus program, are used in the methodology. The integrated control strategy was simulated to study in a single office space, utilizing the Daysim engine to assess indoor daylight quality and focusing on Daylight Factor (DF) and Daylight Glare Probability (DGP). Additionally, two artificial lighting control systems were examined for potential integration with the dynamic PV facade to minimize lighting load. The study employs the Galapagos evolutionary solver function embedded within Grasshopper to identify optimum solutions. The dynamic PV fa & ccedil;ade achieves substantial reductions in overall energy consumption, cutting it by 73% in June, 54% in July, 54.5% in August, and 52.55% in September. The results demonstrate substantial reductions in total energy consumption, with notable savings in heating and cooling due to the dynamic facade's ability to balance and control solar radiation during working hours. Moreover, the dynamic PV facade contributes to electricity generation, demonstrating its potential to improve visual comfort, decrease energy consumption, and generate electric energy through rotational adjustments and varying transparency levels.

AB  - Although many studies have explored the mechanism of epilepsy, it remains unclear and deserves further investigation. Vezatin has been reported to be a synaptic regulatory protein involved in regulating neuronal synaptic transmission (NST). However, the role of vezatin in epilepsy remains unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study are to investigate the underlying roles of vezatin in epilepsy. In this study, vezatin expression was increased in hippocampal tissues from pilocarpine (PILO)-induced epileptic mice and a Mg2+-free medium-induced in vitro seizure-like model. Vezatin knockdown suppressed seizure activity in PILO-induced epileptic mice. Mechanistically, vezatin knockdown suppressed AMPAR-mediated synaptic events in epileptic mice and downregulated the surface expression of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit (GluA1). Interestingly, vezatin knockdown decreased the phosphorylation of GluA1 at serine 845 and reduced protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation; when PKA phosphorylation was suppressed by H-89 (a selective inhibitor of PKA phosphorylation) in vitro, the effects of vezatin knockdown on reducing the phosphorylation of GluA1 at serine 845 and the surface expression of GluA1 were blocked. Finally, we investigated the pattern of vezatin in brain tissues from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and we found that vezatin expression was also increased in patients with TLE. In summary, the vezatin expression pattern is abnormal in individuals with epilepsy, and vezatin regulates seizure activity by affecting AMPAR-mediated NST and the surface expression of GluA1, which is involved in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GluA1 at serine 845, indicating that vezatin-mediated regulation of epileptic seizures represents a novel target for epilepsy.

AB  - Vascular cognitive impairment caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) seriously affects the quality of life of elderly patients and places a great burden on society and family. With the development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), TCM approaches to the prevention and treatment of senile ischemic cerebrovascular disease has received increasing attention. In this study, rats with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) were treated with berberine (BBR). Their learning and memory function, neuronal injury and repair, the extracellular regulatory protein kinase (ERK)/nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, and impairment and improvement of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were evaluated. This study found that BBR can alleviate the pathological injury to the brain, reduce neuronal loss and promote neuronal cell survival after CCH by interfering with the ERK/Nrf2 signaling pathway. BBR can reduce BBB injury in CCH rats by inhibiting the expression of VEGF-A and MMP-9 in plasma, which reveals a protective effect of BBR on vascular cognitive impairment. This study provides a new research direction for BBR in the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

AB  - Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine have unique biological properties. The aim of the study was to investigate, in a rat model of schizophrenia, the effects of chronic administration of these drugs on schizophrenia-like behaviors and anaerobic cysteine metabolism in the hippocampus (HIP). The schizophrenia-type changes were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by repeated administration of the glutathione synthesis inhibitor L-butionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine in combination with the dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR 12909 in the early postnatal period. Adult model rats were chronically treated with aripiprazole (0.3 mg.kg(-1), i.p.) or N-acetylcysteine (30 mg.kg(-1), orally), and their effects on schizophrenia-like behaviors were assessed using the social interaction test and novel object recognition test. In the HIP, the level of anaerobic cysteine metabolites, H2S, and bound sulfane sulfur were determined by a fluorescence method, while the expression of H2S-synthetizing enzymes: cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) by western blot. Long-term treatment with aripiprazole or N-acetylcysteine reversed social and cognitive deficits and reduced the exploratory behaviors. In the HIP of 16-day-old model pups, H2S levels and MST protein expression were significantly decreased. In adult model rats, H2S levels remained unchanged, bound sulfane sulfur significantly increased, and the expression of CBS and MST slightly decreased. The studied drugs significantly reduced the level of bound sulfane sulfur and the expression of tested enzymes. The reduction in bound sulfane sulfur level coincided with the attenuation of exploratory behavior, suggesting that modulation of anaerobic cysteine metabolism in the HIP may have therapeutic potential in schizophrenia.

AB  - Psychological stress increases the risk of major psychiatric disorders. Psychological stress on mice was reported to induce differential gene expression (DEG) in mice brain regions. Alternative splicing is a fundamental aspect of gene expression and has been associated with psychiatric disorders but has not been investigated in the stressed brain yet. This study investigated changes in gene expression and splicing under psychological stress, the related pathways, and possible relationship with psychiatric disorders. RNA-seq raw data of 164 mouse brain samples from 3 independent datasets with stressors including chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), early life stress (ELS), and two-hit stress of combined CSDS and ELS were collected. There were more changes in splicing than in gene expression in the ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, but stress-induced changes of individual genes by differential splicing and differential expression could not be replicated. In contrast, pathway analyses produced robust findings: stress-induced differentially spliced genes (DSGs) were reproducibly enriched in neural transmission and blood-brain barrier systems, and DEGs were reproducibly enriched in stress response-related functions. The hub genes of DSG-related PPI networks were enriched in synaptic functions. The corresponding human homologs of stress-induced DSGs were robustly enriched in AD-related DSGs as well as BD and SCZ in GWAS. These results suggested that stress-induced DSGs from different datasets belong to the same biological system throughout the stress response process, resulting in consistent stress response effects.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zhi-Zi-Hou-Po decoction (ZZHP), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) classic recipe, has been extensively applied for the remedy of depression. However, the underlying mechanism of ZZHP hasn't been fully elucidated and it needs to be further clarified. Aim of study: The aim of the study is to uncover the mechanisms of ZZHP's effect on depression. Materials and methods: C57BL/6 mice were employed to establish Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) models. Behavioral tests were conducted for evaluating the antidepressant effects of ZZHP. Then, the monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus through High Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrochemical Detection (HPLC-ECD) were utilized to assess the effect of ZZHP on the maintenance of monoamine neurotransmitter homeostasis. Immunofluorescence staining and Golgi staining were detected to analyze the effects of ZZHP on neuroplasticity in the hippocampus. Western Blot (WB) was utilized to examine the effects of ZZHP on BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathways. Finally, behavioral tests, WB and immunofluorescence staining were repeated after TrkB receptor antagonist was added to further confirm the underlying mechanism. Results: Our results shown that ZZHP attenuated depressive-like symptoms in CUMS mice. Moreover, ZZHP remarkably reversed the reduction and maintained the homeostasis of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. Simultaneously, ZZHP protected neuronal synaptic plasticity and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. Furthermore, ZZHP stimulated the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in the hippocampus. The addition of TrkB receptor antagonist inhibited the antidepressant effects of ZZHP, suggesting that ZZHP could not work without triggering the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ZZHP can alleviate depressive-like behavior and promote hippocampal neurogenesis in CUMS mice via activating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway.

AB  - The HSP70 and HSP90 family members belong to molecular chaperones that exhibit protective functions during the cellular response to stressful agents. We investigated whether the exposure of rats to chronic mild stress (CMS), a validated model of depression, affects the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HIP) and thalamus (Thal). Male Wistar rats were exposed to CMS for 3 or 8 weeks. The antidepressant imipramine (IMI, 10 mg/kg, i.p., daily) was introduced in the last five weeks of the long-term CMS procedure. Depressive-like behavior was verified by the sucrose consumption test. The expression of mRNA and protein was quantified by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. In the 8-week CMS model, stress alone elevated HSP72 and HSP90B mRNA expression in the HIP. HSP72 mRNA was increased in the PFC and HIP of rats not responding to IMI treatment vs. IMI responders. The CMS exposure increased HSP72 protein expression in the cytosolic fraction of the PFC and HIP, and this effect was diminished by IMI treatment. Our results suggest that elevated levels of HSP72 may serve as an important indicator of neuronal stress reactions accompanying depression pathology and could be a potential target for antidepressant strategy.

AB  - Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction and cognitive deficit, restricted repetitive behaviors, altered immune responses, and imbalanced oxidative stress status. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically alpha 7-nAChRs, in the CNS. Influence of agonists for alpha 7-nAChRs on the cognitive behavior, learning, and memory formation has been demonstrated in neuro-pathological condition such as ASD and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Curcumin (CUR), the active compound of the spice turmeric, has been shown to act as a positive allosteric modulator of alpha 7-nAChRs. Here we hypothesize that CUR, acting through alpha 7-nAChRs, influences the neuropathology of ASD. In patch clamp studies, fast inward currents activated by choline, a selective agonist of alpha 7-nAChRs, were significantly potentiated by CUR. Moreover, choline induced enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents was markedly increased in the presence of CUR. Furthermore, CUR (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated dose-dependent social deficits without affecting locomotor activity or anxiety-like behaviors of tested male Black and Tan BRachyury (BTBR) mice. In addition, CUR (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) mitigated oxidative stress status by restoring the decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampus and the cerebellum of treated mice. Collectively, the observed results indicate that CUR potentiates alpha 7-nAChRs in native central nervous system neurons, mitigates disturbed oxidative stress, and alleviates ASD-like features in BTBR mice used as an idiopathic rodent model of ASD, and may represent a promising novel pharmacological strategy for ASD treatment.

AB  - Tissue expansion is an integral component of reconstructive surgery used to promote native skin growth. This process is driven by the gradual inflation of the tissue expander placed subcutaneously on the patient's body. Despite its widespread use, the lack of in vivo evidence on the biological processes underlying skin growth has limited technological advancements. Here, we explore the gene and protein expression changes that control mechanically induced skin growth during tissue expansion. Using a porcine tissue expansion model, we revealed that skin expansion disrupts key components responsible for epithelial integrity, as evidenced by the loss of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin expression in expanded skin compared to the unexpanded control. This disruption correlates with the translocation of the transcriptional factor YAP1 from the membrane to the nucleus, activating keratinocyte proliferation and possibly regulating other critical processes involved in skin adaptation to mechanical stretch. Our data show that in vivo cell proliferation is mediated by force-induced changes in the composition of molecular complexes formed by E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and YAP1.

AB  - A progressive decline in cognitive function occurs as a result of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is primarily associated with diminished cholinergic neurotransmission. However, the precise mechanisms contributing to cholinergic dysfunction are not fully elucidated. Herein, we evaluated the cholinergic system in wild type (WT) mice and AD-model (App(NL-G-F)) mice exhibiting overproduction of amyloid-beta 42 (A beta(42)). In superfusion experiments, [H-3]acetylcholine (ACh) release from the frontal cortex and hippocampal segments preloaded with [H-3]choline exhibited no significant differences between adult (6-8 months old) and aged (12-17 months old) WT mice. Uptake of [H-3]choline via the high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1) and the subsequent formation/storage of [H-3]ACh showed a moderate tendency to decrease associated with aging. In contrast, in App(NL-G-F) mice, [H-3]ACh release was significantly reduced in both the adult and aged groups, with reductions closely related to impaired CHT1 activity and diminished ACh synthesis/storage at cholinergic terminals. Presynaptic cholinergic feedback mechanisms regulating ACh release, as well as the density and subtype distribution of muscarinic ACh receptors, were minimally affected by both aging and A beta(42) overproduction. These results support the A beta hypothesis, suggesting that presynaptic cholinergic dysfunction arises early and is specifically caused by decreased CHT1 function in the AD forebrain, independent of age-dependent degeneration.image

AB  - Aphids are economically and ecologically important herbivorous insects. A critical step in their life cycle is the visually guided host finding behaviour. To elucidate the role of colour in host finding of aphid spring migrants we conducted large colour trap experiments in the field and analysed aphid catch data, using trap spectral reflectance data as input. Based on known and putative photoreceptor sensitivities we developed and optimized a simple empirical colour choice model for spring migrants of different aphid species which confirmed and explained the yellow preference of these insects. In a further step, we applied multivariate statistical methods to behavioural and reflectance data, but without data on photoreceptor sensitivities, to find the wavelengths of greatest importance for the aphids' behavioural responses. This analysis confirmed the position of the green photoreceptor peak previously obtained independently with electrophysiological methods. In a final step, we applied the colour preference model to a dataset of leaf spectra. This showed that aphid visual preference would be dependent on the plants' nutritional status, with lower nitrogen input being associated with stronger preference, despite known benefits of high nitrogen levels for aphid reproduction and fitness. Ecological and evolutionary implications of these results are discussed. This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding colour vision: molecular, physiological, neuronal and behavioural studies in arthropods'.

AB  - There is credible evidence that environmental factors influence individual risk and/or severity of autism spectrum disorders (hereafter referred to as autism). While it is likely that environmental chemicals contribute to the etiology of autism via multiple mechanisms, identifying specific environmental factors that confer risk for autism and understanding how they contribute to the etiology of autism has been challenging, in part because the influence of environmental chemicals likely varies depending on the genetic substrate of the exposed individual. Current research efforts are focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which environmental chemicals interact with autism genetic susceptibilities to adversely impact neurodevelopment. The goal is to not only generate insights regarding the pathophysiology of autism, but also inform the development of screening platforms to identify specific environmental factors and gene x environment (G x E) interactions that modify autism risk. Data from such studies are needed to support development of intervention strategies for mitigating the burden of this neurodevelopmental condition on individuals, their families and society. In this review, we discuss environmental chemicals identified as putative autism risk factors and proposed mechanisms by which G x E interactions influence autism risk and/or severity using polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as an example.

AB  - Background: Raddeanin A is a triterpenoid isolated from Anemone raddeana Regel. It exhibits a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory, however, its neuroprotective effect in targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains uninvestigated. Purpose: To provide scientific base for the development of novel AD drug by clarifying the neuroprotective effect and molecular mechanisms of raddeanin A in both in vitro and in vivo AD model. Study design: To confirm the neuroprotective role of raddeanin A in the treatment of AD, its mechanisms and effects on beta-amyloidosis and A beta fibrillation was studied in U87 cells. Besides, the improvement on cognitive deficit, pathological defects, reactive astrocyte clusters, inhibition on neuronal inflammation and apoptosis were further studied in 3 x Tg-AD mice model of AD. Methods: Real-time PCR, western blot, dot blot, biolayer interferometry and bioinformatics analysis were used to confirm the in vitro effect and targets of raddeanin A on beta-amyloidosis and its associated protein network. A series of experiments including Morris water maze, H&E staining, nissl staining and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted to confirm the protective behavioral effect of raddeanin A in the in vivo AD mice model. Results: Raddeanin A was identified to reduce beta-amyloidosis in U87 cells and 3 x Tg-AD mice model of AD by decreasing level of BACE1, APP, APP-beta and A beta. Raddeanin A improved behavioral, spatial memory and learning ability in the AD mice. In the cortex and hippocampus, raddeanin A improved the morphology and arrangement of neurons, lower the level of reactive astrocyte marker GFAP and apoptotic marker proteins Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Moreover, raddeanin A upregulated the mRNA and protein level of Prkc alpha in the hippocampus of AD mice whose neuroprotective effect was exerted possibly via the activation of protein kinase C. Conclusion: As a novel natural agent targeting beta-amyloidosis, our results provide the first evidence of the multiple in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective effect of raddeanin A, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in preventing or alleviating the symptoms of AD.

AB  - Piptocarpha macropoda (DC.) Baker (Asteraceae) hosts globoid galls induced by cecidomyiid, which may occur as clusters or as solitary stem galls. The cecidomyiid in clustered galls is attacked by a Platygaster sp. (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae), a polyembryonic endoparasitoid. As each individual cecidomyiid supports many parasitoids, we suppose that high consumption of nutrients by the parasitized galling insect will impact gall structural and histochemical profiles. The parasitized and unparasitized galls were morphologically and histochemically evaluated and, in addition, the bodies of parasitized and unparasitized galling larvae were measured. The main consequence of the presence of the endoparasitoids over gall structure is the increase in gall size and nutritive cell layers. Despite the difference in size between galls with and without the endoparasitoids, the parasitized and unparasitized cecidomyiid larvae had similar sizes. This is evidence of a positive impact of the Platygaster sp. feeding demand over gall growth, but of a null impact on the cecidomyiid body. This scenario indicates a hyperstimulation on plant cells and tissues by the parasitized cecidomyiid.

AB  - Inherited neurodevelopmental disorders: Repairing neural circuitry as a treatment Addressing neurological symptoms may offer new treatments for inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) affecting neurodevelopment. In such IEMs, mutation of an enzyme disrupts a metabolic pathway, causing buildup or lack of key molecules, with symptoms including hyperactivity, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Because the detailed pathological mechanisms of most IEMs are unknown, there are no treatments for resulting neurological issues. Myoung-Hwan Kim at Seoul National University and co-workers investigated whether they could treat the neurological symptoms of the IEM, aminopeptidase P1 (APP1) deficiency. They found that APP1 deficiency in mice caused an increase in the neural receptor NMDAR. Suppressing NMDAR reduced both neurological and behavioral symptoms. These findings suggest potential treatments for APP1 deficiency, and indicate that neurodevelopmental disorders in IEMs may be treated by repairing the neural circuitry instead of the root metabolic cause.
   Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are common causes of neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly, hyperactivity, and intellectual disability. However, the synaptic mechanisms of and pharmacological interventions for the neurological complications of most IEMs are unclear. Here, we report that metabolic dysfunction perturbs neuronal NMDA receptor (NMDAR) homeostasis and that the restoration of NMDAR signaling ameliorates neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits in IEM model mice that lack aminopeptidase P1. Aminopeptidase P1-deficient (Xpnpep1(-/-)) mice, with a disruption of the proline-specific metalloprotease gene Xpnpep1, exhibit hippocampal neurodegeneration, behavioral hyperactivity, and impaired hippocampus-dependent learning. In this study, we found that GluN1 and GluN2A expression, NMDAR activity, and the NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission were markedly enhanced in the hippocampi of Xpnpep1(-/-) mice. The exaggerated NMDAR activity and NMDAR-dependent LTP were reversed by the NMDAR antagonist memantine. A single administration of memantine reversed hyperactivity in adult Xpnpep1(-/-) mice without improving learning and memory. Furthermore, chronic administration of memantine ameliorated hippocampal neurodegeneration, hyperactivity, and impaired learning and memory in Xpnpep1(-/-) mice. In addition, abnormally enhanced NMDAR-dependent LTP and NMDAR downstream signaling in the hippocampi of Xpnpep1(-/-) mice were reversed by chronic memantine treatment. These results suggest that the metabolic dysfunction caused by aminopeptidase P1 deficiency leads to synaptic dysfunction with excessive NMDAR activity, and the restoration of synaptic function may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurological complications related to IEMs.

AB  - Background Air pollution, particularly particulate matter, has been linked to various health issues, including respiratory infections in children. This study investigates the impact of long-term PM2.5 exposure on acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis in a large Korean cohort. While children are known to be more vulnerable due to anatomical factors, the relationship between prolonged PM2.5 exposure and these infections has been insufficiently explored in large populations. Methods We aimed to examine the association of long-term exposure to PM2.5 with the first hospital visit of four infectious diseases - acute otitis media, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis - using a population-based cohort from National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data from 2002 to 2019. To ensure a minimum follow-up period of five years, individuals who enrolled in 2016 or later were excluded. A time-varying Cox model was applied to adjust for age, sex, income status, residential areas and district-level socioeconomic indicators. Annually updated residential addresses and related PM2.5 concentrations based on mean annual predictions from a machine learning-based ensemble prediction model were assigned. Results Our study included 364,227 people aged 0-18 years at enrollment and total of onset of each disease was 196,762 with acute otitis media, 253,248 with sinusitis, 275,160 with pharyngitis, and 315,367 with tonsillitis. Estimated hazard ratios (HR) per 5 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 were noticeably associated with acute otitis media (HR = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.08), sinusitis (HR = 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02), pharyngitis (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), and tonsillitis (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.05-1.06). Conclusions This study demonstrates a significant link between long-term PM2.5 exposure and increased risks of AOM, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis, especially in younger individuals. Highlighting the effects of prolonged exposure, it emphasizes the importance of public health strategies to protect vulnerable populations and provides insights for policies addressing air pollution-related health risks.

AB  - Representing past, present and future locations is key for spatial navigation. Indeed, within each cycle of the theta oscillation, the population of hippocampal place cells appears to represent trajectories starting behind the current position of the animal and sweeping ahead of it. In particular, we reported recently that the position represented by CA1 place cells at a given theta phase corresponds to the location where animals were or will be located at a fixed time interval into the past or future assuming the animal ran at its typical, not the current, speed through that part of the environment. This coding scheme leads to longer theta trajectories, larger place fields and shallower phase precession in areas where animals typically run faster. Here we present a mechanistic computational model that accounts for these experimental observations. The model consists of a continuous attractor network with short-term synaptic facilitation and depression that internally generates theta sequences that advance at a fixed pace. Spatial locations are then mapped onto the active units via modified Hebbian plasticity. As a result, neighboring units become associated with spatial locations further apart where animals run faster, reproducing our earlier experimental results. The model also accounts for the higher density of place fields generally observed where animals slow down, such as around rewards. Furthermore, our modeling results reveal that an artifact of the decoding analysis might be partly responsible for the observation that theta trajectories start behind the animal's current position. Overall, our results shed light on how the hippocampal code might arise from the interplay between behavior, sensory input and predefined network dynamics.
   Author summaryTo navigate in space we need to know where we are, but also where we are going and, possibly, where we are coming from. In mammals, including humans, this might rely on the hippocampal theta phase code, where in each cycle of the theta oscillation, spatial representations appear to start behind the animal's location and then sweep forward. Previously, we showed that these sweeps extend to the locations that were or will be reached at fixed time intervals in the past or future, but assuming the animal ran at its typical speed through each portion of the environment. Here, we present a computational model that can account for these effects, as well as for the over-representation of reward zones in the hippocampal code. The model uses preconfigured neural sequences in the hippocampus to learn sequences of spatial inputs, a mechanism which is supported by experimental findings. Similar mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the encoding of episodic memories. Our work might therefore help reconcile the prominence of spatial representations in the hippocampus with its well-known function in episodic memory.

AB  - Gamma oscillations are a prominent feature of various neural systems, including the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. In CA3, in vitro carbachol application induces -40 Hz gamma oscillations in the network of glutamatergic excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) and local GABAergic inhibitory neurons (INs). Activation of NMDA receptors within CA3 leads to an increase in the frequency of carbachol-induced oscillations to -60 Hz, a broadening of the distribution of individual oscillation cycle frequencies, and a decrease in the time lag between PN and IN spike bursts. In this work, we develop a biophysical integrate-and-fire model of the CA3 subfield, we show that the dynamics of our model are in concordance with physiological observations, and we provide computational support for the hypothesis that the 'E-I' mechanism is responsible for the emergence of -40 Hz gamma oscillations in the absence of NMDA activation. We then incorporate NMDA receptors into our CA3 model, and we show that our model exhibits the increase in gamma oscillation frequency, broadening of the cycle frequency distribution, and decrease in the time lag between PN and IN spike bursts observed experimentally. Remarkably, we find an inverse relationship in our model between the net NMDA current delivered to PNs and INs in an oscillation cycle and cycle frequency. Furthermore, we find a disparate effect of NMDA receptors on PNs versus INs - we show that NMDA receptors on INs tend to increase oscillation frequency, while NMDA receptors on PNs tend to slightly decrease or not affect oscillation frequency. We find that these observations can be explained if NMDA activity above a threshold level causes a shift in the mechanism underlying gamma oscillations; in the absence of NMDA receptors, the 'E-I' mechanism is primarily responsible for the generation of gamma oscillations (at 40 Hz), while when NMDA receptors are active, the mechanism of gamma oscillations shifts to the 'I-I' mechanism, and we argue that within the 'I-I' regime (which displays a higher baseline oscillation frequency of -60 Hz), slight changes in the level of NMDA activity are inversely related to cycle frequency.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is a tropical plant grown for sugar production. We recently showed that sugarcane top (ST) ameliorates cognitive decline in a mouse model of accelerated aging via promoting neuronal differentiation and neuronal energy metabolism and extending the length of the astrocytic process in vitro. Since the crude extract consists of multicomponent mixtures, it is crucial to identify bioactive compounds of interest and the affected molecular targets. In the present study, we investigated the bioactivities of major polyphenols of ST, namely 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3CQA), 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5CQA), 3-O-feruloylquinic acid (3FQA), and Isoorientin (ISO), in human fetal neural stem cells (hNSCs)- an in vitro model system for studying neural development. We found that multiple polyphenols of ST contributed synergistically to stimulate neuronal differentiation of hNSCs and induce mitochondrial activity in immature astrocytes. Mono-CQAs (3CQA and 5CQA) regulated the expression of cyclins related to G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas ISO regulated basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors related to cell fate determination. Additionally, mono-CQAs activated p38 and ISO inactivated GSK3 beta. In hNSC-derived immature astrocytes, the compounds upregulated mRNA expression of PGC-1 alpha, a master regulator of astrocytic mitochondrial biogenesis. Altogether, our findings suggest that synergistic interactions between major polyphenols of ST contribute to its potential for neuronal differentiation and astrocytic maturation.

AB  - Objective: Scleral remodeling plays a key role in axial elongation in myopia. The aim of the present study was to identify the proteomics changes and specific signaling networks to gain insight into the molecular basis of scleral remodeling in myopic eyes.
   Methods: Guinea pig form-deprivation myopia was induced with a translucent diffuser on a random eye for 4 weeks, while the other eye served as the contralateral control group. The axial length and refraction were measured at the beginning and end of the treatment. The proteins were extracted from the sclerae of each group and prepared for quantitative isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The coexpression networks and protein functions were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were performed to confirm the authenticity and accuracy of the iTRAQ results.
   Results: After 4 weeks, the form-deprivation eyes developed significant degrees of myopia, and the axial length increased statistically significantly (p<0.05). A total of 2,579 unique proteins with <1% false discovery rate (FDR) were identified. Furthermore, 56 proteins were found to be upregulated, and 84 proteins were found to be downregulated, with a threshold of a 1.2-fold change and p<0.05 in the myopia group, when compared to the control group. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that 44 of 140 differentially expressed proteins were involved in cellular movement and cellular assembly and organization. The qRT-PCR or western blotting results confirmed that myosin IIB, ACTIN3, and cellular cytoskeletons were downregulated, while RhoA and RAP1A were upregulated in the sclera in myopic eyes. These results were consistent with the proteomics results.
   Conclusions: Proteomics and bioinformatics results can be helpful for identifying proteins and providing new insights for better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying scleral remodeling. These results revealed that the proteins associated with cellular movement and cellular assembly and organization are altered during the development of myopia. Furthermore, RhoA plays a key role in the pathways involved in cellular movement and cellular assembly and organization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tetranychus cinnabarinus is one of the most common polyphagous arthropod herbivores, and is primarily controlled by the application of acaricides. The heavy use of acaricides has led to high levels of resistance to acaricides such as cyflumetofen, which poses a threat to global resistance management programs. Cyflumetofen resistance is caused by an increase in metabolic detoxification; however, the role of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes in cyflumetofen resistance remains to be determined. RESULTS: Synergist 5-nitrouracil (5-Nul) significantly enhanced cyflumetofen toxicity in T. cinnabarinus, which indicated that UGTs are involved in the development of cyflumetofen resistance. Transcriptomic analysis and quantitative (q)PCR assays demonstrated that the UGT genes, especially UGT201H1, were highly expressed in the YN-CyR strain, compared to those of the YN-S strain. The RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of UGT201H1 expression diminished the levels of cyflumetofen resistance in YN-CyR mites. The findings additionally revealed that the recombinant UGT201H1 protein plays a role in metabolizing cyflumetofen. Our results also suggested that the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) probably regulates the overexpression of the UGT201H1 detoxification gene. CONCLUSION: UGT201H1 is involved in cyflumetofen resistance, and AhR may regulates the overexpression of UGT201H1. These findings provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying UGT-mediated metabolic resistance to chemical insecticides. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

Drug resistance hinders the effectiveness of current chemotherapies, making osteosarcoma a leading cause of mortality and an urgent requirement of new therapeutics in this population. Here, we developed a triptolide (TP)-loaded, pH-responsive and near-infrared light-activated nanoplatform (TP-TPBC-PEG) with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to target osteosarcoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that PDT and chemotherapy of TP-TPBC-PEG synergistically reduced cell viability, colony proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and inhibited osteosarcoma growth and pulmonary metastasis in vivo which the nano-micelles were intravenously injected to intratibia injection induced osteosarcoma mouse models, showing enhanced osteosarcoma cell killing by nanoparticle inflating in response to acidic endosomal pH and sensitized osteosarcoma cells to TP chemotherapy. Importantly, the nano-micelles did not exhibit organ toxicity in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter gene and nuclear/ cytoplasm protein expression assays identified the involvement of HIPPO signaling pathway in mediating these effects. Overall, our study provides a promising therapeutic approach for treating primary osteosarcoma and preventing pulmonary metastases by activating the HIPPO signaling pathway.

AB  - The altered expression of known brain Aquaporin (AQP) channels 1, 4 and 9 has been correlated with neuropathological AD progression, but possible roles of other AQP classes in neurological disease remain understudied. The levels of transcripts of all thirteen human AQP subtypes were compared in healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains by statistical analyses of microarray RNAseq expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas database. Previously unreported, AQPs 0, 6 and 10, are present in human brains at the transcript level. Three AD-affected brain regions, hippocampus (HIP), parietal cortex (PCx) and temporal cortex (TCx), were assessed in three subgroups: young controls (n = 6, aged 24-57); aged controls (n = 26, aged 78-99); and an AD cohort (n = 12, aged 79-99). A significant positive correlation (p < 10(-10)) was seen for AQP transcript levels as a function of the subject's age in years. Differential expressions correlated with brain region, age, and AD diagnosis, particularly between the HIP and cortical regions. Interestingly, three classes of AQPs (0, 6 and 8) upregulated in AD compared to young controls are permeable to H2O2. Of these, AQPs 0 and 8 were increased in TCx and AQP6 in HIP, suggesting a role of AQPs in AD-related oxidative stress. The outcomes here are the first to demonstrate that the expression profile of AQP channels in the human brain is more diverse than previously thought, and transcript levels are influenced by both age and AD status. Associations between reactive oxygen stress and neurodegenerative disease risk highlight AQPs 0, 6, 8 and 10 as potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Many central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), affect the deep brain region, which hinders their effective treatment. The hippocampus, a deep brain area critical for learning and memory, is especially vulnerable to damage during early stages of AD. Magnetic drug targeting has shown high potential in delivering drugs to a targeted disease site effectively by applying a strong electromagnetic force. This study illustrates a nanotechnology-based scheme for delivering magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) to the deep brain region. First, we developed a mathematical model and a molecular dynamic simulation to analyze membrane crossing, and to study the effects of particle size, aggregation, and crossing velocities. Then, using in vitro experiments, we studied effective parameters in aggregation. We have also studied the process and environmental parameters. We have demonstrated that aggregation size can be controlled when particles are subjected to external electromagnetic fields. Our simulations and experimental studies can be used for capturing MNPs in brain, the transport of particles across the intact BBB and deep region targeting. These results are in line with previous in vivo studies and establish an effective strategy for deep brain region targeting with drug loaded MNPs through the application of an external electromagnetic field.

AB  - Nowadays, the incidence and mortality of head and neck tumors are gradually increasing. Head and neck malignant tumors (such as laryngeal cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, oral cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, and other head and neck malignancies) are more common among systemic tumors. The most common pathological head and neck tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, accounting for about 90%. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to collect the normal squamous epithelial tissues of the head and neck, atypical hyperplasia tissues, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas on a tissue chip for detection. The recombinant LATS1 overexpression plasmid was prepared and transferred into B88 cells. Western blotting, MTT, and Transwell chamber methods were used to detect the effects of LATS1 proliferation, migration, and B88 cell overexpression. The experimental results showed that in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the expression of LATS1 protein decreased from 59.3% to 11.3%. At the same time, this protein inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of head and neck squamous epithelial cells and also inhibited epithelium-Interstitial transformation exerts its tumor suppressor effect, indicating that LATS1 may play a tumor suppressor effect as a tumor suppressor gene. An in-depth study of the role and mechanism of LATS1 protein in the occurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may provide new opportunities for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the future.

AB  - Insect herbivores such as caterpillars are under strong selection pressure from natural enemies, especially parasitoid wasps. Although the role of olfaction in host-plant seeking has been investigated in great detail in parasitoids and adult lepidopterans, the caterpillar olfactory system and its significance in tri-trophic interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the olfactory system of Pieris brassicae caterpillars and the importance of olfactory information in the interactions among this herbivore, its host-plant Brassica oleracea, and its primary natural enemy Cotesia glomerata. To examine the role of olfaction, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout (KO) the odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco). This KO impaired olfactory detection and primary processing in the brain. Orco KO caterpillars exhibited reduced weight and lost preference for their optimal food plants. Interestingly, the KO caterpillars also experienced reduced weight when challenged by the parasitoid C. glomerata whose ovipositor had been removed, and the mortality of the KO caterpillars under the attack of unmanipulated parasitoids increased. We then investigated the behavior of P. brassicae caterpillars in response to volatiles from plants attacked by conspecific caterpillars and volatiles from plants on which the caterpillars were themselves attacked by C. glomerata. After analyzing the volatile compounds involved in these interactions, we concluded that olfactory information enables caterpillars to locate suitable food sources more efficiently as well as to select enemy-free spaces. Our results reveal the crucial role of olfaction in caterpillar feeding and natural-enemy avoidance, highlighting the significance of chemoreceptor genes in shaping ecological interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUNDDendrothrips minowai Priesner, a significant pest in tea-producing regions of Asia, particularly China, damages tea plants (Camellia sinensis) by feeding on their tender leaves rich in polyphenols. Seven assembled genomes from the order Thysanoptera are currently available.RESULTSThis study presents the first chromosome-level genome assembly of D. minowai generated by PacBio Revio, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, MGI, and Hi-C technology. The assembled genome measures 350.11 Mb with 1269 contigs with a contig N50 of 536.34 Kb and a scaffold N50 of 16.86 Mb, organized across 19 chromosomes. A total of 16 730 protein-coding genes were identified, with 92.28% functionally annotated. The phylogenetic analysis reveals that D. minowai diverged approximately 103.2 million years ago, preceding all reported genomes of Thripidae species. Comparative genomic analysis identified 12 expanded and 172 contracted gene families of D. minowai, with expanded gene families linked to host plant metabolite processing and detoxification enzymes. Additionally, oligophagous thrips, D. minowai and Stenchaetothrips biformis, possess fewer chemosensory genes (gustatory receptors, odorant receptors, ionotropic receptors, chemosensory proteins, and odorant binding proteins) and detoxification genes (P450s, carboxyl/cholinesterases, UDP-glycosyltransferases) than polyphagous species (Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips palmi). Interestingly, D. minowai exhibits an expansion in ABC transporter families, especially ABCG and ABCC, which is likely essential for detoxifying the high polyphenol content in tea plants.CONCLUSIONThis study provides another genome sequence for oligophagous thrips species, which enriches the genomic data for further studies on the evolution, host adaptation, and novel control strategies of thrips.

AB  - Background: Noise pollution pervades daily working and living environment, becoming a serious public health problem. In addition to causing auditory impairment, noise independently contributes to cognitive decline as a risk factor. Though neuroinflammation plays an important role in noise-induced cognitive deficits, the mechanisms underlying noise-induced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus are still poorly understood. Glial hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in noise-induced cognitive impairment remains to be further investigated. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to 100 dB white noise (4 h/day) for 30 days with or without injection of the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (10 mg/kg/day). The Morris water maze (MWM) test and the open field test (OFT) were performed to evaluate learning and memory ability of rats. HE staining was used to explore hippocampal pathological changes, while immunohistochemical staining was employed to evaluate the number and morphology of microglia and astrocytes. The mRNA levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus were examined by Real-time PCR. The protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, inflammatory cytokines, p-TauS396, and amyloid-beta (A beta) 42 in the hippocampus were examined by Western blot. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the distribution of NLRP3 in glial cells and neurons, and the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Results: We found that noise exposure induced learning and memory impairment in rats, mainly related to the activation of microglia and astrocytes in hippocampus region. Noise exposure increased the protein levels of pTau-S396, A beta 42, ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in hippocampus. Furthermore, the hippocampus of noise-exposed rats showed elevated protein levels of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved caspase-1. The co-labeled immunofluorescence levels of Iba-1 or GFAP with NLRP3 significantly increased in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus. NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 intervention reversed chronic noise-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, AD-like pathologies and impairment of learning and memory in rats. Conclusions: The NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation played an essential role in chronic noiseinduced cognitive dysfunction. These results provide novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of cognitive deficits caused by chronic noise.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAcrylamide-based bait has super water absorption making it highly attractive to subterranean termites that are lured by wood with high water content. This study investigated the control efficiency of these baits on subterranean termites. In particular, we evaluated the water-absorption capacity, attractiveness to subterranean termites, and control efficiency of these baits on subterranean termites through wooden blocks (Populus deltoides and three types of particleboards).RESULTSThe results indicated a substantial water absorption capacity of acrylamide (70.6%; control: 14.8%) and a strong attraction for feeding subterranean termites (P. deltoides: 198 highest; 81 lowest subterranean termites individuals; combination of neem leaves and walnut shells: 168 highest; 36 lowest subterranean termites individuals). When acrylamide was combined with boric acid at the highest concentration, it resulted in the lowest wood consumption rates (P. deltoides: 24.1%; control: 63.8%, combination of neem leaves and walnut shells: 32.5%; control: 62.1%).CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion, this research supports the commercial viability of employing innovative acrylamide-based toxic baits and particleboards for subterranean termite management. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.
   Conventional termite control methods fall short, while our study highlights the success of novel acrylamide-based baits in termite attraction and control.

AB  - Objective: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common postoperative disease that threatens patients' quality of life, especially elderly patients. With the popularity of anesthesia/surgery, POCD has received more attention worldwide. The objective of this research is to evaluate 3-n-Butylphthalide (NBP)'s protective effect on postoperative cognitive function in rats and its related mechanisms.Methods: Tibial fracture models of senile rats of POCD were established and divided into blank control group, solvent group, NBP group, Nrf 2 agonist group, and Nrf 2 inhibitor group. The changes in the cognitive abilities of rats were systematically evaluated by the Morris water maze test. After hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of the hippocampus, the morphological and structural changes of hippocampal neurons were observed by light microscopy. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Nrf 2,HO-1,Mfn1,Mfn2,Drp1 proteins. Moreover, the changes in the morphology of mitochondria were observed by transmission electron microscopy.Results: Through the water maze test, we observed that the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment in the NBP, agonist, and inhibitor groups was substantially lower as compared to the blank control group and solvent group (P < 0.05). The expressions of Nrf 2, HO-1, Mfn1, Mfn2, and Drp1 proteins in the NBP group were upregulated in comparison to the blank control group and the solvent group. The expressions of related proteins in the inhibitor group were substantially lower in comparison to the NBP group.Conclusions: NBP can affect the postoperative cognitive function of rats by activating the Nrf 2/ARE signaling pathway.

AB  - The sodium-citrate cotransporter (NaCT) plays a crucial role in citrate transport during amelogenesis. Mutations in the SLC13A5 gene, which encodes the NaCT, cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 25 and amelogenesis imperfecta. We analyzed developing pig molars and determined that the citrate concentrations in secretory- and maturation-stage enamel are both 5.3 mu mol/g, with about 95% of the citrate being bound to mineral. To better understand how citrate might enter developing enamel, we developed Slc13a5Flag reporter mice that express NaCT with a C-terminal Flag-tag (DYKDDDDK) that can be specifically and accurately recognized by commercially available anti-Flag antibodies. The 24-base Flag coding sequence was located immediately upstream of the natural translation termination codon (TAG) and was validated by Sanger sequencing. The general development, physical activities, and reproductive outcomes of this mouse strain were comparable to those of the C57BL/6 mice. No differences were detected between the Slc13a5Flag and wild-type mice. Tooth development was extensively characterized using dissection microscopy, bSEM, light microscopy, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Tooth formation was not altered in any detectable way by the introduction of the Flag. The Slc13a5Flag citrate transporter was observed on all outer membranes of secretory ameloblasts (distal, lateral, and proximal), with the strongest signal on the Tomes process, and was detectable in all but the distal membrane of maturation-stage ameloblasts. The papillary layer also showed positive immunostaining for Flag. The outer membrane of odontoblasts stained stronger than ameloblasts, except for the odontoblastic processes, which did not immunostain. As NaCT is thought to only facilitate citrate entry into the cell, we performed in situ hybridization that showed Ank is not expressed by secretory- or maturation-stage ameloblasts, ruling out that ANK can transport citrate into enamel. In conclusion, we developed Slc13a5Flag reporter mice that provide specific and sensitive localization of a fully functional NaCT-Flag protein. The localization of the Slc13a5Flag citrate transporter throughout the ameloblast membrane suggests that either citrate enters enamel by a paracellular route or NaCT can transport citrate bidirectionally (into or out of ameloblasts) depending upon local conditions.

AB  - Abundant evidence has shown the protective effect of aerobic exercise on central neuronal system, however, research about resistance exercise remains limited. To evaluate the effect and potential molecular mechanisms of resistance exercise in improving cognition and mental health, three-month-old male C57BL/6J mice underwent resistance training for five weeks. Body parameters, cognitive performance and synaptic plasticity were then assessed. In both groups, total RNA from the frontal cortex, hippocampus and gastrocnemius was isolated and sequenced, GO term and KEGG analysis were performed to identify molecular mechanisms. The results from RNA sequencing were then verified by RT-PCR. Our data found that mice in training group showed reduced anxietylike behavior and better spatial memory. Accordingly, resistance exercise specifically increased the number of thin spines without affecting the number of other kind of spines. mRNA sequence analysis showed that resistance exercise induced differential expression of hundreds of genes in the above three tissues. KEGG analysis indicated the FoxO signaling pathway the most significant changed pathway throughout the brain and muscle. GO terms analysis showed that Sgk1 was enriched in the three key cognition related BP, including long-term memory, learning or memory and memory, and the expression level of Sgk1 was positive related with cognitive performance in the water maze. In conclusion, resistance exercise improved the mental health, cognition and synaptic plasticity of mice. Integrating analysis of mRNA expression profiles in frontal cortex, hippocampus and muscle reveals Sgk1 as the key mediator in brain-muscle crosstalk.

AB  - Dopamine plays a critical role in modulating the long-term synaptic plasticity of the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses (SC-CA1), a widely accepted cellular model of learning and memory. Limited results from hippocampal slice experiments over the last four decades have shown that the timing of the activation of dopamine D1/D5 receptors relative to a high/low-frequency stimulation (HFS/LFS) in SC-CA1 synapses regulates the modulation of HFS/LFS-induced long-term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD) in these synapses. However, the existing literature lacks a complete picture of how various concentrations of D1/D5 agonists and the relative timing between the activation of D1/D5 receptors and LTP/LTD induction by HFS/LFS, affect the spatiotemporal modulation of SC-CA1 synaptic dynamics. In this paper, we have developed a computational model, a first of its kind, to make quantitative predictions of the temporal dose-dependent modulation of the HFS/LFS induced LTP/LTD in SC-CA1 synapses by various D1/D5 agonists. Our model combines the biochemical effects with the electrical effects at the electrophysiological level. We have estimated the model parameters from the published electrophysiological data, available from diverse hippocampal CA1 slice experiments, in a Bayesian framework. Our modeling results demonstrate the capability of our model in making quantitative predictions of the available experimental results under diverse HFS/LFS protocols. The predictions from our model show a strong nonlinear dependency of the modulated LTP/LTD by D1/D5 agonists on the relative timing between the activated D1/D5 receptors and the HFS/LFS protocol and the applied concentration of D1/D5 agonists.

AB  - Organic wastes are generated from high consumption of fruits. In this paper, fruit residual wastes collected from fruit-juice centres were transformed into fine powder, and thereafter, proximate analysis along with SEM, EDX and XRD was done to get into the surface morphology, minerals and ash content of fine powder. Aqueous extract (AE) prepared from this powder was studied using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The phytochemicals identified are N-hexadecanoic acid; 1,3-dioxane,2,4-dimethyl-, diglycerol, 4-ethyl-2-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one, eicosanoic acid, etc. AE showed high antioxidant and a low MIC value (2 mg/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa MZ269380. AE having acceptance as nontoxic to biological system, formulation of chitosan (2%)-based coating was done with 1% AQ. Surface coatings of tomatoes and grapes showed significant inhibition of microbial growth even after 10 days of storage at ambient temperature (25 & PLUSMN; 2 & DEG;C). Colour, texture, firmness and aceptability of coated fruits showed no degradation compared to negative control. Additionally, the extracts showed insignificance haemolysis of goat RBC and damage of Calf Thymus DNA which exhibited its biocompatible nature. Biovalorization of fruit wastes yields useful phytochemicals and can be utilized in various sectors thereby finding a sustainable solution for disposal of fruit wastes.

AB  - G-1, a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER)-specific agonist, exhibits anticancer potential in breast cancer cells. This study aims to explore the molecular basis of apoptosis induced by G-1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Here, we found that G-1 induced cytotoxicity and GPER-dependent apoptosis with PARP cleavage and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, as well as nuclear condensation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis in living cells indicated that G-1 effectively disrupted the interaction between large tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2) and Yes-associated protein (YAP). Furthermore, G-1 reduced YAP phosphorylation levels and promoted its nuclear accumulation. Notably, knockdown of YAP attenuated G-1- induced apoptosis, highlighting the crucial role of YAP in this process. Additionally, FRET analysis revealed that G-1 enhanced the binding of YAP to p73, leading to an increase in Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression and an induction of apoptosis. In summary, our findings demonstrate that G-1 induces apoptosis through the GPER/YAP/p73-mediated pathway.

AB  - The escalating food demand and loss to herbivores has led to increasing interest in using resistance-inducing microbes for pest control. Here, we evaluated whether root-inoculation with fungi that are otherwise known as entomopathogens improves tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaflets' reaction to herbivory by Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm) larvae using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Plants were inoculated with Metarhizium brunneum or Beauveria bassiana, and photosystem II reactions were evaluated before and after larval feeding. Before herbivory, the fraction of absorbed light energy used for photochemistry (phi(PSII)) was lower in M. brunneum-inoculated than in control plants, but not in B. bassiana-inoculated plants. After herbivory, however, phi(PSII) increased in the fungal-inoculated plants compared with that before herbivory, similar to the reaction of control plants. At the same time, the fraction of energy dissipated as heat (phi(NPQ)) decreased in the inoculated plants, resulting in an increased fraction of nonregulated energy loss (phi(NO)) in M. brunneum. This indicates an increased singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) formation not detected in B. bassiana-inoculated plants, showing that the two entomopathogenic fungi differentially modulate the leaflets' response to herbivory. Overall, our results show that M. brunneum inoculation had a negative effect on the photosynthetic efficiency before herbivory, while B. bassiana inoculation had no significant effect. However, S. exigua leaf biting activated the same compensatory PSII response mechanism in tomato plants of both fungal-inoculated treatments as in control plants.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the most common cause of death worldwide. Many MI survivors will suffer from recurrent heart failure (HF), which has been recognized as a determinant of adverse prognosis. Despite the success of improved early survival after MI by primary percutaneous coronary intervention, HF after MI is becoming the major driver of late morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The development of regenerative medicine has brought hope to MI treatment in the past decade. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have been established as an essential part of stem cell paracrine factors for heart regeneration. However, its regenerative power is hampered by low delivery efficiency to the heart. We designed, fabricated, and tested a minimally invasive exosome spray (EXOS) based on MSC exosomes and biomaterials. In a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction, EXOS improved cardiac function and reduced fibrosis, and promoted endogenous angiomyogenesis in the post-injury heart. We further tested the feasibility and safety of EXOS in a pig model. Our results indicate that EXOS is a promising strategy to deliver therapeutic exosomes for heart repair.

AB  - Fipronil (FIP) insecticide is extensively used in agriculture, public health and veterinary medicine. Although it is considered as a neurotoxin to insects (target organisms) and exhibits neurological signs upon vertebrates (nontarget organisms) exposure, slight is known about its potential neurotoxic effects and its molecular mechanisms on vertebrates. The current study is designed to assess oxidative stress as a molecular mechanism of FIP neurotoxicity subordinated with apoptosis and neural tissue reactivity. Ten adult male albino rats received 10 mg/kg body weight fipronil technical grade by oral gavage daily for 45 days (subacute exposure). Brain neural tissue regions (hippocampus, cerebellum and caudate putamen) were processed to examine oxidative stress induced cellular macromolecular alterations as MDA, PCC and DNA fragmentation. Besides, TNF-alpha and Bcl-2 gene expression and immunoreactivity for caspase-3 (active form), iNOS and GFAP were evaluated. Also, histopathological assessment was conducted. We found that FIP significantly raised MDA, PCC and DNA fragmentation (p <= 0.05). Also, it significantly upregulated TNF-alpha and non-significantly down-regulated Bcl-2 gene expression (p <= 0.05). Further, significant increased immunoreactivity to GFAP, iNOS and caspase-3 (active form) in these brain neural tissue regions in FIP treated group was noticed (p <= 0.05). Histopathological findings, including alterations in the histological architecture and neuronal degeneration, were also observed in these brain regions of FIP treated group. In conclusion, we suggest the ability of FIP to induce oxidative stress mediated macromolecular alterations, leading to apoptosis and tissue reaction in these brain regions which showed variable susceptibility to FIP toxic effects.

AB  - The GPI-anchoring pathway plays important roles in normal development and immune modulation. MHC Class I Polypeptide-related Sequence A (MICA) is a stress-induced ligand, downregulated by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to escape immune recognition. Its most prevalent allele, MICA*008, is GPI-anchored via an uncharacterized pathway. Here, we identify cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like protein (CLPTM1L) as a GPI-anchoring pathway component and show that during infection, the HCMV protein US9 downregulates MICA*008 via CLPTM1L. We show that the expression of some GPI-anchored proteins (CD109, CD59, and MELTF)-but not others (ULBP2, ULBP3)-is CLPTM1L-dependent, and further show that like MICA*008, MELTF is downregulated by US9 via CLPTM1L during infection. Mechanistically, we suggest that CLPTM1L's function depends on its interaction with a free form of PIG-T, normally a part of the GPI transamidase complex. We suggest that US9 inhibits this interaction and thereby downregulates the expression of CLPTM1L-dependent proteins. Altogether, we report on a new GPI-anchoring pathway component that is targeted by HCMV.
   Kol et al. identify CLPTM1L as a novel component of the GPI-anchoring pathway and show that it is targeted by HCMV. This discovery sheds light on basic aspects of cell biology, as well as on the sophistication with which viruses manipulate the immune response.

AB  - The discovery of mouse embryonic stem cells in 1981 transformed research in mammalian developmental biology and functional genomics. The subsequent generation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and the development of molecular reprogramming have opened unheralded avenues for drug discovery and cell replacement therapy. Here, I review the history of PSCs from the perspective that long-term self-renewal is a product of the in vitro signaling environment, rather than an intrinsic feature of embryos. I discuss the relationship between pluripotent states captured in vitro to stages of epiblast in the embryo and suggest key considerations for evaluation of PSCs. A remaining fundamental challenge is to determine whether na & iuml;ve pluripotency can be propagated from the broad range of mammals by exploiting common principles in gene regulatory architecture.
   Self-renewal of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is achieved in signaling environments that stall developmental progression while permitting proliferation. Na & iuml;ve PSCs corresponding to early epiblast are captured in a signal-restricted milieu. In contrast, specific growth factor stimulation is necessary to sustain formative or primed PSCs that represent transitional and mature epiblast. image

AB  - Background Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-recognized endocrine disruptor and is globally used in the manufacture of many plastic items. Multiple studies suggest links between prenatal BPA exposure and alterations in neurodevelopment and behaviors in children, even at lower levels. This study was conducted to reveal the role of astrocyte morphology and Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling in BPA induced cognitive defects in the offspring of Wistar albino rats when exposed during the prenatal and postnatal periods.
   Methods Dams of Wistar albino rats were exposed to a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight of BPA throughout the pregnancy and lactation period until the third postnatal day (PND). After delivery of pups, cognitive tests were carried out on the 21st, 24th, and 28th PNDs. Blood samples were collected for measurement of serum GABA levels. On the same day as the blood collections, pups were sacrificed and their right frontal cortices were dissected out. Immunohistochemical analysis for glial fibrillar acidic protein + astrocytes was conducted.
   Results Pre and postnatal BPA exposure led to anxiety like behavior in pups. This exposure also resulted in reduced serum GABA concentrations. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed reduced astrocyte numbers as well as decreased numbers of dendritic spines in the BPA exposed pups.
   Conclusion BPA exposure during critical periods of development leads to cognitive impairments that correlate with the defects in the GABA signaling pathways and deteriorated morphology of the astrocytes in the offspring of the Wistar rats.

AB  - Rapid diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks is critical as endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery gains global prominence. Current clinical methods such as endoscopic examination with and without intrathecal injection of fluorescent dye are invasive and rely on subjective judgment by physicians, highlighting the clinical need for label-free point-of-care (POC). However, a viable solution remains undeveloped due to the molecular complexity of CSF rhinorrhea mixed with nasal discharge and the scarcity of specific biomarkers, delaying sensor development. In this study, we accelerated the development of a label-free CSF detection method for clinical use using a nanoparticle corona. We engineered corona nanointerfaces on near-infrared (nIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through noncovalent functionalization with 12 custom-designed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids. By high-throughput screening of the corona library for the CSF biomarker beta-trace protein (beta TP), we selected the optimal corona, achieving a limit of detection (LOD) down to 1.46 mg/L, maintaining its selectivity even in human nasal discharge. Using molecular dynamics and docking simulations, we characterized the 3D morphology and beta TP binding energy of the optimal corona in a quantified way. The corona nanosensor accurately diagnosed CSF leakages from eight patients having lumbar drainage and one patient with CSF leakage due to diverse diseases without any sample preparations. By integrating the nanosensor with custom-designed in vivo and in vitro form factors such as a camera and endoscope, we showed its potential for versatile and practical use in clinical settings. This accelerated sensor development platform can meet future urgent clinical demands for various diseases and conditions.

AB  - Background: Depression is becoming increasingly prevalent around the world, imposing a substantial burden on individuals, families, as well as society. Quercetin is known to be highly effective in treating depression. However, additional research is needed to dissect the mechanisms of its anti -depressive effects. Methods: For this study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized into the control, model, quercetin, or fl uoxetine group. The latter three groups were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 42 d. The fi rst two groups received saline solution daily via oral gavage. Meanwhile, the quercetin group was orally administered a quercetin suspension (52.08 mg/kg) every day, while the fl uoxetine group was orally administered a fl uoxetine solution (2.08 mg/kg). Here, fl uoxetine served as the positive control drug to compare the therapeutic effects of quercetin. The experimental period was 6 weeks. Depressive behaviors in rats were assessed through various physiological and behavioral measures. Additionally, pathological changes in hippocampal tissues were examined using Nissl staining. Serum cytokines were detected using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemistry was employed to quantify the levels and integral optical density (IOD) values of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule -1 (Iba-1) expression in the brain. Real-time fl uorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was utilized to evaluate the mRNA levels of inflammatory fl ammatory indicators as well as toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor -Kappa B P65 (NF -KB P65) in hippocampus. Western blot (WB) technique was employed to observe the protein levels of TLR4, NF -KB P65, and phospho-NF-KB P65 (p -NF -KB P65). Results: After 42 d of exposure to CUMS, rats exhibited a slow increase in body weight, a reduction in food intake, an abnormal preference for sugar water, and aberrant open-field fi eld behaviors. Pathological analysis revealed the disintegration, rupture, interruption, and disorganization of hippocampal neuronal cells after CUMS exposure, along with a decrease in Nissl bodies in the CA1 region. This was accompanied by the elevated expression of interleukin-113 (IL -113), tumor necrosis factor -a (TNF-a), and interleukin-6 (IL -6) in the serum and the upregulation of IL -113, IL -6, and TNF-a mRNA expression in the hippocampus. Increases in Iba-1-positive cells and the IOD values of Iba-1 were detected in hippocampal microglia. Furthermore, TLR4 and NF -KB P65 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in hippocampal tissues. Quercetin, an antidepressant, could alleviate depression -like symptoms in rats and downregulate inflammatory fl ammatory factors associated with the TLR4/NF-KB signaling pathway in hippocampal microglia, and its therapeutic effect was comparable to fl uoxetine. Conclusion: In rat models of CUMS, quercetin may act as an antidepressant by inhibiting inflammation fl ammation in hippocampal microglia via TLR4/NF-KB signaling pathway. These results offer experimental and theoretical support for applying quercetin in the clinical management of depression.

AB  - In this study, a highmolecular weight arabinoxylan (AX, Mw: 694 kDa) from wheat bran was alkaline extracted and covalently linked with Catechin (CA) by free radical catalytic reaction. Comparing to AX, arabinoxylancatechin (AX-CA) conjugates demonstrated an extra UV-vis absorption peak at 274 nm, a new FT-IR absorption band at 1516 cm(-1) and new proton signals at 6.5-7.5 ppm, which all confirmed the covalently linked structure. Grafting CA onto AX not only decreased themolecularweight, thermal stability and apparent viscosity of AX, but also enhanced its inhibition effects on starch digestibility in vitro. The in vitro fermentation test with pig feces showed that the degradation & utilization rate of AX, the total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and acetic acid levels produced all were significantly delayed after grafting. This study provided a novel approach to synthesize AX-CA conjugates that could be a novel dietary fiber of enhanced functional/bioactive properties using in the fields of functional foods and medicine.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a risk factor in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with unclear underlying mechanisms. Recently, we provided data showing the effect of trauma-like stress on Bin1 and Fkbp5 expression in the prefrontal cortex of A beta(1-42) lesioned animals. This present work sought to expand the study by examining the involvement of the amygdala and hippocampus, in addition to highlighting the role of NR2B in the co-occurrence of trauma-like stress and an A beta AD-like pathology.& nbsp;Trauma-like condition was induced by exposing the animals to footshocks. A beta(1-42) was injected into the hippocampus of the animals to induce AD-like pathology. Cognitive functions were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition tests, after which amygdala and hippocampus tissues were harvested for neurochemical analyses.& nbsp;We found that the combination of footshocks and A beta(1-42) lesion caused a decrease in the number of crossings in the target quadrant of the Morris water maze test, indicating memory deficits. Footshocks caused a further downregulation of Bin1 in the amygdala of A beta(1-42)-lesioned rats. Prior exposure to footshocks downregulated NR2B in the hippocampus of A beta(1-42)-lesioned rats. In addition, a combination of footshocks and A beta(1-42) lesion sustained the upregulation of Fkbp5 in the hippocampus and amygdala. A combination of footshocks and A beta(1-42) lesion increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and amygdala.& nbsp;In conclusion, exposure to a trauma-like condition may influence AD-like pathology, leading to exaggerated behavioural and molecular changes in the amygdala and hippocampus.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disease caused almost exclusively by mutations to the MeCP2 gene. This disease may be regarded as a synaptopathy, with impairments affecting synaptic plasticity, inhibitory and excitatory transmission and network excitability. The complete understanding of the mechanisms behind how the transcription factor MeCP2 so profoundly affects the mammalian brain are yet to be determined. What is known, is that MeCP2 involvement in activity-dependent expression programs is a critical link between this protein and proper neuronal activity, which allows the correct maturation of connections in the brain. By using RNA-sequencing analysis, we found several immediate-early genes (IEGs, key mediators of activity-dependent responses) directly bound by MeCP2 at the chromatin level and upregulated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the Mecp2-KO mouse. Quantification of the IEGs response to stimulus both in vivo and in vitro detected an aberrant expression pattern in MeCP2-deficient neurons. Furthermore, altered IEGs levels were found in RTT patient's peripheral blood and brain regions of post-mortem samples, correlating with impaired expression of downstream myelination-related genes. Altogether, these data indicate that proper IEGs expression is crucial for correct synaptic development and that MeCP2 has a key role in the regulation of IEGs.

AB  - BACKGROUNDCamellia oleifera anthracnose (COA), caused by Colletotrichum fructicola, is a serious threat to both the yield and quality of Camellia oleifera oil (COO). To detect and distinguish incipient C. fructicola infection on asymptomatic plants is essential for COA control. Therefore, an efficient and rapid diagnostic method for detection of C. fructicola is desperately needed for making management strategies promptly.RESULTSWe created a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method in conjunction with alkaline lysis (AL) to differentiate C. fructicola from other COA-related Colletotrichum species. Compared to the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, the LAMP method not only exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity in the detection of C. fructicola but also required less complicated equipment (just a dry bath), less operating time (30 min for plant crude DNA lysis and 15 min for LAMP assay), and could be used for on-site diagnosis. The minimum detectable concentration of the C. fructicola DNA using LAMP was 10 pg, which was 100 times lower than the conventional PCR. Furthermore, the AL method of extracting crude genomic DNAs (gDNAs) from oil tea leaves could be applied for the LAMP detection under field conditions with a sensitivity of up to 5 x 103 spores mL-1 of C. fructicola infection, which was ten times more sensitive than conventional PCR.CONCLUSIONWe developed a LAMP assay combined with an AL DNA extraction method (LAMP-AL) to accurately detect and differentiate the C. fructicola infection on oil-tea leaves. The assays specifically detailed here are portable and simple to apply in the field conditions with limited resources. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed an altered expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of schizophrenic patients. Despite extensive considerations, the alteration of NKCC1 and KCC2 co-transporters at different stages of development has not been fully studied. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of these transporters in PFC and hippocampus at time points of four, eight, and twelve weeks in post-weaning social isolation rearing rat model. For this purpose, 23-25 days-old rats were classified into social- or isolation-reared groups. The levels of NKCC1 and KCC2 mRNA expression were evaluated at hippocampus or PFC regions at the time-points of four, eight, and twelve weeks following housing. Post-weaning isolation rearing decreased the hippocampal KCC2 mRNA expression level, but does not affect the NKCC1 mRNA expression. However, no significant difference was observed in the PFC mRNA levels of NKCC1 and KCC2 in the isolation-reared group compared to the socially-reared group during the course of modeling. Further, we assessed the therapeutic effect of selective NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (10 mg/kg), on improvement of prepulse inhibition (PPI) test on twelve weeks isolation-reared rats. Intraperitoneal administration of bumetanide (10 mg/kg) did not exert beneficial effects on PPI deficit. Our findings show that isolation rearing reduces hippocampal KCC2 expression level and may underlie hippocampal GABA excitatory. In addition, 10 mg/kg bumetanide is not effective in improving the reduced PPI of twelve weeks isolation-reared rats.
   Collectively, our findings show that hippocampal chloride transporter KCC2 contributes to excitatory GABA dysregulation in the developmental rat model of schizophrenia.

AB  - Simple Summary Rodents threaten the one health approach in livestock farming. In the present observational case study, livestock farmers collaborated with a pest controller in a pilot project in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The objective was to evaluate factors influencing rodent-prevention potential on 24 livestock farms after 1.5 years project duration. Farmers' attitudes were surveyed at the project's start in March 2019. Potential for rodent prevention was assessed by an external expert in 2020. About half of the farms showed good potential for rodent prevention. Willingness to change at the project start played a central role for rodent-prevention potential. The study underscores the necessity of better informing farmers about rodent control and prevention, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures for long-term rodent control. It also highlights the need for improved advisory services for farmers.Abstract Rodents in livestock farming constitute a threat to the one health approach. In the present observational case study, livestock farmers worked together with a pest controller within a pilot project. The aim of the study was to assess determinants associated with rodent-prevention potential. The study started in March 2019 on 24 livestock farms in a municipality in North Rhine-Westphalia/Germany. At the beginning of the project a survey on the determinants expected to be related to prevention potential was conducted. To determine the potential for rodent prevention, an expert person, who was not involved in the project before, assessed the on-site conditions of the farms after 1.5 years of project duration in 2020. The potential for rodent prevention was good for about half of the farms. There were significant differences in the willingness to make changes at the project's start between farms with a high and a low potential for rodent prevention after 1.5 years. There is a general need for action to provide farmers with more practical information on rodent control. This is aggravated by the insufficient advisory services offered to farmers. This study confirms the importance of implementing preventive measures in the control of rodents to ensure that anticoagulant rodenticides are handled responsibly to reduce the impact on non-target species.

AB  - Objective: Cognitive impairment, one of the most prevalent complications of trigeminal neuralgia, is troubling for patients and clinicians due to limited therapeutic options. Curcumin shows antinociception and neuroprotection pharmacologically, suggesting that it may have therapeutic effect on this complication. This study aimed to investigate whether curcumin alleviates orofacial allodynia and improves cognitive impairment by regulating hippocampal CA1 region synaptic plasticity in trigeminal neuralgia. Methods: A mouse model of trigeminal neuralgia was established by partially transecting the infraorbital nerve (pT-ION). Curcumin was administered by gavage twice daily for 14 days. Nociceptive thresholds were measured using the von Frey and acetone test, and the cognitive functions were evaluated using the Morris water maze test. Dendritic spines and synaptic ultrastructures in the hippocampal CA1 area were observed by Golgi staining and transmission electron microscopy.Results: Curcumin intervention increased the mechanical and cold pain thresholds of models. It decreased the escape latency and distance to the platform and increased the number of platform crossings and dwell time in the target quadrant of models, and improved spatial learning and memory deficits. Furthermore, it partially restored the disorder of the density and proportion of dendritic spines and the abnormal density and structure of synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region of models.Conclusion: Curcumin alleviates abnormal orofacial pain and cognitive impairment in pT-ION mice by a mechanism that may be related to the synaptic plasticity of hippocampal CA1, suggesting that curcumin is a potential strategy for repairing cognitive dysfunction under long-term neuropathic pain conditions.

AB  - Mesometrium is the "gateway" through which the endometrium exchanges nutrients and substances with the outside world due to blood vessels entering endometrium across mesometrium. Therefore, dissecting the transcription atlas of the mesometrium will be a great help in understanding the role of mesometrium during implantation. In this study, we collected samples from the mesometrium and adjacent endometrium on the 12th day of estrous cycle and pregnancy. Transcription atlas of mesometrium and adjacent endometrium revealed that genes such as ISG15, which are related to the pathway of response to Interferon alpha and gamma, were significantly enriched. The result of immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the core genes within these pathways were mainly located in the vascular endothelial cells both the endometrium and mesometrium. ISG15 interferon assay revealed the down-regulation of ISG15 induced proliferation, migration and tube formation. Taken together, we concluded that down-regulation of genes related to response of interferons promoted angiogenesis in the mesometrium and adjacent endometrium, allowing mesometrium to play an essential supportive role in pregnancy.

AB  - The transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are the main downstream effectors of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo signaling pathway. YAP/TAZ are implicated in the transcriptional regulation of target genes that are involved in a wide range of key biological processes affecting tissue homeostasis and play dual roles in the aging process, depending on the cellular and tissue context. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether pharmacological inhibitors of Yap/Taz increase the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. Real-time qRT-PCR was performed to measure the changes in the expression of Yki (Yorkie, the Drosophila homolog of YAP/TAZ) target genes. We have revealed a lifespan-increasing effect of YAP/TAZ inhibitors that was mostly associated with decreased expression levels of the wg and E2f1 genes. However, further analysis is required to understand the link between the YAP/TAZ pathway and aging.

AB  - Actin cytoskeleton dynamics have been found to regulate myogenesis in various progenitor cells, and twinfilin-1 (TWF1), an actin-depolymerizing factor, plays a vital role in actin dynamics and myoblast differentiation. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the epigenetic regulation and biological significance of TWF1 in obesity and muscle wasting have not been explored. Here, we investigated the roles of miR-302a in TWF1 expression, actin filament modulation, proliferation, and myogenic differentiation in C2C12 progenitor cells. Palmitic acid, the most prevalent saturated fatty acid (SFA) in the diet, decreased the expression of TWF1 and impeded myogenic differentiation while increasing the miR-302a levels in C2C12 myoblasts. Interestingly, miR-302a inhibited TWF1 expression directly by targeting its 3 ' UTR. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-302a promoted cell cycle progression and proliferation by increasing the filamentous actin (F-actin) accumulation, which facilitated the nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). Consequently, by suppressing the expressions of myogenic factors, i.e., MyoD, MyoG, and MyHC, miR-302a impaired myoblast differentiation. Hence, this study demonstrated that SFA-inducible miR-302a suppresses TWF1 expression epigenetically and impairs myogenic differentiation by facilitating myoblast proliferation via F-actin-mediated YAP1 activation.

AB  - Simple Summary The challenges to learn veterinary anatomy in the actual curriculums and the changes in studying habits promoted by the global COVID-19 lockdown requires new approaches to deliver the best knowledge to the actual generation of learners. The present study evaluated the students' acceptance to a educational approach, which consisted in bringing plastinate anatomical specimens to study at home. The assessment was done through an anonymous survey and individual interviews. Accordingly, to the students' response, the method was well accepted for reasons that includes flexible time study and better possibilities to explore the anatomical differences between the species in three-dimensional materials. Considering the results and the low impact of this educational approach in the curriculum dynamics, the plastinate library is suggested as interesting aid to the learning experience in animal anatomy.Abstract The shortage of both time for anatomy courses in the new veterinary medicine curriculum and instructors prepared to teach biomedical sciences has raised a crisis in anatomical education. Often, students spend time out of their classes trying to learn not only concepts but also laboratory-wise content from 2D materials such as books and videos. In addition, since the global COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, studying and habits have been reviewed, with many people adopting an at-home style. The purpose of this study was to evaluate students' acceptance of taking plastinate anatomical specimens to study at home. Thirty-three students were divided into three groups. G1 took home a set of kidneys composed of equine, bovine, and swine materials; G2 took home a pig kidney; and G3 (control) did not take any plastinate specimen home. Acceptance was assessed using an anonymous survey and interview. The method had high acceptance by the students, who believed that having the plastinate library was advantageous from different perspectives, including aiding with learning the differences between kidneys from different species, time flexibility, no commute to study after hours of laboratory classes, and time redistribution to prioritize the laboratory topics. The plastinate library has the potential to be a supportive tool for anatomy students in the contemporaneous veterinary curriculum paradigm, considering that the G1 and G2 groups used the plastinate specimens at home to complement the time they spent in the laboratory.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multivariate and diversified disease and affects the most sensitive areas of the brain, the cerebral cortex, and the hippocampus. AD is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease most often associated with memory deficits and cognition that get more worsen over time. The central theory on the pathophysiological hallmark features of AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) peptides, also associated with tau proteins (tau) dysfunctioning which leads to distorted microtubular structure, affects the cholinergic system, and mitochondrial biogenesis. This review emphasizes how simple it is to find novel treatments for AD and focuses on several recently developed medications through repurposing that can speed up traditional drug development.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is a major cause of mortality and neurological impairments in infants. Main HIinduced pathological mechanisms include mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress due to insufficient oxygen and energetic substrates to the nervous cells. Bovine lactoferrin (Lf) has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in several experimental models of neonatal brain injury in rodents, however its mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the early impact of maternal dietary supplementation with Lf on redox and hippocampal mitochondrial function following neonatal HI. From postnatal day 6 (PND6), pregnant Wistar rats were fed with a diet supplemented with Lf (1 g/kg) or with an isocaloric control diet until offspring euthanasia. At PND7, pups of both sexes were subjected to experimental HI through the occlusion of the right common carotid artery followed by 60 min of hypoxia (8 % oxygen). Lf prevented HI-induced increased levels of DCFH and lipoperoxidation in hippocampus. Furthermore, Lf enhanced antioxidant defenses including SOD, GPx, and GSH, counteracting HI-induced oxidative stress. HI injury altered the activities of enzymes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Both effects were counteracted by Lf supplementation. Lactoferrin prevented oxidative stress and to restored mitochondrial function by upregulating Nrf2 and UCP2 expression following experimental HI. Our results show that even a shorter period of Lf delivery to rat pups is able to improve hippocampal response to neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, reversing initial mechanisms of damage in the cascade of HI injury.

AB  - Fermentation losses and aerobic stability of elephant grass silages with inclusion of 4 levels of Parkia platycephala pod meal (PP) (0, 10, 20 and 30 %) and 2 levels of urea (0 and 1.5 %) on as-fed basis were evaluated. The silages were analyzed for gas and effluent losses, dry matter recovery (DMR), pH and aerobic stability (pH and temperature) to determine effects of interactions between levels of urea and PP on gas losses, dry matter recovery, temperature and pH of the silages. The combination of urea and PP increased gas losses and reduced the DMR. PP reduced effluent losses and urea increased aerobic stability of the silages. pH values decreased with inclusion of PP and increased with use of urea. Silages containing 20 and 30 % PP showed greater stability over time, especially when associated with urea. PP with urea were effective in reducing effluent losses, maintaining DMR and allowing higher aerobic stability, with stability rupture from 40 h with the inclusion of 20 % of PP in elephant grass silages.

AB  - To date, no studies have addressed the role of neurotrophins (NTs) in Acanthamoeba spp. infections in the brain. Thus, to clarify the role of NTs in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus during experimental acanthamoebiasis in relation to the host immune status, the purpose of this study was to determine whether Acanthamoeba spp. may affect the concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in brain structures. Our results suggest that at the beginning of infection in immunocompetent hosts, BDNF and NT-3 may reflect an endogenous attempt at neuroprotection against Acanthamoeba spp. infection. We also observed a pro-inflammatory effect of NGF during acanthamoebiasis in immunosuppressed hosts. This may provide important information for understanding the development of cerebral acanthamoebiasis related to the immunological status of the host. However, the pathogenesis of brain acanthamoebiasis is still poorly understood and documented and, therefore, requires further research.

AB  - Dexamethasone is widely used in preclinical studies and clinical trials to treat inner ear disorders. The results of those studies vary widely, maybe due to the different dexamethasone formulations used. Laboratory (lab) and medical grade (med) dexamethasone (DEX, C22H29FO5) and dexamethasone dihydrogen phosphate-disodium (DPS, C22H28FNa2O8P) were investigated for biocompatibility and bio-efficacy in vitro. The biocompatibility of each dexamethasone formulation in concentrations from 0.03 to 10,000 mu M was evaluated using an MTT assay. The concentrations resulting in the highest cell viability were selected to perform a bio-efficiency test using a TNF alpha-reduction assay. All dexamethasone formulations up to 900 mu M are biocompatible in vitro. DPS-lab becomes toxic at 1000 mu M and DPS-med at 2000 mu M, while DEX-lab and DEX-med become toxic at 4000 mu M. Bio-efficacy was evaluated for DEX-lab and DPS-med at 300 mu M, for DEX-med at 60 mu M, and DPS-lab at 150 mu M, resulting in significantly reduced expression of TNF alpha, with DPS-lab having the highest effect. Different dexamethasone formulations need to be applied in different concentration ranges to be biocompatible. The concentration to be applied in future studies should carefully be chosen based on the respective dexamethasone form, application route and duration to ensure biocompatibility and bio-efficacy.

AB  - Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the hippocampus where mediates its actions by activating glutamate receptors. The activation of these receptors is essential for the maintenance and dynamics of dendritic spines and plasticity that correlate with learning and memory processes during neurodevelopment and adulthood. We studied in adults the effect of blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDAR, AMPAR, and KAR) functions at neonatal age (PD1-PD15) with their respective antagonists D-AP5, GYKI-53655 and UBP-302. We first evaluated memory using a new object recognition test in adults. Second, we evaluated the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and actin with immunohistochemistry in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus and, finally, the number of dendritic spines and their dynamics using Golgi-Cox staining. We found that ionotropic glutamate receptor function blockade at neonatal age causes a reduction in short and long-term memory in adulthood and a reduction in the expression of synaptophysin and actin protein levels in the hippocampus regions studied. This blockade also reduced the number of dendritic spines and modified dendritic dynamics in the CA1 region. The antagonism of the three types of ionotropic glutamate receptors reduced the mushrooms and bifurcated types of spines and increased the thin spines. The number of stubby spines was reduced by D-AP5, increased by UPB-302, and not affected by GYKI-53655. Our results indicate that the blockade of neonatal ionotropic glutamate receptors produces alterations that persist until adulthood.

AB  - Ethical consumerism has been on the rise since the early 1900s; thus, increasing discerning consumers. Consumers place greater importance on intangible attributes such as the origin and societal and environmental impacts of the products. Studies focus on agricultural niche marketing in the South African and sub-Saharan context, but none focus on niche markets within the South African sheep wool industry. In this study, we investigated the niche market for local, handmade and socially responsible wool products in South Africa. Our methodology included interviews, a choice-based conjoint analysis and a multinomial logit model. The results revealed that South African high-income consumers preferred locally produced wool products over imported wool products. This was followed by consumers' preferring handmade over machine-made products as well as socially responsible wool products over those that provided no information on social responsibility. The existence of a niche market in South Africa was demonstrated when consumers preferred ethical wool products. We defined consumers' demographic and psychographic factors for a niche market. The findings can assist the South African wool industry and small-scale woolgrowers to identify niche markets for wool products by considering intangible attributes.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate how PM2.5 exposure affects the microstructure, metabolites or functions of the visual system. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to groups exposed to the filtered air (the control group) or the concentrated ambient PM2.5 (the PM2.5 group). Visual evoked potentials (VEP), electroretinograms (ERG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) were performed. Parameters were obtained and compared between the two groups, including latencies and amplitudes of the P1 wave, N1 wave and P2 wave from VEP, latencies and amplitudes of the a wave and b wave from ERG, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) from DTI, visual cortex (VC) metabolites from 1H-MRS, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) from rsfMRI. Results: Compared with the values of the control group, the PM2.5 group showed a prolonged N1 latency (43.11 +/- 7.94 ms vs. 38.75 +/- 4.60 ms) and lowered P1 amplitude (5.62 +/- 4.38 mu V vs. 8.56 +/- 5.92 mu V) on VEP (all p < 0.05). On ERG, the amplitude of the a wave was lowered (-91.39 +/- 56.29 mu V vs. -138.68 +/- 89.05 mu V), the amplitude of the b wave was lowered (194.38 +/- 126.27 mu V vs. 284.72 +/- 170.99 mu V), and the latency of the b wave was prolonged (37.78 +/- 10.72 ms vs. 33.01 +/- 4.34 ms) than the values of the control group (all p < 0.05). DTI indicated FA increase in the bilateral piriform cortex (Pir), FA decrease in the bilateral somatosensory cortex (S) and the bilateral striatum (Stri), AD decrease in the bilateral VC, the right S and the bilateral Pir, MD decrease in the bilateral Pir, and RD decrease in the bilateral Pir in the PM2.5 mice (all p < 0.05, Alphasim corrected). 1H -MRS showed Glutamate (Glu) increase and Phosphocholine (PCh) increase in the VC of the PM2.5 group than those of the control group (PCh 1.63 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.25; PCh/total creatine(tCr) 0.19 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.03; Glu 10.46 +/- 1.50 vs. 9.60 +/- 1.19; Glu/tcr 1.23 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.11) (all p < 0.05). rsfMRI showed higher ReHo in the PM2.5 mice in the left superior colliculus, the left motor cortex, the hippocampus, the periaqueductal gray and the right mesencephalic reticular formation (all p < 0.01, AlphaSim corrected). Conclusions: This study revealed that PM2.5 exposure triggered visual dysfunction, and altered microstructure, metabolite and function in the retina and visual brain areas along the visual system.

AB  - Brain cholesterol metabolic products include neurosteroids and oxysterols, which play important roles in cellular physiology. In neurons, the cholesterol oxidation product, 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), is a regulator of signaling and transcription. Here, we examined the behavioral effects of 24S-HC loss, using global and cell-selective genetic deletion of the synthetic enzyme CYP46A1. Mice that are globally deficient in CYP46A1 exhibited hypoactivity at young ages and unexpected increases in conditioned fear memory. Despite strong reductions in hippocampal 24S-HC in mice with selective loss of CYP46A1 in VGLUT1-positive cells, behavioral effects were not recapitulated in these conditional knockout mice. Global knockout produced strong, developmentally dependent transcriptional effects on select cholesterol metabolism genes. These included paradoxical changes in Liver X Receptor targets. Again, conditional knockout was insufficient to recapitulate most changes. Overall, our results highlight the complex effects of 24S-HC in an in vivo setting that are not fully predicted by known mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that the complete inhibition of enzymatic activity may be needed for a detectable, therapeutically relevant impact on gene expression and behavior.

AB  - Epilepsy, marked by abnormal and excessive brain neuronal activity, is linked to the activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCCs) in neuronal membranes. LTCCs facilitate the entry of calcium (Ca2+) and other metal ions, such as zinc (Zn2+) and magnesium (Mg2+), into the cytosol. This Ca2+ influx at the presynaptic terminal triggers the release of Zn2+ and glutamate to the postsynaptic terminal. Zn2+ is then transported to the postsynaptic neuron via LTCCs. The resulting Zn2+ accumulation in neurons significantly increases the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits, contributing to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neuronal death. Amlodipine (AML), typically used for hypertension and coronary artery disease, works by inhibiting LTCCs. We explored whether AML could mitigate Zn2+ translocation and accumulation in neurons, potentially offering protection against seizure-induced hippocampal neuronal death. We tested this by establishing a rat epilepsy model with pilocarpine and administering AML (10 mg/kg, orally, daily for 7 days) post-epilepsy onset. We assessed cognitive function through behavioral tests and conducted histological analyses for Zn2+ accumulation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death. Our findings show that AML's LTCC inhibition decreased excessive Zn2+ accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and hippocampal neuronal death following seizures. These results suggest amlodipine's potential as a therapeutic agent in seizure management and mitigating seizures' detrimental effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Castration of male piglets without anaesthesia is facing increasing rejection in society and is also questionable for animal welfare reasons. In this study, the intranasal application of azaperone, azaperone combined with alfaxalone and azaperone combined with midazolam in various doses was tested for its suitability to ensure adequate sedation in combination with intratesticular local anaesthesia during the surgical castration of male piglets. Compared to intramuscular application, intranasal application consistently showed a poorer quality of sedation. Therefore, the intranasal application method cannot be recommended.Abstract The aim of this study was to test the intranasal administration of different anaesthetics in piglets less than seven days of age undergoing castration for their suitability for providing good-quality sedation and short induction and recovery time with minimal stress. Azaperone alone at a high (5 mg/kg), medium (3 mg/kg) and low dosage (2 mg/kg) and in two combinations with either alfaxalone or midazolam were applied intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally (i.n.) to 120 healthy piglets. Compared to intramuscular application, intranasal application showed longer induction times, shorter recovery times and higher scores for defence and vocalisation. In conclusion, the intranasal protocols did not meet the requirements in all groups and their use can therefore not be recommended. A rapid induction phase and good quality of sedation could not be guaranteed.

AB  - Theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus have been hypothesized to play a role in the encoding and retrieval of memories. Recently, it was shown that an intrinsic fast gamma mechanism in medial entorhinal cortex can be recruited by optogenetic stimulation at theta frequencies, which can persist with fast excitatory synaptic transmission blocked, suggesting a contribution of interneuronal network gamma (ING). We calibrated the passive and active properties of a 100-neuron model network to capture the range of passive properties and frequency/current relationships of experimentally recorded PV+ neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). The strength and probabilities of chemical and electrical synapses were also calibrated using paired recordings, as were the kinetics and short-term depression (STD) of the chemical synapses. Gap junctions that contribute a noticeable fraction of the input resistance were required for synchrony with hyperpolarizing inhibition; these networks exhibited theta-nested high frequency oscillations similar to the putative ING observed experimentally in the optogenetically-driven PV-ChR2 mice. With STD included in the model, the network desynchronized at frequencies above similar to 200 Hz, so for sufficiently strong drive, fast oscillations were only observed before the peak of the theta. Because hyperpolarizing synapses provide a synchronizing drive that contributes to robustness in the presence of heterogeneity, synchronization decreases as the hyperpolarizing inhibition becomes weaker. In contrast, networks with shunting inhibition required non-physiological levels of gap junctions to synchronize using conduction delays within the measured range.
   Author summary
   Fast oscillations nested within slower oscillations have been hypothesized to play a role in the encoding and retrieval of memories by chunking information within each fast cycle; networks of parvalbumin positive inhibitory interneurons contribute to the generation of fast oscillations. We show that, in the entorhinal cortex, the intrinsic dynamical properties of these neurons are sufficiently heterogeneous that electrical synapses are likely required to synchronize fast oscillations. Moreover, synchrony likely requires the chemical synapses to have a reversal potential that is negative relative to the action potential threshold of individual neurons during these oscillations. We show that the range of slow phases that support a fast oscillation is controlled by short term synaptic depression.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Animal production has an impact on environmental issues, like global warming. Reducing the protein level in animal feed has the potential to decrease fecal and urinary nitrogen excretion and consequently reduces the environmental nitrogen load. The usage of crystalline L-valine is a potential solution to maintain growth performance of piglets when feeding low protein diets. Aim of this study was to determine the optimal valine requirement in weaned piglets. Therefore, 200 weaned piglets were allotted to five feeding groups and received diets with consecutive increasing amounts of L-valine. The supplementation of L-valine to a valine-deficient basal diet led to an increase in growth and feed intake of weaned piglets. Supplementary valine has the potential to decrease the amount of excess dietary nitrogen, namely through meeting valine requirements via supplementary valine instead of increasing dietary crude protein content.
   The optimal digestible (d) Valine (Val) to d Lysine (Lys) ratio (dVal:dLys) in weaned piglets was determined using two different regression models. A total of 200 piglets were allotted to five feeding groups and fed a corn-soybean meal based basal diet supplemented with consecutive increasing amounts of crystalline L-valine in order to reach dVal:dLys of 0.59, 0.63, 0.67, 0.71, 0.75 in the pre-starter (0-13 days) and 0.57, 0.62, 0.66, 0.70, 0.75 in the starter phase (13-43 days). In the starter phase and during the whole period, supplementing the basal diet with L-valine resulted in an improvement in body weight gain and feed intake. An exponential asymptotic (EA) and a curvilinear-plateau (CLP) regression model were fit to feed intake and body weight gain data. The estimated dVal:dLys for body weight gain was found to be 0.68 (EA, 95% of maximum response) and 0.67 (CLP) in the starter phase and 0.65 (EA, 95% of maximum response and CLP) in the total trial period. It is concluded that the supplementation of a valine-deficient basal diet for weaned piglets with L-valine improves the piglet's weight gain and feed intake and that a dVal:dLys of 0.68 is recommended to optimize body weight gain.

AB  - Since salivary chromogranin A (CgA) is one of the known sympathetic adrenomedullar system (SAM) stress markers in humans and pigs, this study aimed to investigate whether salivary CgA in dogs reflects SAM activation. Our hypothesis was that salivary CgA would increase when central noradrenaline was pharmacologically induced. A selective noradrenaline transporter blocker, atomoxetine, was orally administered without causing any aversive responses in nine laboratory dogs to see if it would increase salivary CgA. Three treatment groups (i.e., atomoxetine, placebo, and pre-administration of a selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist (dexmedetomidine) followed by atomoxetine) were prepared with a randomized crossover design. Saliva sample collection, heart rate measurement and behavior observation were performed at Time 0 (baseline) and at 30, 60, 90 and 150 min after each treatment administration. The results demonstrated that salivary CgA significantly increased at 90 min in the atomoxetine treatment (p < 0.05), whereas it was not observed in the other two treatments. The present study showed that salivary CgA was increased by atomoxetine-induced SAM activation. However, this increase was blocked if dexmedetomidine was pre-administered. Overall, the results indicate that salivary CgA is a potential candidate for SAM-mediated stress markers in dogs. Further study to determine the dynamics of salivary CgA will be helpful in its practical use.

AB  - BACKGROUNDHemp seeds are highly nutritious and a sustainable source of protein and omega-fatty acids. The outer shell of the seeds restricts its utilization in the food industry. Dehulling of the seeds leads to a lot of processing losses due to high oil content and hard shell of the seed. Therefore, in the present study, hydrothermal treatment of the hemp seeds (Cannabis sativa L.) before dehulling was proposed to reduce the endosperm breakage and improve dehulling yield of seeds. RESULTThe hemp seeds were subjected to four types of treatments, namely moisture addition (at 14%) with tempering for 10 min and 60 min followed by drying (28-30 degrees C) and steaming at atmospheric pressure for 5 min and 10 min. Results from the study showed that the hydrothermal treatments impacted the hardness of the endosperm and therefore improved the dehulling yield by 1.3 to 1.5 folds. Also, the dehulling losses significantly reduced from 26.80% to 9.52% after the steaming treatments. Though steaming to some extent affected the colour of the dehulled seeds compared to other treatments, it showed an increment in protein digestibility from 86.53% to 88.73%. CONCLUSIONAmong all the hydrothermal treatments, steaming showed significant improvement in the yield of dehulled hemp seeds. It reduced endosperm breakage without affecting the seeds' fatty acid profile and nutritional quality. It can be concluded that steaming as a pretreatment can be used for improved dehulling of hemp seeds, aiding the better valourization of hemp seeds in the food industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) was introduced into Canada in the early 2000s. This plant bears fruits with high commercial value in other countries due to its premium oil. Nevertheless, sea buckthorn berries are also a rich source of bioactives with nutraceutical potential, especially the variety grown in Newfoundland (Canada), which has not previously been characterized. As such, this study evaluated the composition of polyphenols in sea buckthorn pomace and seeds, as well as their prospective health-promoting effects. RESULTS: Polyphenolic identification by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet-mass spectrometry-time of flight revealed the presence of 24 compounds in the seeds and 16 compounds in the pomace, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins, with ellagic acid derivative IV (pomace, 52.13 mu g g(-1)) and (+)-catechin (seeds, 690.8 mu g g(-1)) being the most dominant. Sea buckthorn extracts displayed in vitro antidiabetic and anti-obesity potential by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase (71.52-99.31%) and pancreatic lipase (15.80-35.61%) enzymes, respectively. The extracts also protected low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (50.97-89.67%) and supercoiled DNA (35.11-79.84%) from oxidative damage. CONCLUSION: Sea buckthorn berries grown in Canada showed promising health benefits induced by their rich and diverse polyphenolic profile and need to be considered for further commercial expansion as a bioactive-loaded superfruit.

AB  - Background: Curzerene, a bioactive compound from Curcuma zedoaria, exhibits anticancer effects, but its role in gastric precancerous lesions remains poorly understood. This study investigates the potential of Curzerene in inhibiting gastric precancerous lesions progression by regulating the long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) AFAP1-AS1 and the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Methods: In vitro, a gastric precancerous cell model (MC cells) was established by treating GES-1 cells with MNNG. The effects of Curzerene on cell proliferation, migration, and EMT were assessed using CCK-8, scratch assays, RT-PCR, and Western blot. In vivo, a gastric precancerous mouse model was induced by MNU, and the therapeutic effects of Curzerene (14 mg/kg and 28 mg/kg) were evaluated through histological and molecular analysis. Results: Curzerene treatment significantly inhibited MC cell proliferation, migration, and EMT, downregulating LncRNA AFAP1-AS1 and YAP while upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating N-cadherin. In vivo, Curzerene alleviated gastric mucosal damage, reduced cancer markers (P53 and CD133), and improved histopathology. Transcriptomic analysis identified the Hippo/YAP pathway as a key mediator of Curzerene's effects. YAP activation reversed Curzerene's inhibitory effects on EMT, confirming the involvement of this pathway. Conclusion: Curzerene effectively inhibits gastric precancerous lesion progression by targeting the YAP signaling and the following LncRNA AFAP1-AS1 to suppress EMT. These findings suggest Curzerene's novel potential as a promising therapeutic agent for early intervention and prevention of gastric cancer.

AB  - Occlusal disharmony has been reported to be affected not only by cytokine and steroid hormone secretion and sympathetic activation in peripheral organs, but also by neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system. However, little is known about whether occlusal disharmony can decrease cognitive ability. We hypothesized that hyperocclusion decreases cognition via Alzheimer's disease-associated molecule expression in the brain. The present study is aimed to elucidate the relationships among occlusal disharmony, cytokine and cognitive-regulated molecule expression in the brain, and the impairment of learning and memory cognition.
   We examined the effect of hyperocclusion on the relationships among cytokine expression, cognitive suppressor molecules in the hippocampus, and cognition in behavior using a hyperocclusion mouse model. Hyperocclusion dramatically increased interleukin-1 beta expression in the serum and hippocampus 1 week after hyperocclusal loading in 2-month-old mice, but no effects in 12-month-old mice. The social and long-term cognitive abilities of the 2-month-old mice were transiently downregulated close to the level of the 12-month-old mice 1 week after hyperocclusion and recovered to close to basal level via the expression of cognitive suppressor clearing proteins. The expression levels of amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau were significantly upregulated 1 week after hyperocclusal loading in the hippocampus of 2-month-old mice but were constant in 12-month-old mice. Occlusal disharmony-induced interleukin-1 beta expression may contribute to accumulation of cognitive suppressor molecules such as amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau and activate their clearance proteins, resulting in protection against transient dementia in young but not older individuals.

AB  - Mitochondrial function is essential for synaptic function. ATAD1, an AAA+ protease involved in mitochondrial quality control, governs fission-fusion dynamics within the organelle. However, the distribution and functional role of ATAD1 in neurons remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ATAD1 is primarily localized to mitochondria in dendrites and, to a lesser extent, in spines in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that ATAD1 deficiency disrupts the mitochondrial fission-fusion balance, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation. This deficiency also impairs dendritic branching, hinders dendritic spine maturation, and reduces glutamatergic synaptic transmission in hippocampal neuron. To further investigate the underlying mechanism, we employed an ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutant of ATAD1 to rescue the neuronal deficits associated with ATAD1 loss. We discovered that the synaptic deficits are independent of the mitochondrial morphology changes but rely on its ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, we show that ATAD1 loss leads to impaired mitochondrial function, including decreased ATP production, impaired membrane potential, and elevated oxidative stress. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that ATAD1 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and regulating neurodevelopment and synaptic function.

AB  - Anxiety and depression exhibit high comorbidity and share the alteration of the amygdala-hippocampal-prefrontal network, playing different roles in the ventral and dorsal hippocampi. Deep brain stimulation of the infralimbic cortex in rodents or the human equivalent-the subgenual cingulate cortex-constitutes a fast antidepressant treatment. The aim of this work was: (1) to describe the oscillatory profile in a rodent model of anxiety, and (2) to deepen the therapeutic basis of infralimbic deep brain stimulation in mood disorders. First, the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 was administered to anaesthetized rats to characterize neural oscillations within the amygdala and the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus. Next, deep brain stimulation was applied. FG-7142 administration drastically reduced the slow waves, increasing delta, low theta, and beta oscillations in the network. Moreover, FG-7142 altered communication in these bands in selective subnetworks. Deep brain stimulation of the infralimbic cortex reversed most of these FG-7142 effects. Cross-frequency coupling was also inversely modified by FG-7142 and by deep brain stimulation. Our study demonstrates that the hyperactivated amygdala-hippocampal network associated with the anxiogenic drug exhibits an oscillatory fingerprint. The study contributes to comprehending the neurobiological basis of anxiety and the effects of infralimbic deep brain stimulation.

AB  - Western diets high in sugars and saturated fats have been reported to induce metabolic and inflammatory impairments that are associated with several age-related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is associated with metabolic and inflammatory outcomes that contribute to risks for AD and T2D, with the APOE4 genotype increasing risks relative to the more common APOE3 allele. In this study, we investigated the impacts of the APOE genotype on systemic and neural effects of the Western diet. Female mice with knock-in of human APOE3 or APOE4 were exposed to control or Western diet for 13 weeks. In the control diet, we observed that APOE4 mice presented with impaired metabolic phenotypes, exhibiting greater adiposity, higher plasma leptin and insulin levels, and poorer glucose clearance than APOE3 mice. Behaviorally, APOE4 mice exhibited worse performance in a hippocampal-dependent learning task. In visceral adipose tissue, APOE4 mice exhibited generally higher expression levels of macrophage- and inflammation-related genes. The cerebral cortex showed a similar pattern, with higher expression of macrophage- and inflammation-related genes in APOE4 than APOE3 mice. Exposure to the Western diet yielded modest, statistically non-significant effects on most metabolic, behavioral, and gene expression measures in both APOE genotypes. Interestingly, the Western diet resulted in reduced gene expression of a few macrophage markers, specifically in APOE4 mice. The observed relative resistance to the Western diet suggests protective roles of both female sex and young adult age. Further, the data demonstrate that APOE4 is associated with deleterious systemic and neural phenotypes and an altered response to a metabolic stressor, findings relevant to the understanding of interactions between the APOE genotype and risks for metabolic disorders.

AB  - Most flexible human-machine interfaces emulate the tactile system of the skin, which has the risk of contact damage. Additionally, contact deformation often leads to a hysteresis response. Non-contact interaction can address these problems. Inspired by the electroreception capabilities of the elephantnose fish, this study introduces a non-contact sensing model employing monopolar controlled ionic hydrogel. Compared to most existing mutual capacitive non-contact sensing models, this model not only boosts responsivity by over 3.5 times but also streamlines the sensing architecture. Utilizing this sensing model, a flexible non-contact human-machine interface is developed by organizing three differently shaped hydrogels into an asymmetric configuration. This device reliably discerns six non-contact gestures using machine learning algorithms and supports at least eleven interactive functions by detecting the duration of gestures, enabling continuous real-time control over external devices. This advancement heralds a more liberated paradigm of human-machine interaction with promising implications for the Internet of Things.
   Most tactile human-machine interfaces are prone to deformation hysteresis and contact damage. To address these issues, a bioinspired non-contact sensing model using monopolar controlled ionic hydrogel is proposed, enhancing responsivity while simplifying the sensor structure. The equivalent circuit and empirical formula for this sensing model are derived, facilitating gesture recognition and advancing the development of flexible non-contact human-machine interfaces. image

AB  - Background: Dysphagia is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals as biofeedback training exercises might offer a promising path to improving swallowing function. The Rephagia biofeedback system uses sEMG to assess muscle strength, stamina, and timing of the swallowing action. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the Rephagia system in ICU patients with dysphagia. Methods: This feasibility study included patients admitted to a 14-bed mixed medical-surgical ICU. All patients underwent a new tracheostomy placement during ICU stay due to persistent aspiration and ICU-acquired weakness, accompanied by verified dysphagia. Following Rephagia training, patients completed a questionnaire assessing comprehension, satisfaction, and motivation. Swallowing characteristics were assessed via mean sEMG peak values during exercise. Results: Twenty patients with a mean age of 69.4 (SD 8.2) years were included. The means of sEMG values at the beginning of a measurement were not significantly different at baseline versus everyone's last measurement (52 mu V [23 mu V] vs 57 mu V [22 mu V]; P=.50). The means of sEMG values obtained at the end of a measurement were not significantly different at baseline versus everyone's last measurement (56 mu V [18 mu V] vs 59 mu V [23 mu V]; P=.62). However, dysphagia improved in all patients. Patients understood the importance of the game in relation to their swallowing problems (16/80, 89%), which kept them motivated to participate in the training sessions (9/18, 50%). Conclusions: The Rephagia biofeedback system for stimulating swallowing actions in tracheotomized ICU patients with dysphagia is feasible. No relation was found between clinical improvement in swallowing function and sEMG signals.

AB  - Contradictory results were obtained regarding the effects of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes (EXOs) on diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). Some studies showed that EXOs, including milk EXOs, were involved in the pathogenesis of DN, whereas other studies revealed ameliorative effects. Compared to other animals, camel milk had unique components that lower blood glucose levels. However, little is known regarding the effect of camel milk and its EXOs on DN. Thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate this effect on a rat model of DN induced by streptozotocin. Treatment with camel milk and/or its EXOs ameliorated DN as evidenced by (1) reduced levels of kidney function parameters (urea, creatinine, retinol-binding protein (RBP), and urinary proteins), (2) restored redox balance (decreased lipid peroxide malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of antioxidants enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), (3) downregulated expression of DN-related genes (transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1), intercellular adhesion molecules 1 (ICAM1), and transformation specific 1 (ETS1), integrin subunit beta 2 (ITG beta 2), tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1)), and (4) decreased renal damage histological score. These results concluded that the treatment with camel milk and/or its EXOs could ameliorate DN with a better effect for the combined therapy.

AB  - During coevolution, plants produce numerous toxic secondary metabolites to protect themselves. However, most plants still serve as food for insects to meet their nutritional needs. The evolutionary processes that enable herbivorous insects to resist plant defenses remain largely complex and difficult to predict. In this study, lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) was identified for the first time in Aphis gossypii. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the LPH protein belongs to the glycoside hydrolase 1 (GH1) family. The qPCR showed that the transcript level of LPH in cotton aphids treated with the expression dsAgCYP6CY3 cotton lines was significantly reduced by 39.9% at 48 h compared to the nontransgenic cotton, and the hydrolytic activities of LPH on lactose and phlorizin were significantly reduced by 28.7% and 20.1%, respectively. In vitro enzyme activity experiments demonstrated that LPH could hydrolyze lactose and four phenolic glycosides. In addition, RNA interference (RNAi) and insect performance assays showed that silencing LPH affected the growth of the larvae, resulting in the death of the larvae exposed to phenolic glycosides. These results reveal an evolutionary scenario whereby herbivores use deglycosylation to develop resistance to plant defenses and this can be exploited for plant protection.

AB  - P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) regulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression/activity in response to various harmful insults. Since P2X7R deletion paradoxically decreases the basal glutathione (GSH) level in the mouse hippocampus, it is likely that P2X7R may increase the demand for GSH for the maintenance of the intracellular redox state or affect other antioxidant defense systems. Therefore, the present study was designed to elucidate whether P2X7R affects nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activity/expression and GSH synthesis under nitrosative stress in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. In the present study, P2X7R deletion attenuated iNOS upregulation and Nrf2 degradation induced by LPS. Compatible with iNOS induction, P2X7R deletion decreased S-nitrosylated (SNO)-cysteine production under physiological and post-LPS treated conditions. P2X7R deletion also ameliorated the decreases in GSH, glutathione synthetase, GS and ASCT2 levels concomitant with the reduced S-nitrosylations of GS and ASCT2 following LPS treatment. Furthermore, LPS upregulated cystine:glutamate transporter (xCT) and glutaminase in P2X7R(+/+) mice, which were abrogated by P2X7R deletion. LPS did not affect GCLC level in both P2X7R(+/+) and P2X7R(-/-) mice. Therefore, our findings indicate that P2X7R may augment LPS-induced neuroinflammation by leading to Nrf2 degradation, aberrant glutamate-glutamine cycle and impaired cystine/cysteine uptake, which would inhibit GSH biosynthesis. Therefore, we suggest that the targeting of P2X7R, which would exert nitrosative stress with iNOS in a positive feedback manner, may be one of the important therapeutic strategies of nitrosative stress under pathophysiological conditions.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically important pathogen of swine, causing severe diarrhea in neonates with high morbidity and mortality. Vaccination is a key strategy for PEDV control, but optimizing regimens based on herd status is essential for improving immunity and protection. This study evaluated immune responses to different vaccination protocols using a PED replicon vaccine (PED-RP) in Thai swine farms with varying PED statuses. Two field trials were conducted: Experiment 1 (n = 120) on a PED-negative farm used a killed vaccine followed by PED-RP, while Experiment 2 (n = 42) on a PED-positive farm used a modified-live vaccine (MLV) followed by PED-RP. In Experiment 1, gilts boosted with PED-RP during gestation showed significantly higher colostrum IgA levels compared to those receiving two doses of the killed vaccine. In Experiment 2, priming with MLV followed by PED-RP resulted in increased neutralizing antibody titers and seropositivity, outperforming the MLV-only regimen after acclimatization. These findings suggest that using PED-RP as a booster can enhance serum and lactogenic immunity, providing a promising strategy for improving immune responses in both PED-negative and PED-positive herds. The study highlights the importance of tailored vaccination strategies to optimize herd immunity and protect piglets from PEDV.

AB  - Tea is the most consumed beverage worldwide, and L-theanine in tea leaves significantly affects their flavor and market quality. We have developed and validated a fast and reliable gas chromatographic method with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) to quantify L-theanine after its extraction from Camellia sinensis (tea plant) and derivatization. The procedure was completed in 40 min, from extraction to chromatographic analysis, with a recovery rate of more than 93% and allowing a high sample throughput. The GC-FID intraday precision was within 0.57-2.28%, while the interday precision ranged from 1.57 to 13.48%. The intraday accuracy ranged from -6.84 to 5.26%, while the interday accuracy ranged from -1.08 to 3.12%. The limit of detection was 2.28 mu g/mL, and the limit of quantification was 6.47 mu g/mL. The GC-FID method was validated by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UV) and was used to investigate the biosynthesis and regulation of L-theanine in tea plants. We found that plants fed with ethylamine significantly increased L-theanine concentrations in roots, while exogenous supplementation of glutamic acid, carbamide, and glutamine did not significantly affect the L-theanine level in roots. Our results also indicated that roots were not indispensable for the biosynthesis of L-theanine, which was detected in undifferentiated embryonic calluses in concentrations (g/100 g dry weight) as high as in leaves of whole plants (1.67 and 1.57%, respectively) and without any exogenous theanine precursor supplementation.

AB  - Hypericin, one of the major antidepressant constituents of St. John's wort, was shown to exert antidepressant effects by affecting cerebral CYP enzymes, serotonin homeostasis, and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways. However, its exact mechanisms are unknown. Previous clinical studies reported that the mRNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) interferes with the neurobiological mechanism in depressed patients, and it was also found that the antidepressant efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) is related to m6A modifications. Therefore, we hypothesize that the antidepressant effect of hypericin may relate to the m6A modification of epitranscriptomic regulation. We constructed a UCMS mouse depression model and found that hypericin ameliorated depressive-like behavior in UCMS mice. Molecular pharmacology experiments showed that hypericin treatment upregulated the expression of m6A-modifying enzymes METTL3 and WTAP in the hippocampi of UCMS mice. Next, we performed MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq to study m6A modifications and changes in mRNA expression on a genome-wide scale. The genome-wide m6A assay and MeRIP-qPCR results revealed that the m6A modifications of Akt3, Ntrk2, Braf, and Kidins220 mRNA were significantly altered in the hippocampi of UCMS mice after stress stimulation and were reversed by hypericin treatment. Transcriptome assays and qPCR results showed that the Camk4 and Arhgdig genes might be related to the antidepressant efficacy of hypericin. Further gene enrichment results showed that the differential genes were mainly involved in neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. In conclusion, our results show that hypericin upregulates m6A methyltransferase METTL3 and WTAP in the hippocampi of UCMS mice and stabilizes m6A modifications to exert antidepressant effects via the neurotrophin signaling pathway. This suggests that METTL3 and WTAP-mediated changes in m6A modifications may be a potential mechanism for the pathogenesis of depression and the efficacy of antidepressants, and that the neurotrophin signaling pathway plays a key role in this process.

AB  - Objectives. To analyze and compare, in an animal model, the treatment of thoracoabdominal aneurysms with multilayer stents and its hemodynamic effects through the biomechanical and histological analysis of the aortic wall in contact with the stent. Methods. Large White pigs were randomized into two groups: Stent (n=6) and Control (n=5, non-stent). All animals were subjected to the creation of a suprarenal aneurysm with a bovine pericardial patch. In the Stent group, a multilayer stent was implanted immediately after aneurysm formation. After four weeks, all animals were subjected to angiographic assessment and intravascular ultrasound, and the stent was explanted before euthanasia for histological and biomechanical analyses. Results. At histological analysis, the groups did not differ significantly in maximum thickness of the intima (p=0.526), media (p=0.129), or adventitia (p=0.662). Thrombus formation was observed in 100% of the animals on the intima and media layers of the stented aorta vs. none in the Control group (p=0.048). At biomechanical analysis, no statistical differences were observed in aortic wall elasticity (p=0.158), strength (p=0.360), or thickness (p=0.323). Conclusion. We identified thrombosis of the aneurysmal sac through the presence of thrombi on the intima of the aorta in 100% of the animals in the Stent group; as for the biomechanical analysis, this study showed no statistical differences in vessel wall thickness, strength, and elasticity between groups.

AB  - Red cabbage anthocyanins may provide health benefits that may be associated with antiaging. The protection of red cabbage anthocyanin-rich extract (ARE) and cyanidin-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside-rich extract (CY3D5G) against age-related cognitive dysfunction was investigated in normal aging mice (male C57BL/6J, 12 months old) administered orally for 12 weeks. Behavioral tests showed that ARE and CY3D5G significantly decreased cognitive impairment (p < 0.05) and had no effect on motor disorder. ARE and CY3D5G increased superoxide dismutase activity by 29.18 and 23.09% and decreased malondialdehyde by 15.74 and 10.05%, respectively, compared to the control. Histological staining showed that ARE and CY3D5G treatment reduced hippocampal neuronal damage and brain-derived neurotrophic factor degeneration. ARE and CY3D5G significantly reduced IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels in serum and brain (p < 0.05) by promoting the MAPK signaling pathway while enriching the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and altering the functional profile of the microbial community. In conclusion, ARE and CY3D5G may attenuate age-related cognitive dysfunction by reducing neuroinflammation and regulating the gut-brain axis.

AB  - Simple Summary Copy number variations (CNVs) are a substantial fraction of the total genetic variability and have a major effect on phenotypic performance by altering gene expression patterns. However, the identification of CNVs remains challenging. Recent studies suggest that CNVs hardly fit with Mendelian segregation patterns and can be classified as segregating (shared by parents and offspring) and non-segregating. Both CNV classes have been hypothesized to be important in explaining between-populations (segregating CNVs) and between-individuals (non-segregating CNVs) differences in performance. Here, we report that the two CNV classes spanned different sets of genes, thus supporting that theory. Copy number variations regions (CNVRs) can be classified either as segregating, when found in both parents, and offspring, or non-segregating. A total of 65 segregating and 31 non-segregating CNVRs identified in at least 10 individuals within a dense pedigree of the Gochu Asturcelta pig breed was subjected to enrichment and functional annotation analyses to ascertain their functional independence and importance. Enrichment analyses allowed us to annotate 1018 and 351 candidate genes within the bounds of the segregating and non-segregating CNVRs, respectively. The information retrieved suggested that the candidate genes spanned by segregating and non-segregating CNVRs were functionally independent. Functional annotation analyses allowed us to identify nine different significantly enriched functional annotation clusters (ACs) in segregating CNVR candidate genes mainly involved in immunity and regulation of the cell cycle. Up to five significantly enriched ACs, mainly involved in reproduction and meat quality, were identified in non-segregating CNVRs. The current analysis fits with previous reports suggesting that segregating CNVRs would explain performance at the population level, whereas non-segregating CNVRs could explain between-individuals differences in performance.

TI  - How in vitro gastrointestinal digestion impacts the phenolic profile and bioactivities of North American sea buckthorn fruit and seeds
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION

KW  - ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY
KW  - BIOACCESSIBILITY
AB  - North American sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) shows great commercial potential as a bioactive-rich fruit. The pomace and seeds of sea buckthorn fruit are rich sources of a variety of polyphenols with promising antioxidant and biological potential. However, the modification of these phenolics through the gastrointestinal tract is unknown and can significantly affect their bioactivities. Therefore, the pomace and seeds of Newfoundland cultivated sea buckthorn were subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal (GI) digestion and their phenolic composition was monitored across oral, gastric, small and large intestine digestion. Moderate phenolic bioaccessibility was recorded for sea buckthorn pomace and seeds, with phenolic release rates of 35.34 and 44.86% after small intestinal digestion. This fraction contained a variety of proanthocyanidins, while phenolic acids and their derivatives were generally released at the earlier oral and gastric digestion. The phenolic profile of sea buckthorn digestion products was considerably different from undigested samples, reflecting on improved rate of inhibition of metabolic enzymes linked to type 2 diabetes and obesity in some cases, as well as oxidative protection to supercoiled DNA against the action of hydroxyl radicals. However, the capacity of samples to protect LDL-cholesterol from oxidative damage was decreased after digestion. These results represent an estimate of physiological effects, pending validation through in vivo human studies. Further research should concentrate on investigating the absorption and transport of polyphenols involved across the human gut by using relevant physiological models.

AB  - Background: A chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model has been proposed as relevant to stress-induced behavioral change in humans. In this study, we examined the effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) on CSDS-induced mood disorders and protein expression in an animal model.
   Methods: To evaluate the effect of KRG on social defeat stress, test mice were exposed in the resident aggressor's home cage compartment for 14 days beginning 1 h after KRG treatment (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, per oral (p.o.)). After the exposure, behavioral tests to measure anxiety, social interaction, and depression-like behavior were performed. To investigate the underlying mechanism, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor expression levels in CSDS-induced mice were evaluated using Western blot analysis.
   Results: CSDS induced anxiety-like behaviors by decreasing central activity in the open-field test and open-arm approach in the elevated plus maze test and led to social avoidance behavior in the social interaction test. CSDS mice showed upregulated NR1, NR2A, and NR2B expression in the hippocampus. KRG 20 and 40 mg/kg ameliorated anxiety-like activities and KRG 20 mg/kg alleviated social avoidance by decreasing time in the corner zone. KRG treatment recovered CSDS-induced NR1, NR2A, and NR2B protein levels in the hippocampus.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that KRG has a therapeutic effect on CSDS-induced mood disorder by alleviating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor overexpression in the hippocampus. (C) 2019 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB  - The mechanisms by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes severe lung inflammation and mortality remain unclear. While the role of alveolar macrophages in COVID-19 is known, data on pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) is lacking. PIMs are key inflammatory cells present in species like cattle and pigs. Though constitutively absent in humans and rodents, their recruitment in rodents triggers exaggerated inflammation. We investigated the recruitment of PIMs and other immune cells, using immunofluorescence, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and immunogold labeling in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Syrian golden hamsters were divided into 6 groups: uninfected control, unvaccinated-infected at 2-, 5-, and 14-days post infection (dpi) and vaccinated-infected at 5- and 14-dpi. Lung tissues were analyzed for neutrophils (myeloperoxidase), monocytes/macrophages (CCR2, CX3CR1), macrophages (IBA-1), and T cells (CD3). Septal macrophages increased at 2-, 5-, and 14-dpi in infected animals vs. control. CX3CR1 + cells decreased at 14-dpi in unvaccinated animals, but CX3CR1/CCR2 double positive cells were higher at 5-dpi, indicating a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. PIMs were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. These are the first data showing recruitment of pro-inflammatory PIMs in SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common and severe epilepsy displaying rhythmicity in humans and animals. However, how the circadian clock contributes to TLE remains elusive. A recent circadian analysis of the ventral hippocampal transcriptome of pilocarpine-induced TLE mice revealed as many as 1650 rhythmically expressed transcripts. Here, a comparison of the mouse ventral hippocampal transcriptome with the human epilepsy-related gene set identified 315 possible mouse epilepsy-related genes. Rhythmicity analysis classified them into arrhythmicity, loss-of-rhythmicity, gain-of-rhythmicity, and rhythmicity-maintaining groups. KEGG and GO analyses of these mouse epilepsy genes suggest their involvement in circadian entrainment. In TLE mice, Htr1d, Drd2, and Chrna3 lose rhythmicity, but P2rx7 gains rhythmicity; the up-regulation of Htr1d and Drd2 and down-regulation of Chrna3 inhibit adenylate cyclase (AC), and up-regulation of Htr1d, Drd2, and P2rx7 activates protein kinase C (PKC). Together, these results suggest that epilepsy can disrupt the circadian dynamics of the epileptic genes, shed light on possible TLE pathogenesis, and provide potential targets for TLE diagnosis and chronotherapy.

AB  - Background The liver plays crucial roles in sepsis and is one of the major targets for sepsis-related injuries. Ferroptosis, a newly emerged form of lytic cell death, has been implicated in sepsis related organ failure. Yes-associated protein1 (YAP1), a key regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, may be involved in ferroptosis development. This study aimed to elucidate the role of YAP1 in septic liver injury through regulating ferroptosis, especially ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis. Results Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models were constructed in control (Yap1(flfl)) and liver-conditional knockout mice (Yap1(fl/fl) Alb-Cre) to induce septic liver injury, while LO2 cells with or without YAP1 overexpression/deletion were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Our study showed YAP1 knockdown aggravated CLP-induced liver injury and inflammation, as well as accelerated hepatocyte ferroptosis, revealed by down-regulated expression of GPX4, FTH1 and SLC7A11, along with up-regulated expression of SFXN1 and NCOA4. Consistently, YAP1 deficiency aggravated LO2 cells ferroptosis, but YAP1 overexpression alleviated LPS-induced LO2 ferritinophagy, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial ROS and Fe2+, along with down-regulated expression of SFXN1 and NCOA4. Further co-IP assay verified that YAP1 disrupted the interaction between NCOA4 and FTH1, thus prevent the degradation of ferritin to Fe2+, further reduced the ROS production and suppressed ferroptosis. Conclusion YAP1 inhibits ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis in hepatocytes, and YAP1 deficiency aggravates sepsis-induced liver injury.

AB  - Simple Summary This research is aimed at studying the effect of lithium ascorbate on increasing the antioxidant status of gestational sows and reducing the level of lipid peroxidation products. The studies were conducted on gestational sows of the Irish Landrace breed. Thirty days after successful insemination, the sows of the experimental groups, E10, E5 and E2, began to receive lithium ascorbate powder together with compound feed in doses of 10, 5, and 2 mg/kg of live weight, respectively. Weighing and biochemical examination were carried out before the introduction of the substance, as well as on the 60th and 110th days of gestation. In the blood plasma of sows, the following were determined: malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, SH/SS ratio, activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The use of lithium ascorbate b caused a significant increase in the level of SH (reduced glutathione) by 21% (p < 0.05), a decrease in the level of SS (oxidized glutathione) by 17% (p < 0.05) and a decrease in the level of malondialdehyde by 60% (p < 0.05). The results obtained cause activation of the antioxidant defense system, reduce the risk of oxidative stress, and have a positive effect on the gestation process. This research is aimed at the influence of different doses of lithium ascorbate on pigs' diet estimation, at farrowing sows' antioxidant status increase, and at lipid peroxidation product level decrease. The research was conducted in farrowing sows of the Irish landrace breed during the second farrow. Three groups of animals were formed, with ten livestock units in each. Thirty days after successful insemination, the sows of the E10, E5 and E2 experimental groups started receiving lithium ascorbate powder together with feed stuff in dosages of 10, 5 and 2 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. Their weighing and biochemical examinations were performed before the substance introduction as well as on the 60th and 110th days of pregnancy. The following were detected in sows' blood plasma: malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, SH/SS ratio, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity. Lithium ascorbate usage during sows' breeding cycle caused a significant increase in SH (reduced glutathione) level by 21% (p < 0.05), SS (oxidized glutathione) level decrease by 17% (p < 0.05), and malondialdehyde level decrease by 60% (p < 0.05). These data outline antioxidant defense system activization, reducing the risk of oxidative stress under the influence of feeding with lithium ascorbate. Lithium ascorbate in dosages of 10 mg/kg per body weight given together with feed stuff shows prominent adaptogene and stress protective features in the most effective way. The research conducted regarding lithium ascorbate usage for farrowing sows can reduce the negative consequences of oxidative stress, increase sows' health preservation level, and contribute to fertility boost.

AB  - Proliferating cells have metabolic dependence on glutamine to fuel anabolic pathways and to refill the mitochondrial carbon pool. The Hippo pathway is essential for coordinating cell survival and growth with nutrient availability, but no molecular connection to glutamine deprivation has been reported. Here, we identify a non-canonical role of YAP, a key effector of the Hippo pathway, in cellular adaptation to perturbation of glutamine metabolism. Whereas YAP is inhibited by nutrient scarcity, enabling cells to restrain proliferation and to maintain energy homeostasis, glutamine shortage induces a rapid YAP dephosphorylation and activation. Upon glutaminolysis inhibition, an increased reactive oxygen species production inhibits LATS kinase via RhoA, leading to YAP dephosphorylation. Activated YAP promotes transcriptional induction of ATF4 to induce the expression of genes involved in amino acid homeostasis, including Sestrin2. We found that YAP-mediated Sestrin2 induction is crucial for cell viability during glutamine deprivation by suppressing mTORC1. Thus, a critical relationship between YAP, ATF4, and mTORC1 is uncovered by our findings. Finally, our data indicate that targeting the Hippo-YAP pathway in combination with glutaminolysis inhibition may provide potential therapeutic approaches to treat tumors.

AB  - Rats demonstrate a preference for smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones, a phenomenon known as delay-discounting (DD). Behavior arises from the interaction of multiple decision-making systems, and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been identified as a central component in the mediation between these decision systems. To investigate the role of the prelimbic (PL) subregion of mPFC on decision strategy interac-tion, we compared two cohorts of rats (ChR2-opsin-expressing 'Active' and opsin-absent 'Control') on a spatial delay-discounting task while delivering in-vivo light stimulation into PL at the choice point of select trials. By analyzing the overall delay-adjustment along with deliberative and procedural behavioral strategy markers, our study revealed differences in the decision strategies used between the active and control animals despite both groups showing similar valuations. Control animals developed the expected shift from deliberative to procedural decision strategy on this task (indicated by reaching delay-stability, particularly during late-session laps); however, active-virus animals repeatedly over-adjusted around their preferred delay throughout the entire session, suggesting a significant deficit in procedural decision-making on this task. Active animals showed a significant decrease in proportion of vicarious trial and error events (VTE, a behavior correlated with deliberative processes) on delay adjustment laps relative to control animals. This points to a more nuanced role for VTE, not just in executing deliberation, but in shifting from deliberative to procedural processes. This opto-induced change in VTE was especially pronounced for late-session adjustment laps. We found no other session-by -session or lap-by-lap effects, leaving a particular role for PL in the long-term development of procedural stra-tegies on this task.

AB  - Context Camel milk is used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes mellitus hypertension and other metabolic disorders. Objective This study evaluated the antisteatotic and antihypertensive effects of camel milk protein hydrolysate (CMH) in high fructose (HF)-fed rats and compared it with the effects afforded by the intact camel milk protein extract (ICM). Materials and methods Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups (n = 8 each) as 1) control, 2) ICM (1000 mg/kg), 3) CMH (1000 mg/kg), 4) HF (15% in drinking water), 5) HF (15%) + ICM (1000 mg/kg), and 6) HF (15%) + CMH (1000 mg/kg). All treatments were given orally for 21 weeks, daily. Results Both ICM and CMH reduced fasting glucose and insulin levels, serum and hepatic levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, and serum levels of ALT and AST, angiotensin II, ACE, endothelin-1, and uric acid in HF-fed rats. In addition, both ICM and CMH reduced hepatic fat deposition in the hepatocytes and reduced hepatocyte damage. This was associated with an increase in the hepatic activity of AMPK, higher PPAR alpha mRNA, reduced expression of fructokinase C, SREBP1, SREBP2, fatty acid synthase, and HMG-CoA-reductase. Both treatments lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, the effects of CMH on all these parameters were greater as compared to ICM. Discussion and conclusions The findings of this study encourage the use of CMH in a large-scale population and clinical studies to treat metabolic steatosis and hypertension.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disease that develops following exposure to a traumatic event and is a stress-associated mental disorder characterized by an imbalance of neuroinflammation. Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) is the herbal supplement that is known to be involved in a variety of pharmacological activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of KRG on neuroinflammation as a potential mechanism involved in single prolonged stress (SPS) that negatively influences memory formation and consolidation and leads to cognitive and spatial impairment by regulating BDNF signaling, synaptic proteins, and the activation of NF-kB.
   Methods: We analyzed the cognitive and spatial memory, and inflammatory cytokine levels during the SPS procedure. SPS model rats were injected intraperitoneally with 20, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day KRG for 14 days.
   Results: KRG administration significantly attenuated the cognitive and spatial memory deficits, as well as the inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus associated with activation of NF-kappa B in the hippocampus induced by SPS. Moreover, the effects of KRG were equivalent to those exerted by paroxetine. In addition, KRG improved the expression of BDNF mRNA and the synaptic protein PSD-95 in the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that KRG exerts memory-improving actions by regulating anti-inflammatory activities and the NF-kappa B and neurotrophic pathway.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that KRG is a potential functional ingredient for protecting against memory deficits in mental diseases, such as PTSD. (C) 2021 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal behaviour is an important indicator of animal welfare. For example, alterations in sitting, standing and walking have been identified as key behavioural indicators of lameness in meat, or broiler, chickens. However, manual behavioural observations are time-consuming and can be limited to small sample sizes and short observation periods which may not appropriately represent the population. Animal-attached devices such as accelerometers can measure an animal's movement and be used to automatically identify behaviours using machine learning. We investigated the potential for a random forest algorithm to classify between sitting, standing and walking behaviour using accelerometer data. The random forest model was able to successfully classify sitting, standing and walking behaviour across four strains of broiler chickens with 92-94% accuracy. Further research should aim to scale-up the use of such random forest models to automatically collect behavioural data and in turn overcome the aforementioned limitations of manual observations. Such a tool would also encourage interdisciplinary research between animal behavioural science and other research fields, thus actioning the principle of animal reduction under the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement).Abstract Behavioural states such as walking, sitting and standing are important in indicating welfare, including lameness in broiler chickens. However, manual behavioural observations of individuals are often limited by time constraints and small sample sizes. Three-dimensional accelerometers have the potential to collect information on animal behaviour. We applied a random forest algorithm to process accelerometer data from broiler chickens. Data from three broiler strains at a range of ages (from 25 to 49 days old) were used to train and test the algorithm, and unlike other studies, the algorithm was further tested on an unseen broiler strain. When tested on unseen birds from the three training broiler strains, the random forest model classified behaviours with very good accuracy (92%) and specificity (94%) and good sensitivity (88%) and precision (88%). With the new, unseen strain, the model classified behaviours with very good accuracy (94%), sensitivity (91%), specificity (96%) and precision (91%). We therefore successfully used a random forest model to automatically detect three broiler behaviours across four different strains and different ages using accelerometers. These findings demonstrated that accelerometers can be used to automatically record behaviours to supplement biomechanical and behavioural research and support in the reduction principle of the 3Rs.

AB  - Worldwide distributed Senecavirus A (SVA) poses a threat to pig herds, while, the role of host factor, zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), in SVA infection is still unidentified. Here, ZAP inhibits replication of SVA by the short isoform (ZAP-S) activating RIG-I signaling pathway and the longer isoform (ZAP-L) targeting viral 3Dpol was reported. Overexpression of ZAP-L and ZAP-S inhibit SVA replication, resulting in enhanced expression of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and related cytokines, and interference expression of ZAP has the opposite effect. Infection experiments in RIG-I-/- cells and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay demonstrated physical interaction between ZAP-S and RIG-I, thereby activating the downstream signaling pathway. Further target protein screen showed that ZAP-L directly interacts with 3Dpol to up-regulate expression of IFN-beta and IL-6. Infection experiments in ZAP-/- mice confirmed the role of ZAP in SVA replication. This extends the range of host factors limiting replication of SVA and provides new data for better understanding the molecular mechanism of ZAP in inhibiting the virus.

KW  - ARABIDOPSIS
AB  - Camelina sativa, a Brassicaceae family crop, is used for fodder, human food, and biofuels. Its relatively high resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, as well as being a climate-resilient oilseed crop, has contributed to its popularity. Camelina 's seed yield and oil contents have been improved using various technologies like RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. A stable transformation system for protein localization and other cell autonomous investigations, on the other hand, is tedious and time consuming. This study describes a transient gene expression protocol for Camelina sativa cultivar DH55 leaves using Agrobacterium strain C58C1. The method is suitable for subcellular protein localization and colocalization studies and can be used with both constitutive and chemically induced genes. We report the subcellular localization of the N -terminal ER membrane signal anchor region (1-32 aa) of the At3G28580 gene-encoded protein from Arabidopsis in intact leaves and the expression and localization of other known organelle markers. This method offers a fast and convenient way to study proteins in the commercially important Camelina crop system.

AB  - This study assessed the feasibility of in vivo embryo production and nonsurgical embryo recovery (NSER) in Morada Nova ewes (an endangered native Brazilian breed of sheep) subjected to different estrus synchronization and/or superovulation protocols. Ewes received intravaginal sponges soaked with 60 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP), which were kept in place for six (G6; n = 12), nine (G9; n = 12), or 12 (G12; n = 12) days. Half of the ewes in each group remained estrus synchronized only ((SYNCH)) and the other half was superovulated ((SOV)) with 133 mg porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH). There were no differences (p > 0.05) in antral follicle counts determined with ultrasonography 60 hours before MAP sponge removal (or at the time of the first pFSH dose) among G6 (6.4 +/- 0.9), G9 (6.2 +/- 0.7), and G12 (5.5 +/- 0.6). Estrus responses and NSER success rates did not vary (p > 0.05) among the three progestin-treatment groups of ewes for either estrus-induced or superovulated animals. The onset of estrus occurred 10-12 hours later (p < 0.01) in G9(SYNCH) ewes compared with G6(SYNCH) and G12(SYNCH,) and the duration of estrus was similar to 19 hours greater (p < 0.01) in G9(SOV) than in G6(SOV). The average duration of the NSER procedure was 32.6 +/- 1.3 minutes. At least one structure was recovered in 85.7% of synchronized and in 87.5% of superovulated ewes. Viable embryo recovery rates were also similar (p > 0.05) for G6 (1.0 +/- 0.3 and 2.5 +/- 1.5), G9 (1.3 +/- 0.5 and 4.8 +/- 2.0), and G12 groups (1.0 +/- 0.3 and 4.8 +/- 2.3; estrus-synchronized and superovulated ewes, respectively). In conclusion, progestogen pretreatment of different durations and NSER can be employed in Morada Nova ewes, resulting in reasonable viable embryo recovery rates in both estrus-synchronized and superovulated animals. Therefore, both techniques are suitable for use in commercial settings as well as small ruminant conservation programs.

AB  - Information derived from experiences is incorporated into the brain as changes to ensembles of cells, termed engram cells, which allow memory storage and recall. The mechanism by which those changes hold specific information is unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that the specific synaptic wiring between engram cells is the substrate of information storage. First, we monitor how learning modifies the connectivity pattern between engram cells at a monosynaptic connection involving the hippocampal ventral CA1 (vCA1) region and the amygdala. Then, we assess the functional significance of these connectivity changes by artificially activating or inhibiting its presynaptic and postsynaptic components, respectively. Finally, we identify a synaptic plasticity mechanism mediated by postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), which impacts the connectivity pattern among engram cells and contributes to the long-term stability of the memory. These findings impact our theory of learning and memory by helping us explain the translation of specific information into engram cells and how these connections shape brain function.

AB  - The X-chromosome-linked cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), a glycoprotein mainly expressed by neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems, has been implicated in many neural processes, including neuronal migration and survival, neuritogenesis, synapse formation, synaptic plasticity and regeneration. L1 consists of extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Proteolytic cleavage of L1's extracellular and transmembrane domains by different proteases generates several L1 fragments with different functions. We found that myelin basic protein (MBP) cleaves L1's extracellular domain, leading to enhanced neuritogenesis and neuronal survival in vitro. To investigate in vivo the importance of the MBP-generated 70 kDa fragment (L1-70), we generated mice with an arginine to alanine substitution at position 687 (L1/687), thereby disrupting L1's MBP cleavage site and obliterating L1-70. Young adult L1/687 males showed normal anxiety and circadian rhythm activities but enhanced locomotion, while females showed altered social interactions. Older L1/687 males were impaired in motor coordination. Furthermore, L1/687 male and female mice had a larger hippocampus, with more neurons in the dentate gyrus and more proliferating cells in the subgranular layer, while the thickness of the corpus callosum and the size of lateral ventricles were normal. In summary, subtle mutant morphological changes result in subtle behavioral changes.

AB  - Background: The gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) has been implicated in the development of cardiac fibrosis. Our previous findings revealed that Cx43 dephosphorylation at serine 282 (S282) is related to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and arrhythmias in hearts damaged by ischemia/reperfusion. In this study, we investigated the role of Cx43 S282 phosphorylation in cardiac fibrosis. Methods: We used angiotensin II (Ang II) intervention in mice to establish an in vivo cardiac fibrosis model and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) intervention in cardiac myofibroblasts to establish an in vitro fibrosis model. The expression of Cx43 S282 phosphorylation was examined in the in vivo and in vitro models. To further confirm the effect of Cx43 S282 phosphorylation on cardiac fibrosis, we transfected cardiac myofibroblasts with lentiviral bodies in vitro, and injected myocardium with adenovirus in vivo to establish the over-expression of phosphorylation of Cx43 S282 locus and mutant groups. We sequenced the mRNA of the in vitro group using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and normalized enrichment scoring (NES) to investigate the signaling pathway by which p282-Cx43 affects myocardial fibrosis (MF). The role of the Hippo signaling pathway in phosphorylation at the Cx43 282 site was further validated. Results: In an in vivo and in vitro model of cardiac fibrosis, the level of phosphorylation of Cx43 S282 was reduced. Mutation of Cx43 S282 to a less phosphorylatable form (S282A) resulted in elevated levels of fibrosis markers, suggesting a critical antifibrotic role for phosphorylated Cx43 S282. Increased phosphorylation of Cx43 S282 produced an inhibitory effect on fibrosis. Enrichment analysis of mRNA sequencing in the mutant model group indicated that the Hippo signaling pathway was involved in the fibrosis process. Cx43 S282 phosphorylation increased the expression of Dchs1 gene, which activates the phosphorylation of yes-associated protein (YAP) and inhibits the YAP/TEAD signaling pathway to inhibit fibrosis development. Conclusions: This study suggests that the phosphorylation of Cx43 S282 could be an effective antifibrotic target in cardiac fibroblasts. This indicates a novel mechanism and a molecular target that may hold promise for treating cardiac fibrosis.

AB  - Super-enhancers (SEs) govern the expression of genes defining cell identity. However, the dynamic landscape of SEs and their critical constituent enhancers involved in skeletal muscle development remains unclear. In this study, using pig as a model, we employed cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) to profile the enhancer-associated histone modification marker H3K27ac in skeletal muscle across two prenatal and three postnatal stages, and investigated how SEs influence skeletal muscle development. We identify three SE families with distinct temporal dynamics: continuous (Con, 397), transient (TS, 434), and de novo (DN, 756). These SE families are associated with different temporal gene expression trajectories, biological functions, and DNA methylation levels. Notably, several lines of evidence suggest a potential prominent role of Con SEs in regulating porcine muscle development and meat traits. To pinpoint key cis-regulatory units in Con SEs, we developed an integrative approach that leverages information from eRNA annotation, genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, and high-throughput capture self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) experiments. Within Con SEs, we identify 20 candidate critical enhancers with meat and carcass-associated DNA variations that affect enhancer activity, and infer their upstream transcription factors and downstream target genes. As a proof of concept, we experimentally validate the role of one such enhancer and its potential target gene during myogenesis. Our findings reveal the dynamic regulatory features of SEs in skeletal muscle development and provide a general integrative framework for identifying critical enhancers underlying the formation of complex traits.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Numerous animal welfare schemes have been developed aiming to improve animal welfare on a voluntary basis beyond legal regulations. The success of these schemes depends decisively on whether the design of these schemes is attractive to livestock farmers and, as a result, whether they are willing to participate and thus to implement the animal welfare measures regulated in these schemes. In this study, we investigated German livestock farmers' preferences regarding the design of animal welfare schemes with a choice experiment. Farmers were asked to select their most preferred alternative among animal welfare schemes that differed in the specifications of the following four attributes: basis for remuneration (i.e., type of animal welfare measures to be implemented), commitment period, funding agency and compensation level. The basis for remuneration and the compensation level had the greatest influence on farmers' decisions. The commitment period also affected farmers' decisions. Independent of the livestock species kept, farmers preferred animal health as basis for remuneration, the higher compensation level and the longer commitment period. These findings could be incorporated into the development and refinement of animal welfare programs to make them more attractive to farmers and thus increase their willingness to participate.
   As more animal welfare is required in livestock farming, several approaches have been developed to improve the well-being of farmed animals on a voluntary basis. Since farmers' acceptance is important for the success of these approaches, their preferences should be considered when developing farm animal welfare programs. We used choice based conjoint analysis to investigate the preferences of 242 German livestock farmers (147 cattle farmers; 95 pig farmers) regarding the design of farm animal welfare programs. The conditional logit regression models show that the measures serving as basis for remuneration and the compensation level were of decisive importance for the farmers' choices. The most preferred measure for assessing animal welfare, and thus as the basis for remuneration, was animal health. As expected, a higher compensation level led to greater acceptance of an animal welfare approach. The commitment period was only of subordinate importance with the longer commitment period being preferred. Our study outlines aspects of farm animal welfare programs that might encourage farmers to participate in these programs. Future programs could consider our findings by emphasising health parameters and by creating planning security through longer commitment periods and sufficiently high compensations for farmers' efforts to improve animal welfare.

AB  - Simple Summary The choice of sensors for detecting animal behavior through wearable devices has the greatest impact on the quality of the behavior learning process and the cost of production. The present study evaluated, through a machine learning process, the most important features in the detection and classification of sheep behavior, as well as the individual contribution of each of the sensors included in the monitoring collar. The study showed that the gyroscope had a very low contribution towards improving accuracy, despite its high production cost, and also shares very similar characteristics with the accelerometer used in the collar. Conversely, the thermometer, which was intended for other monitoring scenarios, proved to be essential in detecting some states, especially the ones related to postures in which the animal tends to wrap the collar and thus increases the temperature of the device. The final feature set provided by the thermometer and accelerometer was considered a good basis for building an animal behavior monitoring system. Animal monitoring is a task traditionally performed by pastoralists, as a way of ensuring the safety and well-being of animals; a tremendously arduous and lonely task, it requires long walks and extended periods of contact with the animals. The Internet of Things and the possibility of applying sensors to different kinds of devices, in particular the use of wearable sensors, has proven not only to be less invasive to the animals, but also to have a low cost and to be quite efficient. The present work analyses the most impactful monitored features in the behavior learning process and their learning results. It especially addresses the impact of a gyroscope, which heavily influences the cost of the collar. Based on the chosen set of sensors, a learning model is subsequently established, and the learning outcomes are analyzed. Finally, the animal behavior prediction capability of the learning model (which was based on the sensed data of adult animals) is additionally subjected and evaluated in a scenario featuring younger animals. Results suggest that not only is it possible to accurately classify these behaviors (with a balanced accuracy around 91%), but that removing the gyroscope can be advantageous. Results additionally show a positive contribution of the thermometer in behavior identification but evidences the need for further confirmation in future work, considering different seasons of different years and scenarios including more diverse animals' behavior.

AB  - alpha(2)delta proteins serve as auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels and regulate channel membrane expression and current properties. Besides their channel function, alpha(2)delta proteins regulate synapse formation, differentiation, and synaptic wiring. Considering these important functions, it is not surprising that CACNA2D1-4, the genes encoding for alpha(2)delta-1 to -4 isoforms, have been implicated in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Mutations in CACNA2D2 have been associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and cerebellar atrophy. In our present study, we performed a detailed functional characterization of the p.R593P mutation in alpha(2)delta-2, a homozygous mutation previously identified in two siblings with DEE. Importantly, we analyzed both calcium channel-dependent as well as synaptic functions of alpha(2)delta-2. Our data show that the corresponding p.R596P mutation in mouse alpha(2)delta-2 drastically decreases membrane expression and synaptic targeting of alpha(2)delta-2. This defect correlates with altered biophysical properties of postsynaptic Ca(V)1.3 channel but has no effect on presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 channels upon heterologous expression in tsA201 cells. However, homologous expression of alpha(2)delta-2_R596P in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons affects the ability of alpha(2)delta-2 to induce a statistically significant increase in the presynaptic abundance of endogenous Ca(V)2.1 channels and presynaptic calcium transients. Moreover, our data demonstrate that in addition to lowering membrane expression, the p.R596P mutation reduces the trans-synaptic recruitment of GABA(A) receptors and presynaptic synapsin clustering in glutamatergic synapses. Lastly, the alpha(2)delta-2_R596P reduces the amplitudes of glutamatergic miniature postsynaptic currents in transduced hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data strongly link the human biallelic p.R593P mutation to the underlying severe neurodevelopmental disorder and highlight the importance of studying alpha(2)delta mutations not only in the context of channelopathies but also synaptopathies.image

AB  - Countering the spread of new respiratory infections and reducing the damage they cause to society requires efficient strategies for rapidly developing of targeted therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies. Nanobodies, defined as variable fragments of heavy-chain camelid antibodies, have a set of characteristics that make them particularly convenient for this purpose. The speed at which the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread confirmed that the key factor in the development of therapeutics is obtaining highly effective blocking agents as soon as possible, as well as the diversity of epitopes to which these agents bind. We have optimized the selection process of blocking nanobodies from the genetic material of camelids and obtained a panel of nanobody structures with affinity to Spike protein in the lower nanomolar and picomolar ranges and with high binding specificity. The subset of nanobodies that demonstrate the ability to block the interaction between the Spike protein and the cellular ACE2 receptor was selected in experiments in vitro and in vivo. It has been established that the epitopes bound by the nanobodies are located in the RBD domain of the Spike protein and have little overlap. The diversity of binding regions may allow a mixture of nanobodies to retain potential therapeutic efficacy towards new Spike protein variants. Furthermore, the structural features of nanobodies, particularly their compact size and high stability, indicate the possibility of their utilization in the form of aerosols.

AB  - Simple Summary The European beaver is the biggest rodent in Eurasia and its diet is closely related to the season of the year. The gastrointestinal tract adapts its structure and physiology to ensure resistance to mechanical factors and proper digestion. Among mammals, the esophagus structure is highly variable. We aimed to perform morphological analysis of the esophagus in the European beaver, with a special attention to differences in the thickness of the epithelium in organs collected in spring, summer, and winter. Our results reveal that the mucosa is lined with stratified squamous keratinized epithelium with a structure similar to that of the skin epidermis. The process of epithelial keratinization occurs in both adult and fetal animals, suggesting that it is genetically programmed. The keratinized layer is much thicker in esophagi collected in winter than in spring and summer, while the living cell layer thickness remains unchanged regardless of the season. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining shows increased proliferation of epithelial cells in winter compared to that in spring and summer. Ultrastructural studies reveal the presence of multiple lamellar and non-lamellar bodies in granular cells, whose morphology and location gradually change while reaching the upper epithelial layers. The morphology of the esophagus in the European beaver displays features adapted to seasonal changes in diet. Future studies could employ biochemical characterization of keratinization process in the epithelium and composition of keratinized layer. The European beaver is a herbivorous rodent whose diet changes seasonally, and in winter consists of large quantities of woody plants. It is distinguished among other mammals by a unique organization of the stomach that comprises the cardiogastric gland and by the unusual process of mucus formation in the gastric mucosa. The aim of study was to (i) characterize the structure of the beaver esophagus with particular attention to the mucosal epithelium; (ii) compare the histological structure of the esophagi collected in spring, summer, and winter; (iii) provide preliminary data on the structure of the esophagus in beaver fetuses. The study was conducted on esophagi of 18 adult beavers captured in Poland in April, August, and December, and on 3 fetal organs. The results obtained in adults show that the mucosa is lined with thick stratified squamous keratinized epithelium with a structure similar to that of the skin epidermis. Ultrastructural studies reveal the presence of multiple lamellar and non-lamellar bodies in granular cells, whose morphology and location gradually change while reaching the upper epithelial layers. The muscularis mucosa comprises a layer of longitudinally oriented bundles of smooth muscle cells. Both mucosa and submucosa do not comprise any glands. The thick muscularis externa consists mainly of internal circular and external longitudinal layers of striated muscle fibers. The keratinized layer of mucosa epithelium was 2-3-fold thicker in esophagi collected in winter than in those collected in spring and summer, while the epithelial cell layer thickness remained unchanged regardless of the season. Immunolabeling for proliferating cell nuclear antigen shows a higher index of epithelium proliferation in esophagi collected in winter than in spring and summer. No seasonal differences were noted in other layers of the esophagus.
   Fetal organs have epithelium covered with a keratinized layer, thinner than in adults, and the muscularis externa comprises both striated and smooth muscle cells.

AB  - Pesticides-related toxicities have long been studied. Data regarding the effects of combined exposure to environmentally relevant pesticides however remain lacking. The herbicide glyphosate and the fungicide mancozeb are extensively used in agriculture. Residues of both compounds are frequently found in food and water and therefore, environmental exposure to both pesticides is a possibility. Neurotoxicity of glyphosate, mancozeb and their combinations were investigated using mouse neuroblastoma cells. Cytotoxicity observed with the glyphosate and mancozeb combinations was higher than that observed when glyphosate was tested alone. Combinations of glyphosate followed by mancozeb increased copper, manganese, and zinc levels. Mixture of mancozeb + glyphosate increased manganese and zinc levels. Combination of mancozeb followed by glyphosate increased copper and zinc levels. Glutathione ratio was decreased as a result of combinations of glyphosate and mancozeb. The decrease in glutathione ratio was greater in the combination groups than in glyphosate alone.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with enhanced inflammatory activity, poor skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction that persist in offspring. We hypothesized that targeting heightened inflammation in IUGR-born neonatal lambs by supplementing anti-inflammatory omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) would improve metabolic outcomes. Methods: Maternal heat stress was used to produce IUGR lambs, which received daily oral boluses of omega-3 PUFA Ca2+ salts or placebo for 30 days. Results: Greater circulating TNF alpha and semitendinosus IL6R in IUGR lambs were fully resolved by omega-3 PUFA, and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, muscle glucose oxidation, and hypertension were partially rescued. Impaired glucose oxidation by IUGR muscle coincided with a greater glycogen content that was completely reversed by omega-3 PUFA and greater lactate production that was partially reversed. Ex vivo O2 consumption was increased in IUGR muscle, indicating compensatory lipid oxidation. This too was alleviated by omega-3 PUFA. Conversely, omega-3 PUFA had little effect on IUGR-induced changes in lipid flux and hematology parameters, did not resolve greater muscle TNFR1, and further reduced muscle beta 2-adrenoceptor content. Conclusions: These findings show that targeting elevated inflammatory activity in IUGR-born lambs in the early neonatal period improved metabolic outcomes, particularly muscle glucose metabolism and beta cell function.

AB  - There is evidence suggesting that online consolidation during retrieval-mediated learning interacts with offline consolidation during subsequent sleep to transform memory. Here we investigate whether this interaction persists when retrieval-mediated learning follows post-training sleep and whether the direction of this interaction is conditioned by the quality of encoding resulting from manipulation of the amount of sleep on the previous night. The quality of encoding was determined by computing the degree of similarity between EEG-activity patterns across restudy of face pairs in two groups of young participants, one who slept the last 4 h of the pre-training night, and another who slept 8 h. The offline consolidation was assessed by computing the degree of coupling between slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles (SPs) during post-training sleep, while the online consolidation was evaluated by determining the degree of similarity between EEG-activity patterns recorded during the study phase and during repeated recognition of either the same face pair (i.e., specific similarity) or face pairs sharing sex and profession (i.e., categorical similarity) to evaluate differentiation and generalization, respectively. The study and recognition phases were separated by a night of normal sleep duration. Mixed-effects models revealed that the stability of neural encoding moderated the relationship between sleep- and retrieval-mediated consolidation processes over left frontal regions. For memories showing lower encoding stability, the enhanced SO-SP coupling was associated with increased reinstatement of category-specific encoding-related activity at the expense of content-specific activity, whilst the opposite occurred for memories showing greater encoding stability. Overall, these results suggest that offline consolidation during post-training sleep interacts with online consolidation during retrieval the next day to favor the reorganization of memory contents, by increasing specificity of stronger memories and generalization of the weaker ones.

AB  - Biomarkers, ranging from molecules to behavior, can be used to identify thresholds beyond which performance of mission tasks may be compromised and could potentially trigger the activation of countermeasures. Identification of homologous brain regions and/or neural circuits related to operational performance may allow for translational studies between species. Three discussion groups were directed to use operationally relevant performance tasks as a driver when identifying biomarkers and brain regions or circuits for selected constructs. Here we summarize small-group discussions in tables of circuits and biomarkers categorized by (a) sensorimotor, (b) behavioral medicine and (c) integrated approaches (e.g., physiological responses). In total, hundreds of biomarkers have been identified and are summarized herein by the respective group leads. We hope the meeting proceedings become a rich resource for NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) and the community of researchers.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal welfare and stress response assessment need valid animal-based indicators. Saliva has gained relevance as a non-invasive biological fluid that can be used to assess cortisol levels and different parameters of oxidative stress as potential sensitive indicators for evaluating animal welfare and health. The main objective of this work was to verify whether saliva and eye infrared thermography are accurate and efficient methods that can be used to detect transport-induced stress in calves. Our results show that transport increases salivary cortisol, oxidative status parameters, and eye temperatures. Furthermore, this study proves that the saliva of calves, as well as ocular temperature, suffers significant changes in its composition during the transport process, supporting saliva and infrared thermography as effective non-invasive methodologies to accurately assess cows' stress status. Animal transport is currently a stressful procedure. Therefore, animal-based indicators are needed for reliable and non-invasive welfare assessment. Saliva is a biospecimen with potential validity for the determination of cortisol and oxidative stress, although its use to assess calf welfare during transport has never been tested. Similarly, the applicability and reliability of infrared thermography to assess temperature change during calves' transport have never been evaluated. These objectives were outlined following the known and growing need to identify non-invasive methodologies for stress assessment in bovines. This study was conducted on 20 calves of the Arouquesa autochthone breed, at about nine months of age, during their transport to slaughter. For each animal, saliva samples and thermographic images of the eye were collected at three time points: before transport, after transport, and at slaughter. The saliva was then processed to measure cortisol levels and oxidative stress parameters (reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, carbonyls, and advanced oxidation protein products), and the images were analyzed using FLIR Tools+ software. There was an increase in cortisol concentration and oxidative stress parameters (reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, carbonyls, and advanced oxidation protein products) in saliva after transport. An increase in eye temperature triggered by transport was also observed. The cortisol and eye temperature results at slaughter were returned to values similar to those before transport; however, the values of oxidative stress remained increased (mainly TBARS values). These non-invasive techniques seem to be reliable indicators of stress in bovine transport, and oxidative stress parameters in saliva may be a persistent marker for welfare assessment.

AB  - Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) are critical for memory consolidation and retrieval. The neuronal content of spiking during SPW-Rs is believed to be under the influence of neocortical inputs via the entorhinal cortex (EC). Optogenetic silencing of the medial EC (mEC) reduced the incidence of SPW-Rs with minor impacts on their magnitude or duration, similar to local CA1 silencing. The effect of mEC silencing on CA1 firing and field potentials was comparable to the effect of transient cortex-wide DOWN states of non-REM (NREM) sleep, implying that decreased SPW-R incidence in both cases is due to tonic disfacilitation of hippocampal circuits. The neuronal composition of CA1 pyramidal neurons during SPW-Rs was altered by mEC silencing but was restored immediately after silencing. We suggest that the mEC provides both tonic and transient influences on hippocampal network states by timing the occurrence of SPW-Rs and altering their neuronal content.

AB  - Optical and electrophysiological methods are widely used in neuroscience to study brain activity. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses that complement each other to provide a more comprehensive understanding of neuronal activity. To this end, we developed an implantable CMOS image sensor device with an integrated carbon electrode for the simultaneous measurement of fluorescence and extracellular signals. The device is composed of a 450 x 1660 mu m CMOS chip and micro-LED secured to a flexible printed circuit substrate. The chip has an imaging surface measuring 900 x 300 mu m2, comprising 120 x 90 pixels recording at 10 frames per second. An absorption filter film was placed on top of the imaging surface to block excitation light. The device was coated with parylene-C for waterproofing and, finally, the coating film was readily turned into carbon electrodes by laser carbonization. We characterized the lasercarbonized electrodes by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and in vivo recording of fluorescence and extracellular signals in hippocampus CA1 using the device.

AB  - Historically, reducing aerosol-based transmission of respired viruses in indoor environments has been of importance for controlling influenza viruses and common-cold rhinoviruses. The present public health emergency associated with SARS-CoV-2 makes this topic critically important. Yet to be tested is the potential effectiveness of simple interventions that create an isolation zone (IZ) for a suspected/confirmed sick or sensitive person requiring quarantine. The intent in existing homes is to find a practical means to mitigate exposure to airborne contaminants. In creating an IZ in an occupied single-family home in the study, four simple strategies were tested. The test configurations were: (1) IZ windows closed with IZ bathroom exhaust ventilation fan off, (2) IZ windows closed with IZ exhaust fan on, (3) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan off, and (4) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan on. Incense-generated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was used as a marker for virus transmission. The measured transfer of PM2.5 from the IZ into the main zone (MZ) of the house enabled us to determine the relative effectiveness of four containment strategies. Collectively, the data from pressure differential (across zones) and PM2.5 measurements suggested that the best containment strategy was achieved through continuously operating the bathroom exhaust fan while keeping the windows closed in the IZ (configuration 2). Interventions using open windows were found to be less reliable, due to variability in wind speed and direction, resulting in an unpredictable and sometimes detrimental pressure differential in the IZ with reference to MZ. Our findings strongly suggest a simple IZ exhaust ventilation strategy has the potential for mitigating the risk from the airborne spread of contaminants, such as SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background: Nandrolone Decanoate (ND) is one of the most popular androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS(s)) compounds that is widely abused during adolescence. Despite clear evidence about the effects of ND on hippocampal synaptic plasticity, its complex underlying mechanisms of action have remained elusive. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of P450 aromatase in the mediation of ND effects on hippocampal CA1 synaptic plasticity during adolescence in male rats. Material and Methods: In the present study, the rats were divided into four groups: Control group received DMSO, while other experimental groups received ND (60 mu g/2.5 mu L), anastrozole (1 mu g/2.5 mu L), and co-adminstration of anastrozole (1 mu g/2.5 mu L) and ND (60 mu g/2.5 mu L) for 4 days. Then, Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) and Population spikes (PS) magnitudes were investigated in the hippocampal CA1 area. Results: Electrophysiological results indicated higher fEPSP-LTP magnitude in the ND-treated group compared to DMSO-treated group (P < 0.05). Also, the results of field potential recording showed that anastrozole alone had not a significant effect on fEPSP-LTP magnitude, while pre-administration of anastrozole abolished the ND improvement effects on fEPSP-LTP magnitude. Conclusion: This study presented evidence supporting the involvement of aromatase in improvement effects of ND on hippocampal synaptic plasticity in adolescent male rats.

AB  - Endosomal dysfunction is one of the earliest cellular signs in Alzheimer's disease. Tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein (TSG101) is a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-I, which plays a key role in sorting ubiquitinated cell surface proteins and lipids onto intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies for trafficking to lysosomes or autophagosomes for degradation, or to the plasma membrane for exosomal secretion. TSG101-dependent trafficking has been implicated in the propagation and spread of misfolded proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We used transgenesis mice to study the in vivo consequences of disrupting TSG101-dependent trafficking in adult neurons. Mice lacking Tsg101 in forebrain neurons (Tsg101ck2-null) showed rapid loss of hippocampal neurons and progressive forebrain atrophy. Astrogliosis was apparent in the dentate gyrus within 1 week of deleting Tsg101, followed by apoptosis of hippocampal CA3 neurons and accumulation of the autophagy adapter P62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitinated proteins. Failure to detect lipidated LC3 indicated autophagy was impaired rather than upregulated. Endosomal markers (RAB5 and RAB7) and amyloid protein also accumulated in hippocampal neurons of Tsg101ck2-null mice. Our data establish a critical role for TSG101 in neuronal survival and demonstrate the importance of the in vivo assessment of gene and protein functions.

AB  - In our previous study, phloridzin, sucrose, l-alanine, and dulcitol presented synergistic effects in Camellia nanchuanica black tea (NCBT). This study aims to verify the synergistic effects of the aforementioned sweet taste compounds and the mechanism involved. By conducting sigma-tau plot analysis, phloridzin at the recognition threshold concentration (phl) exhibited synergistic effects with different concentrations of sucrose (Lsuc-6suc). Various concentrations of sucrose, phloridzin, and their combinations were selected to investigate the impact on sweet taste receptor cells. The results revealed that sucrose/phloridzin significantly increased the calcium signal compared to phloridzin and sucrose alone, attributed to the greater stability of the sucrose/phloridzin combination when binding to Taste 1 Receptor Member 3 (TAS1R3; one subunit of sweet taste receptor proteins). Ultimately, the sweet taste signal of sucrose/phloridzin was transmitted to the brain, triggering the activation of more brain regions associated with sweet taste perception (right insular, postcentral, and amygdala).

AB  - The valorization of discarded wool from dairy sheep breeding is a challenging issue. The most proposed strategies lie in the processing of keratin extracted from wool without reducing the molecular weight of the protein chains (the high molecular weight-HMW keratin). Here, the HMW keratin has been spun for the first time by solution blow spinning. A screening study of the process carried out with a 2-level full factorial design revealed that keratin filaments can be obtained by using the polyethylene oxide at 900 kDa, a 2 bar air pressure, and a 30 cm needle-collector distance. An annealing at 80 degrees C for 15 min, at pH 3.5 with citric acid contributes to increasing the viscosity of the keratin solutions thereby allowing the production of defect-free and water-stable filaments having diameters from 1 to 6 mu m. A negligible toxic effect was observed after 24 and 48 h on HT29 epithelial cells and normal blood cells displayed behavior similar to the control demonstrating that the patches are hemocompatible. Therefore, the developed SBS process of keratin aqueous solutions could represent a valuable platform for developing patches that need to be blood-contacting and deposited in-situ.

AB  - Neuronal polarization, a process wherein nascent neurons develop a single long axon and multiple short dendrites, can occur within in vitro cell cultures without environmental cues. This is an apparently random process in which one of several short processes, called neurites, grows to become long, while the others remain short. In this study, we propose a minimum model for neurite growth, which involves bistability and random excitations reflecting actin waves. Positive feedback is needed to produce the bistability, while negative feedback is required to ensure that no more than one neurite wins the winner-takes-all contest. By applying the negative feedback to different aspects of the neurite growth process, we demonstrate that targeting the negative feedback to the excitation amplitude results in the most persistent polarization. Also, we demonstrate that there are optimal ranges of values for the neurite count, and for the excitation rate and amplitude that best maintain the polarization. Finally, we show that a previously published model for neuronal polarization based on competition for limited resources shares key features with our best-performing minimal model: bistability and negative feedback targeted to the size of random excitations.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alcoholic depression, a disorder of the central nervous system, is characterized by alcohol abuse, which causes blood-brain barrier disruption and oxidative damage in the brain. The rhizome of Rhodiola crenulate, from which Dazhu Hongjingtian Injection (DZHJTI) is derived, has been traditionally employed in ethnopharmacology to treat neurological disorders due to its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. However, the exact mechanism by which DZHJTI alleviates alcoholic depression remains unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effects of DZHJTI and its underlying mechanisms in a mouse model of alcohol-induced depression. Materials and methods: A model of alcoholic depression was established using C57BL/6J mice, and the effects of DZHJTI on depression-like behaviors induced by alcohol exposure were assessed through behavioral experiments. Histopathological examination was conducted to observe nerve cell damage and microglial activation in the hippocampal region. Oxidative stress indices in the hippocampus, inflammatory factors, and serum levels of dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were measured using ELISA. Expression of proteins related to the Nrf2/HO-1/NLRP3 signaling pathway was determined by Western blot analysis. Results: DZHJTI attenuated depression-like behaviors, neuronal cell damage, oxidative stress levels, inflammatory responses, and microglial activation. It also restored levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, brain myelin basic protein, DA, and 5-HT in mice with chronic alcohol exposure. After DZHJTI treatment, the expressions of Nuclear Respiratory Factor 2 (Nrf2) and Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) increased in the hippocampus, whereas the levels of NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosisassociated speck-like protein containing CARD, cleaved caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-18 decreased. Conclusions: DZHJTI ameliorates alcohol-induced depressive symptoms in mice through its antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects, involving mechanisms associated with the Nrf2/HO-1/NLRP3 signaling pathway. This study highlights the potential of DZHJTI as a therapeutic option for alcohol-related depression and suggests the scope for future research to further elucidate its mechanisms and broader clinical applications.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory (Yi Xue Zheng Zhuan), the main factors associated with the pathogenesis of depression are deficiencies relating to five zang organs, Qi, and blood. Polygonatum sibiricum F. Delaroche (PS), which may avert these pathological changes, has been used in a variety of formulas to treat depression. However, the effects and mechanism of action of PS, alone, and especially those of its main active component PS polysaccharide (PSP), on depression remain unexplored. Aim of the study: To determine the effects of PSP on depression-like behaviors and to elucidate its mechanism of action. Methods: PSP was isolated from dried PS rhizomes and qualified using transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression models were used to evaluate the antidepressive effects of PSP. Veinal blood and brain tissue were collected to determine the levels of hippocampal 5-HT, serum cortisol (CORT), brain and serum cytokines, and hippocampal oxidation-related indicators. The protein expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), caspase-3, GluA1 and GluA2, and GluN2A and GluN2B were determined using western blotting and immunofluorescence. Nissl staining was performed to detect histopathological changes in brain tissues. Results: Injection of LPS (i.p.) induced depression-like behaviors, reduced the level of hippocampal 5-HT, increased the serum CORT level and hippocampal oxidative stress (ROS), and prompted the activation of ERK1/2, NF-kappa B, and GFAP and an inflammatory response. Conversely, PSP administration reduced these changes and prevented depression-like behaviors. PSP administration also promoted hippocampal expression of p-Akt, pmTOR, GluA1, and GluA2; reduced the expression of caspase-3, GluN2A, and GluN2B; and prohibited the loss of granular cells in the DG region. Conclusion: These results indicate that PSP prevents depression-like behaviors, and synaptic and neuronal damage probably by reducing ROS/HPA axis hyperfunction and the inflammatory response.

AB  - In mammals, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is one of the few regions where neurogenesis continues throughout life. As a result, the dentate gyrus harbours neurons of ontogenetically different origin. Notably, ontogenetically different dentate granule neurons (DGNs) are morphologically distinct and fulfil specialized functions in hippocampal information processing and plasticity. Development of adult-born DGNs is tightly controlled by signals released by the complex cellular environment of the adult dentate gyrus. In mice, an adult-like cytoarchitecture of the dentate gyrus is observed only after postnatal Week 2. The question therefore arises when the signalling environment controlling adult neurogenesis is established and whether development of ontogenetically distinct DGNs is subject to the same regulatory pathways. Here, we analyse BATGAL reporter mice to determine the temporal development of beta-catenin-signalling activity in the murine DGN lineage. We show that the beta-catenin-signalling pattern, which is essential for precise dendritogenesis and neuronal maturation in adulthood, emerges only around 2 weeks after birth and continues to be refined over the next weeks. These results indicate that the signalling environment controlling adult neurogenesis is only gradually established and suggest that the development of ontogenetically distinct DGNs is controlled by different mechanisms.

AB  - Daily intake of tea has been known to relate to a low risk of depression. In this study, we report that a special variety of tea in China, Camellia assamica var. kucha (kucha), possesses antidepressant effects but with less adverse effects as compared to traditional tea Camellia sinensis. This action of kucha is related to its high amount of theacrine, a purine alkaloid structurally similar to caffeine. We investigated the antidepressant-like effects and mechanisms of theacrine in chronic water immersion restraint stress and chronic unpredictable mild stress mice models. PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neural stem cells were treated with stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) to reveal the potential antidepression mechanism of theacrine from the perspective of adult hippocampus neurogenesis. Results of behavioral and neurotransmitter analysis showed that intragastric administration of theacrine significantly counteracted chronic stress-induced depression-like disorders and abnormal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism with less central excitability. Further investigation from both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that the antidepressant mechanism of theacrine was associated with promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis, via the modulation of the phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP response-element binding (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) pathway. Collectively, our findings could promote the prevalence of kucha as a common beverage with uses for health care and contribute to the development of theacrine as a potential novel antidepressant medicine.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental axonal pathfinding plays a central role in correct brain wiring and subsequent cognitive abilities. Within the growth cone, various intracellular effectors transduce axonal guidance signals by remodeling the cytoskeleton. Semaphorin-3E (Sema3E) is a guidance cue implicated in development of the fornix, a neuronal tract connecting the hippocampus to the hypothalamus. Microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) has been shown to be involved in the Sema3E growth-promoting signaling pathway. In this study, we identified the collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) as a MAP6 partner and a crucial effector in Sema3E growth-promoting activity. CRMP4-KO mice displayed abnormal fornix development reminiscent of that observed in Sema3E-KO mice. CRMP4 was shown to interact with the Sema3E tripartite receptor complex within detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains, and DRM domain integrity was required to transduce Sema3E signaling through the Akt/GSK3 pathway. Finally, we showed that the cytoskeleton-binding domain of CRMP4 is required for Sema3E's growth-promoting activity, suggesting that CRMP4 plays a role at the interface between Sema3E receptors, located in DRM domains, and the cytoskeleton network. As the fornix is affected in many psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, our results provide new insights to better understand the neurodevelopmental components of these diseases.

AB  - Against the backdrop of deepening globalization, increasingly severe climate change, and increasing frequency of various "black swan" and "gray rhinoceros" events, the importance of resilience in the food system is becoming increasingly prominent. This article uses panel data from 31 provinces in China from 2013 to 2022 to construct a resilience index system for the food system. The entropy method and geographic detector are used to analyze the level, spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, and influencing factors of resilience in different food functional areas in China. The main conclusions are as follows: from 2013 to 2022, China's main food producing areas, main sales areas, and production sales balance areas all achieved an increase in resilience level. In terms of different sub dimensions, there are differences in the changes of different functional areas. In terms of spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, from 2013 to 2022, the resilience of the food system in different functional areas of China has increased, and the changes in different provinces are clearly visible. In terms of influencing factors, unit food yield, multiple cropping index, rural primary industry personnel, and agricultural mechanization level are the main influencing factors on the resilience level of the food system in different functional areas of China. The interaction between each influencing factor is mainly dual factor enhancement and non-linear enhancement.

AB  - Camellia is an important plant genus that includes well-known species such as C. sinensis, C. oleifera, and C. japonica. The C. sinensis cultivar 'Sangmok', one of Korea's standard types of tea landraces, is a small evergreen tree or shrub. Genome annotation has shown that Korean tea plants have special and unique benefits and superior components, such as catechin. The genome of Camellia sinensis cultivar 'Sangmok' was assembled on the chromosome level, with a length of 2678.62 Mbp and GC content of 38.16%. Further, 15 chromosome-scale scaffolds comprising 82.43% of the assembly (BUSCO completeness, 94.3%) were identified. Analysis of 68,151 protein-coding genes showed an average of 5.003 exons per gene. Among 82,481 coding sequences, the majority (99.06%) were annotated by Uniprot/Swiss-Prot. Further analysis revealed that 'Sangmok' is closely related to C. sinensis, with a divergence time of 60 million years ago. A total of 3336 exclusive gene families in 'Sangmok' were revealed by gene ontology analysis to play roles in auxin transport and cellular response mechanisms. By comparing these exclusive genes with 551 similar catechin genes, 17 'Sangmok'-specific catechin genes were identified by qRT-PCR, including those involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis and related to cytochrome P450. The 'Sangmok' genome exhibited distinctive genes compared to those of related species. This comprehensive genomic investigation enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of 'Sangmok' and its specialized functions. The findings contribute valuable insights into the evolutionary and functional aspects of this plant species.

AB  - The present study was performed to evaluate the reproductive performance of gilts inseminated using fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocol. A total of 408 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred gilts were included in the experiment. Gilts at 8 months of age were randomly allocated into three groups: control AI (n = 192), treatment 1-TAI (n = 117) and treatment 2-FTAI (n = 99). Gilts in the control AI group were inseminated 2-3 times during standing oestrus at 0,12 and 24 h after the onset of oestrus. Gilts in the treatment 1-TAI group were orally administered 20 mg per day of altrenogest for 18 days and then inseminated 2-3 times during standing oestrus by conventional AI. Gilts in the treatment 2-FTAI group were synchronized like gilts in treatment 1-TAI group but then GnRH (10 mg of buserelin) was administered 120 h after the end of altrenogest treatment and fixed time artificial inseminated twice at 24 and 32 h after GnRH irrespective of the presence of oestrus or not. Conception rate of gilts in treatment 2-FTAI (87.9%) was similar to the treatment 1-TAI (94.9%) and control AI (83.3%) (P > 0.05). Conception rate in treatment 1-TAI (94.9%) was higher compared to control AI group (83.3%, P = 0.040). Farrowing rate of gilts in treatment 2-FTAI (83.8%) was similar to treatment 1-TAI (89.7%) and control AI (76.0%) (P > 0.05). Farrowing rate of treatment 1-TAI (89.7%) was higher than control AI gilts (76.0%, P = 0.033). In treatment 2-FTAI, the conception and farrowing rate of the nine gilts that were inseminated even if they were not detected in oestrus (all during warm season) was 44.4% and 44.4%, respectively. Regular return to oestrus was similar between groups (9.4%, 0.9% and 4.1% for control AI, treatment 1-TAI and treatment 2-FTAI, respectively, P > 0.05). The total number of piglets born per litter in treatment 1-TAI group was higher than control AI (13.1 +/- 0.2 versus 11.6 +/- 0.2, respectively, P < 0.001) and treatment 2-FTAI groups (12.2 +/- 0.3, P = 0.019). The number of piglets born alive was higher in treatment 1-TAI (12.1 +/- 0.3) compared to treatment 2-FTAI (11.3 +/- 0.2) and control AI group (11.2 +/- 0.3). The percentage of stillbirth and mummified foetus were not different between groups (P > 0.05). The present study indicated that fixed-time AI in gilts can be successfully performed by administration of altrenogest for 18 days, GnRH at 120 h after altrenogest withdrawal and then double fixed-time AI at 24 and 32 h after the administration of GnRH. Fertility metrics such as conception rate, farrowing rate and litter performances using this method were similar to gilts inseminated at oestrus with conventional AI. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Both hypertension and aging are known to increase the vulnerability of the brain to neurovascular damage, resulting in cognitive impairment. The present study investigated the efficacy of the antihypertensive drug losartan on age- and hypertension-associated cognitive decline and the possible mechanism underlying its effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Losartan was administered (10 mg/kg, i.p. for 19 days) to 3- and 14-month-old SHRs. Age-matched Wistar rats were used as controls. Working memory, short-term object recognition, and spatial memory were assessed using the Y-maze, object recognition test (ORT) and radial arm maze (RAM) test. The expression of markers associated with aging, oxidative stress, and memory-related signaling was assessed in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus. Motor activity measured over 24 h was not different between groups. Middle-aged vehicle-treated SHRs showed poorer performance in spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) and activity in the first Y-maze test than their younger counterparts, suggesting age-related reduced "decision making" and reactivity in a novel environment. Losartan improved the age- and hypertension-induced decline in short-term recognition and spatial memory measured in the ORT and the second Y-maze test, particularly in the middle-aged rats, but was ineffective in the young adult rats. Changes in memory and age-related markers such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and amyloid-beta(1-42) (A beta(1-42)) and increased oxidative stress were observed in the hippocampus but not in the FC between young adult and middle-aged vehicle-treated SHRs. Losartan increased CREB expression while reducing A beta(1-42) levels and concomitant oxidative stress in middle-aged SHRs compared with vehicle-treated SHRs. In conclusion, our study highlights the complex interplay between hypertension, aging, and cognitive impairment. It suggests that there is a critical time window for therapeutic intervention with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) are phenol-accumulating crops that are widely used for public health. The healing effect of tea leaf products is due to the biosynthesis of such phenolic compounds (PCs) as flavans, which have P-vitamin capillary-strengthening activity. Due to their limited habitat and the value of their specialized metabolites of a phenolic nature, a promising approach is to establish in vitro cultures from them that retain the ability to form PCs, which is characteristic of ex vivo tea plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exogenic H2O2 (0.01 mM; 0.1 mM; 1 mM) on the growth, morphology, degree of stress response, and accumulation of various phenolic compounds in tea plant callus cultures of different ages (24 or 36 days) grown under different cultivation conditions (darkness or light). According to the results obtained, the H2O2 effect on tea callus cultures of different ages did not cause changes in their morphophysiological characteristics, both after 2 h of exposure (rapid response of callus culture, RRCC) and after 48 h (delayed response of callus culture, DRCC). The determination of the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, which serves as an indicator of changes in the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the presence of stress responses in plant cells, indicated either its maintenance at the control level, a decrease, or an increase. All these effects depended on the growth conditions of the tea callus cultures (darkness or light), their age, the duration of exposure (rapid or delayed response), and the H2O2 concentration. Similar trends were noted for the total content of PCs as well as the amount of flavans, proanthocyanidins (soluble and insoluble forms), and lignin. The plant cell responses reflected changes in its adaptation programs, when specialized metabolites act as a target for the action of H2O2, thereby contributing to an increase in their resistance.

AB  - Plant latex is a sticky emulsion exuded from laticifers once the plant is damaged. Latex is an essential component of plant defense against herbivores. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in the Compositae family has relatively fewer insect herbivores compared with other leaf vegetables. The larvae of a generalist lepidopteran pest Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) avoided feeding on living lettuce plants. However, the larvae rapidly damaged the excised leaves that were unable to produce latex. Six compounds were isolated from lettuce latex. They were identified as 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (1), 3 beta-hydroxy-4,15-dehydrograndolide (2), annuolide D (3), lactucin (4), lactucopicrin (5), and hanphyllin (6). Bioassays showed that the inhibition rate of compound 1 (2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde) and 6 (hanphyllin, a sesquiterpene lactone) on the weight gain of S. litura were 52.4 % and 10 %, respectively, at the concentration of 100 mu g/g. RNA-seq analyses showed that larval exposure to compound 1 down-regulated the genes associated with heterobiotic metabolism including drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, retinol metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and drug metabolism-other enzymes (mainly uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase, UGTs). RT-qPCR further confirmed that 33 genes in the family of carboxylesterase (CarE), P450s and UGTs were down-regulated by compound 1. The activities of CarE, P450s and UGTs in the larvae fed on diets containing compound 1 were significantly lower than those fed on control diets, with the inhibition for the three detoxification enzymes being 55.4 %, 53.9 %, and 52.9 %. These findings suggest that secondary metabolites including 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde in the latex play a key role in protecting lettuce from insect herbivory.

AB  - Preclinical studies for wound healing disorders are an essential step in translating discoveries into therapies. Also, they are an integral component of initial safety screening and gaining mechanistic insights using an in vivo approach. Given the complexity of the wound healing process, existing guidelines for animal testing do not capture key information due to the inevitable variability in experimental design. Variations in study interpretation are increased by complexities associated with wound aetiology, wounding procedure, multiple treatment conditions, wound assessment, and analysis, as well as lack of acknowledgement of limitation of the model used. Yet, no standards exist to guide reporting crucial experimental information required to interpret results in translational studies of wound healing. Consistency in reporting allows transparency, comparative, and meta-analysis studies and avoids repetition and redundancy. Therefore, there is a critical and unmet need to standardise reporting for preclinical wound studies. To aid in reporting experimental conditions, The Wound Reporting in Animal and Human Preclinical Studies (WRAHPS) Guidelines have now been created by the authors working with the Wound Care Collaborative Community (WCCC) GAPS group to provide a checklist and reporting template for the most frequently used preclinical models in support of development for human clinical trials for wound healing disorders. It is anticipated that the WRAHPS Guidelines will standardise comprehensive methods for reporting in scientific manuscripts and the wound healing field overall. This article is not intended to address regulatory requirements but is intended to provide general guidelines on important scientific considerations for such studies.

AB  - The composition of fatty acids in the muscle tissue of the unique Central Asian carp-like fish, Potanin Altai osman Oreoleuciscus potanini, was studied for the first time. The populations of these fish in the reservoirs of the semiarid zone (Durgun and Taishir) during the period of their formation are considered. It was shown that the content of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids in O. potanini corresponds to the median of this value in the order Cypriniformes. It was established that the basis of the food web of the herbivorous form of this species consists of microalgae (diatoms, Euglena and, possibly, chrysophytes), as well as bacteria. At the same time, the levels of bacterial biomarkers, 15-17BCFA and 17:0 were significantly higher in fish in the Durgun reservoir, whereas the level of EPA (diatom biomarker) in O. potanini was higher in the Taishir reservoir. The established higher values of the heavy nitrogen isotope content in the muscles of O. potanini from the Taishir reservoir are most likely associated with the yet unformed benthic communities and with the incomplete diversification of the riverine form of the Potanin Altai osman into lacustrine forms.

AB  - Drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, produce aberrant changes in synaptic transmission and plasticity that emerge throughout withdrawal. One region of the brain that displays a high degree of synaptic plasticity, as well as connectivity with mesolimbic structures such as the nucleus accumbens, is the ventral hippocampus (vH). Here, we investigated the effects of an escalating cocaine dosing schedule on vH CA1 excitatory transmission by measuring place preference and recording excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at three different withdrawal time points: withdrawal day (WD) 2, 9 or 28. Behaviourally, this escalating cocaine-conditioning protocol was capable of producing conditioned place preference that persisted through WD28. Physiologically, cocaine conditioning produced an increase in vH excitatory transmission on WD2 that appeared to be the result of an increase in calcium-impermeable (CI)-AMPA receptor density. Excitatory transmission was still enhanced in cocaine-treated animals on WD9; however, a significant increase in the contribution of calcium-permeable (CP)-AMPA receptors to EPSCs was detected as compared with WD2. By WD28, these CP-AMPA receptors provided a major contribution to vH CA1 excitatory transmission, resulting in synaptic responses distinct from WD2 and WD9. Taken together, these results highlight progressive changes in vH synaptic transmission during withdrawal that may enhance cocaine contextual associations.

AB  - Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) can improve the learning and memory impairment of rats with Alzheimer's disease, however, its effect on cerebral ischemia remains poorly understood. In this study, we established rat models of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion. One day after modeling, a group of rats were treated with ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 2 hours daily on 28 successive days. Our results showed that rats treated with ELF-EMF required shorter swimming distances and latencies in the Morris water maze test than those of untreated rats. The number of times the platform was crossed and the time spent in the target quadrant were greater than those of untreated rats. The number of BrdU+/NeuN+ cells, representing newly born neurons, in the hippocampal subgranular zone increased more in the treated than in untreated rats. Up-regulation in the expressions of Notch1, Hes1, and Hes5 proteins, which are the key factors of the Notch signaling pathway, was greatest in the treated rats. These findings suggest that ELF-EMF can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis of rats with cerebral ischemia, possibly by affecting the Notch signaling pathway. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Sichuan University, China (approval No. 2019255A) on March 5, 2019.

AB  - Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD) along with aggregation of extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and intracellular aggregates of tau protein. In animal models of amyloidosis, local immune activation is centered around A beta plaques, which are usually of uniform morphology, dependent on the transgenic model used. In postmortem human brains a diversity of A beta plaque morphologies is seen including diffuse plaques (non-neuritic plaques, non-NP), dense-core plaques, cotton-wool plaques, and NP. In a recent study, we demonstrated that during the progression of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC), a transformation of non-NP into NP occurs which is tightly linked to the emergence of cortical, but not hippocampal neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology. This highlights the central role of NP in AD pathogenesis as well as brain region-specific differences in NP formation. In order to correlate the transformation of plaque types with local immune activation, we quantified the clustering and phenotype of microglia and accumulation of astrocytes around non-NP and NP during the progression of ADNC. We hypothesize that glial clustering occurs in response to formation of neuritic dystrophy around NP. First, we show that Iba1-positive microglia preferentially cluster around NP. Utilizing microglia phenotypic markers, we furthermore demonstrate that CD68-positive phagocytic microglia show a strong preference to cluster around NP in both the hippocampus and frontal cortex. A similar preferential clustering is observed for CD11c and ferritin-positive microglia in the frontal cortex, while this preference is less pronounced in the hippocampus, highlighting differences between hippocampal and cortical A beta plaques. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes showed a clear preference for clustering around NP in both the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These data support the notion that NP are intimately associated with the neuroimmune response in AD and underscore the importance of the interplay of protein deposits and the immune system in the pathophysiology of AD.image

AB  - Early life stress shapes the developing brain and increases risk for psychotic disorders. Yet, it is not fully understood how early life stress impacts brain regions in dopaminergic pathways whose dysfunction can contribute to psychosis. Therefore, we investigated gene expression following early life stress in adult brain regions containing dopamine neuron cell bodies (substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA)) and terminals (dorsal/ventral striatum). Sprague-Dawley rats (14F, 10M) were separated from their mothers from postnatal days (PND) 2-14 for 3 h/day to induce stress, while control rats (12F, 10M) were separated for 15 min/day over the same period. In adulthood (PND98), brain regions were dissected, RNA was isolated and five glucocorticoid signalling-related and six brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNAs were assayed by qPCR in four brain regions. In the VTA, levels of glucocorticoid signalling-related transcripts differed in maternally separated rodents compared to controls, with the Fkbp5 transcript significantly lower and Ptges3 transcript significantly higher in stressed offspring. In the VTA and substantia nigra, maternally separated rodents had significantly higher Bdnf IIA and III mRNA levels than controls. By contrast, in the ventral striatum, maternally separated rodents had significantly lower expression of Bdnf I, IIA, IIC, IV and VI transcripts. Sex differences in Nr3c1, Bag1 and Fkbp5 expression in the VTA and substantia nigra were also detected. Our results suggest that early life stress has long-lasting impacts on brain regions involved in dopamine neurotransmission, changing the trophic environment and potentially altering responsiveness to subsequent stressful events in a sex-specific pattern.

AB  - Memory dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a threat to well-being. Engaging in light-intensity exercise has favorable effects on hippocampal function and molecular profiles, including Mct2 mRNA and miR-200a-3p. Here, we investigated the involvement of exosomal miR-200a-3p secretion from gastrocnemius muscles in T2DM mice undergoing light-intensity exercise intervention, focusing on its potential to ameliorate memory dysfunction. We initially assessed the effects of light-intensity exercise over a 4-week period on memory function, the secretion of gastrocnemius muscle-derived exosomal miR-200a-3p, and hippocampal mRNA. Subsequently, the impact of a daily intraperitoneal injection of the mmu-miR-200a-3p mimic over a 4-week duration on hippocampal dysregulation in ob/ob mice was investigated. The light-intensity exercise intervention improved gastrocnemius muscle-derived and plasma exosomal miR-200a-3p levels in ob/ob mice, concomitant with improved memory dysfunction. Intriguingly, the daily intraperitoneal injection of the mmu-miR-200a-3p mimic also improved memory function in ob/ob mice. Notably, both the exercise intervention and miR-200a-3p mimic treatment induced downregulation in hippocampal Keap1 and upregulation in Hsp90aa1 and Mct2 mRNA in ob/ob mice. These results imply that the augmentation of peripherally derived miR-200a-3p contributes to ameliorating memory dysfunction in T2DM mice undergoing light-intensity exercise, with a possible contribution from gastrocnemius muscle-derived exosomal miR-200a-3p to these exercise effects.

From postnatal day 30 (P30) to P180, the rats lived under standard (STND) or overcrowded (CRWD) conditions. Starting from P100, rat behavior was studied in the social preference and tube dominance tests, and aggressive behavior was investigated in the resident-intruder test. After decapitation of rats on P180, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex were collected and analyzed for expression of the IL-1 beta, TNF, TGF-beta 1, and IL-6 mRNAs by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared to the STND group, rats from the CRWD group demonstrated shorter interaction time with a social object in the social preference test. They also had more wins in the tube test and initiated more attacks in the resident-intruder test. Expression of the IL1 beta gene in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex and of the TGF beta 1 gene in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex was increased in the CRWD group. The stress induced by overcrowding increased social dominance and aggressiveness and decreased social motivation in rats. The changes in the social behavior of CRWD rats were accompanied by upregulation of expression of genes for the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-beta 1 in a number of brain structures, which can be considered as manifestations of neuroinflammation and compensatory processes, respectively.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Guanxin II, proposed by Chen Keji (National master of traditional Chinese medicine), possesses neuroprotective effect. Interestingly, its simplified prescription Danshen-ChuanxiongHonghua (DCH) can also clinically ameliorate cerebral impairment and improve spatial cognitive deficits, similar to the function of original formula. Aim of the study: We aimed to elucidate the rationality of DCH's natural existence, qualitatively identify DCHderived phytochemicals, thereby to validate cerebral protective effect, and expose the potential mechanism of DCH and its main absorbed compound ferulic acid (FA). Materials and methods: The natural rationality of DCH's existence for treating TBI was verified using data mining. The qualitative analysis of DCH extract-derived phytochemicals was conducted through liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Controlled cortical impact (CCI) was chosen to establish TBI model. Neurological behavior tests, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability test, brain water content measurement, and proinflammatory factors consisting of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha of plasma, and HPA axis-related hormone levels of DA, NA, 5-HT, ghrelin, and BDNF in hippocampus were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Network pharmacology was employed to predict potential targets and pathways of DCH intervening TBI. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (D-Lys3) was injected intraperitoneally in TBI rats after waking up. Molecular docking and pharmacological experiment with D-Lys3 were used to verify the pathway. Results: Twenty-six phytochemicals were identified based on LC-MS. FA, as the primary contributor of DCH, alleviated disruption of BBB and reduced brain edema, suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory factors, such as IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, as well as HPA axis-related hormones such as DA, NA, and 5-HT, and ghrelin, and BDNF by regulating the Ghrelin/GHSR pathway. These results were validated by GHSR receptor antagonist, as well as molecule docking. Conclusions: Taken together, DCH, when prescribed for the treatment of TBI, has a certain degree of reasonableness. FA, as the main absorbed component, demonstrated a similar function to DCH in improving the bloodbrain barrier, promoting neural recovery, and anti-inflammatory effects in TBI rats, primarily via modulating Ghrelin/GHSR.

AB  - The cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11/xCT is highly expressed in many cancer cells and plays an important role in antioxidant activity by supplying cysteine for glutathione synthesis. Under glucose-depleted conditions, however, SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake causes oxidative stress and cell death called disulfidptosis, a new form of cell death. We previously reported that high cell density (HD) promotes lysosomal degradation of SLC7A11 in glioblastoma cells, allowing them to survive under glucose-depleted conditions. In this study, we found that the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene, Merlin/NF2 is a key regulator of SLC7A11 in glioblastoma cells at HD. Deletion of Merlin increased SLC7A11 protein level and cystine uptake at HD, leading to promotion of cell death under glucose deprivation. Furthermore, HD significantly decreased SLC7A11 mRNA level, which was restored by Merlin deletion. This study suggests that Merlin suppresses glucose deprivation-induced cell death by downregulating SLC7A11 expression in glioblastoma cells at HD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) emerges as a complex psychosomatic condition, notable for its considerable suicidality and mortality rates. Increasing evidence suggests the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine in mitigating depression symptoms and offsetting the adverse effects associated with conventional Western therapeutics. Notably, clinical trials have revealed the adjunctive antidepressant potential of Kaiyu Zhishen Decoction (KZD) alongside Western medication. However, the standalone antidepressant efficacy of KZD and its underlying mechanisms merit in-depth investigation. Aim of the study: This research aims to elucidate the impact of KZD on MDD and delineate its mechanistic pathways through integrated network pharmacological assessments and empirical in vitro and in vivo analyses. Materials and methods: To ascertain the optimal antidepressant dosage and mechanism of KZD, a Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS)-induced depression model in mice was established to evaluate depressive behaviors. High -Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and network pharmacological approaches were employed to predict KZD ' s antidepressant mechanisms. Subsequently, hippocampal samples were subjected to 4D-DIA proteomic sequencing and validated through Western blot, immunofluorescence, Nissl staining, and pathway antagonist applications. Additionally, cortisol-stimulated PC12 cells were utilized to simulate neuronal damage, analyzing protein and mRNA levels of MAPK-related signals and cell proliferation markers. Results: The integration of network pharmacology and HPLC identified kaempferol and quercetin as KZD ' s principal active compounds for MDD treatment. Proteomic and network pharmacological KEGG pathway analyses indicated the MAPK signaling pathway as a critical regulatory mechanism for KZD ' s therapeutic effect on MDD. KZD was observed to mitigate CUMS-induced upregulation of p-ERK/ERK, CREB, and BDNF protein expressions in hippocampal cells by attenuating oxidative stress, thereby ameliorating neuronal damage and exerting antidepressant effects. The administration of PD98059 counteracted KZD ' s improvements in depressionlike behaviors and downregulated p-ERK/ERK and BDNF protein expressions in the hippocampus. Conclusions: This investigation corroborates KZD ' s pivotal, dose -dependent role in antidepressant activity. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate KZD ' s capacity to modulate the ERK-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway by diminishing ROS expression induced by oxidative stress, enhancing neuronal repair, and thus, manifesting antidepressant properties. Accordingly, KZD represents a promising herbal candidate for further antidepressant research.

AB  - In mouse preimplantation embryos, cell polarity plays a crucial role in the first lineage specification. PATJ and its homolog MPDZ are the main members of CRB-PALS1-PATJ (CRUMBS-Protein associated with Lin7 1-Pals-associated tight junction protein) apical polarity complex. They act as adaptor proteins connecting CRB-PALS1 and tight junction proteins, making them essential for cell polarization and stabilization of apical junctions. However, their roles in regulating trophectoderm differentiation and blastocyst development remain unclear. In this study, PATJ and/or MPDZ were downregulated by the microinjection of specific RNA interference constructs into zygotes. Downregulation of PATJ alone did not severely affect early embryonic development and trophectoderm lineage differentiation although it slowed down the blastocyst formation. Depletion of PATJ and MPDZ did not affect compaction and morula development but impaired blastocyst formation. Furthermore, the expression of trophectoderm-specific transcription factors and trophoblast differentiation was compromised in the absence of PATJ/MPDZ. These abnormalities might result from the breakdown of apical domain in the outer cells of the embryo. The loss of PATJ/MPDZ caused the breakdown of CRB and PAR polarity complexes as well as deficiencies in tight junctions and actin filaments. These defects led to ectopic activation of Hippo signaling in the outer cells of developing embryos, ultimately suppressing Cdx2 expression and trophectoderm differentiation. Altogether, PATJ and MPDZ are essential for trophectoderm lineage differentiation and normal blastocyst morphogenesis via the regulation of the establishment of apical domain, formation of tight junctions, phosphorylation and localization of YAP, and expression of trophectoderm-specific transcription factors.

AB  - Plants are challenged regularly with multiple types of biotic stress factors, such as pathogens or insect herbivores, in their environment. To detect and defend against pathogens, plants have evolved an innate immune system in which intracellular receptors in the so-called effector-triggered immunity play a vital role. In Arabidopsis thaliana the Toll/interleukin-1 receptors (TIRs) domain is related to intracellular immunity receptors, for example in TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) proteins. Among the TIR domain carrying proteins, very little is known about the function of the TIR-X proteins. Here, we focus on the recently described TIR-X (TIRP; At5g44900) to analyze its role in phytohormone-mediated plant defense through gene expression and phytohormone quantification. Therefore, we employed two fungal pathogens, the necrotrophic Alternaria brassicicola and the hemibiotrophic Verticillium dahliae, to infect A. thaliana WT (Col-0), TIRP knock-out, and TIRP overexpressing lines for comparative analyses. Furthermore, we included the insect herbivore Spodoptera littoralis and a treatment with S. littoralis egg extract on the plants to analyze any role of TIRP during these attacks. We found that both A. brassicicola and V. dahliae infections increased TIRP gene expression systemically. The salicylic acid content was higher in the TIRP overexpressing line, corresponding to a better S. littoralis larval growth performance in feeding assays. However, since we never observed clear infection-related differences in jasmonate or salicylic acid levels between the wild type and the two transgenic Arabidopsis lines, our results rule out the possibility that TIRP acts via the regulation of phytohormone synthesis and accumulation.

AB  - Ferroptosis is an iron- and lipid peroxidation-dependent form of regulated cell death. The release of labile iron is one of the important factors affecting sensitivity to ferroptosis. Yes-associated protein (YAP) controls intracellular iron levels by affecting the transcription of ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and transferrin receptor (TFRC). However, whether YAP regulates iron metabolism through other target genes remains unknown. Here, we observed that the system Xc(-) inhibitor erastin inhibited the binding of the WW domain and PSY motif between YAP and transcription factor CP2 (TFCP2), and then suppressed the transcription of ferritin light chain (FTL) simultaneously mediated by YAP, TFCP2 and forkhead box A1 (FOXA1). Furthermore, inhibition of FTL expression abrogated ferroptosis-resistance in cells with sustained YAP expression. Unlike FTH, which exhibited first an increase and then a decrease in transcription, FTL transcription continued to decline after the addition of erastin, and a decrease in lysine acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5)-dependent acetylation of FTL was also observed. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues, lipid peroxidation and labile iron decreased, while YAP, TFCP2 and FTL increased compared to their adjacent normal tissues, and the lipid peroxidation marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) was negatively correlated with the level of FTL or the degree of LUAD malignancy, but LUAD tissues with lower levels of 4-HNE showed a higher sensitivity to ferroptosis. In conclusion, the findings from this study indicated that the suppression of FTL transcription through the inhibition of the YAP-TFCP2-KAT5 complex could be another mechanism for elevating ferroptosis sensitivity and inducing cell death, and ferroptotic therapy is more likely to achieve better results in LUAD patients with a lower degree of lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Postoccupancy evaluation (POE) was used to assess newly constructed zoo exhibits from the perspective of three user groups: zoo staff, zoo visitors, and the animals. Staff represents a generally understudied user group in zoo-based POEs. We asked staff to rate the animals' space, the visitors' space, and the staff's space at previous and new exhibits. We also compared zoo visitors' ratings of the animals' behavior and environments, overall exhibit impressions, and the time visitors spent viewing previous and new exhibits. Lastly, we compared activity and space use of a Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), two red pandas (Ailurus fulgens), and one rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) in their previous and new exhibits. Staff rated animal, visitor, and staff areas higher at the new exhibits compared to the previous exhibits. Visitors also rated several factors higher and spent more time at the new exhibits. The most naturalistic exhibit received the most favorable ratings in all categories and animal activity increased visitor stay time. We found that red pandas were less active in their new exhibit, and the Komodo dragon and rhino showed no difference in activity. The red pandas and the Komodo dragon used more available space in their new exhibits; however, we recommend using Electivity index to examine resource preferences for these species, whose enclosure use has been less studied than large mammals. We emphasize the importance of including staff in zoo-based POE, make other recommendations for future POE studies, and discuss various factors that could have influenced our results.

AB  - Neuronal apoptosis is one of the main pathological processes of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) and is involved in the development of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in neonates. Atorvastatin has been found to have neuroprotective effects in some nervous system diseases, but its role in regulating the pathogenesis of neonatal HIBD remains elusive. Thus, this study aimed to explore the effects and related mechanisms of atorvastatin on the regulation of neuronal apoptosis after HIBD in newborn rats. The rat HIBD model and the neuronal oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model were established routinely. Atorvastatin, cAMP inhibitor (SQ22536), and BDNF inhibitor (ANA-12) were used to treat HIBD rats and OGD neurons. Cerebral infarction, learning and memory ability, cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF signaling molecules, and apoptosis-related indicators (TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl2) were then examined. In vivo, atorvastatin reduced cerebral infarction, improved learning and memory ability, decreased the number of TUNEL-positive neurons, inhibited the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2, and activated the cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF pathway in the cerebral cortex after HIBD. In vitro, atorvastatin also decreased the apoptosis-related indicators and activated the cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF pathway in neurons after OGD. Furthermore, inhibition of cAMP or BDNF attenuated the effect of atorvastatin on the reduction of neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that atorvastatin inhibits HIBD-induced neuronal apoptosis and alleviates brain injury in neonatal rats mainly by activating the cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF pathway. In conclusion, atorvastatin may be developed as a potential drug for the treatment of neonatal HIE.

AB  - Introduction: The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is named after the discovery that endogenous cannabinoids bind to the same receptors as the phytochemical compounds found in Cannabis. While endogenous cannabinoids include anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), exogenous phytocannabinoids include Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These compounds finely tune neurotransmission following synapse activation, via retrograde signaling that activates cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) and/or transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1). Recently, the eCB system has been linked to several neurological diseases, such as neuro-ocular abnormalities, pain insensitivity, migraine, epilepsy, addiction and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the current study, we aim to: (i) highlight a potential link between the eCB system and neurological disorders, (ii) assess if THC exposure alters the expression of eCB-related genes, and (iii) identify evolutionary-conserved residues in CB1R or TRPV1 in light of their function. Methods: To address this, we used several bioinformatic approaches, such as transcriptomic (Gene Expression Omnibus), protein-protein (STRING), phylogenic (BLASTP, MEGA) and structural (Phyre2, AutoDock, Vina, PyMol) analyzes. Results: Using RNA sequencing datasets, we did not observe any dysregulation of eCB-related transcripts in major depressive disorders, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia in the anterior cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens or dorsolateral striatum. Following in vivo THC exposure in adolescent mice, GPR55 was significantly upregulated in neurons from the ventral tegmental area, while other transcripts involved in the eCB system were not affected by THC exposure. Our results also suggest that THC likely induces neuroinflammation following in vitro application on mice microglia. Significant downregulation of TPRV1 occurred in the hippocampi of mice in which a model of temporal lobe epilepsy was induced, confirming previous observations. In addition, several transcriptomic dysregulations were observed in neurons of both epileptic mice and humans, which included transcripts involved in neuronal death. When scanning known interactions for transcripts involved in the eCB system (n = 12), we observed branching between the eCB system and neurophysiology, including proteins involved in the dopaminergic system. Our protein phylogenic analyzes revealed that CB1R forms a clade with CB2R, which is distinct from related paralogues such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, receptors, lysophosphatidic acid receptors and melanocortin receptors. As expected, several conserved residues were identified, which are crucial for CB1R receptor function. The anandamide-binding pocket seems to have appeared later in evolution. Similar results were observed for TRPV1, with conserved residues involved in receptor activation. Conclusion: The current study found that GPR55 is upregulated in neurons following THC exposure, while TRPV1 is downregulated in temporal lobe epilepsy. Caution is advised when interpreting the present results, as we have employed secondary analyzes. Common ancestors for CB1R and TRPV1 diverged from jawless vertebrates during the late Ordovician, 450 million years ago. Conserved residues are identified, which mediate crucial receptor functions.

AB  - A decline of estrogen level leads to spatial learning and memory impairments, which mediated by hippocampus and cortex. Accumulating evidences demonstrated that aerobic exercise improved memory of postmenopausal women and ovariectomized (OVX) mice. However, the molecular mechanisms for this protection of exercise are not completely clear. Accordingly, the present study was designed to examine the effect of aerobic exercise on the dendritic morphology in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as the BNDF-mTOR signaling pathway of OVX mice. Adult female C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups (n = 10/group): sham-operated (SHAM/CON), sham-operated with 8-week treadmill exercise (SHAM/EX), ovariectomized operated (OVX/CON), and ovariectomized operated with exercise (OVX/EX). Aerobic exercise improved the impairment of dendritic morphology significantly induced by OVX that was tested by Golgi staining, and it also upregulated the synaptic plasticity-related protein expression of PSD95 and GluR1 as well as activated BDNF-mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In conclusion, aerobic exercise reversed the change of dendritic morphology and increased the synaptic plasticity-related protein expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of OVX mice. The positive effects induced by exercise might be mediated through the BDNF-mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cogni-tive dysfunction and an impaired ability to carry out daily life functions. Mitochondrial dysfunction and l3-amyloid (Al3) deposition are the most common causes of AD. Antioxidants have been shown to delay brain aging and AD development; however, it remains unknown whether the antioxidant peptide SS31 can protect mitochondrial and synaptic function and delay the progression of behavioral deficits in early -stage AD in vivo. Therefore, in this study we compared mitochondrial and synaptic changes, as well as the protective effects of SS31, in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and C57BL/6J control mice. The APP/PS1 transgenic mice exhibited elevated expression of Al340/Al342 and mitochondrial fission protein DLP1 and reduced expression of synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) reductions, as well as increased levels of neuronal apoptosis and ROS in the hippocampus, and long-term treatment with SS31 reversed these effects. Furthermore, the cognitive impairments observed in APP/PS1 transgenic mice were reversed by SS31 treatment. Our findings show that SS31 lowers ROS and Al3 levels, protecting mitochondrial homeostasis and synaptic integrity, and ultimately improving behavioral deficits in early -stage AD. This suggests that SS31 is a potential pharmacological agent for treating or slowing the pro-gression of AD.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Simple Summary There is increasing evidence showing that the pathophysiology of several forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is characterized by microcirculatory dysfunction, which may in fact precede clinical manifestations. For several decades, food supplements have been explored with the aim of restoring microcirculation. Considering the increasing growth of the food supplement industry in recent years and the great impact that CVD has on human health, the present study aimed to provide an up-to-date review of the literature on the role of food supplementation in microcirculation. In this work, the main legal aspects in the European Union and the United States of America concerning food supplements and the beneficial effect that these supplements may have on the population for microcirculation are discussed. Although further studies are needed, especially in humans, there are some data that suggest the beneficial effect of the following supplements: Ruscus aculeatus L., Centella asiatica L., Ginkgo biloba L., Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Crataegus spp., Ginseng, Mangifera indica L., Aesculus hippocastanum L., Hamamelis virginiana L., and Vitis vinifera L. (1) Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health concern worldwide and a key cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Accumulating evidence shows that several CVD forms are characterized by significant microcirculatory dysfunction, which may both cause and be caused by macrovascular disease, often preceding clinical manifestations by several years. Therefore, interest in exploring food supplements to prevent and restore microcirculation has grown. Given the continuous need to expand the available therapeutic arsenal for CVD, the food supplements market has recently grown and is expected to continue growing. (2) Methods: We provide an authoritative up-to-date comprehensive review of the impact of food supplementation on microcirculation by analyzing the European and American legal food supplements framework and the importance of food safety/food quality in this industry. We review the main literature about food bioactive compounds with a focus on microcirculation and some main food supplements with proven benefits. (3) Results: Despite a lack of scientific evidence, diet and microcirculatory function are clearly connected. The main food supplement examples in the literature with potential beneficial effects on microcirculation are: Ruscus aculeatus L., Centella asiatica L., Ginkgo biloba L., Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Crataegus spp., Ginseng, Mangifera indica L., Aesculus hippocastanum L., Hamamelis virginiana L., and Vitis vinifera L. (4) Conclusions: Further clinical trials are necessary to better explore the effects of these food supplements.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common mental illness characterised by abnormal and depressed emotions. Total paeony glycoside (TPG) is a naturally active saponin extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Radix Paeoniae rubra. However, the antidepressant and neuroinflammatory effects of TPG have not been thoroughly studied. Purpose: To study the therapeutic potential of TGP in depression caused by neuronal injury and neuroinflammation and to explore the mechanism of TGP and the relationship between the NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptosis, and autophagy. Study design: A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression model and a cell model of corticosterone (CORT)-induced hippocampal neuron injury were established to evaluate the therapeutic effects of TPG. Methods: The composition of TPG was analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The effects of TPG and fluoxetine on depression-like behaviour, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, pyroptosis, and mitochondrial autophagy in the mice models were evaluated. Results: TGP alleviated depression-like behaviours in mice and inhibited hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. The secretion of inflammatory cytokines was significantly reduced in CORT-induced hippocampal neuron cells and in the serum of a mouse model of CUMS-induced depression. In addition, TGP treatment reduced the levels of NLRP3 family pyrin structural domains, including NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, and IL-1 beta, and the pyroptosis related proteins such as GSDMD-N. Importantly, TPG attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction, promoted the clearance of damaged mitochondria, and the activation of mitochondrial autophagy, which reduced ROS accumulation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. An in-depth study observed that the regulatory effect of TPG on autophagy was attenuated by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) in vitro and in vivo. However, administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Belnacasan (VX-765) successfully inhibited pyroptosis and showed a synergistic therapeutic effect with TPG. Conclusion: These results indicate that TPG can repair neuronal damage by activating autophagy, restoring mitochondrial function, and reducing inflammation-mediated pyroptosis, thereby playing an important role in

AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have unique characteristics, such as self-renewal and pluripotency, which are distinct from those of other cell types. These characteristics of hESCs are tightly regulated by complex signaling mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate that yes-associated protein (YAP) functions in an hESC-specific manner to maintain self-renewal and survival in hESCs. hESCs were highly sensitive to YAP downregulation to promote cell survival. Interestingly, hESCs displayed dynamic changes in YAP expression in response to YAP downregulation. YAP was critical for the maintenance of self-renewal. Additionally, the function of YAP in maintenance of self-renewal and cell survival was hESC-specific. Doxycycline upregulated YAP in hESCs and attenuated the decreased cell survival induced by YAP downregulation. However, decreased expression of self-renewal markers triggered by YAP downregulation and neural/cardiac differentiation were affected by doxycycline treatment. Collectively, the results reveal the mechanism underlying the role of YAP and the novel function of doxycycline in hESCs.

AB  - Background: Social isolation has been suggested to increase the risk to develop cognitive decline. However, our knowledge on causality and neurobiological underpinnings is still limited.
   Methods: In this preregistered analysis, we tested the impact of social isolation on central features of brain and cognitive ageing using a longitudinal population-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. We assayed 1992 cognitively healthy participants (50-82years old, 921women) at baseline and 1409 participants after similar to 6y follow-up.
   Results: We found baseline social isolation and change in social isolation to be associated with smaller volumes of the hippocampus and clusters of reduced cortical thickness. Furthermore, poorer cognitive functions (memory, processing speed, executive functions) were linked to greater social isolation, too.
   Conclusions: Combining advanced neuroimaging outcomes with prevalent lifestyle characteristics from a well-characterized population of middle- to older aged adults, we provide evidence that social isolation contributes to human brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Within-subject effects of social isolation were similar to between-subject effects, indicating an opportunity to reduce dementia risk by promoting social networks.

AB  - The dentate gyrus subregion of the mammalian hippocampus is an adult neural stem cell niche and site of lifelong neurogenesis. Hypotheses regarding the role of adult-born neuron synaptic integration in hippocampal circuit function are framed by robust estimations of adultborn versus pre/perinatally-born neuron number. In contrast, the non-neurogenic functions of adult neural stem cells and their immediate progeny, such as secretion of bioactive growth factors and expression of extracellular matrix-modifying proteins, lack similar framing due to few estimates of their number versus other prominent secretory cells. Here, we apply immunohistochemical methods to estimate cell density of neural stem/progenitor cells versus other major classes of glial and endothelial cell types that are potentially secretory in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. Of the cell types quantified, we found that GFAP(+)SOX2(+) stellate astrocytes were the most numerous, followed by CD31(+) endothelia, GFAP-SOX2(+) intermediate progenitors, Olig2(+) oligodendrocytes, Iba1(+) microglia, and GFAP(+)SOX2(+) radial glia-like neural stem cells. We did not observe any significant sex differences in density of any cell population. Notably, neural stem/progenitor cells were present at a similar density as several cell types known to have potent functional roles via their secretome. These findings may be useful for refining hypotheses regarding the contributions of these cell types to regulating hippocampal function and their potential therapeutic uses. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol# 2016A00000068) on July 14, 2016.

AB  - Background: The Chinese medicines Borneolum and L-Borneolum have neuroprotective effects on acute cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) in rats. Research on their effects during recovery from cerebral IR is lacking. Cerebral ischaemia can activate astrocytes for conversion into neurons. Neurogenesis cannot be achieved without nutri-tional support from an improved brain microenvironment through the blood circulation.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether Borneolum and L-Borneolum can promote trans-differentiation of astrocytes into neurons by regulating the Wnt/Notch pathway to exert neuroprotective effects during recovery from cerebral ischaemia.
   Study design and Methods: A suture crossing the external carotid artery to occlude the middle cerebral artery was used to prepare a model of cerebral IR (Longa et al., 1989). The Longa neurological function score, modified neurological severity score, tape removal test and grid misstep experiment were used to evaluate motor nerve function. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride was used to determine the extent of cerebral infarction. Left/right hemisphere contrast was used to measure brain atrophy. Astrocytes labelled with adeno-associated virus were used to track their fate after transdifferentiation. Laser speckle contrast imaging was used to observe the effects of L-Borneolum and Borneolum on cerebral blood flow. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to investigate their mechanisms.
   Results: L-Borneolum and Borneolum significantly improved neurological function and limb movement in rats with cerebral ischaemia during recovery and increased cerebral blood flow. L-Borneolum improved forelimb motor coordination more effectively than Borneolum and promoted transdifferentiation of astrocytes to GABAergic neurons in the striatal region. The expression of Wnt3a and Notch-1 was downregulated. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was not significantly changed. Borneolum improved forelimb sensitivity and alleviated cerebral infarction and brain atrophy more effectively than L-Borneolum, which pro-moted transdifferentiation of astrocytes into neurons and nestin expression and neurogenesis in the striatal zone. The expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and beta-catenin was upregulated. L-Borneolum and Borneolum had no significant neuroprotective effect on the cortex and hippocampus.
   Conclusions: L-Borneolum and Borneolum exerted neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischaemia during recovery by promoting neurogenesis and blood circulation in the striatal and subventricular zones. Their mechanisms may be related to the Wnt3a and Notch-1 pathways.

AB  - The present study was conducted to observe the effects of removal of seminal plasma of Pantja buck semen and supplementation of bovine seminal plasma (BSP) in the extender before cryopreservation. In a preliminary experiment, different levels of BSP were supplemented (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9% v/v) in egg yolk (7.5% egg yolk)-tris (EYT) extender and used for cryopreservation of Pantja buck semen. Results in terms of motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and lipid peroxidation showed that 5% BSP was suitable for maintaining Pantja buck semen quality during cryopreservation. In the final experiment, pooled semen from four Pantja bucks was split into three aliquots (I, II, and III). Aliquot I was directly diluted in EYT extender and grouped as the control (C); aliquot II and III were washed separately with TALP solution and diluted as D1 (Washed semen with EYT extender) and D2 (Washed semen with EYT extender containing 5% BSP), respectively. Seminal attributes (sperm individual motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and total morphological abnormalities) were assessed at the postdilution, postequilibration, and post-thawing stages. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity were measured at post-thaw. Washed semen significantly improved (p < 0.05) seminal parameters at post-thaw compared with unwashed semen (control). A significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed in seminal attributes between freezing stages and between dilution groups. Significantly higher (p < 0.05) post-thaw sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and GSH-Px activity, and significantly lower (p < 0.05) MDA concentration and extracellular release of enzymes (ALT, AST) were observed in group D2 compared with control and D1. The results of the present study demonstrated that cryopreservation of washed Pantja buck semen diluted with 5% BSP-supplemented EYT extender can improve post-thaw semen quality.

AB  - The hippocampus is an allocortex structure involved in many complex processes, from memory formation to spatial navigation. It starts developing during prenatal life but acquires its adult functional properties around the peripubertal age, in both humans and mice. Such prolonged maturation is accompanied by structural changes in microcircuitry and functional changes involving biochemical and electrophysiological events. Moreover, hippocampus undergoes plasticity phenomena throughout life. In murine rodents, the most relevant maturation steps in Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampal subfield occur during the third-fourth weeks of life. During this period, also the expression and localization of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA) refines: many regulatory (R1A) PKA clusters appear, bound to the cytoskeleton. Here the binding characteristics of R1A are determined in CA1 by using confocal microscopy. Apparently, two binding sites are present with no evidence of cooperativity. Equilibrium dissociation constant is estimated around 22.9 nM. This value is lower from that estimated for R1A in soluble form, suggesting a different binding site conformation or accessibility in the tissue. The method described here may be useful to track the developmental changes in binding activity, which affects cAMP availability at selected intracellular microzones. Possible relations with functional consequences are discussed.

AB  - Background: Hyperlipidemia is a common metabolic disorder and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The traditional medicine herb, Hippophae rhamnoides L., known as sea buckthorn, has anti-obesity and lipid-lowering effects, while Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn, known as milk thistle, has hepatoprotective properties and exhibits antioxidant effects. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of sea buckthorn and milk thistle solid beverage (H-S solid beverage) in alleviating hyperlipidemia in rats and explore the underlying mechanisms by analyzing plasma and liver metabolomics, lipidomics, and liver transcriptomics. Methods: A hyperlipidemic rat model was established after 2 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in Sprague Dawley rats. The administered doses of H-S solid beverage were 0.30 g/kg/d, 0.15 g/kg/d and 0.075 g/kg/d. Serum biochemical parameter detection, histopathological section analysis, untargeted plasma and liver metabolomics, lipidomics, and liver transcriptomics were performed to determine the therapeutic effects of H-S solid beverage and predict the related pathways in rats with hyperlipidemia. Changes in genes and proteins related to lipid metabolism were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Results: Eighty-nine components were identified in H-S solid beverage using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry, with flavonoids being the major constituents. The H-S solid beverage significantly reduced body weight, liver index, body fat percentage, lipid accumulation, and liver injury in HFD-fed rats. Fatty acids (FA), bile acid, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, triglyceride, cholesterol ester, diglyceride and phosphatidylinositol levels were significantly altered in the liver and plasma. Moreover, the transcriptomic analysis suggested that H-S solid beverage significantly altered the hepatic gene expression of cholesterol synthesis (Pdk4, Hmgcs1, and Dhcr24), lipogenesis (Scd, Angptl4, and Angptl8), and FA beta-oxidation (Cpt1 alpha, Ppar delta, Acsl, Pgc-1 alpha, and Pla2g2d). Conclusion: The solid beverage of sea buckthorn and milk thistle was firstly demonstrated to ameliorate HFDinduced hyperlipidemia. The lipid-lowering and hepatoprotective effects of H-S solid beverage significantly

AB  - Background: Regulating the microglial phenotype is an attractive strategy for treating diseases of the central nervous system such as depression and anxiety. Gastrodin can quickly cross the blood-brain barrier and mitigate microglia-mediated inflammation, which widely used to treat a variety of central nervous system diseases associated with microglial dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanism by which gastrodin regulates the functional phenotype of microglia remains unclear.
   Purpose: Since the transcription factor "nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2'' (Nrf2) is associated with the anti-inflammatory effects of gastrodin, we hypothesized that gastrodin induces Nrf2 expression in microglia and thereby programs an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Study design: Male C57BL/6 mice, treated or not with gastrodin, were given lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 0.25 mg/ kg/d for 10 days to induce chronic neuroinflammation. The effects of gastrodin on microglial phenotypes, neuroinflammation and depression- and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated. In another experiment, animals were treated with Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 throughout the 13-day gastrodin intervention period.
   Methods: The effects of gastrodin on depression- and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated through the sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, open field test and elevated plus-maze test; as well as its effects on morphology and molecular and functional phenotypes of hippocampal microglia through immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
   Results: Chronic exposure to LPS caused hippocampal microglia to secrete inflammatory cytokines, their somata to enlarge, and their dendrites to lose branches. These changes were associated with depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. Gastrodin blocked these LPS-induced alterations and promoted an Arg-1(+) microglial phenotype that protected neurons from injury. The effects of gastrodin were associated with Nrf2 activation, whereas blockade of Nrf2 antagonized gastrodin.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that gastrodin acts via Nrf2 to promote an Arg-1(+) microglial phenotype, which buffers the harmful effects of LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Gastrodin may be a promising drug against central nervous system diseases that involve microglial dysfunction.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tinospora cordifolia (TC) a potential medicinal herb, has been ethnobotanically used as an eco-friendly supplement to manage various diseases, including cerebral fever. Earlier studies have shown that TC exhibits diverse beneficial effects, including hepatoprotective and neuroprotective effects. However, the effects of TC remain unexplored in animal models of encephalopathy including hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Aim of the study: To evaluate the effects of TC stem extract against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced behavioural and molecular alterations in HE rats. Methods and materials: The extract was preliminarily screened through phytochemical and HR-LC/MS analysis. Animals were pre-treated with TC extract at doses 30 and 100 mg/kg, orally. Following 7 days of TC pretreatment, HE was induced by administering TAA (300 mg/kg, i. p. thrice). Behavioural assessments were performed after 56 h of TAA first dose. The animals were then sacrificed to assess biochemical parameters in serum, liver and brain. Liver tissue was used for immunoblotting and histological studies to evaluate inflammatory and fibrotic signalling. Moreover, brain tissue was used to evaluate brain edema, activation of glial cells (GFAP, IBA-1) and NF-kappa B/NLRP3 downstream signalling via immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis in cortex and hippocampus. Results: The pre-treatment with TC extract effective mitigated TAA-induced behavioural alterations, lowered serum LFT (AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin) and oxidative stress markers in liver and brain. TC treatment significantly modulated hyperammonemia, cerebral edema and preserved the integrity of BBB proteins in HE animals. TC treatment attenuated TAA-induced histological changes, tissue inflammation (pNF-kappa B (p65), TNF-alpha, NLRP3) and fibrosis (collagen, alpha-SMA) in liver. In addition, immunoblotting analysis revealed TC pre-treatment inhibited fibrotic proteins such as vimentin, TGF-beta 1 and pSmad2/3 in the liver. Our study further showed that TC treatment downregulated the expression of MAPK/NF-kappa B inflammatory signalling, as well as GFAP and IBA-1 (glial cell markers) in cortex and hippocampus of TAA-intoxicated rats. Additionally, TC-treated animals exhibited reduced expression of caspase3/9 and BAX induced by TAA. Conclusion: This study revealed promising insights on the protective effects of TC against HE. The findings clearly demonstrated that the significant inhibition of MAPK/NF-kappa B signalling and glial cell activation could be responsible for the observed beneficial effects of TC in TAA-induced HE rats.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning stress causes retarded growth, gut disorder and dysfunction, severe diarrhea and higher mortality in weaned piglets. Antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) have been conventionally used to alleviate the negative effects of weaning stress. However, the long-term use of AGP leads to various adverse effects, such as antimicrobial resistance and food drug residues, and threatens public safety. Therefore, AGP should be replaced with residue-free, pollution-free and toxin-free alternatives because several countries and regions have banned the use of AGP in the feed industry. This study investigates the effects of an encapsulated organic acid and essential oil mixture (OAEO) on the growth performance, immuno-antioxidant capacity and intestinal health of weaned piglets. The results reveal that OAEO as an alternative to AGP improved the growth performance, immuno-antioxidant status and intestinal health of weaned piglets partly by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway and suppressing the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. This study investigates the effects of an encapsulated organic acid and essential oil mixture (OAEO) on the growth performance, immuno-antioxidant capacity and intestinal health of weaned piglets. In total, 120 weaned piglets (23 days of age; 6.96 +/- 0.08 kg) were randomly allotted to four treatments (six replicates/group; five piglets/replicate): the control group (CON) was fed the basal diet (BD), the antibiotic growth promoters group (AGP) received the BD with 20 mg/kg colistin sulphate and 10 mg/kg bacitracin zinc, and OAEO1 and OAEO2 were fed the BD with 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg OAEO, respectively. The trial lasted 21 days and then one piglet per replicate was selected for sample collection. OAEO increased the average daily gain, spleen index, serum interleukin (IL)-10, immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA levels; serum superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities; and jejunal villus height (VH), VH/crypt depth, goblet cell number, and amylase and trypsin activities (p < 0.05) compared with CON but reduced the diarrhea rate, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, malondialdehyde (MDA), and (D)-lactic acid contents and diamine oxidase (DAO) activity (p < 0.05). OAEO also increased the jejunal zonula occludens-1, occludin, claudin-1, mucin-2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), GPX and IL-10 mRNA levels, GPX activity and IL-10 content (p < 0.05) compared with CON but reduced jejunal MDA, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha contents and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and TNF-alpha mRNA levels (p < 0.05). In addition, AGP increased ADG, serum IgA level and GPX activity, jejunal trypsin activity and IL-10 content and mRNA level (p < 0.05) compared with CON but reduced the serum TNF-alpha content and DAO activity and jejunal NF-kappa B mRNA level (p < 0.05). Overall, OAEO as an alternative to AGP improved the growth performance, immuno-antioxidant status and gut health of weaned piglets partly via activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway and suppressing the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is an abundant central nervous system amino acid derivative that is tightly coupled to mitochondria and energy metabolism in neurons. A reduced NAA signature is a prominent early pathological biomarker in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and becomes progressively more pronounced as disease advances. Because NAA synthesis requires aspartate drawn directly from mitochondria, we argued that this process is in direct competition with oxidative phosphorylation for substrate and that sustained high levels of NAA synthesis would be incompatible with pathological energy crisis. We show here that over-expression of the rate-limiting NAA synthetic enzyme in the hippocampus of the 5x familial Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD) mouse results in an exaggerated pathological ATP deficit and accelerated cognitive decline. Over-expression of NAA synthase did not increase amyloid burden or result in cell loss but did significantly deplete mitochondrial aspartate and impair the ability of mitochondria to oxidize glutamate for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. These results define NAA as a sink for energetic substrate and suggest initial pathological reductions in NAA are part of a response to energetic crisis designed to preserve substrate bioavailability for mitochondrial ATP synthesis.

AB  - Lipid metabolism has been considered as a potential therapeutic target in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity that can potentially affect the learning and memory function in the developmental brain. Recently, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is identified as a crucial step in regulating lipid metabolism and associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, it is reported that quercetin modified Cu2-xSe (abbreviated as CSPQ) nanoparticles can ameliorate sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity by tuning the microglial lipid metabolism and promoting microglial M2-like polarization via TREM2 signaling pathway, in which the apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters (ABCA1 and ABCG1) levels are upregulated. Furthermore, the protective effects of CSPQ nanoparticles against sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity via TREM2 are further demonstrated by the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-TREM2 transfected BV2 cells, which are obviously not influenced by CSPQ nanoparticles. The cell membrane coated CSPQ (referred as CSPQ@CM) nanoparticles can significantly reduce sevoflurane-induced learning and memory deficits, improve lipid metabolism dysfunction, and promote the remyelination in the hippocampus of mice. The study shows great potential of targeting microglial lipid metabolism in promoting remyelination of neurons for treatment of neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Lipid droplets as the components of myelin sheath and neuron cell membranes play an important role in the brain. Sevoflurane exposures in the neonatal can lead to developmental neurotoxicity through dysmyelination. Quercetin functionalized Cu2-xSe nanoparticles are used to modulate the lipid metabolism and polarization of microglia to improve the sevoflurane induced-developmental neurotoxicity by targeting the surface TREM2.image

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevant: Dendrobium is a traditional and precious Chinese medicinal herb. The Compendium of Materia Medica describes its effects as "benefiting intelligence and dispelling shock, lightning the body and extending life". Dendrobium nobile Lindl. is a precious variety of Dendrobium. Our previous data showed Dendrobium nobile Lindl. alkaloid (DNLA) has significant neuroprotective effects and can improve cognitive dysfunction. However, the specific effects and mechanisms of action of its main active component, DNLA, on cognitive dysfunction caused by Tau hyperphosphorylation, are still unclear. Aim of the research: This study aimed to determine the effects of DNLA on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) pathway, thus to explore the mechanisms of DNLA to inhibit Tau hyperphosphorylation. Materials and methods: We used wortmannin (WM) and GF-109203X (GFX)-induced hyperphosphorylation of Tau in N2a cells and rats to detect the protective mechanism of DNLA in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, the effect of modeling method on Tau hyperphosphorylation was screened and verified by Western Blotting (WB), and the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway by different concentrations of DNLA was detected by WB. In vivo, MWM was used to detect the effect of DNLA on model rats, and then Nissl staining was used to detect the loss of neurons. Finally, WB was used to detect the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway by different concentrations of DNLA. Results: DNLA could rescue the abnormal PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway and reverse the hyperphosphorylation of Tau induced by WM and GFX in N2a cells. Furthermore, DNLA improved the learning and memory of WM and GFX-induced model rats. Moreover, DNLA regulated PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta pathway and reduced the p-Tau and neuronal damage in the hippocampus of model rats. Conclusion: DNLA may be a promising candidate for reducing hyperphosphorylation of Tau.

AB  - The human heterozygous 15q13.3 microdeletion is associated with neuropathological disorders, most prominently with epilepsy and intellectual disability. The 1.5 Mb deletion encompasses six genes (FAN1 [MTMR15], MTMR10, TRPM1, KLF13, OTUD7A, and CHRNA7); all but one (TRPM1) are expressed in the brain. The 15q13.3 microdeletion causes highly variable neurological symptoms, and confounding factors may contribute to a more severe phenotype. CHRNA7 and KLF13 are involved in immune system regulation and altered immune responses may contribute to neurological deficits. We used the Df[h15q13]/+ transgenic mouse model with a heterozygous deletion of the orthologous region (Het) to test the hypothesis that the microdeletion increases innate immune responses compared to wild type (WT). Male and female mice were acutely challenged with the bacteriomimetic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) or the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C), 5 mg/ kg). Hippocampal mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were determined three hours after injection using quantitative PCR analysis. In controls, expression was not affected by sex or genotype. LPS and Poly(I:C) resulted in significantly increased hippocampal expression of cytokines, chemokines, and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), with more robust increases for TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, CXCL1, and CCL2 by LPS, higher induction of IFN gamma by Poly(I:C), and similar increases of CCL4 and CCL5 by both agents. Generally, Hets exhibited stronger responses than WT mice, and significant effects of genotype or genotype x treatment interactions were detected for CXCL1 and CCL5, and IL-6, IL-1 beta, and CCL4, respectively, after LPS. Sex differences were detected for some targets. LPS but not Poly(I:C), reduced overnight burrowing independent of sex or genotype, suggesting that LPS induced sickness behavior. Thus, mice carrying the microdeletion have an increased innate immune response following a LPS challenge, but further studies will have to determine the extent and mechanisms of altered immune activation and subsequent contributions to 15q13.3 microdeletion associated deficits.

AB  - Elephant dung is densely packed with undigested fiber, complicating disposal. To manage this waste more efficiently, the dung was converted into biofuel briquettes. Four variables in the briquette production were investigated using three levels of optimization techniques, including a response surface and a central composite design with 95 % confidence. The results show that when compressing a 7:3:1 weight ratio of elephant dung, binder, and water at 40 bars, a briquette density of 613 kg/m3 or 9.09 GJ/m3 could be achieved. Although its dimensional stability was consistent and its shatter resistance was acceptable, its water resistance was poor. The briquettes had atomic ratios of 0.15 and 1.17 for H/C and O/C, respectively. It had a high heating value of 17 MJ/kg and could enhance the stove's overall thermal efficiency by 22 %. The emission study demonstrated that the combustion of the briquettes released mainly CO2 (5.49 x 104 ppm), whereas other gases were negligible.

AB  - Research question: Can the addition of progesterone and neurotensin, molecular agents found in the female reproductive tract, after sperm washing increase the fertilization potential of human spermatozoa? Design: (i) Cohort study of 24 men. Spermatozoa selected by swim -up were incubated in either progesterone or neurotensin (0.1-100 mu M) for 1-4 h, and hyperactive motility and binding to hyaluronan (0.1-100 mu M) were assessed. The effect of progesterone 10 mu M on sperm function was assessed in a blinded manner, including: hyperactive motility, binding to hyaluronan, tyrosine phosphorylation, acrosome reaction and oxidative DNA damage. (i) Embryo safety testing [one -cell mouse embryo assay (MEA), endotoxin and sterility counts (n = 3)] in preclinical embryo models of IVF (murine and porcine, n = 7 each model) and a small preliminary human study (n = 4) of couples undergoing standard IVF with oocytes inseminated with spermatozoa +/- 10 mu M progesterone. Results: Progesterone 10 mu M increased sperm binding to hyaluronan, hyperactive motility and tyrosine phosphorylation (all P < 0.05). Neurotensin had no effect (P > 0.05). Progesterone 10 mu M in human embryo culture media passed embryo safety testing (MEA, endotoxin concentration and sterility plate count). In preclinical models of IVF, the exposure of spermatozoa to progesterone 10 mu M and oocytes to progesterone 1 mu M was not detrimental, and increased the fertilization rate in mice and the blastocyst cell number in mice and pigs (all P <= 0.03). In humans, every transferred blastocyst that had been produced from spermatozoa exposed to progesterone resulted in a live birth. Conclusion: The addition of progesterone to sperm preparation media shows promise as an adjunct to current methods for increasing fertilization potential. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine the clinical utility of progesterone for improving IVF outcomes.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis occurs particularly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle. This continuous addition of neurons to pre-existing neuronal networks is essential for intact cognitive and olfactory functions, respectively. Purinergic signaling modulates adult neurogenesis, however, the role of individual purinergic receptor subtypes in this dynamic process and related cognitive performance is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the role of P2Y(2) receptor in the neurogenic niches and in related forebrain functions such as spatial working memory and olfaction using mice with a targeted deletion of the P2Y(2) receptor (P2Y2(-/-)). Proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) were analyzed by BrdU assay and immunohistochemistry; signal transduction pathway components were analyzed by immunoblot. In P2Y2(-/-) mice, proliferation of NPCs in the SGZ and the SVZ was reduced. However, migration, neuronal fate decision, and survival were not affected. Moreover, p-Akt expression was decreased in P2Y2(-/-) mice. P2Y2(-/-) mice showed an impaired performance in the Y-maze and a higher latency in the hidden food test. These data indicate that the P2Y(2) receptor plays an important role in NPC proliferation as well as in hippocampus-dependent working memory and olfactory function.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of airway obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. Most patients with asthma present a "type 2" (TH2) inflammation. ILC2 and TH2 cells release cytokines IL4, IL-13 and IL-5. CRSwNP is a condition characterized by hyposmia or anosmia, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, and face pain or pressure that last for at least 12 weeks in a row without relief. Both asthma and CRSwNP are often characterized by a type 2 inflammation endotype and are often present in the same patient. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-4 receptor & alpha; (IL-4R & alpha;) subunit, blocking IL4/IL-4R & alpha; binding and IL13. It has been labelled for the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in patients from the age of 12 years with an eosinophilic phenotype, and it has demonstrated efficacy and acceptable safety. Our study aims to investigate the effects of dupilumab on type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, such as eosinophils and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). ECP is an eosinophil-derived substance contained in granules that are released during inflammation and causes various biological effects, including tissue damage in asthmatic airways. Methods: ECP, Eosinophil counts (EOS), and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were longitudinally measured using immunoassays in the serum of 21 patients affected by CRSwNP, of which 17 had asthma as a comorbidity, receiving 300 mg dupilumab every two weeks. Results: The EOS and ECP, after a first phase of significant increase due to the intrinsic characteristic of the block of IL-4 and IL-13, returned to the baseline 10 months after the initial administration of dupilumab. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and serum total IgE decreased significantly after 9 months. Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores improved after dupilumab treatment. FEV1% and FEV1 absolute registered a significant improvement at 10 months. Conclusions: Patients who received 300 milligrams of dupilumab every two weeks first experienced a temporary increase in eosinophils (EOS) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), then exhibited a gradual decline in these variables with a subsequent return to the initial baseline levels. When compared to the baseline, we observed that the levels of IgE and FeNO decreased over time, while there was an increase in both FEV1 and FEV1%.

AB  - Following the promising performance of the seamless morphing trailing edge (SMTE) flap and its internal actuation system, the elephant trunk mechanism (ETM), investigated through aerodynamic and structural analyses, this study presents an experimental analysis of the SMTE flap equipped with an elephant trunk actuation mechanism. The morphing wing model was prototyped using a 3D printer. Four elephant trunk morphing ribs were embedded inside the flap section, all covered with a flexible skin. The control system for flap actuation was installed in the wing box corresponding to four elephant trunk mechanisms using an appropriate graphical interface to control the SMTE flap deflections. The completed model was further tested in a subsonic wind tunnel to validate the numerical aerodynamic results, as well as the functionality of the elephant trunk mechanism in real conditions. The results confirm the reliability and practicability of the proposed elephant trunk mechanism for actuation, and a very good agreement was obtained between the numerical aerodynamic data and wind tunnel test results.

   The biological characteristics of E. faecium R1 and the effect of dietary supplementation with E. faecium R1 on the growth performance of weaned piglets were studied. The results showed that E. faecium R1 had the characteristics of effective bacteriostatic activity, acid resistance, bile salt resistance, and high-temperature resistance. Dietary supplementation with E. faecium R1 (6.5 x 10(6) CFU/g) improved intestinal function of weaning piglets by decreasing diarrhea incidence. Further research found that dietary supplementation with E. faecium R1 (6.5 x 10(6) CFU/g) attenuated intestinal and liver injury in piglets challenged by lipopolysaccharide.
   In this study, a strain of E. faecium R1 with effective bacteriostatic activity, acid resistance, bile salt resistance, high-temperature resistance was screened. To study the effect of E. faecium R1 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal and liver injury in piglets, twenty-four weaned female piglets were randomly assigned into one of three groups (8 piglets per group). Piglets in the control group and LPS group were fed a basal diet, piglets in the E. faecium group were fed the basal diet supplemented with E. faecium R1 (6.5 x 10(6) CFU/g). On day 21 of the trial, piglets in the LPS group and E. faecium group were intraperitoneally administered LPS (100 mu g/kg), piglets in the control group were administered the same volume of saline. Subsequently, blood samples were collected at 3 h, and intestinal, liver, and pancreas samples were collected at 6 h. Results showed that E. faecium R1 supplementation significantly decreased the diarrhea rate and feed to gain ratio, and dramatically reduced LPS-induced intestinal and liver injury in piglets. Compared with the LPS group, E. faecium R1 supplementation significantly increased the content of glucagon in plasma and IL-1 beta in the liver, and the mRNA levels of villin in jejunum and ileum and Bcl-xL and pBD-L in the ileum, and significantly decreased the contents of prostaglandin 2 and malondialdehyde in the liver and the activities of myeloperoxidase and aspartate aminotransferase in plasma in piglets. Moreover, E. faecium R1 improved the pancreatic antioxidant capacity in piglets, which was indicated by a significant increase in catalase activity and a decrease in total nitric oxide synthase activity. In summary, dietary supplementation with E. faecium R1 alleviates intestinal and liver injury in LPS-challenged piglets.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases and cancer are leading global causes of morbidity and mortality, necessitating advances in diagnosis and treatment. Doxorubicin (Doxo), a potent chemotherapy drug, causes long-term heart damage due to cardiotoxicity. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) carry bioactive molecules-such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids-that can modulate gene expression and signaling pathways in recipient cells, including cardiomyocytes. Through the delivery of cytokines, microRNAs, and growth factors, sEVs can influence cell survival, which plays a critical role in the development of cardiotoxicity. This study investigates the role of sEVs derived from breast cancer cells treated or not with Doxo and their potential to induce cardiomyocyte damage, thereby contributing to cardiotoxicity. We isolated sEVs from MCF-7 cells treated or not to Doxo using ultracentrifugation and characterized them through Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Western Blotting (WB) for the markers CD63, CD81, and TSG101. We analyzed cytokine profiles using a Multiplex Assay and Cytokine Membrane Array. We exposed Guinea pig cardiomyocytes to different concentrations of sEVs. We assessed their viability (MTT assay), shortening, reactive oxygen species (ROS-DHE dye) production, mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1 dye), and calcium dynamics (FLUO-4 dye). We performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, ANOVA, Cohen's d, and eta(2) to validate the robustness of the results. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 0.01 mu M Doxorubicin resulted in increased sEVs production, particularly after 48 h of exposure (similar to 1.79 x 10(8) +/- 2.77 x 10(7) vs. similar to 5.1 x 10(7) +/- 1.28 x 10(7) particles/mL, n = 3, p = 0.0019). These sEVs exhibited protein profiles in the 130-25 kDa range and 93-123 nm sizes. They carried cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and IL-10. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to sEVs (0.025 mu g/mL to 2.5 mu g/mL) from both Doxo-treated and untreated cells significantly reduced cardiomyocyte viability, shortened cell length by up to 20%, increased ROS production, and disrupted calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating severe cellular stress and cardiotoxicity. These findings suggest that Doxo enhances sEVs production from breast cancer cells, which plays a key role in cardiotoxicity through their cytokine cargo. The study highlights the potential of these sEVs as biomarkers for early cardiotoxicity detection and as therapeutic targets to mitigate cardiovascular risks in chemotherapy patients. Future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms by which Doxorubicin-induced sEVs contribute to cardiotoxicity and exploring their diagnostic and therapeutic potential to improve patient safety and outcomes in cancer therapy.

AB  - The blockage of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) inhibits inflammation and reduces hippocampal neuronal injury in a pilocarpine-induced mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. NF-kappa B signaling pathway is responsible for the inflammation and neuronal injury during epilepsy. Here, we explored whether TRPV4 blockage could affect the NF-kappa B pathway in mice with pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE). Application of a TRPV4 antagonist markedly attenuated the PISE-induced increase in hippocampal HMGB1, TLR4, phospho (p)-I kappa K (p-I kappa K), and p-I kappa B alpha protein levels, as well as those of cytoplasmic p-NF-kappa B p65 (p-p65) and nuclear NF-kappa B p65 and p50; in contrast, the application of GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 agonist, showed similar changes to PISE mice. Administration of the TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 or the NF-kappa B pathway inhibitor BAY 11-7082 led to a noticeable reduction in the hippocampal protein levels of cleaved IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF, as well as those of cytoplasmic p-p65 and nuclear p65 and p50 in GSK1016790A-injected mice. Finally, administration of either TAK-242 or BAY 11-7082 greatly increased neuronal survival in hippocampal CA1 and CA2/3 regions in GSK1016790A-injected mice. Therefore, TRPV4 activation increases HMGB1 and TLR4 expression, leading to I kappa K and I kappa B alpha phosphorylation and, consequently, NF-kappa B activation and nuclear translocation. The resulting increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production is responsible for TRPV4 activation-induced neuronal injury. We conclude that blocking TRPV4 can downregulate HMGB1/TLR4/I kappa K/kappa B alpha/NF-kappa B signaling following PISE onset, an effect that may underlie the anti-inflammatory response and neuroprotective ability of TRPV4 blockage in mice with PISE.

AB  - eLife digest A new housing development in a familiar neighborhood, a wrong turn that ends up lengthening a Sunday stroll: our internal representation of the world requires constant updating, and we need to be able to associate events separated by long intervals of time to finetune future outcome. This often requires neural connections to be altered. A brain region known as the hippocampus is involved in building and maintaining a map of our environment. However, signals from other brain areas can activate silent neurons in the hippocampus when the body is in a specific location by triggering cellular events called dendritic calcium spikes. Milstein et al. explored whether dendritic calcium spikes in the hippocampus could also help the brain to update its map of the world by enabling neurons to stop being active at one location and to start responding at a new position. Experiments in mice showed that calcium spikes could change which features of the environment individual neurons respond to by strengthening or weaking connections between specific cells. Crucially, this mechanism allowed neurons to associate event sequences that unfold over a longer timescale that was more relevant to the ones encountered in day-to-day life. A computational model was then put together, and it demonstrated that dendritic calcium spikes in the hippocampus could enable the brain to make better spatial decisions in future. Indeed, these spikes are driven by inputs from brain regions involved in complex cognitive processes, potentially enabling the delayed outcomes of navigational choices to guide changes in the activity and wiring of neurons. Overall, the work by Milstein et al. advances the understanding of learning and memory in the brain and may inform the design of better systems for artificial learning.
   Learning requires neural adaptations thought to be mediated by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. A relatively non-standard form of synaptic plasticity driven by dendritic calcium spikes, or plateau potentials, has been reported to underlie place field formation in rodent hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here, we found that this behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) can also reshape existing place fields via bidirectional synaptic weight changes that depend on the temporal proximity of plateau potentials to pre-existing place fields. When evoked near an existing place field, plateau potentials induced less synaptic potentiation and more depression, suggesting BTSP might depend inversely on postsynaptic activation. However, manipulations of place cell membrane potential and computational modeling indicated that this anti-correlation actually results from a dependence on current synaptic weight such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. A network model implementing this bidirectional synaptic learning rule suggested that BTSP enables population activity, rather than pairwise neuronal correlations, to drive neural adaptations to experience.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the effect of powdered coconut water-based diluent (ACP-101c) associated with extra virgin coconut oil (CO) as an external cryoprotectant in the conservation of cryopreserved buck sperm. For cryopreservation, the ejaculates from four bucks were pooled and divided into three aliquots and diluted at 37 degrees C for treatments T1 (ACP-101c + 2.5% egg yolk +7% glycerol), T2 (ACP-101c + 2.5% CO +7% glycerol), and T3 (ACP-101c + 5% CO +7% glycerol). Then, the samples were packaged and cooled at a rate of 1.07 degrees C/min decrease. Upon reaching 4 degrees C, the samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for 30 minutes for stabilization. After this period, the straws were frozen in nitrogen vapor for 15 minutes and then immersed and stored in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C. After thawing, the samples were evaluated for sperm kinetics, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal integrity, membrane functionality, mitochondrial activity (MA), and sperm morphology. In this study, no statistically significant differences were observed between the three treatments regarding the kinetic parameters (p > 0.05; Table 1). However, in relation to the velocities, a reduction was observed beyond the expected. There were no statistically significant differences between the diluents T1, T2, and T3 for the three velocities (curvilinear velocity [VCL], linear velocity [VSL], average path velocity [VAP]). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were observed (p > 0.05) among treatments regarding the evaluation of membrane integrity, the functional membrane, MA, and sperm morphology after thawing. In conclusion, the use of CO in concentrations of 2.5% and 5.0% is effective in maintaining goat sperm quality, presenting itself as an alternative diluent for international programs of artificial insemination and embryo transfers.

AB  - Neural precursors (NPs) present in the hippocampus can be modulated by several neurogenic stimuli, including environmental enrichment (EE) acting through BDNF-TrkB signaling. We have recently identified NPs in meninges; however, the meningeal niche response to pro-neurogenic stimuli has never been investigated. To this aim, we analyzed the effects of EE exposure on NP distribution in mouse brain meninges. Following neurogenic stimuli, although we did not detect modification of the meningeal cell number and proliferation, we observed an increased number of neural precursors in the meninges. A lineage tracing experiment suggested that EE-induced beta 3Tubulin(+) immature neuronal cells present in the meninges originated, at least in part, from GLAST(+) radial glia cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for meningeal reaction to EE exposure, we studied the BDNF-TrkB interaction. Treatment with ANA-12, a TrkB non-competitive inhibitor, abolished the EE-induced meningeal niche changes. Overall, these data showed, for the first time, that EE exposure induced meningeal niche remodeling through TrkB-mediated signaling. Fluoxetine treatment further confirmed the meningeal niche response, suggesting it may also respond to other pharmacological neurogenic stimuli. A better understanding of the neurogenic stimuli modulation for meninges may be useful to improve the effectiveness of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric treatments.

AB  - The overuse and unbalanced application of fertilisers have become common practices in the modern world, causing serious environmental problems and restricting tea growth and quality. Therefore, a scientific and rational fertilisation recommendation method should be developed to solve these problems. In this study, fertilisation datasets collected from field experiments (n = 548) in tea-producing areas (n = 21) from 2016 to 2020 were used to build (n = 492) and validate (n = 56) the Nutrient Expert (NE) system for tea. The field validation results indicated that the NE system significantly increased tea yield, quality, economic benefits, and nitrogen (N) use efficiency, as well as decreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Compared with current farmers' practice (FP), NE reduced fertiliser sourced N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) application rates by 28%, 25%, and 20%, respectively. On average, NE increased tea yields by 14.0% and 9.3% relative to FP and soil testing (ST). The total concentration of free amino acids, which is one of the most important indexes of green tea quality, were highest in the NE treatment. The net economic benefits of NE increased by 20.0% and 12.6% relative to FP and ST. NE also increased the N utilisation efficiency of tea shoots by 87.0% and 85.3% compared to FP and ST, respectively. Moreover, NE reduced total GHG emissions by 27.7% and 9.6% compared to FP and ST. These results suggest that fertiliser recommendations based on the NE system can increase economic benefits and reduce environmental risks by avoiding excessive fertilisation to maintain sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The feasibility of natural plant waste, camellia seed residue powder (CSRP), as an admixture for gypsum is investigate in this study. CSRP can function as a foaming agent when incorporated into alpha-hemihydrate gypsum (alpha-HH), and exhibits remarkable retarding effects during the hydration of alpha-HH. Experimental results indicate that CSRP-generated foam possesses high abundance and stability, particularly at a concentration of 24 % CSRP, with foam volume and half-life reaching up to 1560 mL and 1050 min, respectively. This superior performance is attributed primarily to the presence of the surfactant tea saponin in CSRP. Tea saponin molecules densely accumulate at the gas-liquid interface, significantly increasing surface density and forming cohesive interfacial films, and CSRP particles enhance bubble wall rigidity through physical reinforcement while their hydrophilicity maintains hydration shells around bubbles, synergistically prolonging foam lifetime. For CSRP-containing gypsum slurry, the fluidity and retarding time were tested and their results show that CSRP can reduce the fluidity and significantly prolong the setting time. At 2.5 % CSRP content, the final setting time of gypsum slurry is significantly extended to 197 min, meaning 183 min longer than that of blank gypsum. The role of CSRP in alpha-HH hydration was investigated through adsorption, conductivity, hydration heat, and XRD tests. The active organic components in CSRP, such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, and tea saponin, significantly delay the hydration process by complexing with calcium ions and forming an adsorption layer on the gypsum surface. Additionally, the foams generated by CSRP play a similar role by hindering the accumulation and growth of dihydrate nuclei. SEM images reveal that the incorporation of CSRP resulted in shorter and smaller dihydrate crystals in hardened gypsum, thereby corroborating the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, when the amount of CSRP is more than 1.2 %, gypsum products exhibit the porous characteristics as a lightweight material. The dry density of gypsum containing 1.6 % CSRP can be as low as 636 kg/m3, and the thermal conductivity is 0.2721 W/m & sdot;K, which is 60.27 % and 78.59 % lower than blank gypsum, respectively. In this work, CSRP, as an environmentally friendly admixture, can serve directly as both a foaming agent and retarder in gypsum without the need for additional treatment. The result also suggests an innovative recycling approach for solid plant waste CSRP.

AB  - The etiology of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is associated with alterations in the production of amyloid beta (A beta) species caused by mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes. Mutations affect intra- or inter-molecular interactions and processes between the gamma-secretase complex and amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the aberrant sequential cleavage of A beta species. A 64-year-old woman presented with progressive memory decline, mild right hippocampal atrophy, and a family history of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Whole exome sequencing was performed to evaluate AD-related gene mutations, which were verified by Sanger sequencing. A mutation-caused structural alteration of APP was predicted using in silico prediction programs. Two AD-related mutations, in APP (rs761339914; c.G1651A; p.V551M) and PSEN2 (rs533813519; c.C505A; p.H169N), were identified. The APP Val551Met mutation in the E2 domain may influence APP homodimerization through changes in intramolecular interactions between adjacent amino acids, altering A beta production. The second mutation was PSEN2 His169Asn mutation, which was previously reported in five EOAD patients from Korea and China, with a relatively high frequency in the East Asian population. According to a previous report, the presenilin 2 protein was predicted to result in a major helical torsion by PSEN2 His169Asn mutation. Notably, the co-existence of APP Val551Met and PSEN2 His169Asn may induce a synergistic effect by both mutations. Future functional studies are needed to clarify the pathological effects of these double mutations.

AB  - To obtain good productive performance, sows have different nutrition requirements at different gestation periods. However, in gestation stalls, conventional feeders have large relative errors, management is difficult because of the large numbers of sows, and there are shortcomings in feeding precision and data management. In order to achieve precision feeding and enhance the control of multiple feeders for gestating sows housed in stalls, this study was carried out to investigate a precision feeding system that could be controlled at multiple levels. This system consisted of an electronic sow feeder (ESF), controller area network (CAN), personal digital assistant (PDA), central controller, and Internet of Things platform (IoTP). The results of the experiment showed that relative errors of 60 ESFs delivering feed were within +/- 2.94%, and the coefficient of variation was less than 1.84%. When the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) ranged from -80 dbm to -70 dbm, the packet loss rate of the PDA was 3.425%. When the RSSI was greater than -70 dbm, no packet loss was observed, and the average response time was 556.05 ms. The IoTP was at the performance bottleneck when the number of concurrent threads was greater than 1700. These experimental results indicated that the system was not only highly accurate in delivering feed, but was also highly reliable in the transmission of information, and therefore met the production requirements of an intensive gestation house.

AB  - We aimed to investigate whether environmental enrichment (EE) would alter possible adverse effects of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in elderly rats regarding corticosterone levels, stress-related gene expressions in some brain regions, and learning and memory. Wistar male rats (over 20 months) weighing 450-550 g were housed in enriched or standard cages for the duration of the study (10 weeks). After 8 weeks of CUMS application, body weight gain, adrenal weight, and corticosterone levels were measured. Morris water maze (MWM), and novel object recognition test were performed. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) expression levels were determined in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. In the stress group, body weights decreased over time. Regarding the distance swum by rats to find the platform in the MWM, while there was no significant difference between the 3rd and 4th days in the EE+CUMS group, the decrease continued until the 4th day in the standard control (SC)+CUMS group. Stress application reduced the GR and CRHR1 gene expressions in the hypothalamus. We conclude that chronic stress and EE caused brain region-specific changes, thus affecting the neurobiological and cognitive functions in the elderly. In this respect, our study will contribute to neurobiological and neurodegenerative studies on aging.

AB  - Tooth loss leads to several oral problems and although a large number of treatments have been proposed to rehabilitate partially or totally edentulous patients, none of them is based on replacement of a missing tooth by a new natural whole tooth. In the field of tissue engineering, some animal models have been developed to regenerate a natural tooth in the oral cavity. This review shows the state of the art in whole tooth regeneration based on data from in vivo studies. A systematic scoping review was conducted to evaluate studies that described whole-tooth regeneration and eruption in the oral cavity. The data demonstrated that over 100 animals were used in experimental studies and all of them received implants of tooth germs constructed by bioengineering processes. Mini pigs and pigs were used in four studies followed by mice (n = 1) and dog (n = 1). Over 58 (44%) animals showed whole tooth eruption around 3.5 months after tooth germ implantation (1 to 13.5 months). Most of specimens revealed the presence of odontoblasts, dentin, dentinal tubules, dental pulp, root analogue, cementum, blood vessels, and alveolar bone. It could be concluded that in vivo whole tooth regeneration was proved to be possible, but the challenge to overcome translational barriers and test these approaches in humans still remains. Impact StatementAdvances in tissue engineering have led to the development of new methods to regenerate and replace tissues and organs, including teeth. Tooth regeneration is the main goal for the replacement of tooth loss and therefore current evidence showed that tissue engineering might provide this treatment in future.

AB  - Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a prevalent complication of brain trauma. Current anti-epileptic drugs available do not have satisfactory response to PTE. It is of desperate need to explore novel therapeutic approaches for curing PTE. Our prior work revealed that ferroptosis, a recently discovered mode of cell death, occurs in rodent model of PTE. In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the effect of ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific ferroptosis inhibitor, on seizure behavior and cognitive deficit in a mouse model of PTE. The preparation of PTE was performed by stereotaxical injection in the somatosensory cortex region of 50 mM FeCl3. Seizure activity was assessed via Racine scoring and electroencephalogram analysis. PTE-related cognitive function was evaluated by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Ferroptosis-related indices including glutathione peroxi-dase (GPx) activity and protein expressions of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were detected using a commercial kit and immunofluorescence, respectively. It was found that treatment with Fer-1 significantly exerted protective effects against acute seizure and memory decline, although no evident effect on epileptic progression. Fer-1 also exhibited good tolerability and safety as we observed that it hardly influenced the body weight. Furthermore, it was noted that administration of Fer-1 suppressed ferroptosis-related indices including GPx activity and protein expressions of 4-HNE in hippocampus. These data altogether indicate that Fer-1 has potent therapeutic effects against seizures and cognitive impairment following PTE-induced brain insult. Fer-1 may act as a promising drug for curing PTE patients.

TI  - RETRACTED: Influences of Airway Obstruction Caused by Adenoid Hypertrophy on Growth and Development of Craniomaxillofacial Structure and Respiratory Function in Children (Retracted Article)
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - SLEEP
KW  - CHILDHOOD
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Adenoid hypertrophy (AH) is a common disease in otorhinolaryngology. Children with chronic snoring and hypoxia are susceptible to long-term nasal obstruction, while long-term open-mouth breathing may cause craniofacial bone development disorders and dull facial expressions, the so-called adenoid face. The purpose of this work is to analyze the influence of AHinduced airway obstruction (AO) on the growth and development of craniomaxillofacial structure and respiratory function (RF) in children. The clinical data of 56 AH children (observation group) and 42 healthy children with physical examination (control group) who visited the Hebei Eye Hospital during the same period were retrospectively analyzed. All children received acoustic rhinometry and X-ray cephalometric measurements. The upper airway structure, sleep disorder score, and A/N value of nasopharyngeal lateral X-ray images were compared between cases and controls. For AH children, sleep tests were also performed to assess their RF. X-ray cephalometric measurements of facial morphology showed obvious vertical growth, mandibular retrognathia, and enlarged mandibular angle in AH children. AH mainly affects the size of the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airway. AH children presented with higher nasal airway resistance (5:11 +/- 1:95 cmH(2)O/L min) and lower nasopharyngeal volume (NPV) (16:86 +/- 3:93 cm(3)) than controls. Of the AH children, 45 had abnormal RF, including 4 with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The A/N value of nasopharyngeal lateral X-ray images was significantly higher in AH children than in controls. Besides, worse sleep quality was found in AH children. The above differences were all of statistical significance. The above indicates that AH can affect the size of the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airway, change children's respiratory mode and RF, increase nasal resistance, and decrease NPV, resulting in upper respiratory tract stenosis, as well as craniomaxillofacial and oral malformations, which affects children's normal growth and development.

AB  - Proteasomes degrade most intracellular proteins. Several different forms of proteasomes are known. Little is known about the role of specific proteasome forms in the central nervous system (CNS). Inhibitors targeting different proteasome forms are used in clinical practice and were shown to modulate long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices of untreated animals. Here, to address the role of non-constitutive proteasomes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and reveal the consequences of their continuous inhibition, we studied the effect of chronic administration of the non-constitutive proteasome inhibitor ONX-0914 on the LTP induced by two different protocols: tetanic stimulation and theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Both the tetanus- and TBS-evoked potentiation contribute to the different forms of hippocampal-dependent memory and learning. Field-excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in hippocampal slices from control animals and animals treated with DMSO or ONX-0914 were compared. LTP induced by the TBS was not affected by ONX-0914 administration; however, chronic injections of ONX-0914 led to a decrease in fEPSP slopes after tetanic stimulation. The observed effects correlated with differential expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, glutaminergic synapse, and synaptic signaling. Obtained results indicate that non-constitutive proteasomes are likely involved in the tetanus-evoked LTP, but not the LTP occurring after TBS, supporting the relevance and complexity of the role of specific proteasomes in synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Although the exact details of the neuronal protective effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on AD remain unclear, the preclinical phase of AD appears to be the important time point for such intervention. The described experiment investigates the neuroprotective effect of HIIT on AD in APP/PS1 mice. In total, 14 C57BL6 healthy control (C) mice and 14 APP/PS1 AD mice were each randomly assigned into two groups, one that did not participate in HIIT (C and AD groups, respectively) and the other subject to HIIT intervention (control HIIT (CE) and AD HIIT (ADE) groups, respectively). Visualization of hippocampal neuronal cells via HE and Congo red staining showed significant improvement in cell status and a significant reduction in amyloidosis in ADE compared with AD. The results of behavioral analysis show that the HIIT intervention significantly improved cognitive decline and reduced spatial exploration in both the C and AD groups. Immunofluorescence showed that the overall brain and the hippocampus of aged rats in the C and AD groups had different degrees of neuroglial responses and astrocyte GFAP proliferation and hypertrophy, with obvious improvement in the CE and ADE groups after 10 weeks of HIIT intervention. These results show that HIIT significantly improves the status of mitochondrial kinetic proteins and related proteins, with the mechanism differing between the normal aging C and the AD groups. 10 weeks of HIIT improved the imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics present in normal control mice and in AD mice. We conclude that preclinical training intervention has a significant positive effect on the exploratory behavior and cognitive functioning of mice.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) is a widespread element in the earth's crust. In large quantities, it can be toxic to both plants and herbivores. The aim of the work was to determine the aluminum content in samples of flour, groats and other cereal products available on the retail market in eastern Poland. Al determination was performed in the chemical laboratory of the Bia & lstrok;a Podlaska University "EKO-AGRO-TECH", using a ball mill and a mineralization furnace. The assessment of the content of this element will allow determining whether the aluminum content depends on the type of product, which may be helpful in assessing exposure to aluminum. Samples of flakes and groats were ground in a Fritsh ball mill and dissolved in pure acids, nitrogen and salt (6:1), and mineralized in an Anton Paar furnace. Then, the samples were diluted with distilled water and filtered on paper filters, and the filtrates were subjected to an elemental analysis by atomic emission spectrometer with excitation using an ICP-OES Spectro-blue FME 26 apparatus. The average concentration of aluminum in all tested products does not differ significantly from the average concentrations of this element in individual groups. After averaging in individual product groups, it was found that the average content in all products combined is not statistically different in each of these products. A balanced aluminum concentration was found in the tested cereal products originating from Southern Podlasie (Lubelskie Voivodeship) and from the southern districts of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. It was found that the aluminum concentrations in the tested cereal products did not show statistically significant differences.

AB  - Fungal infections of food and feed with toxigenic strains results in the accumulation of harmful metabolites. In this study, the antifungal activity of two indigenous bacterial strains Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus subtilis isolated from camel feed was investigated. The potential of the bacterial cell free supernatant (CFS) to reduce mycotoxins synthesis was evaluated, and the impact of their antifungal metabolites on the fungal hyphae was examined. High antagonistic activity was exhibited by both bacterial strains. The best activity was observed against two mycotoxigenic A. niger strains (Sp31 and Sp33) with inhibition zones of 36.75 +/- 0.7 mm and 35.75 +/- 1.5 mm, by strains B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis, respectively . The effects of these bacterial strains ' CFSs on mycotoxins synthesis were investigated, and both CFSs were found to reduce the mycotoxins synthesis by A. parasiticus, A. niger and Penicillium spp., in a dosedependent manner. Moreover, the fungal cell wall morphology was significantly altered by the bacterial CFS at a very low concentration of 1 %. The heat stability of the antifungal metabolites was evaluated at various temperatures ranging from-20 degrees C to 100 degrees C, and the metabolites were found to be highly stable, retaining their antifungal activity against A. niger . The antifungal activity of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis was stable at-20 degrees C for 236 and 34 days of storage, respectively. These findings suggest that both bacterial strains are exceptional candidates in the biocontrol of mycotoxigenic fungi and in the reduction of their toxic metabolites.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, the impact of respiratory disease resulting from Avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV) infection has been rising in the broiler industry in Europe. In this context, in order to investigate aMPV contribution to the clinical picture and the potential benefits of diversified vaccination strategies compared to nonvaccination policies, a longitudinal monitoring was performed in broilers located in Western France. The survey confirmed the circulation of field aMPV subtype B strains with a certain degree of genetic heterogenicity and the importance of implementation of vaccination to contain the clinical manifestations. In recent years, the impact of respiratory disease resulting from Avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV) infection has been generally rising in the broiler industry in Europe. In this context, in order to investigate aMPV contribution to the clinical picture and the potential benefits of diversified vaccination strategies compared to nonvaccination policies, a longitudinal monitoring was performed, also evaluating Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) presence. Broiler flocks located in Western France, where aMPV has already proven to be a health and productivity issue, were screened by RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs, and the viruses were genetically characterized by sequence analysis. For a more comprehensive picture of aMPV molecular epidemiology and evolution in France, aMPV subtype B strains detected from 1985 to 1998 were sequenced and included in the analysis. The survey confirmed the detection of aMPV subtype B in commercial broiler flocks in France, together with a certain heterogeneity demonstrated by the circulation of more recent and historical French field strains. No IBV field strains were detected. The implementation and evaluation of different management choices and vaccine strategies suggests once again that immunization does not prevent infection but contributes greatly to the containment of the clinical manifestations.

AB  - The miR-146 family consists of two microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-146a and miR-146b, which are both known to suppress a variety of immune responses. Here in this study, we show that miR-146b is abundantly expressed in neuronal cells, while miR-146a is mainly expressed in microglia and astroglia of adult mice. Accordingly, miR-146b deficient (Mir146b-/-) mice exhibited anxiety-like behaviors and enhanced cognition. Characterization of cellular composition of Mir146b-/- mice using flow cytometry revealed an increased number of neurons and a decreased abundancy of astroglia in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, whereas microglia abundancy remained unchanged. Immunohistochemistry showed a higher density of neurons in the frontal cortex of Mir146b-/- mice, enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis as evidenced by an increased proliferation, and survival of newly generated cells with enhanced maturation into neuronal phenotype. No microglial activation or signs of neuroinflammation were observed in Mir146b-/- mice. Further analysis demonstrated that miR-146b deficiency is associated with elevated expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) mRNA in the hippocampus, which might be at least in part responsible for the observed neuronal expansion and the behavioral phenotype. This hypothesis is partially supported by the positive correlation between performance of mice in the object recognition test and Gdnf mRNA expression in Mir146b-/- mice. Together, these results show the distinct function of miR-146b in controlling behaviors and provide new insights in understanding cell-specific function of miR-146b in the neuronal and astroglial organization of the mouse brain.

AB  - Trimethyltin (TMT) is widely used as a major component of plastic stabilizers in agriculture and industry, and can accumulate in large quantities in the liver. To investigate the relationship between liver tissue damage induced by TMT exposure and YAP phosphorylation in mice, we gave the mice drinking water containing 0.01 mg/mL TMT for 14 days to establish an in vivo experimental model, and continuously treated AML12 cells with 20 mu M TMT for 24 h to establish an in vitro experimental model. Transcriptomics revealed that TMT exposure altered 62,466 apparently diversely expressed genes, including 1197 upregulated and 899 downregulated genes, and that enrichment of the Hippo pathway occurred. Moreover, western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that TMT exposure triggered an increase in the expression of P-YAP, apoptosis and necroptosis-interrelated genes, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression in mouse livers tissues and AML12 cells. The expression of P-YAP was significantly suppressed in the TRULI-treated TMT-exposed AML12 cells, while oxidative stress levels and damage were also significantly attenuated. In conclusion, TMT triggers YAP phosphorylation to induce oxidative stress inducing apoptosis and necroptosis in mouse livers tissues. Our results confirm the liver toxic effect and specific mechanism of TMT.

AB  - Lead (Pb) toxicity from ammunition has been shown to be a threat to scavenging birds across the globe. Toxic levels of lead have recently been found in Australia's largest bird of prey, the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of liver and bone samples. However, ICP-MS is consumptive (causing damage to archived specimens), time-consuming, and expensive. For these reasons, portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) devices have been optimized to measure bone lead in North American avian species, humans, and other environmental samples. In this study, we assessed portable XRF for bone lead measurement in Australian raptors in two parts. First, we validated the method using tissues from wedge-tailed eagles from Tasmania (A. a. fleayi), analysing bone samples taken from sites on the femur immediately adjacent to sites for which we had ICP-MS data (n = 89). Second, we measured lead via portable XRF in the skulls of wedge-tailed eagles from south-eastern mainland Australia (A. a. audax) collected during a criminal prosecution (n 92). Portable XRF bone lead measurement demonstrated an excellent correlation with ICP-MS results using root-transformed regression (R-2 = 0.88). Calculated equivalent ICP-MS values revealed that greater than 50% of the eagles from mainland Australia had elevated lead levels (>10 mg/kg) and 13% had severe lead exposure (>20 mg/kg). Our results support previous studies of North American avian species and suggest that portable XRF could be a useful and inexpensive option for measurement of bone lead in Australian scavenger species.

AB  - The analysis of RNA-Sec data from murine bulk tissue samples taken from five brain regions associated with behavior and stress response was conducted. The focus was on the most contrasting brain region-specific genes (BRSG) sets in terms of their expression rates. These BRSGs are identified as genes with a distinct outlying (high) expression rate in a specific region compared to others used in the study. The analysis suggested that BRSG sets form non-randomly connected compact gene networks, which correspond to the major neuron-mediated functional processes or pathways in each brain region. The number of BRSGs and the connection rate were found to depend on the heterogeneity and coordinated firing rate of neuron types in each brain region. The most connected pathways, along with the highest BRSG number, were observed in the Striatum, referred to as Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs), which make up 95% of neurons and exhibit synchronous firing upon dopamine influx. However, the Ventral Tegmental Area/Medial Raphe Nucleus (VTA/MRN) regions, although primarily composed of monoaminergic neurons, do not fire synchronously, leading to a smaller BRSG number. The Hippocampus (HPC) region, on the other hand, displays significant neuronal heterogeneity, with glutamatergic neurons being the most numerous and synchronized. Interestingly, the two monoaminergic regions involved in the study displayed a common BRSG subnetwork architecture, emphasizing their proximity in terms of axonal throughput specifics and high-energy metabolism rates. This finding suggests the concerted evolution of monoaminergic neurons, leading to unique adaptations at the genic repertoire scale. With BRSG sets, we were able to highlight the contrasting features of the three groups: control, depressive, and aggressive mice in the animal chronic stress model. Specifically, we observed a decrease in serotonergic turnover in both the depressed and aggressive groups, while dopaminergic emission was high in both groups. There was also a notable absence of dopaminoceptive receptors on the postsynaptic membranes in the striatum in the depressed group. Additionally, we confirmed that neurogenesis BRSGs are specific to HPC, with the aggressive group showing attenuated neurogenesis rates compared to the control/depressive groups. We also confirmed that immune-competent cells like microglia and astrocytes play a crucial role in depressed phenotypes, including mitophagy-related gene Prkcd. Based on this analysis, we propose the use of BRSG sets as a suitable framework for evaluating case-control group-wise assessments of specific brain region gene pathway responses.

AB  - Simple Summary A dynamic model was created to determine the nutritional requirements of lambs, aiming to simulate and describe their growth, nutrient requirements, and body composition. The model inputs include body mass, standard final mass, age, and dietary energy concentration. The results showed that the model accurately predicts the final body mass based on the inputs, with a coefficient of determination of 0.89 and a mean bias of 0.656 kg. The utility of this model extends to agricultural practitioners and livestock managers, providing valuable insights into forecasting final body mass and estimating the duration required to attain specific weights. Moreover, it serves as an educational tool elucidating the intricate interplay between nutrition, growth dynamics, and body composition in lambs. Thus, its implementation stands to enhance decision-making processes within feedlot lamb production, contributing to more informed and efficient management practices.Abstract A dynamic model has been developed to simulate aspects of feedlot lamb growth and body composition, including energy and protein requirements, growth rate, composition of gain, and body mass. Model inputs include initial body mass (kg), standard final mass (kg), age (days), and dietary energy concentration (Mcal<middle dot>kg-1). The model was assessed as a decision support tool using a dataset of 564 individual measures of final body mass and diet energy. The simulations provide graphical and numerical descriptions of nutrient requirements, composition of gain, and estimates of animal performance over time. The model is accurate and precise, with a root mean squared error of 7.79% of the observed final body mass and a coefficient of determination of 0.89 when simulating the same variable. The model can be used as a reliable decision support tool to estimate final body mass and the days on feed required to reach a certain final mass with precision and accuracy. Moreover, the dynamic model can also serve as a learning tool to illustrate practical principles of animal nutrition, nutrient requirement relationships, and body composition changes. This model holds the potential to enhance livestock management practices and assist producers in making informed decisions about feedlot lamb production.

AB  - BackgroundTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. However, existing treatments still face numerous clinical challenges. Building on our prior research showing peripheral nerve-derived stem cell (PNSC) spheroids with Schwann cell-like phenotypes can secrete neurotrophic factors to aid in neural tissue regeneration, we hypothesized that repeated intrathecal injections of PNSC spheroids would improve the delivery of neurotrophic factors, thereby facilitating the restoration of neurological function and brain tissue repair post-TBI.MethodsWe generated PNSC spheroids from human peripheral nerve tissue using suspension culture techniques. These spheroids were characterized using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The conditioned media were evaluated in SH-SY5Y and RAW264.7 cell lines to assess their effects on neurogenesis and inflammation. To simulate TBI, we established a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in rats. The animals were administered intrathecal injections of PNSC spheroids on three occasions, with each injection spaced at a 3-day interval. Recovery of sensory and motor function was assessed using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and rotarod tests, while histological (hematoxylin and eosin, Luxol fast blue staining) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging analyses, alongside immunofluorescence, were conducted to evaluate the recovery of neural structures and pathophysiology.ResultsPNSC spheroids expressed high levels of Schwann cell markers and neurotrophic factors, such as neurotrophin-3 and Ephrin B3. Their conditioned medium was found to promote neurite outgrowth, reduce reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death and inflammation, and influence M1-M2 macrophage polarization. In the CCI rat model, rats receiving repeated triple intrathecal injections of PNSC spheroids showed significant improvements in sensory and motor function, with considerable neural tissue recovery in damaged areas. Notably, this treatment promoted nerve regeneration, axon regrowth, and remyelination. It also reduced glial scar formation and inflammation, while encouraging angiogenesis.ConclusionOur findings suggest that repeated intrathecal injections of PNSC spheroids can significantly enhance neural recovery after TBI. This effect is mediated by the diverse neurotrophic factors secreted by PNSC spheroids. Thus, the strategy of combining therapeutic cell delivery with multiple intrathecal injections holds promise as a novel clinical treatment for TBI recovery.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO), an enzymatic product of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), has been associated with a variety of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). NO has long been thought to contribute to neurotoxic insults caused by neuroinflammation in AD. This perception shifts as more attention is paid to the early stages before cognitive problems manifest. However, it has revealed a compensatory neuroprotective role for NO that protects synapses by increasing neuronal excitability. NO can positively affect neurons by inducing neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and myelination, as well as having cytolytic activity to reduce inflammation. NO can also induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a process by which synaptic connections among neurons become more potent. Not to mention that such functions give rise to AD protection. Notably, it is unquestionably necessary to conduct more research to clarify NO pathways in neurodegenerative dementias because doing so could help us better understand their pathophysiology and develop more effective treatment options. All these findings bring us to the prevailing notion that NO can be used either as a therapeutic agent in patients afflicted with AD and other memory impairment disorders or as a contributor to the neurotoxic and aggressive factor in AD. In this review, after presenting a general background on AD and NO, various factors that have a pivotal role in both protecting and exacerbating AD and their correlation with NO will be elucidated. Following this, both the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of NO on neurons and glial cells among AD cases will be discussed in detail.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play a crucial role in the pathology of vascular dementia (VD). Previously, we have found that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in VD, whereas little is known about its mechanism. Therefore, the objective of our study was to explore the contribution of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) to NBP and its effects on anti-inflammatory activity in a mouse model of VD. Our studies revealed that NBP could effectively mitigate cognitive deficits, neuron cell loss, and apoptosis in mice subjected to repeated cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (RCIR). Additionally, NBP promoted both the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) in hippocampus tissue. NBP exhibited antioxidant activity by enhancing Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, increasing HO-1 and NQO1 expression, enhancing SOD activity, and inhibiting RCIR-induced MDA and 8-iso PGF2 alpha generation in the hippocampus. NBP also significantly inhibited TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling and suppressed microglial proliferation and the production of proinflammatory mediators in RCIR mice. Importantly, the antioxidant, antineuroinflammatory, and neuroprotective effects of NBP above were abolished by Nrf2 knockout. Collectively, these results indicated the effects of NBP on neuroinflammation were strongly associated with the Nrf2 pathway. Modulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B pathway by Nrf2 is involved in the neuroprotective effect of NBP against VD induced by RCIR injury. With antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory properties, NBP could be a promising drug candidate for the prevention and/or treatment of VD and other neuroinflammatory disorders.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) showed anticonvulsant action in several preclinical models and is currently approved by regulatory agencies to treat childhood epilepsy syndromes. However, CBD treatment has limited benefits, and its long-term effects on cognition are not fully understood yet. This study aimed to examine the impact of long-term CBD treatment in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling model of epilepsy. Adult male Wistar rats (N = 24) received PTZ (35 mg/kg intraperitoneally) every other day until two consecutive generalized seizures occurred. CBD (60 mg/kg body weight) was administered daily by the oral route until the kindled state was achieved (n = 12). To confirm that the formulation and administration techniques were not of concern, liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry was performed to test the brain penetration of the CBD formula. As a result of CBD treatment, a lower mortality rate and significantly prolonged generalized seizure latency (925.3 +/- 120.0 vs. 550.1 +/- 69.62 s) were observed, while the frequency and duration of generalized seizures were not influenced. The CBD-treated group showed a significant decrease in vertical exploration in the open field test and a significant decrease in the discrimination index in the novel object recognition (NOR) test (-0.01 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.15, p = 0.04). The observed behavioral characteristics may be connected to the decreased thickness of the stratum pyramidale or the decreased astrogliosis observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, CBD treatment did not prevent kindling, nor did it affect seizure frequency or duration. However, it did increase the latency to the first seizure and decreased the prolonged status epilepticus-related mortality in PTZ-kindled rats. The cognitive impairment observed in the NOR test may be related to the high dose used in this study, which may warrant further investigation.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter required for excitation/inhibition balance is synthesized by the glutamic acid decarboxylases (GADs) in GABAergic neurons. The levels and activity of GADs are strongly correlated with GABA and neural transmission. Dysregulation of GADs and GABA is associated with various neurological disorders. The study used psoralidin, found in the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, to investigate its effect on GAD levels and regulatory mechanisms in primary cortical neurons. Psoralidin reduced GAD67 through transcriptional regulation. The reduction was not mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Additionally, psoralidin attenuated the formation of inhibitory synapses in primary hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Healthy aging is an ambitious aspiration for humans, but neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), strongly affect quality of life. Using an integrated omics approach, we investigate alterations in the molecular composition of postmortem hippocampus samples of healthy persons and individuals with AD. Profound differences are apparent between control and AD male and female cohorts in terms of up-and downregulated metabolic pathways. A decrease in the insulin response is evident in AD when comparing the female with the male group. The serine metabolism (linked to the glycolytic pathway and generating the N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptor coagonist D-serine) is also significantly modulated: the D-Ser/total serine ratio represents a way to counteract age-related cognitive decline in healthy men and during AD onset in women. These results show how AD changes and, in certain respects, almost reverses sex-specific proteomic and metabolomic profiles, highlighting how different pathophysiological mecha-nisms are active in men and women.

AB  - Forty per cent of major depression patients are resistant to antidepressant medication. Thus, it is necessary to search for alternative treatments. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine) enhances neurogenesis and neuronal survival in the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus. Additionally, melatonin stimulates the activity of Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II (CaMKII), promoting dendrite formation and neurogenic processes in human olfactory neuronal precursors and rat organotypic cultures. Similarly, ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, modulates CaMKII activity. Importantly, co-treatment of low doses of ketamine (10-7 M) in combination with melatonin (10-7 M) produces additive effects on neurogenic responses in olfactory neuronal precursors. Importantly, enhanced neurogenic responses are produced by conventional antidepressants like ISSRs. The goal of this study was to investigate whether hippocampal CaMKII participates in the signaling pathway elicited by combining doses of melatonin with ketamine acutely administered to mice, 30 min before being subjected to the forced swimming test. The results showed that melatonin, in conjunction with ketamine, significantly enhances CaMKII activation and changes its subcellular distribution in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Remarkably, melatonin causes nuclear translocation of the active form of CaMKII. Luzindole, a non-selective MT1 and MT2 receptor antagonist, abolished these effects, suggesting that CaMKII is downstream of the melatonin receptor pathway that causes the antidepressant-like effects. These findings provide molecular insights into the combined effects of melatonin and ketamine on neuronal plasticity-related signaling pathways and pave the way for combating depression using combination therapy.

AB  - Excessive fluoride exposure can be neurotoxic, although the exact mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the neurotoxicity of continuous sodium fluoride exposure in offspring rats, focusing on the potential effects of fluoride exposure on hippocampal synaptic function and the role of AMPK and CRMP-2 in synaptic damage. We established an SD rat model of fluoride exposure (25, 50, and 100 mg/L NaF) and found that fluoride exposure damaged the learning and memory ability of F1 generation rats and caused ultrastructural changes in the hippocampus. Additionally, after the proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of rat hippocampal tissues, the Gene Ontology analysis revealed that sodium fluoride was involved in the enrichment of neuronal differentiation, synaptic signaling, and cytoskeleton-related biological processes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that differential genes were enriched in synapse-related signaling pathways. Thus, we screened three differentially expressed proteins related to synaptic function for validation. The Western blotting analysis showed that AMPK and CRMP-2 were hyperphosphorylated in the hippocampus of fluoride-exposed rats. Our study found that abnormal AMPK and CRMP-2 phosphorylation leads to synaptic damage. This may be an important cause of memory impairment in fluorosis, offering new insights into the mechanism of fluoride-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Simple Summary Efficient analgesia during surgical piglet castration is an important animal welfare issue. The present study is part of a larger study designed to investigate the efficacy of four local anaesthetics (bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine and procaine) for analgesia during castration. In conscious piglets, it is difficult to distinguish between stress, e.g., due to handling, and pain during castration. Therefore, this study was conducted under light isoflurane anaesthesia. The level of anaesthesia was adjusted such that movement reactions to a peripheral nociceptive stimulus still occurred. We present the results of the investigation of two possible parameters for the detection of nociception: the reaction pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and FOS protein expression in the spinal dorsal horn. In the electroencephalogram, a biphasic reaction pattern in response to noxious stimulation was detected that was attenuated or altered by the application of local anaesthetics. FOS expression, which was examined postmortem, was decreased after the administration of local anaesthetics, except for bupivacaine. Based on these results, local anaesthesia decreases nociceptive transmission during piglet castration in this experimental setup. When combined with the corresponding haemodynamic parameters and the evaluation of defensive movements presented elsewhere, an overall understanding of the nociceptive response to castration can be generated. The objective of this study was to investigate the electroencephalographic reaction pattern and FOS protein expression in male piglets undergoing surgical castration under light isoflurane anaesthesia with or without local anaesthesia. The experiment was conducted under isoflurane anaesthesia to exclude the effect of the affective components of pain on the measurements. Changes in the oscillatory activity of the cerebral cortex over a 90 s period after noxious stimulation or simulated interventions were analysed. FOS expression was determined postmortem by performing immunohistochemistry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The analysis of the response to an interdigital pinch revealed a biphasic reaction pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that similarly was observed for the surgical stimuli during the castration procedure in the group without analgesia. This EEG response was attenuated or altered by the application of local anaesthetics. Immunohistochemical staining for FOS indicated a lower expression in the handling and in three local anaesthetic groups than in the animals castrated without pain relief. The findings indicate that EEG and FOS expression may serve as indicators for nociception in piglets under light isoflurane anaesthesia. A lower activation of nociceptive pathways occurs during castration after the application of local anaesthetics. However, EEG and FOS analyses should be combined with additional parameters to assess nociception, e.g., haemodynamic monitoring.

AB  - The study investigated the impact of pepsin pretreatment and extraction temperature (70 and 90 degrees C) on the biochemical, interfacial, and textural properties of gelatin extracted from camel skin. The highest concentration of low molecular mass peptides (< 5 kDa) was observed in gelatins extracted with pepsin pretreatment. Moreover, the total free amino acids content showed a direct correlation with the concentration of low molecular mass peptides, ranging from 6 to 15 mg/g of gelatin. Proline was identified as the predominant free amino acid (from 2.39 to 4.92 mg/g) in gelatin samples, with levels significantly increased after pepsin treatment. Regarding textural properties, gel hardness was found to be the highest in gelatin extracted at 70 degrees C (380.12 g), while it was observed that the combination of pepsin pretreatment with higher temperatures led to decrease the gel strength (301.89 g). However, despite this lower gel strength, this gelatin showed the highest emulsifying activity index (34.76-37.82 m(2)/g). These findings highlighted the importance of pepsin pretreatment and extraction temperature in modulating the biochemical and textural characteristics of camel skin gelatin, thereby providing insights for optimizing gelatin extraction processes as a function of the target application.

AB  - Glyphosate is the most used herbicide worldwide. It is a small and highly polar pesticide whose physicochemical properties makes its analytical determination difficult. Here, a procedure based on liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) was developed for glyphosate determination in samples of gastric content from wildlife. Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis), a herbivorous mammal species, strongly associated to agrosystems was selected as model species. The procedure involves direct analysis of sample without derivatization or instead of neither further cleaning steps. The procedure was validated by inter-day accuracy and precision studies with gastric content of hare spiked with glyphosate at ecologically relevant concentrations for the species (0.1-6 mu g/g), and with 1 mu g/g of isotopically labelled internal standard (glyphosate-2(-13)C,N-15). Finally, glyphosate residues in hunted animals from pesticide-treated and pesticide-free areas (n = 75 and 28, respectively), as well as from hares found dead in the field (n = 11) were analysed. The linearity of both standards in extraction solutions and procedural calibration curves with spiked samples was similar, both with determination coefficients (r(2)) higher than 0.99. Satisfactory recoveries in spiked samples were achieved within the range of 95% to 118% (CV <= 20%). The limit of detection of glyphosate in hare gastric content was 0.03 mu g/g. Prevalence of glyphosate in hunted animals from pesticide-treated areas ranged between 9 and 22%, increasing to 45% in animals found dead. The glyphosate concentrations detected in the gastric content of hares ranged from 0.11 to 16 mu g/g. No residues were detected in animals from pesticide-free areas. In practice, the developed methodology may be particularly useful in the context of research and other work on the exposure in wildlife of one of the most used pesticides nowadays.

AB  - Acrylamide (ACR) is a widely used environmentally hazardous compound that is known to be neurotoxic, genotoxic, carcinogenic, and reproductive toxicity. It is widely present in soil, water, agents used in chemical industries, and food. It can be distributed to all organs and tissues, and can cause damage to various human systems and those of other animals. Previous metabolomics studies have mainly focused on metabolites in serum and urine, but have lacked comprehensive analysis of major organs and tissues. In the current study, a gas chromatography-massspectrometry method was used to investigate mechanisms underlying organ toxicity, in an effort to identify potentially sensitive biomarkers in the main target tissues of rats after ACR exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups; a control group and a group treated with 20 mg kg-1 ACR intragastrically for 6 weeks. Metabolite changes in the two groups were statistically analyzed. The respective numbers of altered metabolites in the hippocampus, cortex, kidney, serum, heart, liver, and kidney fat were 21, 21, 17, 5, 15, 14, and 6. There were 14 metabolic pathways related to amino acid, fatty acid, purine, and energy metabolism, revealing that the toxic mechanism of ACR may involve oxidative stress, inflammation, and amino acid metabolism and energy disorders.

AB  - Exposure to environmental cadmium (Cd) is known to cause neuronal death and cognitive decline in humans. Ferroptosis, a novel iron-dependent type of regulated cell death, is involved in various neurological disorders. In the present study, Cd exposure triggered ferroptosis in the mouse hippocampus and in the HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cell line, as indicated by significant increases in ferroptotic marker expression, intracellular iron levels, and lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons in response to Cd exposure relied on the induction of autophagy since the suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3 -MA) and chloroquine (CQ) substantially ameliorated Cd-induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated degradation of ferritin was required for the Cd-induced ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons, demonstrating that NCOA4 knockdown decreased intracellular iron levels and lipid peroxidation and increased cell survival, following Cd exposure. Moreover, Cd-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generation was essential for the ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons. Importantly, pretreatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) effectively attenuated Cd-induced hippocampal neuronal death and cognitive impairment in mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that ferroptosis is a novel mechanism underlying Cd-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment and that the mtROSferritinophagy axis modulates Cd-induced neuronal ferroptosis.

AB  - This study investigated the cryoprotectant effects of dimethylformamide (DMF), ethylene glycol (EG), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as substitutes for glycerol (GLY) in a soybean lecithin (SL)-based extender in the cryopreservation of buck sperm. In this study, the semen of three Saanen bucks was individually extended in SL supplemented with 5% GLY (control), DMF, EG, or DMSO. After this, the extended semen was cryopreserved and two straws from each group were thawed (37 degrees C for 30 seconds), pooled, and analyzed for sperm motion parameters, plasma membrane integrity (PMI), acrosomal integrity (ACI), and high mitochondrial membrane potential (HMMP). Samples were analyzed after 15 minutes (T0) and after 2 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C (T2). The results revealed higher values of motility (total and progressive) and sperm motion parameters for DMF than the other cryoprotectants (p < 0.0001). PMI and HMMP did not differ (p > 0.05) between GLY and DMF, but ACI was higher (p < 0.01) for DMF compared with GLY. Based on these results, DMF and GLY samples were used in heterologous in vitro fertilization assays by using bovine oocytes (n = 337) obtained from a slaughterhouse. No differences (p > 0.05) were observed between GLY and DMF for unfertilized (GLY: 38.8%; DMF: 25.33%), pronucleus (GLY: 25.68%; DMF: 27.92%), and cleavage rates (GLY: 35.52%; DMF: 46.75%). Based on these results, it is concluded that DMF preserves sperm motion characteristics and ACI better than GLY, EG, and DMSO, and it is the penetrating cryoprotectant of choice for the cryopreservation of buck sperm in SL extender.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. In this study, we carried out wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in three key port cities in China through real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Next, a novel machine learning algorithm (MLA) based on Gaussian model and random forest model was used to predict the epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. The results showed that from February 2023 to January 2024, three port cities experienced two waves of SARSCoV-2 infection, which peaked in late-May and late-August 2023, respectively. Two waves of IAV were observed in the spring and winter of 2023, respectively with considerable variations in terms of onset/offset date and duration. Furthermore, we employed MLA to extract the key features of epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV from February 3rd, to October 15th, 2023, and thereby predicted the epidemic trends of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV from October 16th, 2023 to April 22nd, 2024, which showed high consistency with the observed values. These collective findings offer an important understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV epidemics, suggesting that wastewater surveillance together with MLA emerges as a powerful tool for risk assessment of respiratory viral diseases and improving public health preparedness.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations in the upper Midwest are highly productive. However, these narrow rotations are followed by a long winter fallow period. Over time, this has contributed to the loss of agroecological functioning, including increased ground water pollution from nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). Winter camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is a third crop that could grow during this fallow period, but its nitrogen (N) use and efficiency are not well known. A study was conducted at three locations in the U.S. upper Midwest to determine the N uptake and use efficiency of winter camelina in response to applied N and N application timing. Agronomic efficiency (AE), internal efficiency (IE), and nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE) tended to decrease with increasing N rates, especially beyond 67 kg N ha-1 in most instances. Total N uptake ranged from 34 to 176 kg ha-1 across N rates, and was on average 1.5 fold the applied rate. Based on the observed decline in N use efficiency with increasing N rates, an application rate of 67 kg N ha-1 appears to balance efficient N use, high yield, and lower environmental risk compared to higher N rates.

AB  - The antioxidant capacity of numerous plant species with medical potential, as well as the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.) have been extensively studied. On the other hand, such data for herbal tea blends, taken directly from the market are scarce. The aim of our study was to evaluate the antioxidant capacity and phenol content of tea and herbal tea blends available on Bulgarian market and to assess Haberlea rhodopensis leaves as a potential ingredient of herbal teas. We applied two methods to evaluate the antioxidant capacity - the Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays, after a two step procedure of processing and extraction of water-soluble and lipo-soluble antioxidants. We did not find a direct relationship between the content of phenols and the antioxidant capacity of the studied herbal teas. The commercial samples of Camellia sinensis L. (North Vietnam cultivation, Tikanium, Green tea) had the highest antioxidant capacity. According to TEAC and FRAP assay Common St John's wort, Oregano, and Garden sage showed antioxidant capacity close to that of Green tea. Maximum antioxidant capacity and, hence maximal health benefits could be obtained from ca. 30 min infusions of Roselle tea and especially Haberlea leaves. This makes cultivated Haberlea rhodopensis a valuable potential ingredient for new blends of herbal tea with high antioxidant capacity.

AB  - There is evidence that viral infections during pre-natal development constitute a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders and lead to learning and memory deficits. However, little is known about why viral infections during early post-natal development have a different impact on learning and memory depending on the sex of the subject. We previously showed that early post-natal immune activation induces hippocampal-dependent social memory deficits in a male, but not in a female, mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; Tsc2(+/-) mice). Here, we explored the impact of a viral-like immune challenge in object memory. We demonstrate that early post-natal immune activation (during the first 2 weeks of life) leads to object memory deficits in female, but not male, mice that are heterozygous for a gene responsible for tuberous sclerosis complex (Tsc2(+/-) mice), while no effect was observed in wild type (WT) mice. Moreover, we found that the same immune activation in Tsc2(+/-) adult mice was not able to cause object memory deficits in females, which suggests that the early post-natal development stage constitutes a critical window for the effects of immune challenge on adult memory. Also, our results suggest that mTOR plays a critical role in the observed deficit in object memory in female Tsc2(+/-) mice. These results, together with previous results published by our laboratory, showing sex-specific memory deficits due to early post-natal immune activation, reinforce the necessity of using both males and females for research studies. This is especially true for studies related to immune activation, since the higher levels of estrogens in females are known to affect inflammation and to provide neuroprotection.

AB  - To achieve an intimate contact between neuronal cells and the electrode in non-invasive platforms intended for neurological research, in this study, we fabricated a raised-type Au multi-electrode array (MEA) by employing nanoscale-thick indium-tin oxide (ITO; 50 nm) as a track layer and plasma-enhanced atomic layer-deposited (PEALD) Al2O3 (30-60 nm) and HfO2 (20 nm) as passivation layers. The PEALD Al2O3-passivated Au MEA was subsequently modified with electrodeposited AuPt nanoparticles (NPs) and IrOx to demonstrate the passivation capability and chemical resistance of Al2O3 to Au-, Pt-, and IrOx NP-containing electrolytes. Al2O3-passivated and IrOx/AuPt-modified MEAs could resolve optogenetically activated spikes and spontaneous activities with a root-mean-square noise level of 2.8 +/- 0.3 mu V generated by the primarily cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with viral vectors. PEALD Al2O3 exhibited a poor resistance to the Ag leaching environment (concentrated nitric acid maintained at 70 degrees C); therefore, a nanoporous Au (NPG) structure could not be implemented on the Au MEA passivated with Al2O3. By depositing a 20 nm-thick HfO2 over a 40 nm-thick Al2O3 layer, the NPG structure could be implemented on the Au MEA, confirming the chemical resistance of HfO2 to the Ag leaching environment. The nontoxicity of Al2O3 and HfO2 was confirmed by the successful primary culture of dissociated hippocampal neurons and electrophysiological studies performed using a hippocampal slice. Considering the advances in ALD technology and the vast number of metal oxides, these results extend the application of ALD metal oxides from water barriers for biomedical implants to passivation layers for in vitro MEAs.

AB  - Aim: To determine the plasma neurotransmitters simultaneously and to find any correlation with pathological changes in the hippocampus and Purkinje cells and their relation with behavioral changes in Balb/c mice.
   Methodology: In the present study, both sexes of Balb /C mice were divided into two groups (4 males and 4 females; n = 8): Both the groups were given a single dose of either saline or sodium valproate (400mg kg(-1)) respectively through subcutaneous injection on PND 14. Behavioural tests were conducted on mice pups on various postnatal days till 40th day. On PND 41, blood samples were collected from all the animals for quantification of the neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenalin) in plasma, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and whole brain was isolated for histological examination of the Purkinje cells and hippocampus.
   Results: Sodium valproate exposed animals showed loss of motor skill development (delayed negative geotaxic response), increased locomotor activity, increased anxiety, and retardation in water maze performance, and lower social interaction. Histopathological evolutions of cerebellum purkinje cells and hippocampus showed 40-50% atrophic cells in sodium valproate animals compared to control animals.
   Interpretation: The results of the present study indicate that Sodium valproate changes specific brain cell population in Balb/C mice, which might be the reason for the altered neurotransmitter levels, leading to behavioural changes in these animals.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia and its sequelae, which include memory impairment, constitute a leading cause of disability worldwide. Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are evolutionarily conserved short-length/noncoding RNA molecules recently implicated in adaptive/maladaptive neuronal responses to ischemia. Previous research independently implicated the miRNA-132/212 cluster in cholinergic signaling and synaptic transmission, and in adaptive/protective mechanisms of neuronal responses to hypoxia. However, the putative role of miRNA-132/212 in the response of synaptic transmission to ischemia remained unexplored. Using hippocampal slices from female miRNA-132/212 double-knockout mice in an established electrophysiological model of ischemia, we here describe that miRNA-132/212 gene-deletion aggravated the deleterious effect of repeated oxygen-glucose deprivation insults on synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory functions. We also examined the effect of miRNA-132/212 gene-deletion on the expression of key mediators in cholinergic signaling that are implicated in both adaptive responses to ischemia and hippocampal neural signaling. miRNA-132/212 gene-deletion significantly altered hippocampal AChE and mAChR-M1, but not alpha 7-nAChR or MeCP2 expression. The effects of miRNA-132/212 gene-deletion on hippocampal synaptic transmission and levels of cholinergic-signaling elements suggest the existence of a miRNA-132/212-dependent adaptive mechanism safeguarding the functional integrity of synaptic functions in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia.

AB  - BackgroundInsulin detemir (IDet) is an insulin analog used to treat diabetes. IDet shows full efficacy but reduced potency compared to human insulin (HI) in both man and rat. In contrast, in pigs and dogs, IDet appears to have full in vivo potency. Non-receptor mediated degradation (NRMD) has previously been suggested as an explanation for the low potency of IDet, but this hypothesis has not been investigated further until now. Bacitracin is a nonspecific protease inhibitor which we hypothesized could inhibit NRMD of IDet in rats.Research design and methodsHealthy male rats instrumented with permanent catheters underwent euglycemic clamp during constant infusion of either HI or IDet at effect-matched doses with co-infusion of vehicle or bacitracin.ResultsPlasma concentrations of IDet increased significantly (p < 0.005) during bacitracin compared to vehicle co-infusion and the concomitant increase in glucose infusion rate (GIR, p < 0.001) required to maintain euglycemic clamp indicates that the IDet rescued from NRMD indeed was active. No significant differences were detected with co-infusions of HI with either bacitracin or vehicle.ConclusionsA large proportion of NRMD of IDet which can be inhibited by bacitracin may partly explain the reduced potency of IDet observed in rats and likely also in man.

AB  - Gold nanoparticles have a high potential for detection. High viability, selective accumulation in cancer cells, and low toxicity are advantages of these particles.The present study investigates the characteristics of one of the new processes prepared with (Fe3O4/Ag3VO4/Au NPs) modified with oleyl chitosan and how to use these characteristics in di-agnostic fields. The obtained nanoparticle has been used as an imaging contrast-enhancing agent. Surface coating with the chitosan alkyl group has improved solubility in therapeutic and imaging applications. MTT assay shows. In addition, the release of MTX at pH 4.7 and 7.4. MTX release obtained an investigation slower and more favorable profile at pH 4.7. The results showed tar-geted, slow, stable, and pH-sensitive release of MTX due to chitosan-modified nanocomposites. Detailed evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography scan (for nanocom-posite production) showed that synergistic properties of nanoparticle structure improved signal strength and T2 time. Cytotoxicity of nanocomposite coated with chitosan-oleic acid was investi-gated using the MTT method. The results clearly showed its non-toxicity. The novelty between the prepared nanocomposite and the previous report is that the modi-fied form in the last word was Caerophyllum macropodum. The role of C. macropodum was for mod-ified nanocomposite in prior published. The compound had only an antibacterial effect.

AB  - The mammalian liver's regenerative ability has led researchers to engineer animals as incubators for expansion of human hepatocytes. The expansion properties of human hepatocytes in immunodeficient mice are well known. However, little has been reported about larger animals that are more scalable and practical for clinical purposes. Therefore, we engineered immunodeficient swine to support expansion of human hepatocytes and identify barriers to their clinical application. Immunodeficient swine were engineered by knockout of the recombinase-activating gene 2 (RAG2) and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). Immature human hepatocytes (ihHCs) were injected into fetal swine by intrauterine cell transplantation (IUCT) at day 40 of gestation. Human albumin was measured as a marker of engraftment. Cytotoxicity against ihHCs was measured in transplanted piglets and control swine. We initially detected higher levels of human albumin in cord blood of newborn FAH/RAG2-deficient (FR) pigs compared with immunocompetent controls (196.26 ng/dL vs. 39.29 ng/dL, p = 0.008), indicating successful engraftment of ihHCs after IUCT and adaptive immunity in the fetus. Although rare hepatocytes staining positive for human albumin were observed, levels of human albumin did not rise after birth, but declined, suggesting rejection of xenografted ihHCs. Cytotoxicity against ihHCs increased after birth by 3.8% (95% CI: [2.1%-5.4%], p < 0.001) and inversely correlated with declining levels of human albumin (p = 2.1 x 10(-5), R-2 = 0.17). Circulating numbers of T cells and B cells were negligible in FR pigs. However, circulating natural killer (NK) cells exerted cytotoxicity against ihHCs. NK cell activity was lower in immunodeficient piglets after IUCT than in naive controls (30.4% vs. 40.1%, p = 0.011, 95% CI for difference [2.7%-16.7%]). In conclusion, ihHCs were successfully engrafted in FR swine after IUCT. NK cells were a significant barrier to expansion of hepatocytes. New approaches are needed to overcome this hurdle and allow large-scale expansion of human hepatocytes in immunodeficient swine.</p> Impact statement
   There is currently a need for robust expansion of human hepatocytes. We describe an immunodeficient swine model into which we engrafted immature human hepatocytes (ihHCs). We identified the mechanism of the eventual graft rejection by the intact NK cell population, which has not been previously shown to have a significant role in xenograft rejection. By both improving engraftment and reducing NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity toward the graft through intrauterine cell transfer, we confirmed the presence of residual adaptive immunity in this model of immunodeficiency and the ability to induce hyposensitization in the NK cell population by taking advantage of the fetal microenvironment.</p>

AB  - Inhaled particulate matter is associated with nasal diseases such as allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and neural disorders.Its health risks on humans are usually evaluated by measurements on monkeys as they share close phylogenetic rela-tionship. However, the reliability of cross-species toxicological extrapolation is in doubt due to physiological and an-atomical variations, which greatly undermine the reliability of these expensive human surrogate models. This studynumerically investigated in-depth microparticle transport and deposition characteristics on human and monkey(Macaca fuscata) nasal cavities that were reconstructed from CT-images. Deposition characteristics of 1-30 mu mparticleswere investigated under resting and active breathing conditions. Similar trends were observed for total deposition ef-ficiencies and a single correlation using Stokes Number wasfitted for both species and both breathing conditions,which is convenient for monkey-human extrapolation. Regional deposition patterns were carefully compared usingthe surface mapping technique. Deposition patterns of low, medium and high inertial particles, classified based ontheir total deposition efficiencies, were further analyzed in the 3D view and the mapped 2D view, which allows locat-ing particle depositions on specific nasal regions. According to the particle intensity contours and regional depositionprofiles, the major differences were observed at the vestibule and thefloor of the nasal cavity, where higher depositionintensities of medium and high inertial particles were shown in the monkey case than the human case. Comparisons ofairflow streamlines indicated that the cross-species variations of microparticle deposition patterns are mainly contrib-uted by two factors. First, the more oblique directions of monkey nostrils result in a sharper airflow turn in the vestibule region. Second, the monkey's relatively narrower nasal valves lead to higher impaction of medium and highinertial particles on the nasal cavityfloor. The methods andfindings in this study would contribute to an improvedcross-species toxicological extrapolation between human and monkey nasal cavities

AB  - Small-scale fisheries support numerous livelihoods in Zimbabwe. However, men are the key actors in the fishing sector relegating women to peripheral roles, often, diminishing women's contribution to household economy and food security. This study investigated the(i) gendered nature of rod and line angling fisheries, (ii) drivers and barriers for gender roles and participation in rod and line angling fisheries, and (iii) household contribution of rod and line angling fisheries in Lake Kariba. The level of participation in fishing, and postharvest roles such as gutting, gleaning, drying, and smoking significantly differs (p < 0.05) among men and women fishers. The main drivers for engaging in rod and line angling for both men and women were a need for food security, extra income, employment, and mental health benefits. The main barriers discouraging rod and line angling were conflict with hippos, crocodiles, expensive fishing permits, park enforcement of strict fishing zones and proper gear, prohibitive costs of fishing equipment, and decline in market demand for fish. Gender does not significantly (p > 0.05) influence the opinions of the fishers towards the drivers and barriers for engaging in rod angling. Women dominate men in numbers and the roles they play, though they have inadequate decision-making powers and hardly get the recognition they deserve in the rod and line angling value chain in Lake Kariba. Developing a pro-women National Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy in Zimbabwe will uplift and empower women fishers in contributing to household food security and poverty alleviation in small-scale artisanal fisheries.

AB  - Millicomposting (MIL, with millipedes), vermicomposting (VER, with earthworms) and composting without invertebrates (CNT, control) were compared for the first time in a replicated controlled experiment to evaluate their efficiency and the quality of their products. Vegetal waste was degraded in small closed digesters to emulate household-scale composting. Temperature profiles were similar in the three composting types. Ninety-two days were enough to complete composting and obtain well-stabilized products (humus with C/N< 20; pH from 7 to 7.8). The mean final volume loss was about 8% higher in VER than MIL and CNT (P < 0.01) and it stabilized between the 32nd and 67th days (51.4% in VER, 43% MIL and 44% in CNT). Both invertebrates promoted gains in humus Ca content (about 34.5% higher compared to CNT), whereas the highest K and Mg contents were observed in VER humus. pH, P2O5, and S contents were also higher in VER humus than in CNT (all P < 0.05). The leachate volumes, electrical conductivity and Na+ and PO43- contents were similar (P > 0.05), while pH and contents of K+ and NH4+ were higher and NO3- was lower in VER than in MIL (all P < 0.01). This resulted in higher maturity degrees in MIL than VER (NH4+/NO3- = 0.01 and 0.93, respectively). Although all three composting types were efficient in producing mature high-quality organic fertilizers, this study showed that the addition of invertebrates improved the composting efficiency and the quality of the final products.

AB  - In modern times, Confidentiality and Privacy principles are reflected in all international and national legislations. Since the formulation of these principles in the Hippocratic Oath and until their emergence in international ethical documents, such as the Oath of Geneva, Confidentiality and Privacy will constantly be the cornerstone of good medical practice. In this paper the authors have summarized some concepts of medical Confidentiality and Privacy, their roles in respecting and protecting the interest of patients and the interest of society that the medical profession can best serve the protection of people's health. Later some historical, ethical, juridical information on them are given as an extension of Medical Deontology in response to new developments in medicine. In the last part of the paper the authors have reflected the situation of Medical Confidentiality and Privacy in Albania and their role to improve the practice of medicine in the current situation of Albania.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Spirulina platensis (SP) and Salvia verbenaca (SV) extracts added to skimmed milk (SM) extender on ram sperm quality and fertility. Semen was collected using an artificial vagina, extended in SM to reach a final concentration of 0.8 x 10(9) spermatozoa/mL, stored at 4? and evaluated at 0, 5 H and 24 H. The experiment has been performed in three steps. Firstly, from four extracts (methanol: MeOH, acetone: Ac, ethyl acetate: EtOAc and hexane: Hex) of SP and SV, only acetonic and hexanoic extracts of SP and acetonic and methanolic extracts of SV showed the highest in vitro antioxidant activities and were then selected for the following step. Thereafter, the effects of four concentrations (1.25, 3.75, 6.25, and 8.75 mu g/mL) of each selected extract on stored sperm motility were evaluated. The output of this trial led to select the best concentrations having beneficial effects on sperm quality parameters (viability, abnormalities, membrane integrity, and lipid peroxidation) and fertility after insemination. The results showed that the same concentration (1.25 mu g/mL) of both Ac-SP and Hex-SP, as well as 3.75 mu g/mL of Ac-SV and 6.25 mu g/mL of MeOH-SV, maintain all sperm quality parameters at 4? during 24 H of storage. Besides, no difference was found in fertility between the selected extracts and the control. In conclusion, SP and SV extracts were shown to improve the quality of ram sperm and to maintain fertility rate after insemination as similar or competitive to many previous studies published in the field.

AB  - In the present study, ZnO-Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized using the leaves of Camellia sinensis and immobilized in crosslinked alginate-chitosan polymer beads and tested for their photocatalytic applications. The prepared nanocomposite was used for the simultaneous adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of acid violet 7 (AV7) dye. The optimization of reaction conditions ensured higher dye removal efficacy up to 94.21 +/- 1.02% using the nanocomposite under UV-C irradiation of 365 nm. The kinetics of the adsorption study fitted well with the pseudo-first-order reaction. The Langmuir model fitted better to the adsorption isotherms compared to the Freundlich and Temkin models. The mechanism of degradation was studied by analyzing the treated AV7 solution. The removal efficiency in tap water, groundwater, and lake water was 83.23 +/- 0.4%, 69.13 +/- 1.6%, and 67.89 +/- 0.3%, respectively. The residual toxicity of the degraded AV7 solution was tested on model organisms like freshwater algae, Scenedesmus sp., and plant model, Allium cepa, demonstrating the lower toxicity of the degraded AV7 product. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis of the experiments was also carried out.

AB  - Birth weight is one of the earliest health parameters with short (neonatal period) and long term (adulthood) implications for an individual. The present work was conducted on the domestic cat, with the objective of determining factors affecting kitten birth weight. Data voluntarily shared by 139 French breeders allowed building a large dataset of purebred kittens (n 1/4 3,547) from 15 breeds. A linear mixed model with queen and cattery as random terms was used to investigate variation factors of kitten birth weight such as breed, litter size, season of birth, age of the queen, presence of stillborn in the litter, sex of the kitten. The most important factor was breed which explained 25% of the variation in birth weight observed in the study population. The five other parameters were also significant but explained only a small additional part of the variance (less than 3% each). Analyses showed that kitten birth weight increased with the age of the queen, was higher in males than females and in litters without stillbirth than in litters with at least one stillborn. In addition, lower birth weights were recorded in summer and autumn compared to other seasons, and birth weight values decreased as the number of kittens in the litter increased. In order to group feline breeds according to their average birth weights and litter sizes, a K-means algorithm was used to identify three clusters among the 15 breeds represented (Group 1: small litter sizes/low birth weights; Group 2: large litter sizes/intermediate birth weights; Group 3: large litter sizes/high birth weights). This study, based on a large dataset established at the national scale, provides reference values of feline birth weights for breeders and veterinarians. The next step could be to explore the relationship between birth weight and neonatal mortality to help identify neonates requiring specific care. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behavior and cognitive functions. It has been reported that high-dose (>20 Gy) radiation-induced behavior and cognitive aberration partly associated with severe tissue destruction. Low-dose (<3 Gy) exposure can occur in radiological disasters and cerebral endovascular treatment. However, only a few reports analyzed behavior and cognitive functions after low-dose irradiation. This study was undertaken to assess the relationship between brain neurochemistry and behavioral disruption in irradiated mice. The irradiated mice (0.5 Gy, 1 Gy and 3 Gy) were tested for alteration in their normal behavior over 10 days. A serotonin (5-HT), Dopamine, gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and cortisol analysis was carried out in blood, hippocampus, amygdala and whole brain tissue. There was a significant decline in the exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in an open field test. We observed a significant short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. Mice exposed to 1 Gy and 3 Gy radiation exhibited increased anxiety in an elevated plus maze (EPM). The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were not statistically significant. In this study we observed that neurotransmitters are significantly altered after irradiation, but the neuronal cells in the hippocampus were not significantly affected. This study suggests that the low-dose radiation-induced cognitive impairment may be associated with the neurochemical in low-dose irradiation and unlike the high-dose scenario might not be directly related to the morphological changes in the brain.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith), is a polyphagous pest whose larval feeding threatens several economically important crops worldwide with especially severe damage to corn (Zea mays L.). Field-derived resistance to several conventional pesticides and Bt toxins have threatened the efficacy of current management strategies, necessitating the development of alternative pest management methods and technologies. One possible avenue is the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other secondary metabolites that are produced and sequestered by plants as a response to larval feeding. The effects of conspecific larval feeding on fall armyworm oviposition preferences and larval fitness were examined using two-choice oviposition experiments, larval feeding trials, targeted metabolomics, and VOC analyses. There was a significant preference for oviposition on corn plants that lacked larval feeding damage, and larvae fed tissue from damaged plants exhibited reduced weights and head capsule widths. All larval feeding promoted significantly increased metabolite and VOC concentrations compared to corn plants without any feeding. Metabolite differences were driven primarily by linoleic acid (which is directly toxic to fall armyworm) and tricarboxylic acids. Several VOCs with significantly increased concentrations in damaged corn plants were known oviposition deterrents that warrant further investigation in an integrated pest management context.

AB  - The nursing behavior of sows plays a crucial role in piglet growth, making precise monitoring and robust statistical analysis essential for a comprehensive evaluation of maternal characteristics. This study employed RGB cameras alongside an innovative Recognition Sow Nursing-You Only Look Once (RSN-YOLO) model to effectively monitor sow nursing behavior. The experimental comprised 24 sows of Yorkshire or Landrace breeds, each fostering no more than 13 piglets. The system automatically detected and recorded the start and end times of each nursing episode, enabling the collection and subsequent analysis of both individual sow characteristics and group behaviors. Results indicate that the YOLOv5s object detection model strikes an optimal balance between speed and accuracy, processing frames at 5.7 ms/frame, while achieving a precision rate of 96.3 %, a recall rate of 95.0 %, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 97.3 %. Comparisons between these automated detections and manual counts from continuous 24-hour video recordings across five pens confirmed that the method accurately captures both the number of nursing instances and the total duration of nursing with over 95 % accuracy when count errors do not exceed two occurrences. Even when count errors exceed two, accuracy remains above 92 %, with the average duration of each nursing session consistently measured with high precision. The study further revealed that sow nursing behavior does not exhibit a significant day-night rhythm, although notable individual variability within the group is evident. This variability is critical for early identification and intervention in cases where sows exhibit abnormal nursing behaviors relative to overall group patterns. Over a 21-day lactation period, both the total and daily average nursing durations decreased and subsequently stabilized as piglets aged, while the frequency of nursing remained relatively constant. A notable positive correlation (r = 0.67) was found between the number of nursing events and the total nursing duration. Additionally, the results support previous findings that proximally influences the synchronicity of nursing behavior: sows located farther apart are significantly less likely to nurse simultaneously (P < 0.01). Overall, this methodology introduces a novel approach for automating the monitoring of sow nursing behavior on large-scale pig farms. By analyzing individual and group nursing patterns, the approach facilitates the early detection and warning of abnormal nursing behaviors, thereby enhancing the assessment of sow nursing performance and significantly advancing precision livestock farming.

AB  - Camels, as resilient livestock uniquely adapted to arid and semi-arid regions, represent a valuable yet underutilized resource for sustainable bioeconomy initiatives. This review highlights the multifaceted valorization of camel-derived bioproducts and wastes across diverse sectors, including food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and bioenergy. Camel milk, rich in proteins, vitamins, and bioactive peptides, offers well-documented nutritional and therapeutic benefits, while camel meat and hump fat-abundant in essential fatty acids-hold promise for functional food and oleochemical applications. Camel skin and hair, high in keratin content, present opportunities for developing biodegradable materials and cosmetic formulations. In biomedical contexts, camel urine exhibits antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant activities, whereas camel blood can be transformed into nanocomposites for advanced therapeutic applications. Furthermore, camel dung serves as a high-potential feedstock for bioenergy through anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis, producing biogas, bio-oil, and biochar for environmental and agricultural uses. Collectively, these camel-based resources support the development of a circular bioeconomy by promoting waste valorization, renewable energy production, and sustainable product innovation in regions facing climatic and ecological challenges.

AB  - Rainfall-runoff (RR) modelling is a challenging task in hydrology, especially at the regional scale. This work presents an approach to simultaneously predict daily streamflow in 86 catchments across the US using a sequential CNN-LSTM deep learning architecture. The model effectively incorporates both spatial and temporal information, leveraging the CNN to encode spatial patterns and the LSTM to learn their temporal relations. For training, a year-long spatially distributed input with precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature for each day was used to predict one-day streamflow. The trained CNN-LSTM model was further finetuned for three local sub-clusters of the 86 stations, assessing the significance of fine-tuning in model performance. The CNN-LSTM model, post fine-tuning, exhibited strong predictive capabilities with a median NashSutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.62 over the test period. Remarkably, 65% of the 86 stations achieved NSE values greater than 0.6. The performance of the model was also compared to different deep learning models trained using a similar setup (CNN, LSTM, ANN). An LSTM model was also developed and trained individually to predict for each of the stations using local data. The CNN-LSTM model outperformed all the models which was trained regionally, and achieved a comparable performance to the local LSTM model. Fine-tuning improved the performance of all models during the test period. The results highlight the potential of the CNN-LSTM approach for regional RR modelling by effectively capturing complex spatiotemporal patterns inherent in the RR process.

AB  - Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is a naturally occurring aryltetralin lignan. However, its clinical application has been limited due to its neurotoxicity, the mechanism of which remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis in PPT-induced neurotoxicity using the toxico-logical evidence chain concept. Our approach included behavioral testing in rats, evaluation of colon and hip-pocampal pathological changes, examination of proinflammatory factors, brain-gut peptides, and an in-depth analysis of gut microbiome and metabolic profiles. Our results demonstrated that PPT exposure compromised cognitive functions, induced damage to the colon and hippocampus, and increased intestinal permeability in rats. Furthermore, it elevated proinflammatory factors, particularly TNF-alpha and IL-6, while causing disruptions in the gut microbiota, favoring Escherichia-Shigella over Lactobacillus. Significant alterations in metabolic profiles in feces, serum, and hippocampus, particularly in tryptophan metabolism with a correlation to inflammatory factors and Escherichia-Shigella, were also observed. Our findings suggest that PPT promotes the enrichment of Escher-ichia-Shigella leading to inflammatory factor production and alterations in kynurenine metabolism in the hip-pocampus, potentially contributing to neurotoxicity. The study provides novel insights into the mechanistic pathways of PPT-induced neurotoxicity, emphasizing the role of the MGB axis and offering avenues for thera-peutic interventions.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphate insecticide commonly used in agriculture and household applications, is con-sidered a developmental neurotoxicant. This study aimed to explain the neuroprotective role of Berberine (BBR) against CPF-induced autophagy dysfunction and apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing hippocampus. F1 gen-eration of Wistar rats was exposed to CPF (3 mg/kg b.wt.) and co-treated with BBR (10 mg/kg b.wt) in two different exposure regimens, gestational (GD9-12 and GD17-21) and lactational (PND1-20). Our results demonstrated that CPF intoxication instigated cognitive and neurobehavioral impairment, oxidant-antioxidant imbalance, and histomorphological alterations in CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the offsprings. Furthermore, mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic genes (caspase3 and Bax) was upregulated, and that of anti-apoptotic BCl2 was downregulated. In addi-tion, exposure to CPF also activated the autophagy inhibitor (mTOR) transcription and subsequently downregulated the expression of autophagy markers beclin1 and LC3-II. In contrast, gestational and lactational co-treatment of BBR significantly upregulated the enzymatic anti-oxidant bar of the hippocampus and attenuated histological alterations. Moreover, BBR co-treatments reduced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the hippocampal region by regulating the ex-pression of apoptotic genes and upregulated the levels of autophagy, confirmed by ultrastructural studies, decreased gene expression and immunostaining of mTOR and increased, and increased expression gene expression and immuno-staining of LC3-II positive cells. Our results confirm that treatment with BBR induces autophagy, which plays a neuro-protective role in CPF-induced developmental neuronal apoptosis in the F1 generation of Wistar rats by regulating the balance between autophagy and apoptosis.

AB  - Regardless of the improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the clinical outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remain poor. Although accumulating evidence indicates that lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs) are essential within the control of tumorigenesis and the metastasis of cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This work explored the pattern of expression and functional significance of a newly found lncRNA, Ewing sarcoma-associated transcript 1 (EWSAT1), in HCC metastasis. The results indicated that EWSAT1 was upregulated significantly in HCC relative to that in normal tissues and was correlated with an aggressive phenotype and low patient survival. Functional experiments demonstrated that EWSAT1 could promote proliferation and HCC cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EWSAT1 binds directly to Yes-associated protein (YAP), promotes Sarcoma gene (Src)-induced phosphorylation of YAP, facilitates nuclear translocation of YAP, and consequently, activates the transcription of Hippo-YAP signaling target genes involved in cancer evolution. This study found that EWSAT1 plays a crucial role in HCC metastasis and that it has the potential to be a prognosis biomarker and a target for therapeutics.

AB  - Histone methylation plays an important regulatory role in the drought response of many plants, but its regulatory mechanism in the drought response of the tea plant remains poorly understood. Here, drought stress was shown to induce lower relative water content and significantly downregulate the methylations of histone H3K4 in the tea plant. Based on our previous analysis of the SET Domain Group (SDG) gene family, the full-length coding sequence (CDS) of CsSDG36 was cloned from the tea cultivar 'Fuding Dabaicha'. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the open reading frame (ORF) of the CsSDG36 gene was 3138 bp, encoding 1045 amino acids and containing the conserved structural domains of PWWP, PHD, SET and PostSET. The CsSDG36 protein showed a close relationship to AtATX4 of the TRX subfamily, with a molecular weight of 118,249.89 Da, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.87, belonging to a hydrophilic protein without a transmembrane domain, probably located on the nucleus. The expression of CsSDG36 was not detected in the wild type, while it was clearly detected in the over-expression lines of Arabidopsis. Compared with the wild type, the over-expression lines exhibited lower hyperosmotic resistance by accelerating plant water loss, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) pressure, and increasing leaf stomatal density. RNA-seq analysis suggested that the CsSDG36 overexpression caused the differential expression of genes related to chromatin assembly, microtubule assembly, and leaf stomatal development pathways. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the significant down-regulation of stomatal development-related genes (BASL, SBT1.2(SDD1), EPF2, TCX3, CHAL, TMM, SPCH, ERL1, and EPFL9) in the overexpression lines. This study provides a novel sight on the function of histone methyltransferase CsSDG36 under drought stress.

AB  - Our understanding of the transitions of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) between distinct stages of pluripotency relies predominantly on regulation by transcriptional and epigenetic programs with limited insight on the role of established morphological changes. We report remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton of hESCs as they transition from primed to naive pluripotency which includes assembly of a ring of contractile actin filaments encapsulating colonies of naive hESCs. Activity of the Arp2/3 complex is required for formation of the actin ring, to establish uniform cell mechanics within naive colonies, to promote nuclear translocation of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ, and for effective transition to naive pluripotency. RNA-sequencing analysis confirms that Arp2/3 complex activity regulates Hippo signaling in hESCs, and impaired naive pluripotency with inhibited Arp2/3 complex activity is rescued by expressing a constitutively active, nuclear-localized YAP-S127A. Moreover, expression of YAP-S127A partially restores the actin filament fence with Arp2/3 complex inhibition, suggesting that actin filament remodeling is both upstream and downstream of YAP activity. These new findings on the cell biology of hESCs reveal a mechanism for cytoskeletal dynamics coordinating cell mechanics to regulate gene expression and facilitate transitions between pluripotency states.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Increasing evidence suggests that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation, may play a substantial role in the traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathophysiology. 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), a compound extracted from the seeds of Apium graveolens Linn (Chinese celery) and used in China to treat ischemic stroke, has demonstrated encouraging anti-reactive oxygen species (ROS) effects. Ascertaining whether NBP can inhibit ferroptosis and its mechanism could potentially expand its use in models of neurological injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Methods and results: In this study, we used erastin-induced in vitro ferroptosis models (HT22 cells, hippocampal slices, and primary neurons) and an in vivo controlled cortical impact mouse model. Our study revealed that NBP administration mitigated erastin-induced death in HT-22 cells and decreased ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial superoxide indicators, resulting in mitochondrial protection. Moreover, the ability of NBP to inhibit ferroptosis was confirmed in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and a TBI mouse model. NBP rescued neurons, inhibited microglial activation, and reduced iron levels in the brain tissue. The protective effect of NBP can be partly attributed to the inhibition of the AHR-CYP1B1 axis, as evidenced by RNA-seq and CYP1B1 overexpression/inhibition experiments in HT22 cells and primary neurons.<br /> Conclusions: Our study underscores that NBP inhibition of the AHR-CYP1B1 axis reduces ferroptosis in neuronal damage and ameliorates brain injury.

AB  - Despite the extensive studies on latex, some fundamental questions on their chemical specialization and the factors influencing this specialization have yet to be investigated. To address this issue, latexes and their bearing tissues from diverse species were profiled by (1) HNMR and GC-MS. Additionally, the antiherbivory activity of these materials was tested against thrips ( Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande, 1895). The multivariate data analysis showed a clear separation between latexes and leaves from the same species. Conversely, the chemical profiles of latexes from different species were highly similar, that is, they displayed much less metabolic species-specificity. These shared chemical profiles of latexes were reflected in their overall higher mortality index (80.4% +/- 7.5) against thrips compared with their bearing tissues (55.5% +/- 14.9). The metabolites correlated to the antiherbivory activity of latexes were triterpenoids and steroids. However, the activity could not be attributed to any single terpenoid. This discrepancy and the reduction of the latex activity after fractionation suggested a complementary effect of the compounds when in a mixture as represented by the latex. Additionally, aqueous fractions of several latexes were found to possess simple spectra, even with only 1 metabolite. These metabolites were determined to be organic acids that might be involved in the modulation of the rate of latex coagulation, potentially increasing the sealing and trapping effects of the latex.

AB  - The transition from paraquat (PQ) to diquat (DQ), both organic dication herbicides, in China has led to significant increases in the number of acute DQ poisoning cases. Case studies have shown that acute DQ poisoning resulted in injury to the central nervous system (CNS), but the mechanism underlying the injury remains to be explored. The present study aimed to investigate how DQ influenced purinergic signaling between astrocytes and microglia and whether extracellular ATP (eATP) was involved in promoting neuroinflammation induced by acute DQ toxicity through the activation of the P2X4/NLRP3 signaling pathway. We constructed a rat model of acute DQ toxicity to observe the pathological changes in hippocampal tissues after DQ exposure and measure the expression levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the hippocampal tissue. We also established an in vitro co-culture model of C6 astrocytes and BV-2 microglia using transwell chambers, measured the amount of eATP secreted into C6 astrocytes after DQ treatment, and assessed the inflammatory response and changes in the P2X4/NLRP3 signaling pathway in BV-2 microglia. The results showed that the neurons in the hippocampal tissue of rats exhibited loose arrangement, nuclear consolidation, and necrosis after DQ exposure, and IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels were signification higher in the hippocampal tissue after DQ exposure. DQ exposure to the co-cultured cells induced an increase in ATP secretion from C6 astrocytes as well as a significant increase of P2X4, NLRP3, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 expression in BV-2 microglia. In contrast, pretreatment of C6 astrocytes with apyrase (an ATP hydrolase) resulted in a significant decrease of P2X4, NLRP3, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 expression in BV-2 microglia. Furthermore, inhibition of P2X4 expression in BV-2 microglia by transfection with si-P2X4 effectively reversed the increase of NLRP3, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 in BV-2 microglia induced by DQ when co-cultured with C6 astrocytes. These results indicate that astrocytes can activate the P2X4/NLRP3 signaling pathway in microglia through the DQ-induced extracellular release of ATP to promote neuroinflammation in rat hippocampal tissue.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) induces hippocampal volume increases in depressed patients, potentially reflecting neuroplasticity. We hypothesized that Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) could provide in vivo evidence of hippocampal neuroplasticity following ECT. This longitudinal study evaluated 43 depressed patients undergoing ECT and 24 controls. MRI and clinical assessments were performed at baseline (V1), after 5 sessions (V2), and post-treatment (V3). Evaluations included a 3 T MR-scan with 3DT1-weighted and multi-shell diffusion (b = 200/1500/2500 s/mm(2), 30/45/60directions) sequences. Q-ball, Diffusion Tensor, and NODDI models provided: axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized FA (GFA), neurite density index (NDI), isotropic fraction (Fiso), and orientation dispersion index (ODI). FreeSurfer extracted whole hippocampal and subfield volumes from T1-weighted images. Longitudinal changes were assessed with linear mixed-effect models. 107 MRIs from patients and 24 MRIs from controls were analyzed. ECT induced significant bilateral hippocampal volume increases (p < 0.001). Group comparisons showed consistently higher FA, lower GFA and ODI in patients compared to controls at all time-points. Following ECT, significant diffusion changes included decreased hippocampal GFA, FA, AD, MD and Fiso, along with increased ODI and NDI. NDI and Fiso changes were localized to the dentate gyrus but not the hippocampal tail. ECT responders showed a significant right hippocampal volume increase at V2 compared to non-responders. After ECT, hippocampal volume increases are accompanied by bilateral changes in NODDI parameters, particularly in the dentate gyrus, consistent with hippocampal neuroplasticity.

AB  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a phosphosphingolipid with pleiotropic biological functions. S1P acts as an intracellular second messenger, as well as extracellular ligand to five G-protein coupled receptors (S1PR1-5). In the brain, S1P regulates neuronal proliferation, apoptosis, synaptic activity and neuroglia activation. Moreover, S1P metabolism alterations have been reported in neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously reported that S1PRs are present in nerve terminals, exhibiting distinct sub-synaptic localization and neuromodulation actions. Since type 2 diabetes (T2D) causes synaptic dysfunction, we hypothesized that S1P signaling is modified in nerve terminals. In this study, we determined the density of S1PRs in cortical synaptosomes from insulin-resistant Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and Wistar controls, and from mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and low-fat-fed controls. Relative to their controls, GK rats showed similar cortical S1P concentration despite higher S1P levels in plasma, yet lower density of S1PR1, S1PR2 and S1PR4 in nerve-terminal-enriched membranes. HFD-fed mice exhibited increased plasma and cortical concentrations of S1P, and decreased density of S1PR1 and S1PR4. These findings point towards altered S1P signaling in synapses of insulin resistance and diet-induced obesity models, suggesting a role of S1P signaling in T2D-associated synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Giraffe present unique contraception challenges as males persistently pursue females during estrus. Year-round pursuit during frequent recurring estrus can pose significant risk under slippery conditions. Complete ovarian suppression is a useful tool in giraffe because it eliminates estrous behavior, interest from the male, and controls reproduction. Effective reproduction control in giraffes has been achieved with porcine zona pellucida, oral melengestrol acetate, and depot medroxy-progesterone acetate. However, these methods allow some degree of folliculogenesis and estrous behavior. Improvest (R) is a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) immunological product that elicits antibodies against GnRH and abrogates the effects of endogenous GnRH. This study evaluated the efficacy of Improvest (R) for gonadal suppression in seven females and one male giraffe by monitoring steroid hormones. Seven female giraffe were treated intramuscularly with an initial dose, a booster at 4 weeks and maintenance boosters at 3-month intervals (600 mu g/dose) for 12 months. Six females were on supplemental contraception during the induction phase because separation from males was not possible. In the male (treated with 400 mu g), testosterone concentrations decreased after the second injection. However, even with low serum testosterone concentrations, mounting (of nontreated females) behavior was still observed occasionally. Ovarian activity was suppressed in all treated females and interest by the males stopped; supplemental contraceptives (during the induction phase) did not impede the effect of Improvest (R). After 15.3 months (seven doses), Improvest (R) was discontinued in three females which no longer needed contraception. In these females, ovarian activity was noted approximately 90 days after the last dose.

AB  - This study aimed, first to assess the chemical composition of date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) syrup and powder, which had been obtained using environmentally friendly processes, in terms of ash, moisture, sugars, proteins, fats and Hydroxymethylfurfural. In addition, the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities were evaluated. Second, to investigate the impact of different mixture concentrations (powder in syrup) on the physicochemical, technological, microbiological and sensorial qualities of probiotic bilayer yogurt during 28 days of refrigerated storage. Both, date syrup and powder found a significant difference in chemical composition. In fact, date powder presented the high antioxidant (5823.22 +/- 6.33 mu mol of Trolox equivalent/g) and antidiabetic activities (82.62 +/- 2.04%) compared to date syrup. Both ingredients enhanced the growth and stability of the yogurt starter culture, thereby improving the probiotic potential of L.rhamnosus LGG in date-added bilayer yogurts with the number of 7.85 log CFU/mL at the end of storage. Physicochemically, the addition of date powder in syrup at 17, 27 and 37% induced significant modifications in pH (4.15 +/- 0.02), acidity (0.58 +/- 0.02%), color and syneresis (57 +/- 0.0%) in probiotic yogurt with 37% of powder in syrup date (PBY37%). During storage, date coproducts hence maintained yogurts' rheological quality. For sensorial analysis, consumers preferred the yogurts with date powder in syrup bilayer because its addition led to functional food and more brownish color and granular texture thereby enhancing consumer's acceptability of the product. In this sense, both date syrup and powder proved to be valuable by-products developed to combat food waste.

AB  - Polonium-210 (210Po) is a radionuclide sentinel as it bioaccumulates in marine organisms, thereby being the main contributor to committed dietary doses in seafood consumers. Although seafood and marine mammals are an important part of the traditional Inuit diet, there is a general lack of information on the 210Po concentrations in the Greenlandic marine food chain leading to the human consumer. Here, we determine background 210Po concentrations in edible parts of different marine organisms from Greenland and provide a dose assessment. Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), organs of ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and polar bear (Ursus maritimus) displayed significantly elevated 210Po concentrations in respect to all other studied organisms (p < 0.001). 210Po concentrations ranged from 0.02 Bq kg-1, w.w. in Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) muscle to 78 Bq kg-1, w.w. and 202 Bq kg-1, w.w. in ringed seal muscle and kidneys, respectively. 210Po concentration ratio for edible parts increases in the order bladderwrack (Fucus Vesiculosus), northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), blue mussels, and from fish species to ringed seal and polar bear. 210Po distribution in fish, ringed seal, and polar bear follows a general pattern, the lowest concentrations were in muscle, and the highest concentrations were in the organs involved in metabolism. The derived 210Po annual absorbed dose in edible parts of studied marine organisms are several orders of magnitude lower than the recommended dose rate screening value of 10 mu Gy h-1. Effective doses from intake of 210Po to Greenland average children (1.4 mSv y-1), and high seafood and marine mammal consumers (2 mSv y-1 for adults and 3.6 mSv y-1for children) are higher than the world average annual effective dose due to ingestion of naturally occurring radionuclides.

AB  - Boswellic acid (BA) is a pentacyclic terpenoid derived from the gum-resin of Boswellia serrate. It is known for its strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. It has improved spatial learning and provides neuroprotection against trimethyltin-induced memory impairment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible neuroprotective activity of B. serrata extract (BSE) containing BA against fipronil (FPN)-induced neurobehavioral toxicity in Wister male albino rats. Sixty male rats were allocated equally into six groups. The first group served as control; the second and third groups received BSE at two different oral doses (250 or 500 mg/kg body weight [BW], respectively). The fourth group was orally intoxicated with FPN (20 mg/kg BW), whereas the fifth and sixth groups served as preventive groups and co-treated with FPN (20 mg/kg BW) and BSE (250 or 500 mg/kg BW, respectively). The experiment was conducted over 8 weeks period. Results revealed that co-treatment with BSE led to significant (p > 0.05) dose-dependent reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factors-alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor Kappa-B (NF-KB), Cyclooxegenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), serotonin, and acetylcholine (ACh). Conversely, significant (p > 0.05) up regulation of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) has reported in BSE-co-treated groups. In addition, significant (p > 0.05) promotion in neurobehaviours, histopathologic imaging of the cerebral, cerebellar, and hippocampal regions, and immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were also reported in the BSE-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, BSE (500 mg/kg BW) is a natural, promising neuroprotective agent that can mitigate FPN-induced neurobehavioral toxicity via the suppression of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic pathways and relieve neuronal necrosis and astrogliosis.

AB  - Misopates orontium L. is traditionally used as diuretic, in liver disorders and also in treatment of ulcer. The objective of present study to evaluate anthelmintic, insecticidal and anti-ulcer potential of M. orontium. Albendazole (20mg/ml) was used as standard drug in anthelmintic activity. Permethrin (239.5 mu/cm(2)) was used as standard insecticidal drug. While standard drugs used for anti-ulcer activity were ranitidine (50mg/kg), omeprazole (20mg/kg) and sucralfate (100mg/kg). In anthelmintic activity ethyl acetate and n- butanol fraction showed time of paralysis (59min), (57min) and death time (107min), (114min) respectively. No extract showed any significant insecticidal activity. Ulcer indices, percentage ulcer inhibition, gastric volume, pH, mucous and protein contents were assessed in ethanol induced ulcer model in rats. Chloroform extract of M orontium significantly reduced gastric lesion 39.84% at 50mg/kg when compared to ranitidine (54.2%), omeprazole 20mg/kg (69.5%) and sucralfate 100mg/kg (53.6%). Gastric volume and total acidity decreased (1.87 +/- 0.2) (45.5 +/- 5.9) in chloroform treated group. While pH, mucous and protein content increased in comparison to ethanol treated group (5.1 +/- 0.3), (478.3 +/- 12.7), (26.1 +/- 4.1) and (2.4 +/- 0.1), (371.8 +/- 10.2), (16.2 +/- 3.2) respectively. Chloroform treated group all values are close relevant to standard drug treated groups. So it was concluded that chloroform extract showed more safe result as compared to other extracts.

AB  - Alumunium usage and toxicity has been a global concern especially an increased use of nanoparticulated aluminum (Al-NPs) products from the environment and the workplace. Al degrades in to nanoparticulate form in the environment due to the routine process of bioremediation in human body. Al-NPs toxicity plays key role in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration which is characterised by the development of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques which correlates to the Alzheimer's disease. This study evaluated the Al-NPs induced neurodegeneration and causative behavioral alterations due to oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage, beta-amyloid aggregation, and histopathological changes in mice. Furthermore, the preventive effect of naringenin (NAR) as a potent neuroprotective flavonoid against Al-NPs induced neurodegeneration was assessed. Al-NPs were synthesized and examined using FTIR, XRD, TEM, and particle size analyzer. Mice were orally administered with Al-NPs (6 mg/kg b.w.) followed by NAR treatment (10 mg/kg b.w. per day) for 66 days. The spatial working memory was determined by novel object recognition, T-maze, Y-maze, and Morris Water Maze tests. We measured nitric oxide, advanced oxidation of protein products, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, oxidised glutathione, and acetylcholine esterase, as well as cytokines analysis, immunohistochemistry, and DNA damage. Al-NPs significantly reduced the learning memory power, increased oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant enzymatic activity, increased DNA damage, altered the levels of cytokines, and increased beta-amyloid aggregation in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the mice brain. These neurobehavioral impairments, neuronal oxidative stress, and histopathological alterations were significantly attenuated by NAR supplementation. In conclusion, Al-NPs may be potent neurotoxic upon exposure and that NAR could serve as a potential preventive measure in the treatment and management of neuronal degeneration.

AB  - Lead poisoning of wild birds by ingestion of lead ammunition occurs worldwide. Histopathological changes in organs of lead-intoxicated birds are widely known, and lead concentration of each organ is measurable using mass spectrometry. However, detailed lead localization at the suborgan level has remained elusive in lead-exposed birds. Here we investigated the detailed lead localization in organs of experimentally lead-exposed ducks and kites by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). In both the ducks and kites, lead accumulated diffusely in the liver, renal cortex, and brain. Lead accumulation was restricted to the red pulp in the spleen. With regard to species differences in lead distribution patterns, it is noteworthy that intensive lead accumulation was observed in the arterial walls only in the kites. In addition, the distribution of copper in the brain was altered in the lead-exposed ducks. Thus, the present study shows suborgan lead distribution in lead-exposed birds and its differences between avian species for the first time.

AB  - Simple Summary Inflammation induced by diet, environmental factors, and stimulated innate immunity is not conducive to intestinal maintenance and remodeling. Fermented soybean meal (FSBM) by Bacillus velezensis (Bv) and Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 367 (Lb) reduces these negative factors and provides bioactive active peptides that are beneficial to intestinal repair and regulate the immune system of the intestinal tract. This study showed that two-stage FSBM regulates the immunity and tight junction in the jejunum, which are beneficial to health and performance. The effect of soybean peptides from fermented soybean meal on the intestinal immunity and tight junction of broilers was assessed. Roughly, two-stage fermented soybean meal prepared with Bv and Lb (FSBMB+L), which has nearly three times higher soluble peptides than soybean meal (SBM), and reduced galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) content and allergen protein. The one-stage fermented by Bv (FSBMB) has the highest soluble peptides, while commercial lactic acid bacteria (FSBML) has the highest Lactic acid bacteria count; these were used to compare the differences in the process. Ross308 broilers (n = 320) were divided into four groups: SBM diet and a diet replaced with 6% FSBMB+L, FSBMB, or FSBML. The growth performance was recorded during the experiment, and six birds (35-day-old) per group were euthanized. Analysis of their jejunum and ileum showed that the fermented soybean meal significantly improved the villus height in the jejunum (p < 0.05) and reduced the crypt hyperplasia. The FSBMB group had the highest reducing crypt depth; however, the FSBMB+L group had the highest villus height/crypt depth in the ileum (p < 0.05). In the jejunum, the relative mRNA of CLDN-1 and Occludin increased 2-fold in the treatments, and ZO-1 mRNA increased 1.5 times in FSBML and FSBMB+L (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the level of NF-kappa B and IL-6 mRNAs in FSBML increased, respectively, by 4 and 2.5 times. While FSBMB, along with FSBMB+L, had a 1.5-fold increase in the mRNA of IL-10, that of NF-kappa B increased 2-fold. FSBMB+L and FSBMB singly led to a 2- and 3-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA, respectively (p < 0.05). FSBMB and FSBMB+L can also upregulate MUC2 in the jejunum (p < 0.05). In short, using the soybean peptides from two-stage fermented soybean meal can ameliorate the negative factors of SBM and effectively regulate immune expression and intestinal repair, which will help broilers maintain intestinal integrity.

AB  - Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), also known as beta-secretase, is an aspartic protease. The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals. These results indicate that the BACE1-generated fragment of NCAM2 regulates BACE1 activity by promoting the targeting of BACE1 to Rab11-positive endosomes.

AB  - The baseline data of radioactivity levels in food is one of the main factors for the assessment of resident's health risk. Gross beta and alpha activity was identified for selected commercial freshwater fish species, including 29 types of fish species by a gas-flow proportional detector. The samples were collected from wholesale markets in Hanoi city, Vietnam. The highest gross alpha activity was recorded in blotched snakehead, a pelagic and carnivorous species, and the lowest one was recorded in common carp, a demersal and omnivorous species. Meanwhile, the gross beta activity was much higher than the gross alpha activity with the highest value of gross beta, observed in Wels catfish, a demersal and carnivorous species, and the lowest one found in Mudskipper a demersal, herbivores species. Regarding feeding types, the gross alpha activity was observed in the order of Al-carnivores > Al-omnivores > Al-herbivores whereas the gross beta was non-distinction. In terms of living behavior, the gross alpha activity in pelagic species was much higher than that in demersal species (Al-pelagic > > Al-demersal) and indifferent for gross beta. There was an insignificant relationship between the trophic level with gross beta and alpha activities in freshwater fish species. The calculated annual effective dose ranged from 0.19 to 1.88 and 0.78 mSv.y(-1) on average, being within the limited dose for the public as reported by UNSCEAR in which gross beta activity has a strong correlation with the total annual effective dose.

AB  - Low methoxy pectin (LM pectin) suffers from burst release owing to its high swellability and solubility in water. Consequently, in ways to design an ideal drug delivery system, these obstacles must be surmounted. Therefore, the work aimed to design dual crosslinked LM pectin-neem gum (NG) mediated interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) floating mucoadhesive microbeads for lansoprazole (LNZ) gastro-retentive delivery. In short, LNZ-loaded floating microbeads were achieved by using the ionic gelation method wherein zinc acetate was preferred as a crosslinking agent. The optimization of IPN microbeads was performed employing a 32factorial design wherein concentration of pectin and NG was considered as independent factors whereas dependant factors are entrapment efficiency and drug release. Importantly, carboxylic functionality of low methoxy (LM) pectin and hydroxylic functionality NG cross-linked with Zn+2 forms a 3D network. Diffractogram and thermogram revealed that conversion of drug from crystalline to amorphous form because of entrapment of drug within polymeric network. Anticipated floating microbeads showed that polymer concentration had considerable effect on drug encapsulation efficiency and drug release. Briefly, optimizing floating microbeads (Batch B:5) showed maximum drug entrapment (87.47 %) with a delayed drug release (69.20 %, at 8 h) due to formation of strong IPN. Moreover, it showed good mucoadhesive aptitude with goat stomach mucosa because of entanglement between gum and mucus layer. In addition, use of calcium silicate assists to modulate floating profile of IPN microbeads. Therefore, designing dual crosslinked zinc-pectinate-NG mediated IPN floating mucoadhesive microbeads will offer a new substitute for floating delivery.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that mostly affects joints. Although RA therapy has made significant progress, difficulties including extensive medication metabolism and its quick clearance result in its inadequate bioavailability. The anti-inflammatory effect of zein was reported with other medications, but it has certain limitations. There are reports on the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of aescin, which exhibits low bioavailability for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Also, the combinatorial effect of zein with other effective drug delivery systems is still under investigation for the treatment of experimental collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis. The focus of this study was to formulate and define the characteristics of zein-coated gelatin nanoparticles encapsulated with aescin (Ze@Aes-GNPs) and to assess and contrast the therapeutic effectiveness of Ze@Aes-GNPs towards collagen-induced RA in Wistar rats. Nanoprecipitation and the layer-by-layer coating process were used to fabricate Ze@Aes-GNPs and their hydrodynamic diameter was determined to be 182 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to further validate the size, shape, and surface morphology of Ze@Aes-GNPs. When tested against foreskin fibroblasts (BJ), these nanoparticles demonstrated significantly high cytocompatibility. Both Aes and Ze@Aes-GNPs were effective in treating arthritis, as shown by the decreased edoema, erythema, and swelling of the joints, between which Ze@Aes-GNPs were more effective. Further, it was demonstrated that Aes and Ze@Aes-GNPs reduced the levels of oxidative stress (articular elastase, lipid peroxidation, catalase, superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide) and inflammatory indicators (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and myeloperoxidase). The histopathology findings further demonstrated that Ze@Aes-GNPs considerably reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells at the ankle joint cartilage compared to Aes. Additionally, immunohistochemistry examination showed that treatment with Ze@Aes-GNPs suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory markers (COX-2 and IL-6) while increasing the expression of SOD1. In summary, the experiments indicated that Aes and Ze@Aes-GNPs lowered the severity of arthritis, and critically, Ze@Aes-GNPs showed better effectiveness in comparison to Aes. This suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation was likely driven by Aes and Ze@Aes-GNPs.

AB  - Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and nanofibrils (CNFs) are sustainable candidates for designing nanocomposites and all-nanocellulose systems for a myriad of advanced applications, such as protective coatings, packaging materials, and hydrogels. The role of nanocellulose in such different applications is mainly determined by its morphological and physicochemical properties. Although these properties have been studied at length by a consistent and growing number of publications, there is still a lack of a comprehensive study of the relationships between structure, properties, and functions of different nanocelluloses. Here, we thoroughly investigated the combined effect of distinct production methods and anatomical origins of non-wood cellulose on the structure-property relationships of CNCs and CNFs. These nanoparticles were obtained by the most established production approaches, that is, sulfuric acid hydrolysis or TEMPO-mediated oxidation/fibrillation of elephant grass leaves or stems, that is, two different parts of a unique biosource. We were able to prepare CNCs and CNFs with modulated morphological features and degrees of polymerization, which implied major effects on the mechanical and rheological behaviors of nanocellulose films and dispersions, respectively. Additionally, tailoring lignin and ionizable group contents as well as the color, transparency, and stability of nanocellulose dispersions could provide important implications for the shelf life of nanocellulose formulations, as well as for their application as nanocomposite additives with UV-protection and antioxidant abilities. Therefore, the assembly of results presented here can work as a tool to guide decision-making for both (1) the selection of methods and/or plant anatomical parts to produce nanocelluloses with tailored properties and (2) the prospects of combining different cellulose nanostructures to design advanced materials.

AB  - In recent decades, fertility traits in humans as well as in farm animals have decreased worldwide. As such, it is imperative to know more about the genetics and physiology of increased or high fertility. However, most of the current animal models with reproductive phenotypes describe lower fertility or even infertility (around 99%). The "Dummerstorf high-fertility lines" (FL1 and FL2) are two unique mouse lines selected for higher reproductive performances, more specifically for higher number of pups per litter. We recently described how those superfertile mice managed to increase their reproductive phenotype by doubling the ovulation rate and consequently the litter size compared to the unselected mice of the same founder population. FLs show an unusual estrous cycle length and atypical levels of hormones that link reproduction and metabolism, such as insulin in FL1 and leptin in FL2. Moreover, we described that their higher ovulation rate is mostly due to a higher quality of their oocytes rather than their sheer quantity, as they are characterized by a higher quantity of high-quality oocytes in antral follicles, but the quantity of follicles per ovary is not dissimilar compared to the control. In the present study, we aimed to analyze the lipid composition of the fertility lines from plasma to the gonads, as they can connect the higher reproductive performances with their metabolic atypicalities. As such, we analyzed the fat content of FLs and fatty acid composition in plasma, liver, fat, oocytes of different quality, and granulosa cells. We demonstrated that those mice show higher body weight and increased body fat content, but at the same time, they manage to decrease the lipid content in the ovarian fat compared to the abdominal fat, which could contribute to explaining their ovarian quality. In addition, we illustrate the differences in fatty acid composition in those tissues, especially a lower level of saturated fatty acids in plasma and a different lipid microenvironment of the ovary. Our ongoing and future research may be informative for farm animal biology as well as human reproductive medicine, mostly with cases that present characteristics of lower fertility that could be reversed following the way-of-managing of Dummerstorf high-fertility lines.

AB  - Intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau is a hallmark pathology shown in over twenty neurodegenerative disorders, collectively termed as tauopathies, including the most common Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, selectively removing or reducing hyperphosphorylated tau is promising for therapies of AD and other tauopathies. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel DEPhosphorylation TArgeting Chimera (DEPTAC) to specifically facilitate the binding of tau to B alpha -subunit-containing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-B alpha), the most active tau phosphatase in the brain. The DEPTAC exhibited high efficiency in dephosphorylating tau at multiple AD-associated sites and preventing tau accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Further studies revealed that DEPTAC significantly improved microtubule assembly, neurite plasticity, and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in transgenic mice with inducible overexpression of truncated and neurotoxic human tau N368. Our data provide a strategy for selective removal of the hyperphosphorylated tau, which sheds new light for the targeted therapy of AD and related-tauopathies.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) is one of major key effectors of the Hippo pathway and the mechanism supporting abnormal YAP expression in Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains to be characterized. Here, we identified ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3) as a bona fide deubiquitylase of YAP in ATC. UCHL3 stabilized YAP in a deubiquitylation activity-dependent manner. UCHL3 depletion significantly decreased ATC progression, stem-like and metastasis, and increased cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. Depletion of UCHL3 decreased the YAP protein level and the expression of YAP/TEAD target genes in ATC. UCHL3 promoter analysis revealed that TEAD4, through which YAP bind to DNA, activated UCHL3 transcription by binding to the promoter of UCHL3. In general, our results demonstrated that UCHL3 plays a pivotal role in stabilizing YAP, which in turn facilitates tumorigenesis in ATC, suggesting that UCHL3 may prove to be a potential target for the treatment of ATC.

AB  - Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition that often requires long-term management, with opioids frequently being the primary option for severe pain relief. Capsaicin, a natural analgesic, holds promise for chronic pain management but is limited by its hydrophobicity, low tissue affinity, and short half-life. In this study, we developed a magnetic field-responsive nanodrug for the on-demand delivery of capsaicin, overcoming these limitations. We utilize iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionally coated with thermoresponsive poly(oligo (ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA). POEGMA nanocoatings on MNPs serve as capsaicin reservoirs. Upon alternating magnetic field (AMFs) exposure, MNPs dissipate heat locally, which triggers the thermodynamic response of their POEGMA nanocoating for capsaicin release. We studied the passive and AMFs-controlled release of capsaicin from MNPs. Then, we investigated the nanodrug for regulating the pain receptor TRPV1, endogenously expressed in primary rat hippocampal neurons, using calcium ion influx as an ion channel activity indicator. Finally, we assessed the biological impact of the nanodrug through cell viability and reactive oxygen species production. We showed that AMFs-induced release of one dose of capsaicin enhances TRPV1 receptors in more than 75% of hippocampal neurons, which would translate to an increased pain sensitivity. However, tonic capsaicin treatment (more than 3 doses of AMFs-induced release) desensitizes TRPV1 in more than 90% of neurons, which would result in analgesic effects. Importantly, the nanotherapy has no detrimental effects on neuronal health. The nanodrug developed here offers a promising mechanism-driven alternative for chronic pain management by enabling wireless and on-demand control of pain receptors.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation is a complex process involving gene expression, protein synthesis, membrane stability, and metabolic adaptation. However, molecular alterations in sperm cryopreservation and the mechanisms defending against freezing damage remain poorly understood. This study investigates these changes and defense mechanisms using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. During sperm cryopreservation, the expression level of G protein subunit alpha i3 (GNAI3) was significantly downregulated in post-thaw sperm (P < 0.001), while matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was upregulated compared to FS groups (P < 0.01). Additionally, interleukin 6 (IL6) expression in the CS group showed an approximate increase (P < 0.05), whereas ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27A) expression decreased markedly (P < 0.05). Other important molecules such as macrophage stimulating 1 receptor (MST1R), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A), fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), CD9 molecule (CD9), peptidase D (PEPD) and terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5B (TENT5B) also exhibited significant changes in expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, the study revealed the regulatory roles of metabolites such as glucose and glutamic acid during sperm cryopreservation. The involvement of catalase (CAT) protein in antioxidant defense was also noted. The interactions among mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins, and metabolites highlight the critical role of the FoxO signaling pathway in modulating responses to freezing. Our study reveals the molecular regulatory mechanisms of sperm during cryopreservation, emphasizing the importance of the FoxO pathway and specific metabolites in response to cryo-injury. These findings provide deeper insights into the complexity of sperm cryobiology and offer practical guidance for optimizing sperm cryopreservation.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) is a promising neurological agent with potential beneficial effects on memory and cognitive function. The combination of CBD and topiramate in the treatment of some neurological diseases has been of great interest. Since Topiramate-induced memory loss is a major drawback of its clinical application and the overall effect of the combination of CBD and topiramate on memory is still unclear, here we investigated the effect of CBD on topiramate-induced memory loss and the underlying molecular mechanisms. A one trial step-through inhibitory test was used to evaluate memory consolidation in rats. Moreover, the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the combination of CBD and topiramate in memory consolidation was evaluated through the intra-CA1 administration of MK-801 and NMDA. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate variations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB)/CREB ratio in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). While the intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of topiramate (50, 75, and 100 mg/kg) significantly reduced inhibitory time latency, the i.p. administration of CBD (20 and 40 mg/kg) could effectively reverse these effects. Similarly, the sub-effective doses of NMDA plus CBD (10 mg/kg) could improve the topiramate-induced memory loss along with an enhancement in BDNF and pCREB expression in the PFC and HPC. Contrarily, the administration of sub-effective doses of the NMDAR antagonist (MK-801) diminished the protective effects of CBD (20 mg/kg) on topiramate-induced memory loss associated with decreased BDNF and pCREB levels in the PFC and HPC. These findings suggest that CBD can improve topiramate-induced memory impairment, partially by the NMDARs of the PFC and HPC, possibly regulated by the CREB/BDNF signaling pathway.Graphical AbstractConsidering the neuroprotective effect of cannabidiol and the deteriorative effect of topiramate on memory function, we investigated the overall effect of the interesting and novel option of their co-administration. Our findings revealed that cannabidiol has ameliorative effects on topiramate-induced memory loss, partially via hippocampal and prefrontal cortical NMDA receptors and CREB/BDNF signaling pathways.

AB  - We discovered tolvaptan as a new Eg5 inhibitor using molecular dynamics simulation-based virtual screening. The Eg5-monastrol, Eg5-ispinesib, and Eg5-STLC complexes with "closed" L5 conformation obtained in MD simulation were used to generate a combined pharmacophore model, and this model was used during the process of virtual screening. Further, the MD simulation for 1 mu s showed that the binding of tolvaptan to Eg5 was stable due to the closure of the alpha 2/L5/alpha 3 pocket. Tolvaptan belongs to the class of drugs called vaptans which are non-peptide vasopressin receptor antagonists. Since our virtual search for mitotic inhibitors identified tolvaptan as a potential candidate, we were interested in unraveling its antimitotic mechanism. Tolvaptan bound to purified Eg5-437H with a dissociation constant of 27 +/- 3.8 mu M. Tolvaptan inhibited the growth of HeLa cells through the mitotic block, and around 70% of these mitotic cells exhibited a characteristic monopolar spindle. Tolvaptan bound to goat brain tubulin with a dissociation constant of 103 +13 mu M. The binding location of tolvaptan on tubulin overlapped with that of colchicine, according to molecular docking analysis. The combination of tolvaptan with STLC augmented mitotic bock with monopolar cells, whereas its combination with vinblastine increased mitotic block with bipolar cells. Since tolvaptan is found to have a significant cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells, it can be developed as a prospective anticancer agent either alone or in combination with other antimitotic drugs.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Originally formulated to mitigate high-altitude sickness, Xinnaoxin capsules (XNX) are composed of three traditional Chinese medicines (Rhodiola rosea L., Lycium barbarum L. and Hippophae rhamnoides) with properties of anti-hypoxia, anti-fatigue, and anti-aging. Emerging evidence now suggests that XNX may also offer therapeutic benefits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting its potential significance in the development of novel AD treatments. Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate whether XNX improves AD-related behavioral and cognitive deficits by enhancing antioxidant defenses, reducing peripheral and neuroinflammation, and protecting neurons. Materials and methods: The AD mouse model was established using D-galactose and aluminum chloride. Spatial memory and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed via the Morris water maze and open field tests to evaluate the therapeutic effects of XNX. Biochemical markers in hippocampal tissue and serum were measured using ELISA kits, while serum chemical composition was analyzed by LC-MS. Histopathological changes and amyloid-(3 deposition in the hippocampus were examined through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence. Additionally, hippocampal expression of apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3, anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, and synaptic proteins PSD-95 and Syn were assessed via Western blot. Results: Behavioral tests demonstrated that XNX significantly improved spatial learning and memory abilities, as well as reduced anxiety-like behaviors in AD mice. XNX also modulated inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in hippocampal tissue and serum, while reducing amyloid-(3 deposition. Further LC-MS analysis of serum revealed a marked upregulation of compounds such as adenosine following treatment, with key metabolic pathways affected, including linoleic acid metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. HE staining and immunofluorescence indicated that XNX ameliorated neuronal damage and decreased amyloid-(3 accumulation. Western blot analysis confirmed that XNX inhibited neuronal apoptosis and preserved synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. Conclusion: XNX mitigates AD-induced behavioral and cognitive deficits by enhancing antioxidant defenses, reducing peripheral and neuroinflammation, and protecting neurons. Our findings provide valuable data and a theoretical foundation for the potential therapeutic application of XNX in AD treatment and its further development.

AB  - Environmental information is required to stabilize estimates of head direction (HD) based on angular path integration. However, it is unclear how this happens in real-world (visually complex) environments. We present a computational model of how visual feedback can stabilize HD information in environments that contain multiple cues of varying stability and directional specificity. We show how combinations of feature-specific visual inputs can generate a stable unimodal landmark bearing signal, even in the presence of multiple cues and ambiguous directional specificity. This signal is associated with the retrosplenial HD signal (inherited from thalamic HD cells) and conveys feedback to the subcortical HD circuitry. The model predicts neurons with a unimodal encoding of the egocentric orientation of the array of landmarks, rather than any one particular landmark. The relationship between these abstract landmark bearing neurons and head direction cells is reminiscent of the relationship between place cells and grid cells. Their unimodal encoding is formed from visual inputs via a modified version of Oja's Subspace Algorithm. The rule allows the landmark bearing signal to disconnect from directionally unstable or ephemeral cues, incorporate newly added stable cues, support orientation across many different environments (high memory capacity), and is consistent with recent empirical findings on bidirectional HD firing reported in the retrosplenial cortex. Our account of visual feedback for HD stabilization provides a novel perspective on neural mechanisms of spatial navigation within richer sensory environments, and makes experimentally testable predictions.

AB  - The hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) projects heavily to the hippocampus to regulate hippocampal activity and plasticity. Although the projections from the SuM to the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA2 have been extensively studied, whether the SuM projects to CA1, the main hippocampal output region, is unclear. Here, we report a glutamatergic pathway from the SuM that selectively excites CA1 interneurons in the border between the stratum radiatum (SR) and the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). We find that the SuM projects selectively to a narrow band in the CA1 SR/SLM and monosynaptically excites SR/SLM inter- neurons, including vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) and neuron-derived neurotrophic factor- expressing (NDNF+) cells, but completely avoids making monosynaptic contacts with CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) or parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) or somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) cells. Moreover, SuM activation drives spikes in most SR/SLM interneurons to suppress CA1 PN excitability. Taken together, our findings reveal that the SuM can directly regulate hippocampal output region CA1, bypassing CA2, CA3, and the DG.

AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) is a neonicotinoid insecticide employed worldwide for crop protection. IMI's mode of action occurs through the agonism of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), with high specificity for insect nAChRs although there are reports of mammals' toxicity. Studies on IMI's neurotoxicity are not conclusive; therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subchronic toxic effects of an IMI based commercial pesticide on rats. Adult male Wistar rats received an IMI suspension via the oral route at doses of 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg for 45 consecutive days. IMI caused an increase in rearing and time spent at the periphery in the locomotor activity test and a decrease in time spent to finish the OX maze task (p < 0.05; ANOVA/Bonferroni). In blood, there was a decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (p < 0.05; ANOVA/ Bonferroni) and an increase in serum butyrylcholinesterase activity (p < 0.001; ANOVA/Bonferroni). Therefore, subchronic administration of an IMI-based-pesticide caused behavioral and systemic impairments in rats.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shenzhiling oral liquid (SZL), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compound, is firstly approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). SZL is composed of ten Chinese herbs, and the precise therapy mechanism of its action to AD is far from fully understood.
   Aim of the study: The purpose of this study was to observe whether SZL is an effective therapy for amyloid-beta (A beta)-induced myelin sheath and oligodendrocytes impairments. Notably, the primary aim was to elucidate whether and through what underlying mechanism SZL protects the myelin sheath through the PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in A beta(42)-induced OLN-93 oligodendrocytes in vitro.
   Materials and methods: APP/PS1 mice were treated with SZL or donepezil continuously for three months, and A beta(42)-induced oligodendrocyte OLN-93 cells mimicking AD pathogenesis of myelin sheath impairments were incubated with SZL-containing serum or with donepezil. LC-MS/MS was used to analysis the active components of SZL and SZL-containing serum. The Y maze test was administered after 3 months of treatment, and the hippocampal tissues of the APP/PS1 mice were then harvested for observation of myelin sheath and oligodendrocyte morphology. Cell viability and toxicity were assessed using CCK-8 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays, and flow cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis. The expression of the myelin proteins MBP, PLP, and MAG and that of A beta(42) and A beta(40) in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice were examined after SZL treatment. Simultaneously, the expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, and mTOR were also examined. The expression of proteins, including CNPase, Olig2, NKX2.2, MBP, PLP, MAG, MOG, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, pmTOR, and mTOR, was determined by immunofluorescence and Western blot, and the corresponding gene expression was evaluated by qPCR in A beta(42)-induced OLN-93 oligodendrocytes.
   Results: LC-MS/MS detected a total of 126 active compounds in SZL-containing serum, including terpenoids, flavones, phenols, phenylpropanoids and phenolic acids. SZL treatment significantly improved memory and cognition in APP/PS1 mice and decreased the G-ratio of myelin sheath, alleviated myelin sheath and oligodendrocyte impairments by decreasing A beta(42) and A beta(40) accumulation and increasing the expression of myelin proteins MBP, PLP, MAG, and PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway associated protein in the hippocampi of APP/ PS1 mice. SZL-containing serum also significantly reversed the OLN-93 cell injury induced by A beta(42) by increasing cell viability and enhanced the expression of MBP, PLP, MAG, and MOG. Meanwhile, SZL-containing serum facilitated the maturation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes in A beta(42)-induced OLN-93 cells by heightening the expression of CNPase, Olig2 and NKX2.2. SZL-containing serum treatment also fostered the expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, and mTOR, indicating an activating PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in OLN93 cells. Furthermore, the effects of SZL on myelin proteins, p-Akt, and p-mTOR were clearly inhibited by LY294002 and/or rapamycin, antagonists of PI3K and m-TOR, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that SZL exhibits a neuroprotective effect on the myelin sheath by promoting the expression of myelin proteins during AD, and its mechanism of action is closely related to the activation of the PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - The cloning of horses is a commercial reality, yet the availability of oocytes for cloned embryo production remains a major limitation. Immature oocytes collected from abattoir-sourced ovaries or from live mares by ovum pick-up (OPU) have both been used to generate cloned foals. However, the reported cloning efficiencies are difficult to compare due to the different somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) techniques and conditions used. The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the in vitro and in vivo development of equine SCNT embryos produced using oocytes recovered from abattoir-sourced ovaries and from live mares by OPU. A total of 1,128 oocytes were obtained, of which 668 were abattoir-derived and 460 were OPU-derived. The methods used for in vitro maturation and SCNT were identical for both oocyte groups, and the embryos were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Embryo development in vitro was assessed, and Day 7 blastocysts were transferred to recipient mares. The embryos were transferred fresh when possible, and a cohort of vitrified-thawed OPU-derived blastocysts was also transferred. Pregnancy outcomes were recorded at Days 14, 42 and 90 of gestation and at foaling. The rates of cleavage (68.7 +/- 3.9% vs 62.4 +/- 4.7%) and development to the blastocyst stage (34.6 +/- 3.3% vs 25.6 +/- 2.0%) were superior for OPU-derived embryos compared with abattoir-derived embryos (P < 0.05). Following transfer of Day 7 blastocysts to a total of 77 recipient mares, the pregnancy rates at Days 14 and 42 of gestation were 37.7% and 27.3%, respectively. Beyond Day 42, the percentages of recipient mares that still had a viable conceptus at Day 90 (84.6% vs 37.5%) and gave birth to a healthy foal (61.5% vs 12.5%) were greater for the OPU group compared with the abattoir group (P < 0.05). Surprisingly, more favourable pregnancy outcomes were achieved when blastocysts were vitrified for later transfer, probably because the uterine receptivity of the recipient mares was more ideal. A total of 12 cloned foals were born, 9 of which were viable. Given the differences observed between the two oocyte groups, the use of OPU-harvested oocytes for generating cloned foals is clearly advantageous. Continued research is essential to better understand the oocyte deficiencies and increase the efficiency of equine cloning. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Advanced or metastatic breast cancer affects multiple organs and is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Cancer metastasis is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal metastasis (EMT). However, the specific signals that induce and regulate EMT in carcinoma cells remain unclear. PRR16/Largen is a cell size regulator that is independent of mTOR and Hippo signalling pathways. However, little is known about the role PRR16 plays in the EMT process. We found that the expression of PRR16 was increased in mesenchymal breast cancer cell lines. PRR16 overexpression induced EMT in MCF7 breast cancer cells and enhances migration and invasion. To determine how PRR16 induces EMT, the binding proteins for PRR16 were screened, revealing that PRR16 binds to Abl interactor 2 (ABI2). We then investigated whether ABI2 is involved in EMT. Gene silencing of ABI2 induces EMT, leading to enhanced migration and invasion. ABI2 is a gene that codes for a protein that interacts with ABL proto-oncogene 1 (ABL1) kinase. Therefore, we investigated whether the change in ABI2 expression affected the activation of ABL1 kinase. The knockdown of ABI2 and PRR16 overexpression increased the phosphorylation of Y412 in ABL1 kinase. Our results suggest that PRR16 may be involved in EMT by binding to ABI2 and interfering with its inhibition of ABL1 kinase. This indicates that ABL1 kinase inhibitors may be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of PRR16-related breast cancer.

AB  - The implementation of CRISPR technology in large animals requires further improvements in embryo manipulation and transfer to be applied with commercial purposes. In this study we report (a) developmental competence of CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes subjected to in vitro culture in large scale programs in sheep; (b) pregnancy outcomes after early-stage (2-8-cell) embryo transfer into the oviduct or the uterine horn; and (c) embryo survival and birth rate after vitrification/warming of CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes. Experiment 1 consisted of a retrospective analysis to evaluate embryo developmental rate of in vitro produced zygotes subjected to CRISPR/Cas microinjection (n = 7,819) compared with a subset of non-microinjected zygotes (n = 701). Development rates to blastocyst on Day 6 were 20.0% for microinjected zygotes and 44.9% for non-injected zygotes (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, CRISPR/ Cas microinjected zygotes were transferred on Day 2 after in vitro fertilization (2-8 cell embryos) into the oviductal ampulla (n = 262) or into the uterine horn (n = 276) in synchronized recipient ewes at prefixed time (i.e., approximately two days after ovulation). Pregnant/transferred recipients (24.0% vs. 25.0%), embryo survival/transferred embryos (6.9% vs. 6.2%), and born lambs/pregnant embryos (72.2% vs. 100.0%) did not differ significantly in the two groups. In Experiment 3, CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes were maintained under in vitro culture until blastocyst stage (Day 6), and subjected to vitrification/ warming via the Cryotop method (n = 474), while a subset of embryos were left fresh as control group (n = 75). Embryos were transferred into the uterine horn of recipient females at prefixed time 8.5 days after the estrous synchronization treatment (i.e., approximately six days after ovulation). Pregnancy rate (30.8% vs. 48.0%), embryo survival rate (14.8% vs. 21.3%), and birth rate (85.7% vs. 75.0%) were not different (P]NS) between vitrified and fresh embryos, respectively. In conclusion, the current study in sheep embryos reports (a) suitable developmental rate after CRISPR/Cas microinjection (i.e., 20%), even though it was lower than non-microinjected zygotes; (b) similar outcomes when Day 2-embryos were placed into the uterine horn instead of the oviduct, avoiding both time-consuming and invasive oviduct manipulation, and extended in vitro culture during one week; (c) promising pregnancy and birth rates obtained with vitrification of CRISPR/Cas microinjected embryos. This knowledge on in vitro embryo development, timing of embryo transfer, and cryopreservation of CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes have practical implications for the implementation of genome editing technology in large animals.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Alveologenesis, the final stage in lung development, substantially remodels the distal lung, expanding the alveolar surface area for efficient gas exchange. Secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) exist transiently in the neonatal distal lung and are crucial for alveologenesis. However, the pathways that regulate SCMF function, proliferation and temporal identity remain poorly understood. To address this, we purified SCMFs from reporter mice, performed bulk RNA-seq and found dynamic changes in Hippo -signaling components during alveologenesis. We deleted the Hippo effectors Yap/Taz from Acta2 -expressing cells at the onset of alveologenesis, causing a significant arrest in alveolar development. Using single cell RNA-seq, we identified a distinct cluster of cells in mutant lungs with altered expression of marker genes associated with proximal mesenchymal cell types, airway smooth muscle and alveolar duct myofibroblasts. In vitro studies confirmed that Yap/Taz regulates myofibroblastassociated gene signature and contractility. Together, our findings show that Yap/Taz is essential for maintaining functional myofibroblast identity during postnatal alveologenesis.

AB  - Synaptic facilitation is a major form of short-term plasticity typically driven by an increase in residual presyn-aptic calcium. Using near-total internal reflection fluorescence (near-TIRF) imaging of single vesicle release in cultured hippocampal synapses, we demonstrate a distinctive, release-dependent form of facilitation in which probability of vesicle release is higher following a successful glutamate release event than following a failure. This phenomenon has an onset of <= 500 ms and lasts several seconds, resulting in clusters of successful release events. The release-dependent facilitation requires neuronal contact with astrocytes and astrocytic glutamate uptake by EAAT1. It is not observed in neurons grown alone or in the presence of astrocyte-conditioned media. This form of facilitation dynamically amplifies multi-vesicular release. Facilitation-evoked release events exhibit spatial clustering and have a preferential localization toward the active zone center. These results uncover a rapid astrocyte-dependent form of facilitation acting via modulation of multi-vesicular release and displaying distinctive spatiotemporal properties.

AB  - Tissue-engineered skin is an ideal material for clinical use in wound repair. However, the epidermal layer of tissue-engineered skin has limited function owing to the inability to maintain its proliferative potential and weak antimicrobial properties, posing a challenge to its widespread clinical application in repairing skin defects. In this study, a bioink formulation containing 1 % gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and 0.5 % chitosan methacryloyl (CSMA) was used to develop a bilayer tissue-engineered skin material containing a dermal layer composed of human dermal fibroblasts and an epidermal layer composed of human keratinocytes. The bioprinted tissues showed antimicrobial properties with 85 % effectiveness in hydrogel antibacterial experiment, biocompatibility of over 89 % in cell viability test, and good mechanical properties. In vivo experiments further showed that the cell-inoculated GelMA-CSMA scaffolds cultured for 10 days maintained the proliferative potential of the epidermal layer of the bioprinted constructs under a confined force after transplantation to skin tissue defects in nude mice. Functional tests demonstrated that these scaffolds facilitate wound repair by promoting epidermal growth, collagen deposition, and skin appendage formation. Thus, bilayer tissue-engineered skin with mechanical stimulation loading offers an effective material for the treatment of skin defects, providing a new approach to clinical wound healing.

AB  - Despite ongoing experiential change, neural activity maintains remarkable stability. Although this is thought to be mediated by homeostatic plasticity, what aspect of neural activity is conserved and how the flexibility necessary for learning and memory is maintained is not fully understood. Experimental studies suggest that there exists network-centered, in addition to the well-studied neuron-centered, control. Here we computationally study such a potential mechanism: input-dependent inhibitory plasticity (IDIP). In a hippocampal model, we show that IDIP can explain the emergence of active and silent place cells as well as remapping following silencing of active place cells. Furthermore, we show that IDIP can also stabilize recurrent dynamics while preserving firing rate heterogeneity and stimulus representation, as well as persistent activity after memory encoding. Hence, the establishment of global network balance with IDIP has diverse functional implications and may be able to explain experimental phenomena across different brain areas.

AB  - Cypermethrin (CMN) is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide known for its neurotoxic effects, particularly in the hippocampus. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we conducted integrated microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing in HT22 hippocampal cells treated with 400 mu M CMN. We identified 36 differentially expressed miRNAs and 170 target mRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed significant involvement in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, and signaling pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B signaling pathway (PI3K-Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. Using six topological algorithms, three hub genes (Col1a2, Fn1, and Pdgfrb) were finally identified. In addition, a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed, and expression patterns of key miRNAs and mRNAs were validated via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These findings highlight the critical role of the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in CMN-induced neurotoxicity. The study provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and preventive strategies for CMN-associated hippocampal damage.

AB  - Lead (Pb) exposure can cause central nervous system (CNS) damage. The process of Pb neurotoxicity is accompanied by the microglia activation. In addition, microglia activation was observed under the intervention of high-fat diets (HFD). This study was designed to investigate the effect of Pb on the cognitive function of mice with HFD, with focus on the microglia activation in brain. Male C57BL/6J mice, 8 weeks of age, were randomly divided into control, HFD, Pb, and HFD + Pb groups. The results showed that HFD following Pb exposure could exacerbate the learning and memory impairment in mice. Pb exposure could promote microglia activation and increase the expression of M1 microglia marker and decrease the expression of M2 microglia marker in the hippocampus of mice with HFD. Our finding suggested that Pb exposure may aggravate CNS damage by promoting M1 polarization and inhibiting M2 polarization of hippocampal microglia in HFD mice.

AB  - DTNBP1 is a gene associated with schizophrenia. Postmortem studies found a reduced expression of DTNBP1 in regions associated with schizophrenia in patients' brains. Sandy (Sdy) mice have a loss-of-function mutation in Dtnbp1 gene, resulting in behavioral deficits and brain changes similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia. We previously showed that exposing adult Sdy mice to circadian disruption led to an exacerbation of schizophrenia-relevant behaviors. Here we asked whether the interaction between this genetic risk factor and circadian disruption occurs during adolescence, a period when environmental insults can promote schizophrenia symptoms, and whether sex affects this interaction. Starting at postnatal day 21, wild-type (WT) and Sdy males and females were housed for 4 weeks either in a 12 h light:12 h dark (LD 12:12) cycle or under chronic jetlag (CJL). Then, after 2 weeks in LD 12:12, behavioral assessments were conducted, including elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition (NOR), social interaction, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. NOR and social novelty tests showed that, surprisingly, CJL during adolescence had opposite effects on WT and Sdy males, that is, behavioral deficits in WT males while rescuing preexisting deficits in Sdy mice. CJL led to decreased sociability in WT and Sdy mice while decreasing PPI only in females. Sdy mice showed decreased anxiety-like behavior compared with wild-type (WT), which was further accentuated by CJL in males. Thus, circadian disruption during adolescence, on its own or in association with Dtnbp1 mutation, can influence cognition, sociability, sensorimotor gating, and anxiety-like behaviors in a sex-dependent manner.

AB  - Reports are scarce on the increase of antimicrobial resistance and the transfer of resistance from progenitor to progeny in production animals. Given this scenario, it is essential to understand how bacterial resistance mechanisms spread in ovine culture.The aim of this study is to identifythe occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in Coliforms and Presumptive (P.) Enterococcus spp. present in progenitors and their descendants during the birth and weaning periods. Twenty-six pregnant ewes (Ovis pries) with an average body weight of 40 +/- 2.0 kg and a body condition score of 3.5 +/- 0.3 were used. Blood and fecal samples were collected from both dams and offspring for complete blood count analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST).The ASTwas performed against the antibiotics penicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, ampicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin and ceftiofur, targeting the bacterial genera Coliforms and Enterococcus spp. The results have shown that in the birth and weaning period, the progenitor and progeny had similarity to the susceptibility tests. Antibiotics such as erythromycin and penicillin presented high resistance levels. Furthermore, ceftiofur, an antibiotic not used in sheep farming, showed isolated cases of resistance. Although these occurrences were low and not widespread, the findings highlight the potential impact of pre-existing bacterial resistance mechanisms on the effectiveness of newer antimicrobials. It is concluded that there is a maternal-descendant similarity between both bacteria.The antibiotics ceftiofur, tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin and enrofloxacin showed lower resistance; erythromycin and penicillin showed higher resistance. Specific studies are recommended for each ovine production to control the resistance offered by erythromycin and penicillin.

AB  - Green tea, derived from Camellia sinensis, contains polyphenolic active compounds that exhibit diverse pharmacological effects including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. Employing various concentrations of green tea polyphenols (GTPs; 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 Ng/mL), human normal lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (A549) underwent treatment. The cell viability was assessed using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, proliferation was examined through the colony formation assay, apoptosis was monitored via flow cytometry, cell migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin) were determined by Western blot. A549 cells were subjected to Cisplatin (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 NM) and X-ray irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6 Gy) for treatment to probe the influence of GTPs on A549 cells in response to chemoradiotherapy. The functioning mechanism of GTPs in the context of NSCLC was validated using lithium chloride (LiCl) [a glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) inhibitor], which activates the Wnt//3-catenin pathway. GTPs suppressed NSCLC cell viability in a concentration-dependent pattern, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 362.5 Ng/mL, while showing little impact on BEAS-2B cells' viability (at concentrations not exceeding 500 Ng/mL). Treatment with GTPs dampened colony formation of NSCLC cells, while promoting apoptosis. LiCl treatment vigorously attenuated the inhibitory impact of GTPs on the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. Mechanistic studies suggested that GTPs strengthened GSK-3 beta stability, thereby impeding the Wnt//3-catenin pathway. Tea polyphenols (TPs) in conjunction with concurrent radiochemotherapy (CRCT) enhance the stability of GSK-3 beta and dampen the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, hence exerting anticancer effects in NSCLC.

AB  - Inhibitory control is essential for the regulation of neuronal network activity, where excitatory and inhibitory synapses can act synergistically, reciprocally, and antagonistically. Sustained excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance, therefore, relies on the orchestrated adjustment of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength. While growing evidence indicates that the brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial regulator of excitatory synapse plasticity, it remains unclear whether and how the ECM contributes to inhibitory control in neuronal networks. Here we studied the simultaneous changes in excitatory and inhibitory connectivity after ECM depletion. We demonstrate that the ECM supports the maintenance of E-I balance by retaining inhibitory connectivity. Quantification of synapses and super-resolution microscopy showed that depletion of the ECM in mature neuronal networks preferentially decreases the density of inhibitory synapses and the size of individual inhibitory postsynaptic scaffolds. The reduction of inhibitory synapse density is partially compensated by the homeostatically increasing synaptic strength via the reduction of presynaptic GABA(B) receptors, as indicated by patch-clamp measurements and GABA(B) receptor expression quantifications. However, both spiking and bursting activity in neuronal networks is increased after ECM depletion, as indicated by multi-electrode recordings. With computational modelling, we determined that ECM depletion reduces the inhibitory connectivity to an extent that the inhibitory synapse scaling does not fully compensate for the reduced inhibitory synapse density. Our results indicate that the brain's ECM preserves the balanced state of neuronal networks by supporting inhibitory control via inhibitory synapse stabilization, which expands the current understanding of brain activity regulation.

AB  - Antenatal psychopathology negatively affects obstetric outcomes and exerts long-term consequences on the offspring's wellbeing and mental health. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these associations remain largely unknown. Here, we present a novel model system in mice that allows for experimental investigations into the effects of antenatal depression-like psychopathology and for evaluating the influence of maternal pharmacological treatments on long-term outcomes in the offspring. This model system in based on rearing nulliparous female mice in social isolation prior to mating, leading to a depressive-like state that is initiated before and continued throughout pregnancy. Using this model, we show that the maternal depressive-like state induced by social isolation can be partially rescued by chronic treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (FLX). Moreover, we identify numerous and partly sex-dependent behavioral and molecular abnormalities, including increased anxiety-like behavior, cognitive impairments and alterations of the amygdalar transcriptome, in offspring born to socially isolated mothers relative to offspring born to mothers that were maintained in social groups prior to conception. We also found that maternal FLX treatment was effective in preventing some of the behavioral and molecular abnormalities emerging in offspring born to socially isolated mothers. Taken together, our findings suggest that the presence of a depressive-like state during preconception and pregnancy has sex-dependent consequences on brain and behavioral functions in the offspring. At the same time, our study highlights that FLX treatment in dams with a depression-like state can prevent abnormal behavioral development in the offspring.

AB  - Interleukin 34 (IL34) and colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) signal through a shared receptor (CSF1R) to control macrophage survival, differentiation, and function. Here, we describe the impact of loss-of-function mutation in the rat Il34 gene. In contrast to IL34 mutant mice, macrophages within squamous epithelia (Langerhans cells) were not significantly depleted in Il34-/- rats. In the brain, microglia and brain-associated macrophages were selectively depleted in grey matter. A gradient of microglial density in the Il34-/- cortex suggests that CSF1 can diffuse outwards from the corpus callosum. Microglial loss was not associated with detectable neuropathology or altered gene expression in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus aside from selective loss of microglia-expressed transcripts. In the adenine diet model of renal interstitial fibrosis, both Il34 and Csf1 were induced. The absence of IL34 led to a significant reduction in macrophage recruitment compared with controls, but pathology was unaffected. We suggest that IL34 and CSF1 provide overlapping signals to sustain microglia and to direct macrophage recruitment and repair tissue injury in the periphery.

AB  - The maintenance of genome stability is critical for health, but during individual ontogenesis, different stressors affect DNA integrity, which can lead to functional and/or structural changes in the cells of target organs. In the nervous system, cell genome destabilization is associated with different neurological and psychiatric diseases, but experiments in vivo, where a link between stress and DNA instability has been demonstrated, are relatively rare. Here, we use rat strains selected for the contrast excitability of the tibialis nerve (n. tibialis) and nonselected Wistar rats to investigate the reasons for individual differences in developing post-stress pathologies. Previous research on the behavioral response of these strains to prolonged emotional-painful stress (PEPS) allows us to consider one strain as a model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and another strain as a model of compulsive disorder (CD). We study DNA damage in the cells of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala, regions involved in stress responses and the formation of post-stress dysfunctions. The evaluation of cell genome integrity via the comet assay shows different responses to PEPS in each brain area analyzed and for all strains used. This could help us to understand the reasons for individual differences in the consequences of stress and the pathophysiology of post-stress disease formation.

AB  - The leafcutter ants (LCA) are considered plague in a great part of the American continent, causing great damage in production fields. Knowing the locomotion and foraging rhythm in LCA on a continuous basis would imply a significant advance for ecological studies, fundamentally of animal behavior. However, studying the forage rhythm of LCA in the field involves a significant human effort. This also adds a risk of subjective results due to the operator fatigue. In this work a new development named 'AntVideoRecord' is proposed to address this issue. This device is a low-cost autonomous system that records videos of the LCA path in a fixed position. The device can be easily reproduced using the freely accessible source code provided. The evaluation of this novel device was successful because it has exceeded all the basic requirements in the field: record continuously for at least seven days, withstand high and low temperatures, capture acceptable videos during the day and night, and have a simple configuration protocol by mobile devices and laptops. It was possible to confirm the correct operation of the device, being able to record more than 1900 h in the field at different climate conditions and times of the day. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Vacant land in residual urban areas is a crucial resource to tackle the current climate and housing crises. In this study, we present the development of a geodatabase to determine the occurrence of vacant land in the urban core of Oklahoma City, USA (OKC), and assess its potential for infill housing. As a starting point, we define urban vacant land through a literature review. We present a description of the case study's social and urbanistic context by highlighting its relevance to this study. We explain the methodology for the development of the geodatabase to quantify residual urban land in OKC's urban core. We examine the spatial distribution and recurring characteristics of vacant parcels using QGIS, Python scripting for Rhinoceros 3D, and aerial imagery. We find that small parcels have higher vacancy rates than average-sized parcels and there is a correlation between higher vacancy rates and proximity to downtown and brownfields. Finally, we discuss the implications of the findings by assessing the urban vacant land potential for residential development and its contribution to OKC's housing provision. Under all the proposed scenarios, the considered developable vacant land in the urban core could entirely fulfill the need for new housing units for the entire city.

KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), a CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration with type 2 inflammation and is highly associated with bronchial asthma. Intractable ECRS with poorly controlled asthma is recognized as a difficult-to-treat eosinophilic airway inflammation. Although eosinophils are activated and coincubation with airway epithelial cells prolongs their survival, the interaction mechanism between eosinophils and epithelial cells is unclear. This study examined the effect of eosinophils on mucin glycoprotein 1 (MUC1), a member of membrane-bound mucin, in the airway epithelial cells, to elucidate the mechanisms of the eosinophil-airway epithelial cell interaction. Nasal polyp samples from patients with CRSwNP and BEAS-2B airway epithelial cells, coincubated with purified eosinophils, were stained with two MUC1 antibodies. To confirm the involvement of CCL4, an anti-CCL4 neutralizing antibody or recombinant CCL4 was used as needed. The immunofluorescence results revealed a negative correlation between the expression of full-length MUC1 and eosinophil count in nasal polyps. In BEAS-2B coincubated with eosinophils, full-length MUC1, but not the C-terminal domain, was reduced, and eosinophil survival was prolonged, which was concomitant with CCL4 increase, whereas the anti-CCL4 neutralizing antibody decreased these reactions. The survival of eosinophils that contacted recombinant MUC1 without the N-terminal domain was prolonged, and recombinant CCL4 increased the expression of metalloproteases. Increased CCL4 induces the contact between eosinophils and airway epithelial cells by shedding the MUC1 N-terminal domain and enhances eosinophil survival in eosinophilic airway inflammation. This novel mechanism may be a therapeutic target for difficult-to-treat eosinophilic airway inflammation.

AB  - Despite intensive research, the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still not fully understood, and currently there are no effective treatments. Therefore, there is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers and animal models of AD to develop innovative therapeutic strategies addressing early pathologic events such as neuroinflammation and redox disturbances. The study aims to identify inflammatory and redox dysregulations in the context of AD-specific neuronal cell death and DNA damage, using the APP(V717I)x TAU(P301L) (AT) mouse model of AD. The expression of 84 inflammatory and 84 redox genes in the hippocampus and peripheral blood of double transgenic AT mice was evaluated against age-matched controls. A distinctive gene expression profile in the hippocampus and the blood of AT mice was identified, addressing DNA damage, apoptosis and thrombosis, complemented by inflammatory factors and receptors, along with ROS producers and antioxidants. Gene expression dysregulations that are common to AT mice and AD patients guided the final selection of candidate biomarkers. The identified inflammation and redox genes, common to AD patients and AT mice, might be valuable candidate biomarkers for preclinical drug development that could be readily translated to clinical trials.

AB  - Hydrocephalus is a complicated disorder that affects both adult and pediatric populations. The mechanism of hydrocephalus development, especially when there is no mass lesion present causing an obstructive, is poorly understood. Prior studies have demonstrated that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) develop hydrocephalus by week 7, which was attenuated with minocycline. The aim of this study was to determine sex differences in hydrocephalus development and to examine the effect of minocycline administration after hydrocephalus onset. Male and female Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) and SHRs underwent magnetic resonance imaging at weeks 7 and 9 to determine ventricular volume. Choroid plexus epiplexus cell activation, cognitive deficits, white matter atrophy, and hippocampal neuronal loss were examined at week 9. In the second phase of the experiment, male SHRs (7 weeks old) were treated with either saline or minocycline (20 mg/kg) for 14 days, and similar radiologic, histologic, and behavior tests were performed. Hydrocephalus was present at week 7 and increased at week 9 in both male and female SHRs, which was associated with greater epiplexus cell activation than WKYs. Male SHRs had greater ventricular volume and epiplexus cell activation compared to female SHRs. Minocycline administration improved cognitive function, white matter atrophy, and hippocampal neuronal cell loss. In conclusion, while both male and female SHRs developed hydrocephalus and epiplexus cell activation by week 9, it was more severe in males. Delayed minocycline treatment alleviated hydrocephalus, epiplexus macrophage activation, brain pathology, and cognitive impairment in male SHRs.

AB  - A facile method for the preparation of oxygen and nitrogen self-doped biochar is developed in this work through the application of one-step chemical activation by using pre-oxidized camellia combing graphene oxide. The extracted results revealed that the obtained biochar had a micropores structure while the nitrogen, oxygen heteroatoms were successfully homogeneously introduced into the carbon frameworks. The specific surface area of the GC-700-4 was about 1343 cm(2) g(-1) with oxygen and nitrogen contents of nearly 15.6 at.% and 2.4 at.%, respectively. When used as an electrode for supercapacitors, the GC-700-4 compound shows the highest area-specific capacitance of 2,206 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2), and capacitance retention of about 97.4% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the proposed symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated based on GC-700-4, which exhibits a high gravimetric capacitance value of 236.5 F g(-1) and capacity retention of 94.2% after the enforcement of 10,000 cycles at 20 A g(-1), as well as an excellent rate capability. These results confirm that graphene wrapped in biochar can change its morphology, and improve its conductivity and electrochemical performance, while graphene wrapped on the surface of biochar is only beneficial to improve the cycle stability of capacitors.

AB  - Cytoprotective and neurotoxic kynurenines formed along the kynurenine pathway (KP) were identified as possible therapeutic targets in various neuropsychiatric conditions. Memantine, an adamantane derivative modulating dopamine-, noradrenaline-, serotonin-, and glutamate-mediated neurotransmission is currently considered for therapy in dementia, psychiatric disorders, migraines, or ischemia. Previous studies have revealed that memantine potently stimulates the synthesis of neuroprotective kynurenic acid (KYNA) in vitro via a protein kinase A-dependent mechanism. Here, the effects of acute and prolonged administration of memantine on brain kynurenines and the functional changes in the cerebral KP were assessed in rats using chromatographic and enzymatic methods. Five-day but not single treatment with memantine selectively activated the cortical KP towards neuroprotective KYNA. KYNA increases were accompanied by a moderate decrease in cortical tryptophan (TRP) and L-kynurenine (L-KYN) concentrations without changes in 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) levels. Enzymatic studies revealed that the activity of cortical KYNA biosynthetic enzymes ex vivo was stimulated after prolonged administration of memantine. As memantine does not directly stimulate the activity of KATs' proteins, the higher activity of KATs most probably results from the increased expression of the respective genes. Noteworthy, the concentrations of KYNA, 3-HK, TRP, and L-KYN in the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum were not affected. Selective cortical increase in KYNA seems to represent one of the mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of memantine. It is tempting to hypothesize that a combination of memantine and drugs could strongly boost cortical KYNA and provide a more effective option for treating cortical pathologies at early stages. Further studies should evaluate this issue in experimental animal models and under clinical scenarios.

AB  - In myocardial ischemia, melatonin confers antiarrhythmic action, but its electrocardiographic expression is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effects of melatonin treatment on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters reflecting major arrhythmogenic factors and to test the association of these parameters with ventricular fibrillation (VF) incidence. Myocardial ischemia was induced by 40 min coronary artery occlusion in 25 anesthetized pigs. After induction of ischemia, 12 and 13 animals were given melatonin or placebo, respectively. Twelve-lead ECGs were recorded and durations of QRS, QT, Tpeak-Tend intervals and extrasystolic burden were measured at baseline and during occlusion. During ischemia, VF episodes clustered into early and delayed phases (20 min, respectively), and QRS duration was associated with VF incidence. QT interval and extrasystolic burden did not differ between the groups. The Tpeak-Tend interval was progressively prolonged, and the prolongation was less pronounced in the treated animals. QRS duration increased, demonstrating two maxima (5-10 and 25 min, respectively). In the melatonin group, the earlier maximum was blunted, and VF development in this period was prevented. Thus, acute melatonin treatment prevented excessive prolongation of the QRS and Tpeak-Tend intervals in the porcine myocardial infarction model, and QRS duration can be used for the assessment of antiarrhythmic action of melatonin.

AB  - The accumulation of microglia around senile plaques is one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chemerin is an adipokine with immune-modulating properties. Our previous study showed that chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), the receptor for chemerin, is also a functional receptor of A beta. However, it remains unclear whether and how the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis affects the migration of microglia. The impact of CMKLR1 on microglial activation and recruitment toward A beta deposits was examined in APP/PS1 mice mated with CMKLR1 knockout (CMKLR1(-/-)) mice. CMKLR1 deficiency reduced the number of microglia around A beta deposits in aged APP/PS1-CMKLR1(-/-) mice compared with APP/PS1 mice. Chemerin expression was significantly decreased in the hippocampus and cortex of aged APP/PS1 mice compared with WT mice. In vitro assays demonstrated that activation of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis promoted the migration of primary cultures of microglia and murine microglial N9 cells. Mechanistic studies found that chemerin/CMKLR1 induced polarization and protrusion formation of microglia by promoting the remodeling of actin filaments and microtubules, and Golgi apparatus reorientation. The inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuated the promotion of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis on microglial migration and polarization. In addition, chemerin inhibited A beta-induced microglial clustering. The inhibition of p38 MAPK alleviated the suppressive effect of chemerin on A beta-induced microglial aggregation. Our data indicate that the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis is involved in the migration and recruitment of microglia to senile plaques via the p38 MAPK pathway. Modulation of the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis is a potential new strategy for AD therapy.

AB  - Representations related to past experiences play a critical role in memory and decision-making processes. The rat hippocampus expresses these types of representations during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events, and previous work identified a minority of SWRs that contain 'replay' of spatial trajectories at similar to 20x the movement speed of the animal. Efforts to understand replay typically make multiple assumptions about which events to examine and what sorts of representations constitute replay. We therefore lack a clear understanding of both the prevalence and the range of representational dynamics associated with replay. Here, we develop a state space model that uses a combination of movement dynamics of different speeds to capture the spatial content and time evolution of replay during SWRs. Using this model, we find that the large majority of replay events contain spatially coherent, interpretable content. Furthermore, many events progress at real-world, rather than accelerated, movement speeds, consistent with actual experiences.

AB  - Hepatic pathological angiogenesis (HPA) is the key event of hepatic fibrosis (HF). Xueshisanjia powder (XSSJS), a Chinese herbal compound, is beneficial for alleviating pathological angiogenesis of hepatic tissue. The present study attempts to reveal the effect and mechanism of XSSJS via regulating miR-29b-3p/VEGFA axis against pathological angiogenesis in HF. In in vitro model, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with miR-29b-3p mimics, whereby the expression of miR-29b-3p was tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), ensued by Luciferase assay determining the relationship between miR-29b-3p and vascular endothelial cell growth factor A (VEGFA). In addition, miR-29b-3p mimic transfected into the activated hepatic stellate cell T6 (HSC-T6). The Cell-Counting-Kit 8 (CCK8) and 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining were first utilized to detect the antiproliferative efficiency of XSSJS following the XSSJS compound serum intervention, and then used to observe the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), VEGFA, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) via RT-PCR, Western blot (WB), and Immunofluorescence (IF) methods. During the in vivo model, XSSJS with boil-free granules were fed to Wistar rats with liver fibrosis caused by intraperitoneal injection of pig serum followed by the transfection of miR-29b-3p adeno-associated virus (AAV). Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining was used for histopathology assessment. The expression of miR-29b-3p, VEGFA, PDGF, TGF-beta have been investigated in liver tissue using RT-PCR, WB, IF. The results verified that XSSJS could up-regulate miR-29b-3p and suppress the expression of VEGFA, PDGA, and TGF-beta. In mechanism, miR-29b-3p primarily targeted the 3'UTR of VEGFA. In conclusion, XSSJS could modulate miR-29b-3pNEGFA axis to inhibit the pathological angiogenesis of HF.

AB  - Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are the two most important phytohormones in plant immunity. While SA plays pivotal roles in local and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against biotrophic pathogens, JA, on the other hand, contributes to defense against necrotrophic pathogens, herbivores, and induced systemic resistance (ISR). Over the past 30 years, extensive research has elucidated the biosynthesis, metabolism, physiological functions, and signaling of both SA and JA. Here, we present an overview of signaling pathways of SA and JA and how they interact with each other to fine-tune plant defense responses.

AB  - Key message Genome-wide identification of the sea buckthorn GRAS genes and their transcription profiles in different organizations. GRAS proteins comprise a large family of transcription factors that experienced extensive replication, and play important roles in many aspects of growth regulatory and environmental signals. Sea buckthorn is a unique and valuable plant which has tremendous value for medical researching, ecological protection, and providing daily necessities. We identified, characterized, and distinguished duplication models of GRAS transcription factors in sea buckthorn. A systematic whole-genome analysis was performed to identify and characterize the GRAS gene family of sea buckthorn, especially the comparative genome method was used to demonstrate its different duplication models. We identified 62 sea buckthorn GRAS (HrGRAS) genes and renamed based on their respective chromosome distribution. Fifty-nine HrGRASs were classified into nine subgroups and three HrGRASs did not belong to any of the subfamilies according to their phylogenetic features. HrGRAS genes tend to have a representative GRAS domain, few introns, and unevenly distributed on chromosomes. Segmental duplication was the main driver of the GRAS gene family expansion, followed by whole-genome duplication (WGD) and tandem duplication, according to the results of comparative genome analysis. GRAS genes involved in duplication experienced strong purifying selection pressure according to the Ka/Ks ratios. The expression profile derived from transcriptome data shows the expression patterns of HrGRAS gene in different tissues and the characterization of differentially expressed genes. This systematic analysis provided a foundation to understand the expansion and potential functions of GRAS genes with an aim of sea buckthorn crop improvement.

AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is one of the most important zoonotic pathogens that threaten the lives of pigs and humans. Even worse, the increasingly severe antimicrobial resistance in S. suis is becoming a global issue. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel antibacterial alternatives for the treatment of S. suis infection. In this study, we investigated theaflavin (TF1), a benzoaphenone compound extracted from black tea, as a potential phytochemical compound against S. suis. TF1 at MIC showed significant inhibitory effects on S. suis growth, hemolytic activity, and biofilm formation, and caused damage to S. suis cells in vitro. TF1 had no cytotoxicity and decreased adherent activity of S. suis to the epithelial cell Nptr. Furthermore, TF1 not only improved the survival rate of S. suis-infected mice but also reduced the bacterial load and the production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. A hemolysis test revealed the direct interaction between TF1 and Sly, while molecular docking showed TF1 had a good binding activity with the Glu198, Lys190, Asp111, and Ser374 of Sly. Moreover, virulence-related genes were downregulated in the TF1-treated group. Collectively, our findings suggested that TF1 can be used as a potential inhibitor for treating S. suis infection in view of its antibacterial and antihemolytic activity.

AB  - The evolutionarily conserved Hippo (Hpo) pathway has been shown to impact early development and tumorigenesis by governing cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, its post-developmental roles are relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate its roles in post-mitotic cells by showing that defective Hpo signaling accelerates age-associated structural and functional decline of neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of wts-1/LATS, the core kinase of the Hpo pathway, resulted in premature deformation of touch neurons and impaired touch responses in a yap-1/YAP-dependent manner, the downstream transcriptional co-activator of LATS. Decreased movement as well as microtubule destabilization by treatment with colchicine or disruption of microtubule-stabilizing genes alleviated the neuronal deformation of wts-1 mutants. Colchicine exerted neuroprotective effects even during normal aging. In addition, the deficiency of a microtubule-severing enzyme spas-1 also led to precocious structural deformation. These results consistently suggest that hyper-stabilized microtubules in both wts-1-deficient neurons and normally aged neurons are detrimental to the maintenance of neuronal structural integrity. In summary, Hpo pathway governs the structural and functional maintenance of differentiated neurons by modulating microtubule stability, raising the possibility that the microtubule stability of fully developed neurons could be a promising target to delay neuronal aging. Our study provides potential therapeutic approaches to combat age- or disease-related neurodegeneration.

AB  - Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a common malignant tumor in the lung that seriously endangers the health of people worldwide. The neutrophil-associated inflammatory microenvironment contributes to the activation of tumor cells. In this study, we report a role of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) promote tumor progression of LUAD by crosstalk between neutrophils and tumor cells. Mechanistically, in co-culture with tumor cells, downregulation of TPM2 on tumor cells increases neutrophil elastase (ELANE) levels in neutrophils regulated by p38/ MAPK signaling activation, and ELANE promotes tumor cell progression through the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, downregulation of TPM2 activates ELANE of neutrophils to facilitate ERK1/2 activation, thus enhancing IL1 beta and IL8 secretion for chemoattraction of more neutrophils to tumor microenvironment. The new studies identify an accomplice role for the interaction between TPM2 and ELANE in promoting LUAD progression and provide potential strategies in the prevention and/or treatment of LUAD and other cancers.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), one of the common complications of sepsis, is associated with higher ICU mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and long-term cognitive decline. Sepsis can induce neuroinflammation, which negatively affects hippocampal neurogenesis. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to protect against SAE. However, the potential mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we added lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated astrocytes-conditioned media (LPS-CM) to neural stem cells (NSCs) culture, which were pretreated with dexmedetomidine in the presence or absence of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine or the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor antagonist BRL-44408. LPS-CM impaired the neurogenesis of NSCs, characterized by decreased proliferation, enhanced gliogenesis, and declined viability. Dexmedetomidine alleviated LPS-CM-induced impairment of neurogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Yohimbine, as well as BRL-44408, reversed the effects of dexmedetomidine. We established a mouse model of SAE via cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). CLP-induced astrocyte-related neuroinflammation and hippocampal neurogenesis deficits, accompanied by learning and memory decline, which were reversed by dexmedetomidine. The effect of dexmedetomidine was blocked by BRL-44408. Collectively, our findings support the conclusion that dexmedetomidine can protect against SAE, likely mediated by the combination of inhibiting neuroinflammation via the astrocytic alpha 2A-adrenoceptor with attenuating neuroinflammation-induced hippocampal neurogenesis deficits via NSCs alpha 2A-adrenoceptor.

AB  - The cystine/glutamate antiporter system x(c)(-) has been identified as the major source of extracellular glutamate in several brain regions as well as a modulator of neuroinflammation, and genetic deletion of its specific subunit xCT (xCT(-/-)) is protective in mouse models for age-related neurological disorders. However, the previously observed oxidative shift in the plasma cystine/cysteine ratio of adult xCT(-/-) mice led to the hypothesis that system x(c)(-) deletion would negatively affect life- and healthspan. Still, till now the role of system x(c)(-) in physiological aging remains unexplored. We therefore studied the effect of xCT deletion on the aging process of mice, with a particular focus on the immune system, hippocampal function, and cognitive aging. We observed that male xCT(-/-) mice have an extended lifespan, despite an even more increased plasma cystine/cysteine ratio in aged compared to adult mice. This oxidative shift does not negatively impact the general health status of the mice. On the contrary, the age-related priming of the innate immune system, that manifested as increased LPS-induced cytokine levels and hypothermia in xCT(+/+) mice, was attenuated in xCT(-/-) mice. While this was associated with only a very moderate shift towards a more anti-inflammatory state of the aged hippocampus, we observed changes in the hippocampal metabolome that were associated with a preserved hippocampal function and the retention of hippocampus-dependent memory in male aged xCT(-/-) mice. Targeting system x(c)(-) is thus not only a promising strategy to prevent cognitive decline, but also to promote healthy aging.

AB  - Simple Summary Ensuring good health and welfare is an increasingly important consideration for conservation of endangered species, whether free-ranging or managed to varying degrees under human care. The welfare-based design of a new habitat for Asian elephants focused on meeting the elephants' physical, physiological, psychological, and social needs 24 h a day and across life stages. In this study, multiple elephant health and welfare indicators measured throughout transition and acclimation from the previous habitat to this new habitat provided evidence that the complexity, flexibility, space, and resource distribution of the new habitat was effective in improving overall welfare. The elephants were more active and walked farther on a daily basis in the new habitat, with an average walking distance of over 15 km per day. Disbursement of food with less temporal and spatial predictability increased foraging opportunities, which is important for psychological well-being of this species. All individuals showed adaptive and normal adrenal responses to the changes and challenges throughout the construction period and subsequent acclimation to a novel environment. They demonstrated social dynamics of a healthy herd in both habitats with transitions of individuals through life stages; however, in the new habitat they exhibited more autonomy in choosing whom to associate with socially, suggesting increased social equity for individuals. Ensuring good health and welfare is an increasingly important consideration for conservation of endangered species, whether free-ranging or managed to varying degrees under human care. The welfare-based design of a new habitat for Asian elephants at the Oregon Zoo focused on meeting the elephants' physical, physiological, psychological, and social needs 24 h a day and across life stages. The habitat was designed to encourage activity, promote species-typical behaviors, support changing social dynamics, offer increased opportunities for choice, and provide biologically meaningful challenges. In this 4-year study, we monitored elephant health and welfare indicators throughout the transition and acclimation from the previous habitat to the new habitat. Several welfare indicators obtained through longitudinal hormone analyses, behavior assessments, and GPS measurement of walking distance and space use provided evidence that these goals were achieved. The elephants were more active and walked farther on a daily basis in the new habitat, with an average walking distance of over 15 km per day. A switch from primarily caretaker-delivered food to seeking food on their own indicates that the disbursement of food with less temporal and spatial predictability increased foraging opportunities, which better satisfies appetitive motivations important for psychological well-being. All individuals showed adaptive and normal adrenal responses to change and challenge, with the highest fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations and variability during the construction phase, and a return to previous baseline concentrations in the new habitat, suggesting they acclimated well to the new environment. The elephants expressed a diverse range of species-typical behaviors and demonstrated social dynamics of a healthy herd in both habitats with transitions of individuals through life stages. They exhibited more autonomy in choosing whom to associate with socially and also by choosing different aspects of their environment with regular indoor/outdoor access and extensive resource use in the new habitat.
   Findings indicate that the complexity and flexibility of the new habitat and habitat management has been effective in improving overall welfare by providing meaningful challenges and the opportunity to express appetitive behaviors, by offering choice in environmental conditions, and by providing the space and resource distribution to support evolving herd dynamics and increased social equity for individuals.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation is an effective strategy for distributing spermatozoa for artificial insemination, but this process reduces the fertility potential of post-thawed spermatozoa. The current study was conducted to assess effects of the novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant "Mito-TEMPO" on ram sperm quality and fertility potential during the freeze-thawing process in a plant-based extender. Semen samples were diluted in extenders supplemented with 0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 mu M Mito-TEMPO and then frozen using a standard protocol. Motility, abnormal morphology, acrosome integrity, membrane integrity, mitochondria membrane potential, viability, apoptotic-like changes, lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, H2O2 concentration and fertility potential were assessed after thawing. Results indicated that with the 5 and 50 mu M Mito-TEMPO there was a greater (P <= 0.05) percentage of sperm total motility, progressive motility, acrosome integrity and viability as well as less (P <= 0.05) lipid peroxidation and late apoptotic-like changes. Membrane integrity and mitochondria membrane potential were greater (P <= 0.05) with the 50 mu M Mito-TEMPO extender supplementation. Furthermore, with 0.5, 5 and 50 mu M Mito-TEMPO supplementations there was a greater (P <= 0.05) average path velocity and lesser (P <= 0.05) percentages of spermatozoa with DNA fragmentation and relatively greater H2O2 concentration. Results from the fertility experiment indicated the 5 and 50 mu M Mito-TEMPO treatments resulted in greater pregnancy, parturition and lambing rates. It, therefore, is concluded that Mito-TEMPO may enhance quality and fertility potential of post-thawed semen of rams.

AB  - Brain-inspired bionic navigation is a groundbreaking technological approach that emulates the biological navigation systems found in mammalian brains. This innovative method leverages experiences within cognitive space to plan global paths to targets, showcasing remarkable autonomy and adaptability to various environments. This work introduces a novel bionic, goal-oriented path planning approach for mobile robots. First, an experience map is constructed using NeuroSLAM, a bio-inspired simultaneous localization and mapping method. Based on this experience map, a successor representation model is then developed through reinforcement learning, and a goal-oriented predictive map is formulated to address long-term reward estimation challenges. By integrating goal-oriented rewards, the proposed algorithm efficiently plans optimal global paths in complex environments for mobile robots. Our experimental validation demonstrates the method's effectiveness in experience sequence prediction and goal-oriented global path planning. The comparative results highlight its superior performance over traditional Dijkstra's algorithm, particularly in terms of adaptability to environmental changes and computational efficiency in optimal global path generation.

AB  - YAP1 functions in lineage differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs); however, the detailed mechanisms underlying the regulation of YAP1 activity during ESC differentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that hCINAP serves as a negative regulator of YAP1 during ESC fate decisions. The expression of mCI-NAP, the murine homolog of hCINAP, is downregulated during the differentiation process of murine ESC (mESC) ectoderm lineage, leading to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of NEDD4 and activation of YAP1. Mechanistically, hCINAP interacts with and prevents NEDD4 from forming cytoplasmic condensates that compartmentalize YAP1 and its kinase NLK, facilitating YAP1 phosphorylation at Ser128 and promoting YAP1 activation. mCINAP depletion leads to the formation of NEDD4 condensates and YAP1 activation, which impedes endoderm differentiation of mESCs. Our study shows that hCINAP is a vital regulator of YAP1 activity and is essential for stem cell fate decisions, which provides mechanistic insight into early embryogenesis.

AB  - Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) enzymes has been investigated as therapeutic strategy to treat memory problems in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although PDE4D inhibitors are effective in enhancing memory processes in rodents and humans, severe side effects may hamper their clinical use. PDE4D enzymes comprise different isoforms, which, when targeted specifically, can increase treatment efficacy and safety. The function of PDE4D isoforms in AD and in molecular memory processes per se has remained unresolved. Here, we report the upregulation of specific PDE4D isoforms in transgenic AD mice and hippocampal neurons exposed to amyloid-beta. Furthermore, by means of pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown, we show that the long-form PDE4D3, -D5, -D7, and -D9 isoforms regulate neuronal plasticity and convey resilience against amyloid-beta in vitro. These results indicate that isoform-specific, next to non-selective, PDE4D inhibition is efficient in promoting neuroplasticity in an AD context. Therapeutic effects of non-selective PDE4D inhibitors are likely achieved through actions on long isoforms. Future research should identify which long PDE4D isoforms should be specifically targeted in vivo to both improve treatment efficacy and reduce side effects.

AB  - The influence of extracellular and intracellular calcium on smooth muscle contractile activity varies between organs. In response to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) stimulation, the urinary bladder detrusor muscle has shown a 70% dependence on extrac-ellular calcium, whereas the urothelium and lamina propria (U&LP) has a 20%-50% dependence. However, as this only accounts for partial contractile activity, the contribution of intracellular calcium and calcium sensitization pathways remains unclear. This study assessed the role of intracellular signaling pathways on GPCR-mediated urinary bladder U&LP contraction. Porcine U&LP responses to activation of the Gq/11-coupled muscarinic, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), neurokinin, prostaglandin, and angiotensin II receptors were assessed with three selective inhibitors of store-released intracellular calcium, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), and ruthenium red, and three Rho kinase inhibitors, fasudil, Y-27632, and GSK269962. There was no discernible impact on receptor agonist-induced contractions of the U&LP after blocking intracellular calcium pathways, suggesting that this tissue is more sensitive to alterations in the availability of extracellular calcium. However, an alternative mechanism of action for GPCR-mediated contraction was identified to be the activation of Rho kinase, such as when Y-27632 significantly reduced the GPCR-mediated contractile activity of the U&LP by approximately 50% (P < 0.05, n = 8). This suggests that contractile responses of the bladder U&LP do not involve a significant release of calcium from intracellular stores, but that Gq/11-coupled receptor activation causes calcium sensitization via Rho kinase. This study highlights a key role for Rho kinase in the urinary bladder, which may provide a novel target in the future pharmaceutical management of bladder con-tractile disorders.

This context-specific modulation of facial expression is thought to engage the amyg-dala, hippocampus, and orbitofrontal cortex; however, the underlying neural computations remain unknown. Here we use human intracranial electroencephalograms (EEGs) directly recorded from these regions and report bidirectional theta-gamma interactions within the amygdala-hippocampal network, facilitating contextual processing. Contextual information is subsequently represented in the orbitofrontal cortex, where a theta phase shift binds context and face associations within theta cycles, endowing faces with contextual meanings at behavioral timescales. Our results identify theta phase shifts as mediating associations between context and face processing, supporting flexible social behavior.

AB  - RAC3 encodes a small GTPase of the Rho family that plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and intracellular signaling regulation. Pathogenic variants in RAC3, all of which reported thus far affect conserved residues within its functional domains, have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by diverse phenotypic features, including structural brain anomalies and facial dysmorphism (NEDBAF). Recently, a novel de novo RAC3 variant (NM_005052.3): c.196C>T, p.R66W was identified in a prenatal case with fetal akinesia deformation sequence (a spectrum of conditions that interfere with the fetus's ability to move), and complex brain malformations featuring corpus callosum agenesis, diencephalosynapsis, kinked brainstem, and vermian hypoplasia. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the association between RAC3 deficiency and this unique, distinct clinical phenotype, we explored the pathophysiological significance of the p.R66W variant in brain development. Biochemical assays revealed a modest enhancement in intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange activity and an inhibitory effect on GTP hydrolysis. Transient expression studies in COS7 cells demonstrated that RAC3-R66W interacts with the downstream effectors PAK1, MLK2, and N-WASP but fails to activate SRF-, AP1-, and NFkB-mediated transcription. Additionally, overexpression of RAC3-R66W significantly impaired differentiation in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Acute expression of RAC3-R66W in vivo by in utero electroporation resulted in impairments in cortical neuron migration and axonal elongation during corticogenesis. Collectively, these findings suggest that the p.R66W variant may function as an activated version in specific signaling pathways, leading to a distinctive and severe prenatal phenotype through variant-specific mechanisms.

AB  - Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most prevalent diseases seriously affecting the well-being and quality of life. To address this condition, a novel intelligent liposome nanoparticle (BHL@IR780@LNP) was constructed by coloading the photosensitizer IR780 and a nitric oxide donor (l-arginine-loaded biguanide chitosan-hyaluronic acid composite nanoparticles, BHL) onto liposome nanoparticles composed of cholesterol and soybean phospholipids. Under irradiation with an 808 nm near-infrared laser, BHL@IR780@LNP was able to generate heat and reactive oxygen species, resulting in the precise release of nitric oxide, which effectively killed 97.5% of Escherichia coli and 99.2% of Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Furthermore, in vivo findings demonstrated that BHL@IR780@LNP+L could effectively eliminate 99.5% of S. aureus at the nasal mucous membrane and significantly reduce inflammatory markers. Overall, this study demonstrates a highly effective antibacterial nanoformulation (BHL@IR780@LNP+L) that innovatively integrates the synergistic effects of heat, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide to combat acute rhinosinusitis.

AB  - Liver fibrosis is a chronic pathological process in which the abnormal proliferation of connective tissue is induced by various pathogenic factors. During the process of fibrosis, excessive angiogenesis is observed. Physiological angiogenesis has the potential to impede the progression of liver fibrosis through augmenting matrix metalloenzyme activity; however, pathological angiogenesis can exacerbate liver fibrosis by promoting collagen accumulation. Therefore, a key scientific research focus in the treatment of liver diseases is to search for the "onoff" mechanism that regulates angiogenesis from normal proliferation to pathological proliferation. In this study, we found that excessive angiogenesis appeared during the initial phase of hepatic fibrosis without mesenchymal characteristics. In addition, angiogenesis accompanied by significant endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was observed in mice after the intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II (Ang II). Interestingly, the changes in Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity in endothelial cells (ECs) can affect the regulation of angiogenesis by Ang II. The results of in vitro experiments revealed that the regulatory influence of Ang II on ECs was significantly attenuated upon suppression of YAP activity. Furthermore, the function of Ang II in regulating angiogenesis during fibrosis was investigated in liver-specific transgenic mice. The results revealed that Ang II gene deletion could restrain liver fibrosis and EndMT. Meanwhile, Ang II deletion downregulated the profibrotic YAP signaling pathway in ECs. The small molecule AT1R agonist olmesartan targeting Ang II-YAP signaling could also alleviate liver fibrosis. In conclusion, this study identified Ang II as a pivotal regulator of EndMT during the progression of liver fibrosis and evaluated the therapeutic effect of the Ang II-targeted drug olmesartan on liver fibrosis.

AB  - Mitochondrial malfunction and morphologic disorganization have been observed in brain cells as part of complex pathological changes. However, it is unclear what may be the role of mitochondria in the initiation of pathologic processes or if mitochondrial disorders are consequences of earlier events. We analyzed the morphologic reorganization of organelles in an embryonic mouse brain during acute anoxia using an immunohistochemical identification of the disordered mitochondria, followed by electron microscopic three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. We found swelling of the mitochondrial matrix after 3 h anoxia and probable dissociation of mitochondrial stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP2)-containing complexes after 4.5 h anoxia in the neocortex, hippocampus, and lateral ganglionic eminence. Surprisingly, deformation of the Golgi apparatus (GA) was detected already after 1 h of anoxia, when the mitochondria and other organelles still had a normal ultrastructure. The disordered GA showed concentrical swirling of the cisternae and formed spherical onion-like structures with the trans-cisterna in the center of the sphere. Such disturbance of the Golgi architecture likely interferes with its function for post-translational protein modification and secretory trafficking. Thus, the GA in embryonic mouse brain cells may be more vulnerable to anoxic conditions than the other organelles, including mitochondria.

AB  - Background: While the Bushen Yizhi Formula can treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), the yet to be ascertained specific mechanism of action was explored in this work. Methods: Different concentrations of the Bushen Yizhi Formula and amyloid-beta peptide (A(3) were used to treat rat pheochromocytoma cells (P12) and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Cell morphological changes were observed to determine the in vitro cell damage. Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay and flow cytometry were employed to identify cell viability and apoptosis/cell cycle, respectively. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were employed to measure the expressions of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins (GRP78 and CHOP), p-IRE1a, IRE1a, ASK1, p-JNK, JNK, Bax, Bcl-2, XBP-1, and Bim. Fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) was used to determine the intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration. Also, an AD model was constructed by injecting A(3 into the CA1 area of the hippocampus in Sprague Dawley rats. AD model rats were gavaged with different concentrations of Bushen Yizhi Formula for 14 consecutive days. The Morris water maze experiment was conducted to test the learning and memory of rats. Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining were done to determine histopathological changes in the brain. Results: Bushen Yizhi Formula relieved the A(3-induced effects including cell injury, decreased viability, increased apoptosis, G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, up-regulation of GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1a, p-JNK, Bax, XBP-1 and Bim, as well as down-regulation of Bcl-2. These results were also seen with IRE1a silencing. While A(3 suppressed the learning and memory abilities of rats, the Bushen Yizhi Formula alleviated these effects of A(3. Brain nerve cell injury induced by A(3 could also be treated with Bushen Yizhi Formula. Conclusion: Bushen Yizhi Formula could influence ERS through the IRE1a signaling pathway to achieve its therapeutic effects on AD.

AB  - The growth of leaves and biosynthesis of characteristic secondary metabolites are critically important for tea production and quality control. However, little is known about the coordinated regulation of leaf development and catechin biosynthesis in tea plants. Here, we reported that TCP TFs are involved in both catechin biosynthesis and leaf development. An integrated analysis of catechin profiling and CsTCP expression in different tissues of plants under various environmental conditions at different developmental stages indicated significant correlations between the transcript levels of CIN-type TCPs and catechin production. CIN-type CsTCP3 and CsTCP4 and PCF-type CsTCP14 interacted with the MYB-bHLH-WD40 repeat (MBW) complex by forming a CsTCP3-CsTT8 heterodimer and modulating the transactivation activity of the promoters of anthocyanin synthase (CsANS1) and anthocyanidin reductase (CsANR1). Four types of microRNA/target modules, miR319b/CsTCP3-4, miR164b/CsCUC, miR396/CsGRF-GIF, and miR165b/HD-ZIPIII ones, were also identified and characterized for their functions in the regulation of the development of tea plant shoot tips and leaf shape. The results of these modules were reflected by their different expression patterns in developing buds and leaves that had distinctly different morphologies in three different tea plant varieties. Their roles in the regulation of catechin biosynthesis were also further verified by manipulation of microRNA319b (miR319b), which targets the transcripts of CsTCP3 and CsTCP4. Thus, CsTCPs represent at least one of these important groups of TFs that can integrate tea plant leaf development together with secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Our study provides new insight into shoot tip development and catechin production in tea plants and lays a foundation for further mechanistic understanding of the regulation of tea plant leaf development and secondary metabolism.

AB  - The impact of testosterone levels on changes in brain structure has been reported. However, it is still unclear which specific brain region could be affected. This study approached Mendelian randomization method to reveal the causal relationship between testosterone levels and the rate of longitudinal structural changes in the brain. The testosterone-related GWAS data were determined from 425,097 European participants. The GWAS data on the rate of longitudinal structural changes in the brain came from the ENIGMA consortium, which included 15,640 all-age participants from 40 longitudinal cohorts. The inverse variance weighted was considered as the main estimate, MR Egger and weighted median methods were used to supplement IVW. A positive correlation was found between total testosterone levels and bioavailable testosterone levels in women and age-independent longitudinal changes in cerebral WM and surface area. The sex hormone-binding globulin levels were found a negative correlation with age-dependent longitudinal structural changes of cortical GM in men. Additionally, we also found that the bioavailable testosterone level in males was negatively associated with the quadratic agedependent longitudinal change rate in the globus pallidum. We also found estradiol levels and sex hormonebinding globulin levels were negatively associated with the quadratic age-dependent longitudinal change rate of total brain in men. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between total testosterone levels and linear agedependent longitudinal changes in the hippocampus in both males and females. The testosterone levels in different genders may have varying degrees of causal effects on the structural changes of brain regions. These findings provide evidence for the influence of the brain glandular axis on brain structure, particularly during female brain development.

AB  - Tea is identified as the second most consumed drink in the world, and its frequent intake is related to several benefits to human health, considering its antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antihistamine, diuretic, calming, and above all, antioxidant effects. These effects are often associated with the action of the phenolic compounds contained in these infusions. In Brazil, among the most consumed infusions are the teas of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus (D.C.) Stapf), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), anise (Pimpinella anisum L.), yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil), peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), and green/black tea (Camellia sinensis L.). Therefore, said popularity is the reason why the mentioned species were chosen to be evaluated on inflammatory enzymes. The activity of phospholipases A2 was reduced by more than 25% after treatment with black tea and yerba mate. The most significant inhibition of protease activity was observed after incubation with black tea (40.74%), green tea (31.48%) and yerba mate (25.93%). Infusions of black and green tea reduced hemolysis in semisolid and liquid media, and for the latter, reductions of up to 50% of hemolytic activity were observed, indicating an anti-inflammatory potential of the samples. Plasma incubations with green tea, black tea and lemon balm and subsequent addition of venom (1:10 ratio; tea:PBS, v:v) prolonged the coagulation time of citrated plasma by approximately twice compared to the positive control. All controls with pure tea had a thrombolytic character, in higher proportions than the venom control, especially chamomile (273.55% dissolution). Phenolic compounds derived from phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins are identified as the main agents that promote the biological effects observed in this study. This is mainly due to their anti-catalytic properties exerted on inflammatory enzymes and as chelating agents of enzymatic co-factors. The evaluated teas showed potential for nutraceutical use, thus pointing to the possibility of use as an adjuvant in the treatment of diseases linked to hemostasis.

AB  - The synaptic removal of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) is a core mechanism for hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). In this study, we address the role of microtubule-dependent transport of AMPARs as a driver for vesicular trafficking and sorting during LTD. Here, we show that the kinesin-1 motor KIF5A/C is strictly required for LTD expression in CA3-to-CA1 hippocampal synapses. Specifically, we find that KIF5 is required for an efficient internalization of AMPARs after NMDA receptor activation. We show that the KIF5/AMPAR complex is assembled in an activity-dependent manner and associates with microsomal membranes upon LTD induction. This interaction is facilitated by the vesicular adaptor protrudin, which is also required for LTD expression. We propose that protrudin links KIF5-dependent transport to endosomal sorting, preventing AMPAR recycling to synapses after LTD induction. Therefore, this work identifies an activity-dependent molecular motor and the vesicular adaptor protein that executes AMPAR synaptic removal during LTD.

AB  - S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe), a methyl donor, induces antidepressant effects in preclinical and clinical studies of depression. However, the mechanisms behind these effects have been poorly investigated. Since SAMe is involved in monoamine metabolism, this work aimed at 1) testing the effects induced by systemic treatment with SAMe in mice submitted to the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST); 2) investigating the involvement of serotonergic neurotransmission in the behavioral effects induced by SAMe. To do that, male Swiss mice received systemic injections (1 injection/day, 1 or 7 days) of imipramine (30 mg/kg), L-methionine (400, 800, 1600, and 3200 mg/kg), SAMe (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg), or vehicle (10 ml/kg) and were submitted to the FST or TST, 30 min after the last injection. The effect of SAMe (50 mg/kg) was further investigated in independent groups of male Swiss mice pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, serotonin synthesis inhibitor, 150 mg/kg daily, 4 days) or with WAY100635 (5-HT1A receptor antagonist, 0.1 mg/kg, 1 injection). One independent group was submitted to the FST and euthanized immediately after for collection of brain samples for neurochemical analyses. Serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) levels were measured in the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, to investigate if the treatments used could induce any significant exploratory/motor effect which would interfere with the FST results, the animals were also submitted to the open field test (OFT). The administration of imipramine (30 mg/kg), L-methionine (400, 800, 1600, and 3200 mg/kg), and SAMe (10 and 50 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time in the FST, an effect blocked by pretreatment with PCPA and WAY100635. None of the treatments increased the locomotion in the OFT. In conclusion, our results suggest that the antidepressant-like effects induced by SAMe treatment are dependent on serotonin synthesis and 5-HT1A receptor activation.

AB  - To understand the defense mechanisms of spinach against insect attack at the molecular level, RNA-seq was used to compare the transcriptome of spinach leaves exposed to beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua Hubner) larvae with that of unexposed control leaves. In total, 37,256 unigenes with an average length of 1134 bp were produced after de novo assembly of clean reads from two libraries. Based on mapping of the reads generated from each library to the unigenes, 1412 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the insect-fed spinach leaves, including 1252 and 160 genes that were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. A MapMan analysis of the DEGs revealed that 206 genes were associated with abiotic (14 genes) and biotic (192 genes) stress responses. Based on these results, 107 and 7 DEGs with log(2) fold changes >= 5 and 10, respectively, were identified. Notably, six of the seven highly over-expressed DEGs (WAK2-1, CAM3, CAM5-1, CAM6-1, CAM6-2 and CPK17-1) were associated with calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling. Moreover, these genes were highly co-over-expressed with several ECA (endoplasmic reticulum-type calcium-transporting-ATPase) genes known to be involved in Ca2+ transport, indicating that the Ca2+ signaling cascade plays an important role in the defense of spinach against insect attack.

AB  - Gray blight is a serious foliar disease that significantly threatens tea plant cultivation. Although dynamic histone methylation was reported in regulating plant immunity, the specific roles of this epigenetic modification in tea plant disease resistance have yet to be fully elucidated. This study demonstrates that the protein arginine methyltransferase CsPRMT5, which catalyzes the symmetric dimethylation of histone H4R3 (H4R3sme2), is involved in the tea plant response to gray blight. Transcription of CsPRMT5 and the level of histone H4R3 methylation in tea were downregulated following infection by the fungal pathogen Pseudopestalotiopsis (Ps). A negative correlation was observed between the resistance of tea plants to Ps and the expression level of CsPRMT5 across various cultivars. Downregulation of CsPRMT5 expression led to reduced H4R3sme2 levels, elevated expression of defense-related genes, and lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after Ps infection, thus enhancing pathogen resistance of tea. Furthermore, complementation of Atprmt5 mutant with CsPRMT5 restored the susceptibility to Ps infection in Arabidopsis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq)and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analyses revealed that CsPRMT5 binds to defense-related genes, including CsMAPK3, and regulates their expression through H4R3sme2 modification. Collectively, the results indicate that CsPRMT5 negatively regulates the immune response to pathogens through repressing CsMAPK3 expression in tea plants.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a well-known beverage crop rich in polyphenols with health benefits for humans. Understanding how tea polyphenols participate in plant resistance is beneficial to breeding resistant varieties and uncovering the resistance mechanisms. Here, we report that a Colletotrichum infection-induced 'pink ring' symptom appeared outside the lesion, which is highly likely to occur in resistant cultivars. By identifying morphological feature-specific metabolites in the pink ring and their association with disease resistance, and analysis of the association between metabolite and gene expression, the study revealed that the accumulation of anthocyanin-3-O-galactosides, red phytotoxin compounds resistant to anthracnose, plays a pivotal role in the hypersensitive response surrounding infection sites in tea plants. The results of genetic manipulation showed that the expression of CsF3Ha, CsANSa, CsUGT78A15, CsUGT75L43, and CsMYB113, which are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, is positively correlated with anthracnose-resistance and the formation of the pink ring. Further phosphorus quantification and fertilization experiments confirmed that phosphate deficiency caused by anthracnose is involved in the occurrence of the pink ring. Genetic manipulation studies indicated that altering the expression levels of Pi transporter proteins (CsPHT2-1, CsPHT4;4) and phosphate deprivation response transcription factors (CsWRKY75-1, CsWRKY75-2, CsMYB62-1) enhances resistance to anthracnose and the formation of the pink ring symptom in tea plants. This article provides the first evidence that anthocyanin-3-O-galactosides are the anthracnose-resistant phytoalexins among various polyphenols in tea plants, and this presents an approach for identifying resistance genes in tea plants, where genetic transformation is challenging.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevancy: Chaihushugan san (CSS), a classic formula for soothing the liver and relieving depression, has been identified to produce rapid antidepressant-like effects in female mice. However, the gender predominance and underlying mechanisms of CSS's antidepressant remain unclear. Aim of the study: In this study, we focused on unraveling the gender predominance of CSS in antidepressant and the specific neuronal mechanisms that mediate this predominance. Methods and materials: Tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT) were used to evaluate depressive phenotypes or antidepressant-like effects of CSS in female and male chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice model. RNA-sequencing was used to screen specific target for CSS antidepressant gender dominance. RT-PCR and elisa were used to detect the expressions of specific molecule, hormones, and inflammatory factors in the hippocampus. hippocampal viral overactivation and pharmacological blockade were used to detect the correlation between CSS antidepressant gender dominance and related targets. Results: In the present study, both female and male mice displayed depressive phenotypes including significant increasing immobility time in TST and reducing sucrose preference ratio in SPT after exposing CUMS for 3 weeks. However, acute administration of CSS (2,4 g/kg) improved the depressive phenotypes only in female mice or not male mice at 2 h later. Moreover, the expressions of TC2N were increased only in female mice after exposing CUMS for 3 weeks, which were also reversed by CSS after a single administration 2 h later, but no alterations in male mice. The hippocampal expressions of estrogen receptor (3 (Er(3), pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1(3 and TNF alpha) and anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, TGF-(3 and IL-1R alpha) were all abnormal in female CUMS mice model, which were all normalized by CSS. Furthermore, overactivation of hippocampal TC2N by AAV-TC2N+/+ blocked the antidepressant-like effects of CSS and the up-regulation of hippocampal Er(3 in female mice. However, inhibition of Er(3 blunted the antidepressant-like effects of CSS and CSS's suppression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1(3 and TNF-alpha), which had no any effect on hippocampal TC2N and anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF(3). Conclusions: The study revealed that CSS had antidepressant superiority in female mice depending on inhibiting hippocampal TC2N and then activating Er(3, further inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory factors to produce antidepressant effects, which provided a basis for the guidance of CSS in clinical application, new ideas and targets for the development of drugs for depression with gender differences.

AB  - Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is primarily regulated by rapid Ca2+ influx through membrane-resident voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is extensively present in axonal terminals of neurons and plays a modulatory role in synaptic transmission by regulating Ca2+ levels. Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is marked by enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER and downregulation of Ca2+ buffering proteins. However, the precise consequence of impaired Ca2+ signaling within the vicinity of VGCCs (active zone (AZ)) on exocytosis is poorly understood. Here, we perform in silico experiments of intracellular Ca2+ signaling and exocytosis in a detailed biophysical model of hippocampal synapses to investigate the effect of aberrant Ca2+ signaling on neurotransmitter release in FAD. Our model predicts that enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER increases the probability of neurotransmitter release in FAD. Moreover, over very short timescales (30 similar to-60 ms), the model exhibits activity-dependent and enhanced short-term plasticity in FAD, indicating neuronal hyperactivity-a hallmark of the disease. Similar to previous observations in AD animal models, our model reveals that during prolonged stimulation (similar to 450 ms), pathological Ca2+ signaling increases depression and desynchronization with stimulus, causing affected synapses to operate unreliably. Overall, our work provides direct evidence in support of a crucial role played by altered Ca2+ homeostasis mediated by intracellular stores in FAD.

AB  - Context Fibraurea recisa Pierre. (Menispermaceae) (FR) is a traditional Chinese medicine known as "Huangteng." The total alkaloids of FR (AFR) are the main active ingredients. However, the pharmacological effects of AFR in the treatment of depression have not been reported. Objectives This study investigates the antidepressant effects of AFR by network pharmacology and verification experiments. Materials and methods Compound-Target-Pathway (C-P-T) network of FR and depression was constructed through network pharmacology. In vitro, HT-22 cells were treated with corticosterone (CORT) solution (0.35 mg/mL), then AFR (0.05 mg/mL) solution and inhibitor AZD6244 (14 mu M/mL) or BAY11-7082 (10 mu M/mL) were added, respectively. The cell viability was detected by CCK-8. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were divided into 5 groups, namely the normal group, the CUMS group, the AFR (400 mg/kg) group, and the 2 groups that were simultaneously administered the inhibitory group AZD6244 (8 mg/kg) and BAY11-7082 (5 mg/kg). Western blotting was used to assess the expression level of the proteins. Results AFR could protect HT-22 cells from CORT-induced damage and increase the cell viability from 49.12 +/- 3.4% to 87.26 +/- 1.5%. Moreover, AFR significantly increased the levels of BDNF (1.3, 1.4-fold), p-ERK (1.4, 1.2-fold) and p-CERB (1.6, 1.3-fold), and decreased the levels of NLRP3 (11.3%, 31.6%), ASC (19.2%, 34.2%) and caspase-1 (18.0%, 27.6%) in HT-22 cells and the hippocampus, respectively. Discussion and conclusions AFR can improve depressive-like behaviours and can develop drugs for depression treatment. Further studies are needed to validate its potential in clinical medicine.

AB  - Cell fate decisions in preimplantation embryos require the coordinated expression of pluripotency and lineage-specific transcription factors. SOX2 represents the first pluripotency regulator for which expression is restricted to the inside cells of mouse preimplantation embryos. However, the genetic mechanisms that activate the expression of zygotic Sox2 are poorly understood. Here, we report that Sox2 expression in mouse embryos is controlled by the actions of key cis-regulatory elements, including a proximal promoter and super enhancer. We show that TFAP2C, a key trophoblast lineage regulator, binds to the Sox2 proximal promoter to activate its expression. Lastly, we provide evidence that TFAP2C and the HIPPO signaling pathway cooperatively regulate Sox2 expression. In summary, this work has important implications for understanding how conventional trophoblast transcription factors, such as TFAP2C, contribute to the activation of early pluripotency genes to facilitate divergent cellular states that support lineage formation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral impairments in the elderly. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a crucial role in modulating the pathological processes associated with AD. Jiajian Shuyu Pills (JJSYP) are frequently employed in the treatment of AD, purportedly by enhancing the physiological functions of human tissues and organs to modulate the immune response. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms by which JJSYP exert their therapeutic effects in the context of AD remain inadequately elucidated. Aim of the study: This study aimed to assess the effects of JJSYP on cognitive enhancement and the alleviation of neuroinflammation in the treatment of AD, as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms using mouse models. Materials and methods: The components of JJSYP in serum were analyzed using HPLC-Q/TOF-MS. APP/PS1 transgenic mice served as AD models in this investigation. Cognitive function in the AD mice was assessed through the Mirror Water Maze Test and the Novel Object Recognition Test. The quantification of apoptotic hippocampal cells was conducted using Nissl staining and TUNEL staining. Immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot (WB) analyses were employed to examine microglial activation and the expression of relevant proteins. Transcriptomic sequencing analysis and network pharmacology were administrated to explore the potential mechanisms of JJSYP in AD treatment. Inflammatory cytokine levels in the brain were measured using RT-PCR. Results: A total of 74 absorbed prototype components from JJSYP were identified. JJSYP effectively improved cognitive function and neuroapoptosis in AD model mice by modulating the activation of microglia. The JJSYP intervention alleviated neuroinflammation by suppressing microglial activation and reducing the accumulation of amyloid beta-protein. Through transcriptome sequencing and WB verification, 34 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including ACKR3, NR1H3 and Adra1a. Following treatment with a high dose of JJSYP, both ACKR3 and NR1H3 showed a significant decrease compared to the model group. Conversely, ADRA1A expression was reduced in model group compared to the control group, but increased following high dose JJSYP treatment. Research involving RNA sequencing and network pharmacology indicated that JJSYP altered the activation of CXCL12/ACKR3 signaling pathways in the hippocampus. Conclusions: JJSYP exhibits potential anti-Alzheimer's Disease effects and warrants further investigation and development as a prosper treatment for AD.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms that trigger Tau aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain elusive. Fungi, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), can be found in brain samples from patients with AD. Here, we show that the yeast protein Ure2p from S. cerevisiae interacts with Tau and facilitates its aggregation. The Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils are more potent in seeding Tau and causing neurotoxicity in vitro. When injected into the hippocampus of Tau P301S transgenic mice, the Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils show enhanced seeding activity compared with pure Tau fibrils. Strikingly, intracranial injection of Ure2p fibrils promotes the aggregation of Tau and cognitive impairment in Tau P301S mice. Furthermore, intranasal infection of S. cerevisiae in the nasal cavity of Tau P301S mice accelerates the aggregation of Tau. Together, these observations indicate that the yeast protein Ure2p initiates Tau pathology. Our results provide a conceptual advance that non-mammalian prions may cross-seed mammalian prion-like proteins.

AB  - In response to preharvest priming with exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA), tea plants adjust their physiological behavior at the molecular level. The whole-organism reconfiguration of aroma formation from the precursor to storage is poorly understood. In this study, we performed iTRAQ proteomic analysis and identified 337, 246, and 413 differentially expressed proteins in tea leaves primed with MeJA for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 266 nonvolatile and 100 volatile differential metabolites were identified by utilizing MS-based metabolomics. A novel approach that incorporated the integration of extended self-organizing map-based dimensionality was applied. The vivid time-scale changes tracing physiological responses in MeJA-primed tea leaves are marked in these maps. Jasmonates responded quickly to the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway in tea leaves, while hydroxyl and glycosyl jasmonates were biosynthesized simultaneously on a massive scale to compensate for the exhausted defense. The levels of alpha-linolenic acid, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and phenylalanine, which are crucial aroma precursors, were found to be significantly changed in MeJA-primed tea leaves. Green leaf volatiles, volatile terpenoids, and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were spontaneously biosynthesized from responding precursors and subsequently converted to their corresponding glycosidic forms, which can be stably stored in tea leaves. This study elucidated the physiological response of tea leaves primed with exogenous methyl jasmonate and revealed the molecular basis of source and sink changes on tea aroma biosynthesis and catabolism in response to exogenous stimuli. The results significantly enhance our comprehensive understanding of tea plant responses to exogenous treatment and will lead to the development of promising biotechnologies to improve fresh tea leaf quality.

AB  - Geraniol is an important contributor to the pleasant floral scent of tea products and one of the most abundant aroma compounds in tea plants; however, its biosynthesis and physiological function in response to stress in tea plants remain unclear. The proteins encoded by the full-length terpene synthase (CsTPS1) and its alternative splicing isoform (CsTPS1-AS) could catalyze the formation of geraniol when GPP was used as a substrate in vitro, whereas the expression of CsTPS1-AS was only significantly induced by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Neopestalotiopsis sp. infection. Silencing of CsTPS1 and CsTPS1-AS resulted in a significant decrease of geraniol content in tea plants. The geraniol content and disease resistance of tea plants were compared when CsTPS1 and CsTPS1-AS were silenced. Down-regulation of the expression of CsTPS1-AS reduced the accumulation of geraniol, and the silenced tea plants exhibited greater susceptibility to pathogen infection than control plants. However, there was no significant difference observed in the geraniol content and pathogen resistance between CsTPS1-silenced plants and control plants in the tea plants infected with two pathogens. Further analysis showed that silencing of CsTPS1-AS led to a decrease in the expression of the defense-related genes PR1 and PR2 and SA pathway-related genes in tea plants, which increased the susceptibility of tea plants to pathogens infections. Both in vitro and in vivo results indicated that CsTPS1 is involved in the regulation of geraniol formation and plant defense via alternative splicing in tea plants. The results of this study provide new insights into geraniol biosynthesis and highlight the role of monoterpene synthases in modulating plant disease resistance via alternative splicing.

AB  - Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-mediated cognitive impairment is a serious problem worldwide. However, given its complexity, the underlying mechanisms by which CCH induces cognitive dysfunction remain unclear, resulting in a lack of effective treatments. In this study, we aimed to determine whether changes in the expression of RasGRF1, an important protein associated with cognition and synaptic plasticity, underlie the associated impairments in cognition after CCH. We found that RasGRF1 levels markedly decreased following CCH. Through prediction and validation studies, we observed that miRNA-323-3p was upregulated after CCH and could bind to the 3 '-untranslated region of Rasgrf1 mRNA and regulate its expression in vitro. Moreover, the inhibition of miRNA-323-3p upregulated Rasgrf1 expression in the hippocampus after CCH, which was reversed by Rasgrf1 siRNA. This suggests that miRNA-323-3p is an important regulator of Rasgrf1. The Morris water maze and Y maze tests showed that miRNA-323-3p inhibition and Rasgrf1 upregulation improved spatial learning and memory, and electrophysiological measurements revealed deficits in long-term potentiation after CCH that were reversed by Rasgrf1 upregulation. Dendritic spine density and mature mushroom spine density were also improved after miRNA323-3p inhibition and Rasgrf1 upregulation. Furthermore, Rasgrf1 upregulation by miRNA-323-3p inhibition improved dendritic spine density and mature mushroom spine density and ameliorated the deterioration of synapses and postsynaptic density. Overall, RasGRF1 regulation attenuated cognitive impairment, helped maintain structural and functional synaptic plasticity, and prevented synapse deterioration after CCH. These results suggest that Rasgrf1 downregulation by miRNA-323-3p plays an important role in cognitive impairment after CCH. Thus, RasGRF1 and miRNA-323-3p may represent potential therapeutic targets for cognitive impairment after CCH.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common and recurrent neuropsychiatric disorder. Recent studies have shown that the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) is involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Previous studies have found that Kaji-ichigoside F1 (KF1) has a protective effect against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. However, the antidepressant mechanism of KF1 has not been confirmed yet. Purpose: In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the rapid antidepressant activity of KF1 and explore the underlying mechanism. Study design: First, we explored the effect of KF1 on NMDA-induced hippocampal neurons and the underlying mechanism. Second, depression was induced in C57BL/6 mice via chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and the immediate and persistent depression-like behavior was evaluated using the forced swimming test (FST) after a single administration of KF1. Third, the contributions of NMDA signaling to the antidepressant effect of KF1 were investigated using pharmacological interventions. Fourth, CUMS mice were treated with KF1 for 21 days, and then their depression-like behaviors and the underlying mechanism were further explored. Methods: The FST was used to evaluate immediate and persistent depression-like behavior after a single administration of KF1 with or without NMDA pretreatment. The effect of KF1 on depressive-like behavior was investigated in CUMS mice by treating them with KF1 once daily for 21 days through the sucrose preference test, FST, open field test, and tail suspension test. Then, the effects of KF1 on the morphology and molecular and functional phenotypes of primary neuronal cells and hippocampus of mice were investigated by hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, propidium iodide staining, TUNEL staining, Ca2+ imaging, JC-1 staining, ELISA, immunofluorescence analysis, RT-PCR, and Western blot. Results: KF1 could effectively improve cellular viability, reduce apoptosis, inhibit the release of LDH and Ca2+, and increase the mitochondrial membrane potential and the number of dendritic spines numbers in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, behavioral tests showed that KF1 exerted acute and sustained antidepressant-like effects by reducing Glu-levels and ameliorating neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Additionally, in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that PSD95, Syn1, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were upregulated at the protein level, and BDNF and AMPA were upregulated at the mRNA level. NR1 and NR2A showed the opposite trend. Conclusion: These results confirm that KF1 exerts rapid antidepressant effects mainly by activating the AMPA-BDNF-mTOR pathway and inhibiting the NMDAR-CaMKII alpha pathway. This study serves as a new reference for discovering rapid antidepressants.

AB  - With a 5-year survival rate of approximately 10%, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal solid malignancies in humans. A poor understanding of the underlying biology has resulted in a lack of effective targeted therapeutic strategies. Tissue microarray and bioinformatics analyses have revealed that the downstream transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), might be a therapeutic target in PDAC. Since pharmacological inhibition of TAZ is challenging, we performed unbiased deubiquitinase (DUB) library screening to explore the pivotal regulators of TAZ ubiquitination as potential targets in PDAC models. We found that USP14 contributed to Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TAZ transcriptional activity and stabilized TAZ but not YAP. Mechanistically, USP14 catalyzed the K48-linked deubiquitination of TAZ to promote TAZ stabilization. Moreover, TAZ facilitated the transcription of USP14 by binding to the TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) 1/4 response element in the promoter of USP14. USP14 was found to modulate the expression of TAZ downstream target genes through a feedback mechanism and ultimately promoted cancer progression and liver metastasis in PDAC models in vitro and in vivo. In addition, depletion of USP14 led to proteasome-dependent degradation of TAZ and ultimately arrested PDAC tumour growth and liver metastasis. A strong positive correlation between USP14 and TAZ expression was also detected in PDAC patients. The small molecule inhibitor of USP14 catalytic activity, IU1, inhibited the development of PDAC in subcutaneous xenograft and liver metastasis models. Overall, our data strongly suggested that the self-amplifying USP14-TAZ loop was a previously unrecognized mechanism causing upregulated TAZ expression, and identified USP14 as a viable therapeutic target in PDAC.

AB  - Cerebral ischemic stroke is a common neuron loss disease that is caused by the interruption of the blood supply to the brain. In order to enhance the CIS outcome, both identifying the treatment target of ischemic brain damage in the acute phase and developing effective therapies are urgently needed. Scutellarin had been found to be beneficial to ischemic injuries and has been shown to have potent effects in clinical application on both stroke and myocardial infarction. However, whether scutellarin improves ischemic brain damage in the acute phase remains unknown. In this study, the protective effects of scutellarin on ischemic brain damage in the acute phase (within 12 h) were illustrated. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) modeling rats, the ZLonga score was significantly down-regulated by 25% and 23.1%, and the brain infarct size was reduced by 26.95 +/- 0.03% and 25.63 +/- 0.02% when responding to high-dose and low-dose scutellarin treatments, respectively. H&E and TUNEL staining results indicated that the neuron loss of the ischemic region was improved under scutellarin treatment. In order to investigate the mechanism of scutellarin's effects on ischemic brain damage in the acute phase, changes in proteins and metabolites were analyzed. The suppression of scutellarin on the glutamate-inducing excitatory amino acid toxicity was strongly indicated in the study of both proteomics and metabolomics. A molecular docking experiment presented strong interactions between scutellarin and glutamate receptors, which score much higher than those of memantine. Further, by performing a parallel reaction monitoringmass spectrometry (PRM-MS) study on both the cortex and hippocampus tissue of the ischemic region, we screened the scutellarin-regulating molecules that are involved in both the release and transportation of neurotransmitters. It was found that the aberrant levels of glutamate receptors, including EAAT2, GRIN1, GRIN2B, and GRM1, as well as of other glutamatergic pathway-involving proteins, including CAMKK2, PSD95, and nNOS, were significantly regulated in the ischemic cortex. In the hippocampus, EAAT2, GRIN1, nNOS, and CAM were significantly regulated. Taken together, scutellarin exerts potent effects on ischemic brain damage in the acute phase by regulating the activity of neurotransmitters and reducing the toxicity of excitatory amino acids in in neurons.

AB  - Seizure is known to induce oxidative stress which may initiate neuronal death. Oxidant-antioxidant imbalance often leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and apoptosis in the brain which may further result in the development of seizure. Phenolic compounds such as curcumin and rosmarinic acid are reported to control convulsions and seizures in pentylenetetrazol induced seizures models by suppressing seizure time, oxidative stress and inflammation indirectly. Sinapic acid (SA), a polyphenolic product of hydroxycinnamic acid found in various plants, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anxiolytic effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of sinapic acid on pentylenetetrazol induced seizures in rats through oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and neurotrophic factor. A total of 28 male Wistar Albino rats weighing 200-220 g were divided into four equal groups (n=7/group). The treatment groups received 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg SA, respectively, by oral gavage for five consecutive days along with pentylenetetrazol (45 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) to induce seizures. The levels of Total oxidant status (TOS), Total antioxidant status (TAS), TNF-alpha, IL-113, and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured in the cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, caspase 3 and caspase 9 levels, as well as the immunoreactivity of Cleaved caspase 3, were determined in the hippocampus. The results showed that pretreatment with 20 mg/kg SA delayed the latency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and first myoclonic jerk, reduced GTCS duration, and improved seizure score and cognitive function. Importantly, the 20 mg/kg SA pretreatment resulted in decreased levels of TOS, TNF-alpha, IL-113, and BDNF in the cortex and hippocampus, while increasing TAS levels in these brain areas. Moreover, the 20 mg/kg SA reduced hippocampal caspase 3 and caspase 9 levels, as well as the immunoreactivity of Cleaved caspase 3 in rats with pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. These findings suggest that the anti-seizure effects of SA are mediated by BDNF modulation, as well as its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties.

AB  - Fluoride (F) is a nonessential but potentially harmful element for plants, especially when present in excess. The tea plant is known for its ability to hyperaccumulate F from the soil and eventually accumulates in the leaves; however, how the tea plant transports F to the leaves remains unclear. Here, we found that Se can significantly decrease the transport efficiency of F from root to leaf. Therefore, RNA-Sequencing was performed on tea roots cotreated with selenite and fluoride, and then we isolated a plasma membrane-localized F transporter CsNPF2.3 from tea plant roots and examined its role in transport of F in tea plants. The results showed that CsNPF2.3 exhibited F transport activity when heterologously expressed in yeast. Expression pattern analysis revealed that CsNPF2.3 is expressed in epidermal cells, cortex cells, and xylem parenchyma cells in roots. Overexpression of CsNPF2.3 in tea roots significantly increased F content in the root, stem, and leaf, and enhanced the transport efficiency of F from root to leaf. Furthermore, in nine tea cultivars, CsNPF2.3 expression in the root was significantly positively correlated with F content in the leaf and root, and the transport efficiency of F from root to leaf. Altogether, these findings suggest that CsNPF2.3 was involved in uptake and transport of F in tea plants.

AB  - In plants, 5mC DNA methylation is an important and conserved epistatic mark involving genomic stability, gene transcriptional regulation, developmental regulation, abiotic stress response, metabolite synthesis, etc. However, the roles of 5mC DNA methylation modification (5mC methylation) in tea plant growth and development (in pre-harvest processing) and flavor substance synthesis in pre- and post-harvest processing are unknown. We therefore conducted a comprehensive methylation analysis of four key pre-harvest tissues (root, leaf, flower, and fruit) and two processed leaves during oolong tea post-harvest processing. We found that differential 5mC methylation among four key tissues is closely related to tissue functional differentiation and that genes expressed tissue-specifically, responsible for tissue-specific functions, maintain relatively low 5mC methylation levels relative to non-tissue-specifically expressed genes. Importantly, hypomethylation modifications of CsAlaDC and TS/GS genes in roots provided the molecular basis for the dominant synthesis of theanine in roots. In addition, integration of 5mC DNA methylationomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics of post-harvest leaves revealed that content changes in flavor metabolites during oolong tea processing were closely associated with transcription level changes in corresponding metabolite synthesis genes, and changes in transcript levels of these important synthesis genes were strictly regulated by 5mC methylation. We further report that some key genes during processing are regulated by 5mC methylation, which can effectively explain the content changes of important aroma metabolites, including & alpha;-farnesene, nerolidol, lipids, and taste substances such as catechins. Our results not only highlight the key roles of 5mC methylation in important flavor substance synthesis in pre- and post-harvest processing, but also provide epimutation-related gene targets for future improvement of tea quality or breeding of whole-tissue high-theanine varieties.

AB  - Flavonoids constitute the main nutraceuticals in the leaves of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). To date, although it is known that drought stress can negatively impact the biosynthesis of flavonoids in tea leaves, the mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear. Herein, we report a protein phosphorylation mechanism that negatively regulates the biosynthesis of flavonoids in tea leaves in drought conditions. Transcriptional analysis revealed the downregulation of gene expression of flavonoid biosynthesis and the upregulation of CsMPK4a encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase in leaves. Luciferase complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays disclosed that CsMPK4a interacted with CsWD40. Phosphorylation assay in vitro, specific protein immunity, and analysis of protein mass spectrometry indicated that Ser-216, Thr-221, and Ser-253 of CsWD40 were potential phosphorylation sites of CsMPK4a. Besides, the protein immunity analysis uncovered an increased phosphorylation level of CsWD40 in tea leaves under drought conditions. Mutation of the three phosphorylation sites generated dephosphorylated CsWD403A and phosphorylated CsWD403D variants, which were introduced into the Arabidopsis ttg1 mutant. Metabolic analysis showed that the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin content was lower in ttg1:CsWD403D transgenic plants than ttg1::CsWD403A transgenic and wild type plants. The transient overexpression of CsWD403D downregulated the anthocyanidin biosynthesis in tea leaves. The dual-fluorescein protein complementation experiment showed that CsWD403D did not interact with CsMYB5a and CsAN2, two key transcription factors of procyanidins and anthocyanidins biosynthesis in tea plant. These findings indicate that the phosphorylation of CsWD40 by CsMPK4a downregulates the flavonoid biosynthesis in tea plants in drought stresses.

AB  - Naturally occurring methylated catechins, especially methylated EGCG in tea leaves, are known to have many health benefits. Although the genes involved in methylated EGCG biosynthesis have been studied extensively, the transcription factors that control methylated EGCG biosynthesis are still poorly understood. In the present study, a WRKY domain-containing protein termed CsWRKY57like was identified, which belongs to group IIc of the WRKY family and contains one conserved WRKY motif. CsWRKY57like was found to localize in the nucleus and function as a transcriptional activator; its expression was positively correlated with methylated EGCG level. In addition, CsWRKY57like activated the transcription of three genes related to methylated EGCG biosynthesis (CCoAOMT, CsLAR, and CsDFR), specifically interacting with their promoters by binding to the cis-acting element (C/T)TGAC(T/C). Further assays revealed that CsWRKY57like physically interacts with CsVQ4 and participates in the metabolic regulation of O-methylated catechin biosynthesis. We conclude that CsWRKY57like may positively impact the biosynthesis of methylated EGCG in the tea plant. These results comprehensively enrich the regulatory network of WRKY TFs associated with methylated EGCG and provide a potential strategy for the breeding of specific tea plant cultivars with high methylated EGCG levels.

AB  - SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein (SBP)-box proteins are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) and play crucial roles in a variety of physiological processes, including plant growth and development, signal transduction, and stress response. However, SBP-box family genes have not been well characterized in tea plant. In the present study, we identified 16 CsSBP genes in tea plant based on the tea plant genomic data. Phylogenetic analysis of SBP-box proteins from tea plant, Arabidopsis, and rice divided these proteins into nine groups (A-I). The number of exon-intron varied among the groups. The SBP-box genes in a same group shared similar exon-intron structures and motif locations. Prediction of miRNA target sites revealed that six CsSBPs genes contained a miR156 target site, while seven were targeted by miR157. RT-qPCR analysis revealed tissue/organ-specific expression patterns of CsSBP genes. In addition, their expression patterns in response to different phytohormone treatments and abiotic stresses were also investigated. This work provides base foundation for understanding the crucial roles of CsSBP genes in plant development and other biological processes.

AB  - Simple Summary In ovine species, transcervical artificial insemination is not easy to apply, due to the tortuous lumen of the cervix that does not allow the passage of routinely used catheters. Moreover, the quality of frozen-thawed semen in small ruminants is poor and these factors negatively affect the wide spreading of superior genotypes. The aim of this study was therefore to preliminarily test three newly designed insemination catheters, with bent tips of different lengths, in terms of reproductive performances in pluriparous ewes inseminated with frozen-thawed semen. Afterwards, the outcomes of insemination with the best performing catheter were compared to those obtained in ewes previously submitted to surgical incision of cervical folds, a technique that allows transcervical intrauterine deposition of semen. The results obtained indicated that a catheter with a bent tip of 5.0 mm allowed deep and fast intrauterine insemination, leading to pregnancy rates similar to those obtained following surgical incision of the folds. Further tests on the efficiency of the catheter are needed in field conditions and on a larger number of animals to assess the feasibility of the method in wide commercial insemination campaigns. In ovine species, transcervical artificial insemination (TCAI) is limited by the poor quality of frozen-thawed semen and by the convoluted cervical lumen hampering the passage of inseminating devices. The aim of the study was to test the efficiency of three newly designed catheters with bent tips of 3.5 mm, 5.0 mm or 8.0 mm in terms of reproductive performances (experiment 1) and to compare the results of TCAI with the best performing catheter of experiment 1 to those obtained in ewes submitted to surgical incision of cervical folds (SICF) prior to insemination (experiment 2). The following parameters were assessed: time to pass the cervix; depth of cervical penetration; site of deposition of semen; pregnancy (PR); and lambing rates (LR). The results of experiment 1 indicated that the 5.0 mm tip catheter resulted in deeper and faster TCAI and higher PR and LR compared to 3.5 mm and 8.0 mm tip catheters (p < 0.05). In experiment 2, TCAI with the 5.0 mm catheter did not differ from TCAI after SICF in terms of depth of semen deposition, time to pass the cervix, PR and LR (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the use of a catheter that allowed transcervical uterine deposition of semen without excessive manipulation led to satisfactory pregnancy rates.

AB  - Sorghum is considered a fifth major cereal, widely used as a multipurpose crop worldwide. The use of sorghum as a major forage crop is limited due to cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin in the vegetative shoot tissues. This cyanogenic glycoside is harmful to livestock when fed as fodder. The present study selected three sorghum genotypes for estimating hydrogen cyanide potential (HCNp) in vegetative tissues under well-watered (WW) conditions. The HCNp concentration varied from genotype to genotype and ranged from 364 to 512 ppm. The HCNp estimation was observed more in ICSR 14001 with 511 ppm, followed by ICSV 93046 (443 ppm) and CSH 24 MF (364 ppm). A significant difference was noticed between the genotypes. Sequence information of dhurrin biosynthesis pathway genes was retrieved and characterized using different bioinformatic tools. The gene expression analysis of dhurrin biosynthesis pathway genes showed different expression patterns, with the highest in ICSV 93046 and less in ICSR 14001 and CSH 24 MF. Genes CYP79A1, CYP71E1 and UGT85B1 showed a 2.5- to 4 fold increase in ICSV 93046 and no significant expression in ICSR 14001 and CSH 24 MF. The genotype CSH 24 MF observed a 1.5-fold increase in CYP79A1 gene expression, and the other genes observed no significant increase. This study assisted in identifying the contrasting genotypes inducing HCNp and the key genes of the dhurrin pathway producing hydrogen cyanide (HCN) under WW conditions, which can be used as potential candidates for gene editing, providing safe feed for the livestock.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract of poultry is a potential source of Campylobacter jejuni. Here, the prevalence, risk factors, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and genetic relationship of C. jejuni were studied in broilers from farms and meat from live bird markets (LBMs) and super shops (SS). Pooled cloacal samples were obtained from farms in six districts of Bangladesh between June 2019 and March 2020. Pooled meat samples were obtained from LBMs and SS in the Chattogram district. Microbial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antimicrobial susceptibility tests were used to detect multidrug-resistant C. jejuni. A positive PCR amplicon was validated by mapA partial gene sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. In total, 12.5% (95% CI: 8.5-17.7%) of farms (N = 216) and 27.1% (95% CI: 15.28-41.85%) of LBMs and SS (N = 48) tested positive for C. jejuni. Moreover, 98% of the isolates were multidrug-resistant, with 86% resistant to five or more antimicrobial groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed a downtime of <14 days, no separate footwear for shed access, and more than one person entering the sheds were significantly associated with C. jejuni colonization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a strong relationship between C. jejuni strains obtained in Bangladesh and strains isolated in India, South Africa and Grenada from humans, pigs and bats. This study revealed significant contamination of broiler meat with Campylobacter spp. and C. jejuni. Potential sources of contamination and anthropogenic factors associated with the alarming prevalence of C. jejuni identified in this study would aid in reducing the growing risks of broiler-associated pathogens.

AB  - The wild-type H1N1 and H3N2 swine influenza virus (SIV) strains are unsuitable for vaccine production because of high lethality in chicken embryos and low reproductive titers. This study developed recombinant H1N1-Re1 and H3N2-Re1 strains via HA and NA genes from the wild-type H1N1 SW/GX/755/17 and H3N2 SW/GX/1659/17 strains combined with six internal genes from the H1N1 A/PR/8/34 strain. The recombinant viruses demonstrated typical cytopathic effects in MDCK cells, and the presence of viral particles was confirmed via electron microscopy. Growth curve analysis revealed titers of 108.31 and 108.17 EID50 per 100 mu L for H1N1-Re1 and H3N2-Re1, respectively, within 72-96 h postinoculation. Virus stocks were used to produce a bivalent inactivated vaccine. After two immunizations, hemagglutination inhibition titers in piglets were significantly greater than those induced by commercial vaccines and were sustained from 5 to 29 weeks postimmunization. Upon challenge with virulent wild-type SIV strains, viral isolation occurred in all pigs in the PBS group (5/5 protection), whereas no virus was detected in the bivalent vaccine group (0/5). In contrast, the commercial vaccine group had a viral isolation rate of 1/5. Pathological examination revealed severe pulmonary lesions in the PBS group, mild changes in the commercial vaccine group (1/5), and normal lung morphology in the bivalent vaccine group. This study demonstrated the successful application of an eight-plasmid reverse genetics system to develop recombinant vaccine strains with enhanced immunogenicity and replication efficiency. The bivalent inactivated vaccine provides prolonged and complete protection against H1N1 and H3N2 SIV strains, offering a robust tool for controlling evolving SIV variants.

AB  - The currently available treatment options for leishmaniasis are associated with high costs, severe side effects, and high toxicity. In previous studies, thiohydantoins demonstrated some pharmacological activities and were shown to be potential hit compounds with antileishmanial properties. The present study further explored the antileishmanial effect of acetyl-thiohydantoins against Leishmania amazonensis and determined the main processes involved in parasite death. We observed that compared to thiohydantoin nuclei, acetyl-thiohydantoin treatment inhibited the proliferation of promastigotes. This treatment caused alterations in cell cycle progression and parasite size and caused morphological and ultrastructural changes. We then investigated the mechanisms involved in the death of the protozoan; there was an increase in ROS production, phosphatidylserine exposure, and plasma membrane permeabilization and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in an accumulation of lipid bodies and the formation of autophagic vacuoles on these parasites and confirming an apoptosis-like process. In intracellular amastigotes, selected acetyl-thiohydantoins reduced the percentage of infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes/macrophages by increasing ROS production and reducing TNF-alpha levels. Moreover, thiohydantoins did not induce cytotoxicity in murine macrophages (J774A.1), human monocytes (THP-1), or sheep erythrocytes. In silico and in vitro analyses showed that acetyl-thiohydantoins exerted in vitro antileishmanial effects on L. amazonensis promastigotes in apoptosis-like and amastigote forms by inducing ROS production and reducing TNF-alpha levels, indicating that they are good candidates for drug discovery studies in leishmaniasis treatment. Additionally, we carried out molecular docking analyses of acetyl-thiohydantoins on two important targets of Leishmania amazonensis: arginase and TNF-alpha converting enzyme. The results suggested that the acetyl groups in the N1 position of the thiohydantoin ring and the ring itself could be pharmacophoric groups due to their affinity for binding amino acid residues at the active site of both enzymes via hydrogen bond interactions. These results demonstrate that thiohydantoins are promising hit compounds that could be used as antileishmanial agents.

AB  - Benzoates, particularly salicylic acid (SA) and its derivatives, play critical roles in plant immune responses and basal defense through hydroxylation and glycosylation. Anthracnose is one of the most common and devastating diseases in tea plants (Camellia sinensis). However, the role of SA and its derivatives in tea plant immunity and resistance to anthracnose remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we identified and characterized a glycosyltransferase, CsUGT74B5, which was significantly downregulated in tea seedlings upon anthracnose infection. CsUGT74B5 was preferentially expressed in mature leaves and stem, and responded rapidly to exogenous SA treatment. Phylogenetic analysis suggested CsUGT74B5 might possess the catalytic activity toward benzoates. Enzymatic assays and molecular docking demonstrated recombinant CsUGT74B5 specifically glycosylated at the ortho hydroxyl groups of SA and 2, 6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 6-DHBA), but did not glycosylate 2, 3-DHBA, 2, 5-DHBA, or other substrates in vitro. Overexpression of CsUGT74B5 in Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) reduced SA level while promoting the accumulation of SA 2-O-beta-D-glucoside (SAG), further validating the in vivo function of CsUGT74B5. Moreover, transient overexpression of CsUGT74B5 in two tea plant cultivars increased their sensitivity to anthracnose and accelerated lesion development, which was attributed to decreased SA levels. Overall, our finding demonstrated that CsUGT74B5-mediated biosynthesis of SAG regulated tea plant immunity against anthracnose by fine-tuning free SA levels, providing new progress into the immunity response of tea plants.

AB  - Theanine is a non-protein free amino acid accumulated in tea plant leaves and makes a major contribution to the unique umami and sweet taste and a multitude of human health benefits of tea. However, its biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation in tea plant leaves remain to be fully understood. Here, we report that an R2R3-MYB CsMYB213 and a bHLH CsbHLH35 co-regulated two key theanine biosynthesis genes, CsTSI and CsAlaDC, and regulate the theanine biosynthesis in tea plant leaves in response to nitrogen availability. By combining extensive co-expression analyses on a large body of transcriptomic data with validation through yeast one-hybrid, gel shift, dual-luciferase reporter assays as well as antisense inhibition experiments, we demonstrated that CsMYB213 bound to the promoters of CsTSI and CsAlaDC and activated theanine biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo. Although showing no transactivation activity alone, CsbHLH35 could interact with CsMYB213 and enhance the CsMYB213 transactivation of CsTSI and CsAlaDC expression. VIGS experiments revealed that silencing either CsMYB213 or CsbHLH35 in tea leaves significantly repressed CsTSI and CsAlaDC expression. Both CsMYB213 and CsbHLH35 were up-regulated by application of green manure, nitrogen fertilizer alone or in combination with organic fertilizer, aligning with the enhanced theanine accumulation. The CsMYB213-CsbHLH35 module functions as a nitrogen-responsive transcriptional activator of theanine biosynthesis in tea plants. The study sheds light on the complex regulatory mechanism underlying theanine biosynthesis in tea plants under nitrogen nutrition, offering effective cultivation strategies to enhance theanine content in tea leaves.

AB  - The study aimed to analyze changes in biomolecular composition of granulosa and theca interna cells of porcine ovarian follicles following in vitro treatment of vitamin D3 and insulin alone or in combination. Medium antral follicles (n = 4/each group) were cultured alone (C; control) or in the presence of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 (VD; 100 ng/ mL) and insulin (I; 10 ng/mL) separately or in combination, VD and I (VD+I). Then paraplast-embedded ovarian follicles were used for Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and respective histological stainings. FTIR analysis revealed changes in the content of fibrous proteins (mainly collagens) within theca interna following vitamin D3 and insulin co-administration that was verified by Masson's trichrome staining. Treatment-dependent differences were also observed in the secondary structure of proteins, indicating enhanced conversion to alpha-helices in response to vitamin D3 and insulin action/interaction in both follicular compartments. In the granulosa and theca interna layers, tendency to lower DNA content in the VD+I group was noted and confirmed by Fulgen's staining. Finally, altered monosaccharides production in both follicular layers was found. Based on FTIR results, it is possible to attribute the observed alterations to biological processes that could be regulated by vitamin D3 and insulin in the porcine ovarian follicles.

AB  - In the current article, a developed, patented method denoted the 'Camel Semen Collection Kit-CSCK', was designed to solve the problem of semen collection in dromedary camels. CSCK is composed of three main parts: (1) Semen collection sac: made from supersensitive flexible low-density polyethylene- (LDPE); (2) Metal stainless steel applicator: designed to introduce the collection sac intravaginally and fixate it to the vaginal wall of a female camel through air insufflation; (3) Fixation sticker: a cushion sheet sticker is used to secure the outer portion of the collection sac to the female's perineal area. Semen was collected twice a week from eight dromedary bulls by using electroejaculation (EJ), artificial vagina (AV) and CSCK. Successful semen collections were 81.3%, 84.4% and 43.8% using EJ, CSCK and AV techniques respectively. Semen obtained by EJ technique showed lower semen volume, gross activity, sperm concentration, total sperm motility and percentage of live sperm cells compared to the other two techniques. Semen collected by CSCK showed a longer collection period and higher volume, gross activity, sperm motility and percentage of live spermatozoa and a lower rate of visible contamination compared to AV technique. The advantages and disadvantages of the three techniques were compared and discussed. In conclusion, CSCK represents a practical and easy method to reliably collect high-quality semen from any untrained male dromedary camel and may facilitate the widespread application of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) on a large scale in this species.

AB  - Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is the loss of skeletal muscle that exceeds the muscle's self-repair mechanism and leads to permanent functional deficits. In a previous study, we demonstrated the ability of our scaffold-free, multiphasic, tissue-engineered skeletal muscle units (SMUs) to restore muscle mass and force production. However, it was observed that the full recovery of muscle structure was inhibited due to increased fibrosis in the repair site. As such, novel biomaterials such as hydrogels (HGs) may have significant potential for decreasing the acute inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, as well as enhancing skeletal muscle regeneration following VML injury and repair. The goal of the current study was to assess the biocompatibility of commercially available poly(ethylene glycol), methacrylated gelatin, and hyaluronic acid (HA) HGs in combination with our SMUs to treat VML in a clinically relevant large animal model. An acute 30% VML injury created in the sheep peroneus tertius (PT) muscle was repaired with or without HGs and assessed for acute inflammation (incision swelling) and white blood cell counts in blood for 7 days. At the 7-day time point, HA was selected as the HG to use for the combined HG/SMU repair, as it exhibited a reduced inflammation response compared to the other HGs. Six weeks after implantation, all groups were assessed for gross and histological structural recovery. The results showed that the groups repaired with an SMU (SMU-Only and SMU+HA) restored muscle mass to greater degree than the groups with only HG and that the SMU groups had PT muscle masses that were statistically indistinguishable from its uninjured contralateral PT muscle. Furthermore, the HA HG, SMU-Only, and SMU+HA groups displayed notable efficacy in diminishing pro-inflammatory markers and showed an increased number of regenerating muscle fibers in the repair site. Taken together, the data demonstrates the efficacy of HA HG in decreasing acute inflammation and fibrotic response. The combination of HA and our SMUs also holds promise to decrease acute inflammation and fibrosis and increase muscle regeneration, advancing this combination therapy toward clinically relevant interventions for VML injuries in humans.
   Impact statement Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a clinically relevant problem for which current treatment methods are limited and are not 100% effective. Tissue-engineered skeletal muscle and commercially available hydrogels (HGs) are promising novel therapeutic options. This study aimed to access the biocompatibility of commercially available poly(ethylene glycol), methacrylated gelatin, and hyaluronic acid HGs in combination with our tissue-engineered skeletal muscle units to treat VML in a clinically relevant large animal model (sheep) after a 6-week recovery.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Citrus medica L. has been cultivated in China for over two thousand years, with the effects of soothing the liver, regulating qi. Studies have shown that it can relieve anxiety. Its combination with other traditional Chinese medicines has been widely used in clinical practice assist in the treatment of anxiety and depression. The essential oil rich in peel is important active substance of Citrus medica L. A large number of studies have confirmed that essential oils are commonly used to relieve pain, psychological stress and induce relaxation. However, there are currently no studies on the effects of Citrus medica L. essential oil (CEO) on anxiety. Aim of the study: Anxiety has become the most common mental illness worldwide, so effective and diverse prevention and control methods are urgently needed. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect and optimal administration route of CEO on anxiety caused by different susceptibility factors, and to further explore its potential mechanism for improving anxiety, providing scientific guidance for the application of CEO. Materials and methods: Induce anxiety models caused by fatigue or stress, and use animal behavior as an indicator to evaluate the CEO. To illustrate the underlying mechanisms of anti-anxiety effect of CEO, histological examination, immunofluorescence staining and Western Blot were carried out. Results: The results showed that the safer inhalation administration was more effective. Compared with the stressinduced anxiety model, CEO has a more obvious effect on fatigue-induced anxiety. After CEO administration, the frequency, time, and movement distance of fatigue-type anxious mice in Open Field Test (OFT) increased significantly. During Elevated Plus Maze Test (EPM), the mice spent more time and have more entry in the open arm. Further research found that CEO can significantly increase cerebral blood flow, recover damaged neurons in the hippocampus. RNA-seq analysis investigated that CEO can significantly improve gene expression in the hippocampus of fatigue accompanied anxiety mice. The underlying mechanism is significantly related to cholinergic system pathways. Further research found that the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR) in anxious mice was down-regulated, accompanied by decreased activation of its downstream ERK/ CREB. Inhaling essential oil improved fatigue-induced anxiety by reversing this phenomenon. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that CEO have a significant anti-anxiety effect, especially fatigue induced anxiety. Our research results verify the accuracy and effectiveness of symptomatic treatment strategies for anxiety caused by different susceptibility factors, and provide scientific guidance for the rational use of CEO.

AB  - Sperm metabolism consists of a sophisticated network of biochemical reactions and varies between species, resulting in different metabolic strategies for ATP production to maintain sperm functionality. ATP can be produced through glycolysis or in the mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Since OXPHOS is the predominant metabolic pathway in horses spermatozoa, various assessments of mitochondrial activity are used to evaluate fertility, utilizing techniques such as fluorescent probes analysed via microscopy or flow cytometry, and polarographic electrode assays to measure current flow in response to an applied voltage. Though, these methods are limited by low throughput, as they assess mitochondrial activity at a single time point under a specific treatment condition. This study explores, for the first time, the application of the Agilent Seahorse XFp Technology to evaluate metabolism in stallion spermatozoa. This method enables real-time measurement of cellular metabolism across multiple samples or experimental conditions simultaneously. Ejaculates from eight different stallions were collected, and pools were prepared from three of them. Sperm viability and mitochondrial activity were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy, sperm motility by a computer-assisted sperm analysis system, and sperm metabolism was analysed via the Seahorse XFp analyser. Results confirmed a preference for OXPHOS over glycolysis in ATP production in stallion sperm, with mitochondria contributing significantly to total ATP generation. The Seahorse XFp Technology proved effective in evaluating equine sperm bioenergetics, offering insights into metabolic pathways critical for sperm function. In conclusion, this technology grants a new method for high-throughput analysis of sperm metabolism and quality, which could be applied to future reproductive studies in male equine fertility.

AB  - Author summaryAfter new memories are acquired, they can be transferred over time into other brain areas-a process called systems memory consolidation. For example, new declarative memories, which refer to the conscious memory of facts and events, depend on the hippocampus. Older declarative memories, however, also rely on neocortical networks. The cellular mechanisms underlying such a transfer are poorly understood. In this work, we show that a simple and in the brain ubiquitous connectivity pattern, combined with a standard learning rule, leads to gradual memory transfer. We illustrate our proposed mechanism in numerical simulations and mathematical analyses. At the neurophysiological level, our theory explains experimental findings on memory storage in the hippocampal formation when specific pathways between neural populations are disrupted. At the psychophysical level, we can account for the power-law forgetting curves typically found in humans. A consequence of the proposed model is that consolidated memories can yield faster responses because they are stored in increasingly shorter synaptic pathways between sensory and motor areas. By giving a mechanistic explanation of the consolidation process, we contribute to the understanding of the transfer of memories and the reorganization of memories over time.
   Systems memory consolidation involves the transfer of memories across brain regions and the transformation of memory content. For example, declarative memories that transiently depend on the hippocampal formation are transformed into long-term memory traces in neocortical networks, and procedural memories are transformed within cortico-striatal networks. These consolidation processes are thought to rely on replay and repetition of recently acquired memories, but the cellular and network mechanisms that mediate the changes of memories are poorly understood. Here, we suggest that systems memory consolidation could arise from Hebbian plasticity in networks with parallel synaptic pathways-two ubiquitous features of neural circuits in the brain. We explore this hypothesis in the context of hippocampus-dependent memories. Using computational models and mathematical analyses, we illustrate how memories are transferred across circuits and discuss why their representations could change. The analyses suggest that Hebbian plasticity mediates consolidation by transferring a linear approximation of a previously acquired memory into a parallel pathway. Our modelling results are further in quantitative agreement with lesion studies in rodents. Moreover, a hierarchical iteration of the mechanism yields power-law forgetting-as observed in psychophysical studies in humans. The predicted circuit mechanism thus bridges spatial scales from single cells to cortical areas and time scales from milliseconds to years.

AB  - This study aimed to elucidate the specific biochemical pathways linked to changes in proteins in the Alzheimer 's disease (AD) human hippocampus. Our data demonstrate a constant rise in the expression of four proteins (VGF, GFAP, HSPB1, and APP) across all eleven studies. Notably, UBC was the most centrally involved and had increased expression in the hippocampus tissue of individuals with AD. Modified proteins in the hippocampal tissue were found to activate the innate immune system and disrupt communication across chemical synapses. Four hub proteins (CD44, APP, ITGB2, and APOE) are connected to amyloid plaques, whereas two hub proteins (RPL24 and RPS23) are related to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The presence of modified proteins was discovered to trigger the activation of microglia and decrease the functioning of ribosomes and mitochondria in the hippocampus. Three significant microRNAs (hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-17 -5p, and hsa-miR-16 -5p) and transcription factors (MYT1L, PIN1, and CSRNP3) have been discovered to improve our understanding of the alterations in proteins within the hippocampal tissues that lead to the progression of AD. These findings establish a path for possible treatments for AD to employ therapeutic strategies that specifically focus on the proteins or processes linked to the illness.

AB  - Background: Xuefu Zhuyu decoction (XFZYD) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula known for its ability to eliminate blood stasis and improve blood circulation, providing neuroprotection against severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Purpose: We aim to investigate the neuroprotective effects of XFZYD in sTBI from a novel mechanistic perspective of miRNA-mRNA. Additionally, we sought to elucidate a potential specific mechanism by integrating transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and conducting both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Methods: The sTBI rat model was established, and the rats were treated with XFZYD for 14 days. The neuroprotective effects of XFZYD were evaluated using a modified neurological severity score, hematoxylin and eosin staining, as well as Nissl staining. The anti-inflammatory effects of XFZYD were explored using quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence. Next, miRNA sequencing of the hippocampus was performed to determine which miRNAs were differentially expressed. Subsequently, qRT-PCR was used to validate the differentially expressed miRNAs. Target core mRNAs were determined using various methods, including miRNA prediction targets, mRNA sequencing, miRNA-mRNA network, and protein -protein interaction (PPI) analysis. The miRNA/mRNA regulatory axis were verified through qRT-PCR or Western blot analysis. Finally, morphological changes in the neural synapses were observed using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Results: XFZYD exhibited significant neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on subacute sTBI rats ' hippocampus. The analyses of miRNA/mRNA sequences combined with the PPI network revealed that the therapeutic effects of XFZYD on sTBI were associated with the regulation of the rno-miR-191a-5p/BDNF axis. Subsequently, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed XFZYD reversed the decrease of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus caused by sTBI. Additionally, XFZYD treatment potentially increased the number of synaptic connections, and the expression of the synapse -related protein PSD95, axon -related protein GAP43 and neuronspecific protein TUBB3. Conclusions: XFZYD exerts neuroprotective effects by promoting hippocampal synaptic remodeling and improving cognition during the subacute phase of sTBI through downregulating of rno-miR-191a-5p/BDNF axis, further activating BDNF-TrkB signaling.

AB  - Kombucha is a slightly sweet, acidic, carbonated, fermented beverage obtained by fermenting sugared tea (Camellia sinesis) with symbiotic bacteria. In the present study, kombucha was produced from black tea (Camellia sinensis), black grape (Vitis labrusca), black mulberry (Morus nigra), and rosehip (Rosa canina) fruits. Its physicochemical, microbiological, sensory properties and antimicrobial effects were investigated. During the fermentation, pH, Brix (%), viscosity, total antioxidant, and phenolic substance values decreased (p < 0.05). Total aerobic mesophilic bacteria (TAMB) and yeast/mold, Lactococcus/Streptococcus counts decreased, while the osmophilic yeast, acetic acid, and lactic acid bacterial counts increased (p < 0.05). The samples produced using black mulberry had the highest antibacterial activity (26.58 mm zone diameter), lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (0.012 mg center dot L-1), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) (0.008 mg center dot L-1) on Staphylococcus aureus. The highest antifungal activity was in the rosehip on Mucor racemosus (p < 0.05). The a* values increased during fermentation, while L* and b* values decreased. Based on the sensory analysis, black mulberry was the most preferred sample concerning all assessment criteria.

AB  - Aging decreases cognitive functions, especially learning and memory. Neuroinflammation is mediated by microglia and occurs in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The expression profiles in a dataset of cognitively normal controls (GSE11882) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Microarray data were used to explore the expression of age-related genes in the human hippocampus. A total of 120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. A total of 18 key genes were identified by the plugin cytoHubba in Cytoscape software. Two genes with a positive impact on cognition during aging were teased out: triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and a scavenger receptor (CD163). Finally, the results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) verified that the mRNA expression of these two genes was significantly upregulated in aged mice. Moreover, the levels of the inflammatory factors IL-1 beta and IL-6 were significantly increased. TREM2 and CD163 may be upregulated to alleviate the inflammatory environment resulting from microglial activation in the aging brain, thereby delaying cognitive decline.

AB  - Porcine cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been widely used in biotechnology for generating animal disease models and genetically modified animals for xenotransplantation. Vitamin C is a multifunctional factor that reacts with several enzymes. In this study, we used porcine oocytes to investigate the effects of different concentrations of vitamin C on in vitro maturation (IVM), in vitro culture (IVC), and the derivation of nuclear transfer embryonic stem-like cells (NT-ESCs). We demonstrated that vitamin C promoted the cleavage and blastocyst rate of genetically modified cloned porcine embryos and improved the derivation of NT-ESCs. Vitamin C integrated into IVM and IVC enhanced cleavage and blastocyst formation (P < 0.05) in SCNT embryos. Glutathione level was increased, and reactive oxygen species levels were decreased (P < 0.05) due to vitamin C treatment. Vitamin C decreased the gene expression of apoptosis (BAX) and increased the expression of genes associated with nuclear reprogramming (NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, c-Myc, Klf4, and TEAD4), antioxidation (SOD1), anti-apoptotic (Bcl2), and trophectoderm (CDX2). Moreover, vitamin C improved the attachment, derivation, and passaging of NT-ESCs, while the control group showed no outgrowths beyond the primary culture. In conclusion, supplementation of vitamin C at a dose of 50 mu g/ml to the IVM and IVC culture media was appropriate to improve the outcomes of porcine IVM and IVC and for the derivation of NT-ESCs as a model to study the pre-and post-implantation embryonic development in cloned transgenic embryos. Therefore, we recommend the inclusion of vitamin C as a supplementary factor to IVM and IVC to improve porcine in vitro embryonic development.

AB  - Corticoptropin releasing factor (CRF) is implicated in stress-related physiological and behavioral changes. The septohippocampal pathway regulates hippocampal-dependent mnemonic processes, which are affected in stressrelated disorders, and given the abundance of CRF receptors in the medial septum (MS), this pathway is influenced by CRF. Moreover, there are sex differences in the MS sensitivity to CRF and its impact on hippocampal function. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive. In the present study, we utilized an in vivo biosensor-based electrochemistry approach to examine the impact of MS CRF infusions on hippocampal cholinergic signaling dynamics in male and female rats. Our results show increased amplitudes of depolarization-evoked phasic cholinergic signals in the hippocampus following MS infusion of CRF at the 3 ng dose as compared to the infusion involving artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Moreover, a trend for a sex x infusion interaction indicated larger cholinergic transients in females. On the contrary, intraseptal infusion of a physiologically high dose (100 ng) of CRF produced a subsequent reduction in phasic cholinergic transients in both males and females. The assessment of tonic cholinergic activity over 30 min post-infusion revealed no changes at the 3 ng CRF dose in either sex, but a significant infusion x sex interaction indicated a reduction in females at the 100 ng dose of CRF as compared to the aCSF. Taken together, our results show differential, dosedependent modulatory effects of MS CRF on the dynamics of phasic and tonic modes of cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus of male and female rats. These cholinergic signaling modes are critical for memory encoding and maintaining arousal states, and may underlie sex differences in cognitive vulnerability to stress and stressrelated psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Patients with dementia are diagnosed with deficiency patterns and interior patterns in traditional Chinese medicine due to decreased physical strength, mental atrophy including cognitive function, and decreased motor function in the gastrointestinal tract. Since "greater yin symptom " in Shanghanlun has been interpreted as interior, deficiency, and cold pattern in traditional Chinese medicine, it is necessary to determine whether Geijigadaehwang-tang (GDT) has therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying mechanism if it has such effects. Aims of the study: Trimethyltin (TMT), a neurotoxic organotin compound, has been used to induce several neurodegenerative diseases, including epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of GDT for TMT-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration and seizures and to determine the mechanisms involved at the molecular level. Materials and methods: The main components of GDT were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. TMT was used to induce neurotoxicity in microglial BV-2 cells and C57BL6 mice. GDT was administered at various doses to determine its neuroprotective and seizure inhibition effects. The inhibitory effects of GDT on TMT-induced apoptosis, inflammatory pathways, and oxidative stress pathways were determined in the mouse hippocampal tissues. Results: GDT contained emodin, chrysophanol, albiflorin, paeoniflorin, 6-gingerol, and liquiritin apioside. In microglial BV-2 cells treated with TMT, GDT showed dose-dependent neuroprotective effects. Oral administra-tion of GDT five times for 2.5 days before and after TMT injection inhibited seizures at doses of 180 and 540 mg/ kg and inhibited neuronal death in the hippocampus. In hippocampal tissues extracted from mice, GDT inhibited the protein expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3, and phosphorylated nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B/total-NF kappa B ratio. Additionally, GDT inhibited the messenger RNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, caspase-1, interleukin-1 beta, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2, and heme oxygenase-1. Conclusion: This study's results imply that GDT might have neuroprotective potential in neurodegenerative diseases through neuronal death inhibition and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms.

AB  - Affective empathy enables social mammals to learn and transfer emotion to conspecifics, but an understanding of the neural circuitry and genetics underlying affective empathy is still very limited. Here, using the naive observational fear between cagemates as a paradigm similar to human affective empathy and chemo/optogenetic neuroactivity manipulation in mouse brain, we investigate the roles of multiple brain regions in mouse affective empathy. Remarkably, two neural circuits originating from the ventral hippocampus, previously unknown to function in empathy, are revealed to regulate naive observational fear. One is from ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons to lateral septum GABAergic neurons, and the other is from ventral hippocampus pyramidal neurons to nucleus accumbens dopamine -receptor -expressing neurons. Furthermore, we identify the naive observational -fear -encoding neurons in the ventral hippocampus. Our findings highlight the potentially diverse regulatory pathways of empathy in social animals, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying empathy circuity and its disorders.

AB  - Hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) is a widespread environmental pollutant in air and water that is primarily attributed to industrial pollution. The current maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (0.05 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively) were set based on contact dermatitis and warrant further toxicological investigation. While Cr(VI) is neurotoxic and accumulates in the brain, most animal studies only report whole-brain Cr, leaving large knowledge gaps. Few studies consider differences between ages or sexes, and fewer consider essential metal dyshomeostasis. We sought to investigate where Cr accumulates in the brain, considering sex and age differences, following a 90-day drinking water exposure to current MCLs. Here, we report Cr levels in six brain regions of rats exposed to drinking water Cr(VI). We observed Cr only accumulated in the hippocampus, and only in older females. We further assessed changes to essential metals in the hippocampus, observing opposite effects across sexes and between young rats compared to older rats. In sum, our data indicate drinking water Cr(VI) selectively targeted the hippocampus, with geriatric females accumulating the most Cr, and induced significant essential metal dyshomeostasis even in tissues lacking evident Cr accumulation.

AB  - We have previously reported a failure of recovery of synaptic function in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices from mice with a conditional neuronal knockout (KO) of GLT-1 (EAAT2, Slc1A2) driven by synapsin-Cre (synGLT-1 KO). The failure of recovery of synaptic function is due to excitotoxic injury. We hypothesized that changes in mitochondrial metabolism contribute to the heightened vulnerability to excitotoxicity in the synGLT-1 KO mice. We found impaired flux of carbon from C-13-glucose into the tricarboxylic acid cycle in synGLT-1 KO cortical and hippocampal slices compared with wild-type (WT) slices. In addition, we found downregulation of the neuronal glucose transporter GLUT3 in both genotypes. Flux of carbon from [1,2-C-13]acetate, thought to be astrocyte-specific, was increased in the synGLT-KO hippocampal slices but not cortical slices. Glycogen stores, predominantly localized to astrocytes, are rapidly depleted in slices after cutting, and are replenished during ex vivo incubation. In the synGLT-1 KO, replenishment of glycogen stores during ex vivo incubation was compromised. These results suggest both neuronal and astrocytic metabolic perturbations in the synGLT-1 KO slices. Supplementing incubation medium during recovery with 20 mM D-glucose normalized glycogen replenishment but had no effect on recovery of synaptic function. In contrast, 20 mM non-metabolizable L-glucose substantially improved recovery of synaptic function, suggesting that D-glucose metabolism contributes to the excitotoxic injury in the synGLT-1 KO slices. L-lactate substitution for D-glucose did not promote recovery of synaptic function, implicating mitochondrial metabolism. Consistent with this hypothesis, phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which decreases enzyme activity, was increased in WT slices during the recovery period, but not in synGLT-1 KO slices. Since metabolism of glucose by the mitochondrial electron transport chain is associated with superoxide production, we tested the effect of drugs that scavenge and prevent superoxide production. The superoxide dismutase/catalase mimic EUK-134 conferred complete protection and full recovery of synaptic function. A site-specific inhibitor of complex III superoxide production, S3QEL-2, was also protective, but inhibitors of NADPH oxidase were not. In summary, we find that the failure of recovery of synaptic function in hippocampal slices from the synGLT-1 KO mouse, previously shown to be due to excitotoxic injury, is caused by production of superoxide by mitochondrial metabolism.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in communication, social interaction, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, with no specific drug therapy available. Studies have found that cannabidiol (CBD) can improve hyperactive and cognitive symptoms in children with ASD. However, little is known about the effect of CBD in combination with other medications, such as risperidone (RISP). This study aimed to evaluate the behavioral and biochemical effects of CBD in animals using a valproic acid (VPA)-induced ASD animal model. VPA was administered in pregnant Wistar rats on Day 12.5 of gestation to induce the ASD model. From the 10th to the 16th postnatal day (PND), the neurodevelopment of the animals was assessed through eye-opening, olfactory discrimination, and negative geotaxis behavioral tests. From PNDs 9 to 54, the animals were weighed. They were treated for 21 days with CBD alone (100 mg/kg, by gavage, twice a day) or in combination with RISP (0.1 mg/kg, by gavage, once a day). At PND 55, the animals were evaluated in social interaction and locomotor activity experiments. Finally, after behavioral assessment, the animals were euthanized, the brain was isolated, and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the hippocampus and cortex posterior. Animals exposed to VPA showed neurodevelopmental delays in opening their eyes, difficulties in turning around their axis, and took longer time to find the original nest when compared to control animals. They also exhibited impaired sociability and reduced exploratory activity, which indicates model impairments. Interestingly, animals exposed to VPA treated with CBD + RISP significantly improved sociability parameters, whereas isolated CBD did not affect this parameter. In the biochemical analysis, a significant decrease in the hippocampal sulfhydryl content was noted in the CT + CBD group and an increase in the VPA + CBD group. In conclusion, these results suggest that CBD, in combination with RISP, may be an interesting pharmacological approach to reducing ASD-related symptoms.Summary: Besides the increased prevalence of ASD cases in recent years, there are no medications to improve the central symptoms of autism. Numerous studies discuss CBD as an important medication for improving ASD symptoms; however, it is not known how CBD interacts with commonly used drugs in ASD individuals, such as RISP. This study demonstrated that CBD therapy, only when combined with RISP, improved sociability in a VPA-induced ASD animal model.

AB  - In addition to aquaporin (AQP) classes AQP1, AQP4 and AQP9 known to be expressed in mammalian brain, our recent transcriptomic analyses identified AQP0 and AQP11 in human cortex and hippocampus at levels correlated with age and Alzheimer's disease (AD) status; however, protein localization remained unknown. Roles of AQP0 and AQP11 in transporting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in lens and kidney prompted our hypothesis that up -regulation in brain might similarly be protective. Established cell lines for astroglia (1321N1) and neurons (SHSY5Y, differentiated with retinoic acid) were used to monitor changes in transcript levels for human AQPs (AQP0 to AQP12) in response to inflammation (simulated with 10-100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide [LPS], 24 h), and hypoxia (5 min N2, followed by 0 to 24 h normoxia). AQP transcripts up -regulated in both 1321N1 and SHSY5Y included AQP0, AQP1 and AQP11. Immunocytochemistry in 1321N1 cells confirmed protein expression for AQP0 and AQP11 in plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum; AQP11 increased 10 -fold after LPS and AQP0 increased 0.3 -fold. In SHSY5Y cells, AQP0 expression increased 0.2 -fold after 24 h LPS; AQP11 showed no appreciable change. Proposed peroxiporin roles were tested using melondialdehyde (MDA) assays to quantify lipid peroxidation levels after brief H2O2. Boosting peroxiporin expression by LPS pretreatment lowered subsequent H2O2-induced MDA responses (-50%) compared with controls; conversely small interfering RNA knockdown of AQP0 in 1321N1 increased lipid peroxidation (-17%) after H2O2, with a similar trend for AQP11 siRNA. Interventions that increase native brain peroxiporin activity are promising as new approaches to mitigate damage caused by aging and neurodegeneration.

AB  - The small-molecule drug, FTY720 (fingolimod), is a synthetic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) analogue currently used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in both adults and children. FTY720 can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and, over time, accumulate in lipid-rich areas of the central nervous system (CNS) by incorporating into phospholipid membranes. FTY720 has been shown to enhance cell membrane fluidity, which can modulate the functions of glial cells and neuronal populations involved in regulating behaviour. Moreover, direct modulation of S1P receptor-mediated lipid signalling by FTY720 can impact homeostatic CNS physiology, including neurotransmitter release probability, the biophysical properties of synaptic membranes, ion channel and transmembrane receptor kinetics, and synaptic plasticity mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate how chronic FTY720 treatment alters the lipid composition of CNS tissue in adolescent mice at a key stage of brain maturation. We focused on the hippocampus, a brain region known to be important for learning, memory, and the processing of sensory and emotional stimuli. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, we discovered that FTY720 increases the fatty acid chain length of hydroxy-phosphatidylcholine (PCOH) lipids in the mouse hippocampus. It also decreases PCOH monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and increases PCOH polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A total of 99 lipid species were up-regulated in the mouse hippocampus following 3 weeks of oral FTY720 exposure, whereas only 3 lipid species were down-regulated. FTY720 also modulated anxiety-like behaviours in young mice but did not affect spatial learning or memory formation. Our study presents a comprehensive overview of the lipid classes and lipid species that are altered in the hippocampus following chronic FTY720 exposure and provides novel insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms that may underlie the therapeutic or adverse effects of FTY720 in the central nervous system.

AB  - Many women risk unintended pregnancy because of medical contraindications or dissatisfaction with contraceptive methods, including real and perceived side effects associated with the use of exogenous hormones. We pursued direct vaginal delivery of sperm-binding monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can limit progressive sperm motility in the female reproductive tract as a strategy for effective nonhormonal contraception. Here, motivated by the greater agglutination potencies of polyvalent immunoglobulins but the bioprocessing ease and stability of immunoglobulin G (IgG), we engineered a panel of sperm-binding IgGs with 6 to 10 antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), isolated from a healthy immune-infertile woman against a unique surface antigen universally present on human sperm. These highly multivalent IgGs (HM-IgGs) were at least 10- to 16-fold more potent and faster at agglutinating sperm than the parent IgG while preserving the crystallizable fragment (Fc) of IgG that mediates trapping of individual spermatozoa in mucus. The increased potencies translated into effective (>99.9%) reduction of progressively motile sperm in the sheep vagina using as little as 33.g of the 10-Fab HM-IgG. HM-IgGs were produced at comparable yields and had identical thermal stability to the parent IgG, with greater homogeneity. HM-IgGs represent not only promising biologics for nonhormonal contraception but also a promising platform for engineering potent multivalent mAbs for other biomedical applications.

AB  - The host-pathogen interaction during meningitis can be investigated with blood-cerebrospinal-fluid-barrier (BCSFB) cell culture models. They are commonly handled under atmospheric oxygen conditions (19-21% O-2), although the physiological oxygen conditions are significantly lower in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (7-8% O-2). We aimed to characterize oxygen levels in a Streptococcus (S.) suis-infected BCSFB model with transmigrating neutrophils. A BCSFB model with human choroid plexus epithelial cells growing on transwell-filters was used. The upper "blood"-compartment was infected and blood-derived neutrophils were added. S. suis and neutrophils transmigrated through the BCSFB into the "CSF"-compartment. Here, oxygen and pH values were determined with the non-invasive SensorDish(R) reader. Slight orbital shaking improved the luminescence-based measurement technique for detecting free oxygen. In the non-infected BCSFB model, an oxygen value of 7% O-2 was determined. However, with S. suis and transmigrating neutrophils, the oxygen value significantly decreased to 2% O-2. The pH level decreased slightly in all groups. In conclusion, we characterized oxygen levels in the BCSFB model and demonstrated the oxygen consumption by cells and bacteria. Oxygen values in the non-infected BCSFB model are comparable to in vivo values determined in pigs in the CSF. Infection and transmigrating neutrophils decrease the oxygen value to lower values.

AB  - The role of scavengers, which consume the carcasses of predators along with predation of the prey, has been ignored in comparisons to herbivores and predators. It has now become a topic of high interest among researchers working with food-web systems of prey-predator interactions. The food-web considered in these works contains prey, predators, and scavengers as the third species. In this work, we attempt to study a food-web model of these species in the presence of the multiplicative Allee effect and harvesting. It is observed that this makes the model more complex in the form of multiple co-existing steady states. The conditions for the existence and local stability of all possible steady states of the proposed system are analyzed. The global stability of the steady state lying on the x-axis and the interior steady state have been discussed by choosing suitable Lyapunov functions. The existence conditions for saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations are derived analytically. The stability of Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions with respect to both Allee and harvesting constants is examined. It is also observed that multiple Hopf bifurcation thresholds occur for harvesting parameters in the case of two co-existing steady states, which indicates that the system may regain its stability. The proposed model is also studied beyond Hopf bifurcation thresholds, where we have observed that the model is capable of exhibiting period-doubling routes to chaos, which can be controlled by a suitable choice of Allee and harvesting parameters. The largest Lyapunov exponents and sensitivity to initial conditions are examined to ensure the chaotic nature of the system.

AB  - Environmental pollutants like PM2.5 contribute to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a contaminant sensor linked to tryptophan metabolites, is regulated by IL4I. However, how PM2.5 stimulation via IL4I1 influences AhR activation and CRS pathogenesis remains unclear. This study explored the IL4I1-AhR pathway in CRS using patient tissues, HNEpCs, and murine models. Methods included IHC, qRT-PCR, and WB under PM2.5 exposure, with further investigation into downstream effects on CYP1B1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Significant upregulation of IL4I1, AhR, and CYP1B1 was observed in CRS tissues, with higher expression levels in CRS patients. Exposure to PM2.5 activated the IL4I1-AhR pathway, leading to decreased E-cadherin, increased N-cadherin and vimentin, and impaired nasal mucosal barrier function. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PM2.5-induced EMT in HNEpCs was mediated by IL4I1-dependent AhR activation. CH223191 reduced cell migration and EMT, while IL4I1 knockdown attenuated AhR activation and EMT marker expression. Murine models further confirmed that PM2.5 exacerbated nasal polyp formation and tissue remodeling via the IL4I1-AhR pathway. This study underscores the critical role of the IL4I1-AhR signaling pathway in PM2.5-induced nasal mucosal barrier dysfunction and EMT in CRS. IL4I1, as an upstream regulator of AhR, promotes EMT and nasal mucosal barrier disruption.

AB  - Neonatal diarrhea causes significant economic losses in swine production by reducing average daily weight gain (ADWG) and increasing piglet mortality, with Clostridioides difficile (CD) and Clostridium perfringens type A (CPA) being the most common causes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new commercial vaccine against these agents to minimize diarrhea, pre-weaning mortality, and its negative consequences on weight performance in suckling piglets under field conditions. The study consisted of two randomized, double-blind, negative-controlled field trials (Study A and B) focusing on clinically healthy pregnant sows from commercial pig farms experiencing recurrent neonatal diarrhea. In the meta-analysis of both farms, the control group showed lower performance compared to the vaccine group (least squares means differences) for ADWG (-14.5 g/day, p < 0.001), body weight (-0.33 kg, p < 0.001), and underweight piglets at weaning (6.94%, p = 0.011). The number of piglets with diarrhea (9.76%, p < 0.001) and the percentage of piglets treated with antibiotics for diarrhea (6.09%, p = 0.016) were lower in vaccinated animals compared to controls. No significant differences in pre-weaning mortality were observed. The results of this study suggest that the new commercial vaccine against CD and CPA reduces the incidence of neonatal diarrhea and the associated use of antibiotics, while positively impacts the growth performance of suckling piglets.

AB  - FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) belong to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily and are involved in a wide range of biological processes including protein folding, hormone signaling, plant growth, and stress responses. However, the FKBPs and their biological functions have not been identified in tea plants. In this study, 21 FKBP genes were identified using the conserved FK506-binding domain (PF00254) in the tea-plant genome. Their phylogeny, classification, structure, motifs, interactors, and expression patterns were analyzed. Comprehensive qRT-PCR analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of CsFKBPs in different tissues and in response to low temperature. Through a comprehensive genome-wide analysis, we characterized the low-temperature expression dynamics of the CsFKBP53 gene family and demonstrated that its overexpression significantly enhances cold tolerance in Arabidopsis. Notably, the transcript levels of CsFKBP53 exhibited pronounced variability across distinct tea (Camellia sinensis) cultivars under cold-stress conditions. These findings not only underscore the functional conservation of FKBP-type immunophilins across plant lineages but also highlight the biotechnological potential of CsFKBP53 as a genetic modulator of low-temperature resilience in crops. By integrating comparative genomics and functional validation, our study establishes a foundation for leveraging conserved stress-response mechanisms to engineer climate-resilient plants.

AB  - A large body of evidence implies the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). A deficiency of BDNF in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of BTBR mice (a model of autism) has been noted in a number of studies. Earlier, we showed that induction of BDNF overexpression in the hippocampus of BTBR mice reduced anxiety and severity of stereotyped behavior, but did not affect social interest. Here, we induced BDNF overexpression in the frontal cortex neurons of BTBR mice using an adeno-associated viral vector, which resulted in a significant increase in the social interest in the three-chamber social test. At the same time, the stereotypy, exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior, and novel object recognition were not affected. Therefore, we have shown for the first time that the presence of BDNF in the frontal cortex is critical for the expression of social interest in BTBR mice, since compensation for its deficiency in this structure eliminated the autism-like deficiencies in the social behavior characteristic for these animals.

AB  - Knockout of Mir125b-2 in mice leads to defects in hippocampus-related behaviors and affects hippocampal expression of Grin2a and NMDAR-mediated currents.
   Genomic imprinting predominantly occurs in the placenta and brain. Few imprinted microRNAs have been identified in the brain, and their functional roles in the brain are not clear. Here we show paternal, but not maternal, expression of MIR125B2 in human but not mouse brain. Moreover, Mir125b-2(m)(-)(/p)(-) mice showed impaired learning and memory, and anxiety, whose functions were hippocampus-dependent. Hippocampal granule cells from Mir125b-2(m)(-)(/p)(-) mice displayed increased neuronal excitability, increased excitatory synaptic transmission, and decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission. Glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A (Grin2a), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, was physically bound by miR-125b-2 and upregulated in the hippocampus of Mir125b-2(m)(-)(/p)(-) mice. Taken together, our findings demonstrate MIR125B2 imprinted in human but not mouse brain, mediated learning, memory, and anxiety, regulated excitability and synaptic transmission in hippocampal granule cells, and affected hippocampal expression of Grin2a. Our work provides functional mechanisms of a species-specific imprinted microRNA in the brain.

AB  - Goal of the current work was to conduct comparative analysis of the effects of acute and chronic lipopolysaccharide-induced stress on the behavior of rats in the Morris water maze test and on expression of mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines and BDNF in different brain structures. Relevance of this study is related to poor understanding of the effects of acute and chronic stress on manifestation of cognitive brain functions, as well as ambiguity of the literature data on the effects of both stresses on hypothalamic pituitary axis and expression of the proinflammatory cytokine genes. In the experiments with rats, acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced stress improved learning in the Morris water maze. For the period of learning, the rats under acute stress swam on average less distance to reach a hidden platform, spent less time in the peripheral zone of the pool (thigmotaxis), and had low speed compared to the control animals and to the group of rats under chronic LPS-induced stress. In the test without a platform in the pool there were no significant differences between the groups on the time spent in the platform quadrant and distance swum. Acute stress caused substantial increase of the TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA concentrations in the hippocampus and amygdala, but not in the frontal lobe in comparison with the control animals. Although chronic stress increased the levels of the TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA in the amygdala and hippocampus compared to the control groups, significance between the groups was only marginal and BDNF concentration did not differ from the control animals in any of the brain structures mentioned. Expression of the IL-6 mRNA only marginally increased in the amygdala of the animals under the acute LPS-induced stress and marginally decreased in the animals under chronic LPS stress in the hippocampus relative to the control groups. In total, the most pronounced molecular-biochemical changes occurred in the amygdala and hippocampus, where increase of the expression of the TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta interleukins mRNAs were observed in the animals under acute and chronic LPS-induced stress and no changes in the BDNF mRNA concentration were observed in the frontal lobe.

AB  - Systemic injection with lipopolysaccharide can lead to depressive-like behavior in experimental animals by inducing neuroinflammation and is considered to be a classic model of depression. S-equol is a major metabolite of dietary soy isoflavones with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and it has many beneficial effects on human health, including alleviation of menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, cancer, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive dysfunction. A recent study reported that S-equol inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neuroinflammation in astrocytes. However, there is no research on the antidepressant-like effects of S-equol. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of S-equol in a lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model in mice and explore its underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that treatment with S-equol (10, 20 and 40 mg kg(-1)) for 19 days markedly reversed the behavior of acute LPS (1.0 mg kg(-1)) treated mice in sucrose preference, tail suspension and forced swimming tests, exerting antidepressant-like effects. In addition, S-equol administration significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-1 beta), increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine, and normalized the release of tryptophan and kynurenine in the hippocampi of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with S-equol significantly up-regulated the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins (phospho synapsin, synapsin, postsynaptic density-95) and down-regulated the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway in the hippocampi of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. These findings demonstrated that S-equol significantly alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by acute systemic injection of LPS, and its antidepressant action was related to mediation of neuroinflammation via the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, normalization of the monoamine neurotransmitter levels, reversal of tryptophan metabolism dysfunction, and enhancement of synaptic plasticity. The current study provides insight into the potential of S-equol in the prevention of depression.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection elicits both protein and lipid antigen-specific T cell responses. However, the incorporation of lipid antigens into subunit vaccine strategies and formulations has been underexplored, and the characteristics of vaccine-induced Mtb lipid-specific memory T cells have remained elusive. Mycolic acid (MA), a major lipid component of the Mtb cell wall, is presented by human CD1b molecules to unconventional T cell subsets. These MA-specific CD1b-restricted T cells have been detected in the blood and disease sites of Mtb-infected individuals, suggesting that MA is a promising lipid antigen for incorporation into multicomponent subunit vaccines. In this study, we utilized the enhanced stability of bicontinuous nanospheres (BCN) to efficiently encapsulate MA for in vivo delivery to MA-specific T cells, both alone and in combination with an immunodominant Mtb protein antigen (Ag85B). Pulmonary administration of MA-loaded BCN (MA-BCN) elicited MA-specific T cell responses in humanized CD1 transgenic mice. Simultaneous delivery of MA and Ag85B within BCN activated both MA- and Ag85B-specific T cells. Notably, pulmonary vaccination with MA-Ag85B-BCN resulted in the persistence of MA, but not Ag85B, within alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vaccination of MA-BCN through intravenous or subcutaneous route, or with attenuated Mtb likewise reproduced MA persistence. Moreover, MA-specific T cells in MA-BCN-vaccinated mice differentiated into a T follicular helper-like phenotype. Overall, the BCN platform allows for the dual encapsulation and in vivo activation of lipid and protein antigen-specific T cells and leads to persistent lipid depots that could offer long-lasting immune responses.

AB  - The bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are attracting attention due to their promising applications in food and pharmaceuticals fields. Hence, a LAB strain, GCNRC_GA15, was isolated from Egyptian goat cheese, and molecularly identified as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. This strain showed a wide antimicrobial spectrum, which was found to be of proteineous nature, suggesting that L. plantarum GCNRC_GA15 is a bacteriocin-producer. This bacteriocin (bacteriocin GA15) was partially purified using cation exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis for the fraction showing bacteriocin activity has estimated the molecular mass to be 4369 Da. Furthermore, amino acid sequencing of this peptide has detected 34 amino acids, and comparing its amino acid sequence with those of some pediocin-like bacteriocins revealed that bacteriocin GA15 has the conserved sequence (YYGNGV/L) in its N-terminal region which identified bacteriocin GA15 as a pediocin-like bacteriocin. Bacteriocin GA15 showed good heat and pH stabilities, and its activity was enhanced after treatment with Tween 80 or Triton X-100. Bacteriocin production medium was statistically optimized using the Plackett-Burman and Central Composite designs. As a result, bacteriocin production increased from 800 to 12,800 AU/ml using the optimized medium in comparison with result recorded for the un-optimized medium.

AB  - Paraquat (PQ) is a nonselective herbicide that induces oxidative reactions and multiple-organ failure on exposure. Crocin, a carotenoid obtained from saffron, has demonstrated many therapeutic effects against neural conditions because of its antioxidant properties. In this study, 30 male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups to evaluate the protective effects of crocin and crocin-loaded niosomes (NC) against PQ in the brain. The levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total thiol groups (TTG), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity were measured as the markers of redox status. Histopathological changes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were evaluated by cresyl violet staining. Results indicated that both crocin and NC were able to attenuate the adverse effects of PQ at the histopathological level, which was following the changes in LPO (P < 0.0001), TAC (P < 0.01), and TTG (P < 0.05) level. The activity of CAT (P < 0.01) and SOD (P < 0.01) could be restored either by crocin or NC. Also, results indicated that nanoformulation of crocin in niosomes appears to be more promising. In conclusion, both crocin and NC showed favourable effects of PQ in the brain of rats, and were determined to be excellent agents to prevent acute toxicities of PQ. Furthermore, these two compounds can be known to provide neuroprotection.

AB  - This study showcases the application of an integrated workflow of molecular networking chemical profiling (GNPS), together with miniaturized microbioreactor cultivation profiling (MATRIX) to successfully detect, dereplicate, prioritize, optimize the production, isolate, characterize, and identify a diverse selection of new chemically labile natural products from the Queensland sheep pasture soil-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. CMB-MRF324. More specifically, we report the new tryptamine enamino tripeptide aspergillamides E-F (7-8), dihydroquinoline-2-one aflaquinolones H-I (11-12), and prenylated phenylbutyrolactone aspulvinone Y (14), along with an array of known co-metabolites, including asterriquinones SU5228 (9) and CT5 (10), terrecyclic acid A (13), and aspulvinones N-CR (15), B (16), D (17), and H (18). Structure elucidation was achieved by a combination of detailed spectroscopic and chemical analysis, biosynthetic considerations, and in the case of 11, an X-ray crystallographic analysis.

AB  - We previously found that chronic adenosine A1 receptor stimulation with N6-Cyclopentyladenosine increased alpha-synuclein misfolding and neurodegeneration in a novel alpha-synucleinopathy model, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Here, we aimed to synthesize a dimer caffeine-indan linked by a 6-carbon chain to cross the blood-brain barrier and tested its ability to bind alpha-synuclein, reducing misfolding, behavioral abnormalities, and neurodegeneration in our rodent model. Behavioral tests and histological stains assessed neuroprotective effects of the dimer compound. A rapid synthesis of the F-18-labeled analogue enabled Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography imaging for biodistribution measurement. Molecular docking analysis showed that the dimer binds to alpha-synuclein N- and C-termini and the non-amyloid-beta-component (NAC) domain, similar to 1-aminoindan, and this binding promotes a neuroprotective alpha-synuclein "loop" conformation. The dimer also binds to the orthosteric binding site for adenosine within the adenosine A1 receptor. Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging showed the dimer abolished alpha-synuclein upregulation and aggregation in the substantia nigra and hippocampus, and the dimer mitigated cognitive deficits, anxiety, despair, and motor abnormalities. The F-18-labeled dimer remained stable post-injection and distributed in various organs, notably in the brain, suggesting its potential as a Positron Emission Tomography tracer for alpha-synuclein and adenosine A1 receptor in Parkinson's disease therapy.

AB  - Virus-like particles (VLPs) are emerging as nanoscaffolds in a variety of biomedical applications including delivery of vaccine antigens and cargo such as mRNA to mucosal surfaces. These soft, colloidal, and proteinaceous structures (capsids) are nevertheless susceptible to mucosal environmental stress factors. We cross-linked multiple capsid surface amino acid residues using homobifunctional polyethylene glycol tethers to improve the persistence and survival of the capsid to model mucosal stressors. Surface cross-linking enhanced the stability of VLPs assembled from Acinetobacter phage AP205 coat proteins in low pH (down to pH 4.0) and high protease concentration conditions (namely, in pig and mouse gastric fluids). Additionally, it increased the stiffness of VLPs under local mechanical indentation applied using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip. Small angle X-ray scattering revealed an increase in capsid diameter after cross-linking and an increase in capsid shell thickness with the length of the PEG cross-linkers. Moreover, surface cross-linking had no effect on the VLPs' mucus translocation and accumulation on the epithelium of in vitro 3D human nasal epithelial tissues with mucociliary clearance. Finally, it did not compromise VLPs' function as vaccines in mouse subcutaneous vaccination models. Compared to PEGylation without cross-linking, the stiffness of surface cross-linked VLPs were higher for the same length of the PEG molecule, and also the lifetimes of surface cross-linked VLPs were longer in the gastric fluids. Surface cross-linking using macromolecular tethers, but not simple conjugation of these molecules, thus offers a viable means to enhance the resilience and survival of VLPs for mucosal applications.

AB  - L-lysine (L-Lys) is the first-limiting amino acid in swine nutrition, but free-form supplements exhibit poor intestinal absorption, reducing their bioavailability. This study aimed to enhance the gastric retention, controlled intestinal release, and systemic availability of L-Lys by optimizing solid lipid microcapsules (SLMs). SLMs were formulated using hydrogenated triglycerides (C16:0 or C18:1), free fatty acids, and varying emulsifier concentrations. Gastric retention and intestinal release were evaluated in vitro under simulated gastrointestinal conditions (a pepsin buffer at pH 5.0 for 2 h, followed by a pancreatin buffer at pH 6.5 for up to 8 h at 39 degrees C). SLMs with hydrogenated triglycerides showed significantly higher gastric retention (94-95%) than those with free fatty acids (48%). Specifically, C16:0 triglyceride-based SLMs achieved 74% intestinal release, which was enhanced to 90% with 1% emulsifier. This refined formulation was subsequently evaluated in vivo using weaned pigs (three groups; n = 4) fed a basal cornmeal diet. The treatments included a single oral administration of saline solution (placebo), free L-Lys (0.17 g/kg BW), or L-Lys SLMs (0.38 g/kg BW, equally providing L-Lys at 0.17 g/kg BW). The SLMs delayed the L-Lys plasma peak (T. max. 3-4 h vs. 1 h) and significantly increased the total L-Lys amount in the plasma over 24 h, demonstrating the enhanced relative bioavailability of encapsulated L-Lys.

AB  - Drought has become an important environmental stress limiting the growth and development of Camellia sinensis due to its moisture-loving and temperature-tolerant nature. ABA-response element binding factor (ABFs) is a key transcriptional regulator in the ABA signaling pathway that regulates plant responses to hormones and adversity. However, their roles and regulatory mechanisms in tea tree remain unknown. To investigate the drought response in Camellia sinensis, drought-sensitive (Fuyun No.6, FY) and drought-tolerant (Taicha No.12, TC) tea cultivars were treated with exogenous PEG and ABA and subjected to non-targeted metabolomics by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Triple Quadrupole tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-Q TRAP-MS/MS). The bioactive carbohydrates galactinol and raffinose were identified as potential drought regulators. Analysis of transcriptomics data identified potential drought tolerant target genes, namely CsGolS1/2, encoding galactinol synthases, CsRaf6, a raffinose synthase, and CsABF8, a transcriptional regulator in the ABA-response element binding factor family. The tea CsSnRK2.8-CsABF8-CsGolS1/CsGolS2/CsRaf6 regulatory module induced in response to drought stress was constructed using multiple molecular validation tools. This preliminary analysis of the molecular mechanism by which CsABF8, a regulator on the ABA signaling pathway, mediates the differences in drought tolerance in different tea cultivars provides a theoretical basis for the selection and breeding of drought-resistant varieties.

AB  - To achieve a durable, rigid, and lightweight construction material, a new class of Camellia sinensis/Ananas comosus fiber-enhanced corrugated sandwich panel was designed and produced. The crushed core layer comprises sinusoidal corrugation and is manufactured by a method of mould pressing in an attempt to assess this material's sound absorption ability. In addition, the influence of airgap and micro perforation on sound absorption properties was investigated. The samples with a greater perforation ratio and air gap are found to have a noise reduction coefficient (NRC) of 0.745, which can be used to attenuate mid- and high-range frequencies in industrial environments.

AB  - Simple Summary Artificial insemination is a crucial technology for livestock producers world-wide. This technology has afforded producers access to premier genetics without having to physically own superior sires. The improvement of this technology can have a large impact on the livestock industry, especially those sectors of the industry which rely heavily on artificial insemination. This article will review ongoing improvements being made to artificial insemination and their potential impacts. Artificial insemination of livestock has been a staple technology for producers worldwide for over sixty years. This reproductive technology has allowed for the rapid improvement of livestock genetics, most notably in dairy cattle and pigs. This field has experienced continuous improvements over the last six decades. Though much work has been carried out to improve the efficiency of AI, there are still many areas which continue to experience improvement, including semen analysis procedures, sperm selection techniques, sperm sexing technologies, and semen storage methods. Additionally, the use of AI continues to grow in beef cattle, horses, and small ruminants as the technology continues to become more efficient and yield higher pregnancy rates. In this review, AI trends in the various livestock species as well as cutting edge improvements in the aforementioned areas will be discussed at length. Future work will continue to refine the protocols which are used for AI and continue to increase pregnancy rates within all livestock species.

AB  - The mechanisms of volatile anesthetic action remain among the most perplexing mysteries of medicine. Across phylogeny, volatile anesthetics selectively inhibit mitochondrial complex I, and they also depress presynaptic excitatory signaling. To explore how these effects are linked, we studied isoflurane effects on presynaptic vesicle cycling and ATP levels in hippocampal cultured neurons from wild-type and complex I mutant (Ndufs4(KO)) mice. To bypass complex I, we measured isoflurane effects on anesthetic sensitivity in mice expressing NADH dehydrogenase (NDi1). Endocytosis in physiologic concentrations of glucose was delayed by effective behavioral concentrations of isoflurane in both wild-type (tau [unexposed] 44.8 +/- 24.2 s; tau [exposed] 116.1 +/- 28.1 s; p < 0.01) and Ndufs4(KO) cultures (tau [unexposed] 67.6 +/- 16.0 s; tau [exposed] 128.4 +/- 42.9 s; p = 0.028). Increasing glucose, to enhance glycolysis and increase ATP production, led to maintenance of both ATP levels and endocytosis (tau [unexposed] 28.0 +/- 14.4; tau [exposed] 38.2 +/- 5.7; reducing glucose worsened ATP levels and depressed endocytosis (tau [unexposed] 85.4 +/- 69.3; tau [exposed] > 1,000; p < 0.001). The block in recycling occurred at the level of reuptake of synaptic vesicles into the presynaptic cell. Expression of NDi1 in wild-type mice caused behavioral resistance to isoflurane for tail clamp response (EC50 Ndi1(-) 1.27% +/- 0.14%; Ndi1(+) 1.55% +/- 0.13%) and halothane (EC50 Ndi1(-) 1.20% +/- 0.11%; Ndi1(+) 1.46%+/- 0.10%); expression of NDi1 in neurons improved hippocampal function, alleviated inhibition of presynaptic recycling, and increased ATP levels during isoflurane exposure. The clear alignment of cell culture data to in vivo phenotypes of both isoflurane-sensitive and -resistant mice indicates that inhibition of mitochondrial complex I is a primary mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics.

AB  - Mice lacking functional thyroid follicular cells, Pax8(-/-) mice, die early postnatally, making them suitable models for extreme hypothyroidism. We have previously obtained evidence in postnatal rat neurons, that a down-regulation of Na+-current density could explain the reduced excitability of the nervous system in hypothyroidism. If such a mechanism underlies the development of coma and death in severe hypothyroidism, Pax8(-/-) mice should show deficits in the expression of Na+ currents and potentially also in the expression of Na+/K+-ATPases, which are necessary to maintain low intracellular Na+ levels. We thus compared Na+ current densities in postnatal mice using the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration as well as the expression of three alpha and two beta-subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase in wild type versus Pax8(-/-) mice. Whereas the Na+ current density in hippocampal neurons from wild type mice was upregulated within the first postnatal week, the Na+ current density remained at a very low level in hippocampal neurons from Pax8(-/-) mice. Pax8(-/-) mice also showed significantly decreased protein expression levels of the catalytic alpha 1 and alpha 3 subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase as well as decreased levels of the beta 2 isoform, with no changes in the alpha 2 and beta 1 subunits.

AB  - Prodigiosin (PDG) is a bacterial metabolite with numerous biological and pharmaceutical properties. Exposure to aluminium is considered a root etiological factor in the pathological progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, in this investigation, we explored the neuroprotective potential of PDG against aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-mediated AD-like neurological alterations in rats. For this purpose, rats were gavaged either AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), PDG (300 mg/kg), or both for 42 days. As a result of the analyzes performed on the hippocampal tissue, it was observed that AlCl3 induced biochemical, molecular, and histopathological changes like those related to AD. PDG pre-treatment significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and restored the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin), and transmembrane protein (Na+/K+-ATPase). Furthermore, PDG boosted the hippocampal antioxidant capacity, as shown by the increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione contents. These findings were accompanied by decreases in malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. The antioxidant effect may promote the upregulation of the expression of antioxidant genes (Nrf2 and HO-1). Moreover, PDG exerted notable anti-inflammatory effects via the lessening of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, nuclear factor kappa B, and decreases in the gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. In addition, noteworthy decreases in pro-apoptotic (Bax and caspase-3) levels and increases in anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) biomarkers suggested an anti-apoptotic effect of PDG. In support, the hippocampal histological examination validated the aforementioned changes. To summarize, the promising neuromodulatory, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities of PDG establish it as a potent therapeutic option for AD.

AB  - In the peripheral nervous system, the activation of Sirtuin 1 can improve insulin resistance; however, the role played by Sirtuin 1 in the central nervous system remains unknown. In this study, rat models of diabetes mellitus were generated by a single injection of streptozotocin. At 8 weeks after streptozotocin injection, the Morris water maze test and western blot assays confirmed that the diabetic model rats had learning and memory deficits, insulin resistance, and Sirtuin 1 expression could be detected in the hippocampus. Insulin and the insulin receptor inhibitor S961 were intranasally administered to investigate the regulatory effects of insulin signaling on Sirtuin 1. The results showed that insulin administration improved the impaired cognitive function of diabetic model rats and increased the expression levels of phosphorylated insulin receptor, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1, and Sirtuin 1 in the hippocampus. Conversely, S961 administration resulted in more severe cognitive dysfunction and reduced the expression levels of phosphorylated insulin receptor, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1, and Sirtuin 1. The Sirtuin 1 activator SRT2104 and the inhibitor Sirtinol were injected into the lateral ventricle, which revealed that the activation of Sirtuin 1 increased the expression levels of target of rapamycin complex 1, phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Hippocampal dendritic length and spine density also increased in response to Sirtuin 1 activation. In contrast, Sirtinol decreased the expression levels of target of rapamycin complex 1, phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and damaged the dendritic structure. These findings suggest that the Sirtuin 1 signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance-related cognitive deficits in diabetic rats. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Welfare Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine (approval No. ZYFY201811207) in November 2018.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Saiga antelope horn (SAH) is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating hypertension with liver-yang hyperactivity syndrome (Gan-Yang-Shang-Kang, GYSK), that has a long history of clinical application and precise efficacy, but its mechanism and functional substances are still unknown. Based on the demand for alternative research on the rare and endangered SAH, the group designed and carried out the following studies. Aim of the study: The purpose of this research was to demonstrate the functional substances and mechanisms of SAH in the treatment of GYSK hypertension. Materials and methods: The GYSK-SHR model was constructed by administering a decoction of aconite to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Blood pressure (BP), behavioural tests related to GYSK, and pathological changes in the kidneys, heart and aorta were measured to investigate the effects of SAH on GYSK-SHRs. Proteomic analysis was used to identify the keratins and peptides of SAH. Moreover, network pharmacology and plasma metabolomics studies were carried out to reveal the mechanisms by which functional peptides in SAH regulate GYSK-hypertension. Results: SAH has a significant antihypertensive effect on GYSK hypertensive animals. It has also been proven to be effective in protecting the function and structural integrity of the kidneys, heart and aorta. Moreover, SAH improved the abnormalities of 31 plasma biomarkers in rats. By constructing a "biomarker-target-peptide" network, 10 functional peptides and two key targets were screened for antihypertensive effects of SAH. The results indicated that SAH may exert a therapeutic effect by re-establishing the imbalance of renin-angiotensin (RAS) system. Conclusions: Functional peptides from keratin contained in SAH are the main material basis for the treatment of GYSK-hypertension and exhibited the protective effect on the GYSK-SHR model through the RAS system.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Depression is a major mental disorder and it is currently recognized as the second-leading cause of disability worldwide. However, the therapeutic effect of antidepressants remains un-satisfactory. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used for centuries, including commonly-used complementary and alternative medical therapies for depression. Recent clinical trials have been carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of TCM, and to explore the mechanisms of action in relation to the treatment of depression.Aim of the study: To summarize frequently used TCM decoctions and Chinese patent medicines (CPM) for treating depression, review their clinical therapeutic effects in treating depressive disorders, consider their possible mechanisms, and characterize the relationships between their efficacy and mechanisms.Materials and methods: We performed a computerized literature search using the electronic databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases, with the keywords "depression", "traditional Chinese medicine decoction", "Chinese patent medi-cine", "application", "mechanism", and their combinations, from January 1, 2000 to August 8, 2022 (inclusive).Results: A total of 51 papers were identified. We reviewed studies on six each TCM decoctions and CPMs, which demonstrated their significant clinical efficacy for treating depression and examined their mechanisms of action. The anti-depressive effects were related to: 1) increased monoamine neurotransmitter levels, 2) inhibiting hy-peractivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, 3) regulating hippocampal neurons and neurotrophic factors, 4) regulating immune cytokines, 5) counteracting excitatory amino acid toxicity, and 6) regulating microbe-gut-brain axis function. Conclusion: TCM plays an increasingly important role in the management of depression by enhancing the ther-apeutic effects and alleviating the side effects of antidepressant chemicals.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum, Lingzhi), also known as "immortality mushroom" has been broadly used to improve health and longevity for thousands of years in Asia. G. lucidum and its spores have been used to promote health, based on its broad pharmacological and therapeutic activity. This species is recorded in Chinese traditional formula as a nootropic and has been suggested to improve cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about the nootropic effects and molecular mechanism of action of G. lucidum spores.
   Aim of the study: The present study investigated the protective effects of sporoderm-deficient Ganoderma lucidum spores (RGLS) against learning and memory impairments and its mechanism of action.
   Materials and methods: In the Morris water maze, the effects of RGLS on learning and memory impairments were evaluated in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease that was induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Changes in amyloid beta (A beta) expression, Tau expression and phosphorylation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus were evaluated by Western blot.
   Results: Treatment with RGLS (360 and 720 mg/kg) significantly enhanced memory in the rat model of STZ-induced sporadic Alzheimer's disease and reversed the STZ-induced increases in A beta expression and Tau protein expression and phosphorylation at Ser199, Ser202, and Ser396. The STZ-induced decreases in neurotrophic factors, including BDNF, TrkB and TrkB phosphorylation at Tyr816, were reversed by treatment with RGLS.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that RGLS prevented learning and memory impairments in the present rat model of STZ-induced sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and these effects depended on a decrease in A beta expression and Tau hyperphosphorylation and the modulation of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the hippocampus.

AB  - Current crop stress resistance research suggests that the prominent stimulants nanoselenium (NSe) and melatonin (MT) might improve tea safety, quality, and stress resistance induced by the widely used nonselective herbicide glufosinate (GLU). Their biofortification effects on tea growth, antioxidant activity, and secondary metabolism pathways response to GLU remain unclear. Here, NSe, MT, and their combination NSe-MT effectively reduced 26.6-50.9% GLU and its metabolites in tea seedlings, balanced the photosystem, enhanced antioxidant defenses, and optimized reactive oxygen species scavenging mechanisms. Further, GLU-induced inhibition of glutamine synthetase (11.2-34.0%), ammonium toxicity (55.0-64.7%), and nitrogen metabolism disorders were alleviated. Stimulants exhibited different preferences in the accumulation of l-theanine (8.4-47%), gamma-aminobutyric acid (10.3-41.7%), and catechins (13.1-73.1%, excluding ECG), thereby influencing tea quality. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses validated that NSe-MT had a more pronounced impact on tender tea leaves than individual stimulant treatments. All stimulants reduced GLU-induced excessive jasmonic acid (29.8-50.5%) production and signaling responses, revealing their significance in crop physiological activities under herbicide or nitrogen stress. The reduction in aromatic amino acids helped mitigate GLU's interference with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, leading to inhibited lignin production but enhanced nutritional flavonoid levels, such as catechins. NSe and NSe-MT demonstrated promising potential as herbicide safeners. These findings provided insights into GLU detoxification mechanisms in other nontarget crops as well.

AB  - The human neocortex has a cytoarchitecture composed of six layers with an intrinsic organization that relates to afferent and efferent pathways for a high functional specialization. Various histological, neurochemical, and connectional techniques have been used to study these cortical layers. Here, we explore the additional possibilities of swift ion beam and synchrotron radiation techniques to distinguish cellular layers based on the elemental distributions and areal density pattern in the human neocortex. Temporal cortex samples were obtained from two neurologically normal adult men (postmortem interval: 6-12 h). A cortical area of 500 x 500 mu m(2) was scanned by a 3 MeV proton beam for elemental composition and areal density measurements using particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE) and scanning transmission ion microscopy (STIM), respectively. Zinc showed higher values in cortical layers II and V, which needs a critical discussion. Furthermore, the areal density decreased in regions with a higher density of pyramidal neurons in layers III and V. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) revealed the cellular density with higher lateral resolution than STIM, but not enough to distinguish each cortical lamination border. Our data describe the practical results of these approaches employing both X-ray and ion-beam based techniques for the human cerebral cortex and its heterogeneous layers. These results add to the potential approaches and knowledge of the human neocortical gray matter in normal tissue to develop improvements and address further studies on pathological conditions.

AB  - Due to the high amount of carbon dioxide emission from conventional cement production, sustainable alternative cementitious materials are preferred in the construction sector. Earlier studies were focused only on the use of industrial by-products such as fly ash, slag and silica fume as alternative cementitious materials. A comprehensive review of the use of a wide range of agro-waste ashes is highly limited. Therefore, the present review focuses on the potential of several agro-waste ashes including sugarcane bagasse ash, rice husk ash, palm oil fuel ash, corncob ash, coconut shell ash, wood ash, groundnut husk ash, cassava peel ash, wheat straw ash, elephant grass ash, rice straw ash, sugarcane straw ash, tobacco ash and bamboo leaf ash as alternative cementitious materials in concrete. Physical, chemical and morphological characteristics of different agro-waste ashes and their influences in the blended cement concrete are presented. Besides, the effects of these agro-waste ashes on workability, strength, water absorption, sorptivity, porosity, permeability, drying shrinkage, resistance to acid and sulfate attacks of blended concretes are critically compared. Agro-waste ashes consist of silica content above 50% with the exception of tobacco ash and groundnut husk ash. Addition of the agro-waste ashes reduces the slump of concrete except for palm oil fuel ash, wheat straw ash and rice straw ash blended concretes. Significant reduction in the permeability and subsequent enhancement in the durability of agro-waste blended concretes are evidently witnessed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder) overlap in symptomatology, risk factors, genetics, and other biological measures. Based on previous findings, it remains unclear what transdiagnostic regional gray matter volume (GMV) alterations exist across these disorders, and with which factors they are associated. GMV (3-T magnetic resonance imaging) was compared between healthy controls (HC; n = 110), DSM-IV-TR diagnosed MDD (n = 110), BD (n = 110), and SSD patients (n = 110), matched for age and sex. We applied a conjunction analysis to identify shared GMV alterations across the disorders. To identify potential origins of identified GMV clusters, we associated them with early and current risk and protective factors, psychopathology, and neuropsychology, applying multiple regression models. Common to all diagnoses (vs. HC), we identified GMV reductions in the left hippocampus. This cluster was associated with the neuropsychology factor working memory/executive functioning, stressful life events, and with global assessment of functioning. Differential effects between groups were present in the left and right frontal operculae and left insula, with volume variances across groups highly overlapping. Our study is the first with a large, matched, transdiagnostic sample to yield shared GMV alterations in the left hippocampus across major mental disorders. The hippocampus is a major network hub, orchestrating a range of mental functions. Our findings underscore the need for a novel stratification of mental disorders, other than categorical diagnoses.

AB  - Owing to progressive aging in the population, there is an increase in patients with cognitive impairment. For the prevention of dementia, the use of plant remedies is relevant. Of particular interest is Klasea centauroides (L.) Cass. (Serratula centauroides L., Asteraceae), which has significant natural reserves, contains a wide range of biologically active substances, and is used in folk medicine to treat nervous system diseases. This study aimed to estimate the neuroprotective, energy-protective, and antioxidant effects of K. centauroides extract in cholinergic deficiency caused by long-term scopolamine administration. It has been established that K. centauroides extract accelerates passive avoidance-conditioned reflex development and ensures its preservation over a longer time period under cholinergic deficiency conditions. The K. centauroides extract increases the resistance of brain tissues to the toxic effects of scopolamine, reducing the number of neuron regressive forms in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The K. centauroides extract enhances the predominance of aerobic glycolysis over anaerobic glycolysis and enhances the NADH-dehydrogenase and succinate-dehydrogenase complexes activity, thus promoting more intensive ATP synthesis against this background, the introduction of scopolamine. The use of K. centauroides extracts reduces the malonic dialdehyde (MDA) content in the brain structures and increases the catalase (CAT) and antioxidant system glutathione unit activities.

AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases. It is urgent to unravel the pathogenesis of DLB and find potential therapeutic drugs. Here, we investigated the pharmacological effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 in A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic line M83 mice aged 4 months. The behavioral tests including Y-maze, Barnes maze, nest building and Rotarod showed that MCC950 significantly improved the cognitive dysfunction symptom without affecting the motor coordination after consecutive intragastric administration every day for 5 weeks. Furthermore, immunostaining or immunoblotting experiments on the hippocampal tissue were performed, and the results suggested that MCC950 not only inhibited the expression of NLRP3, and suppressed the activation of astrocytes and microglia, but also promoted the mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway to reduce human alpha-synuclein accumulation. Our findings further demonstrate that line M83 mice may be used as an animal model for DLB research, and can provide preclinical evidences for the development of MCC950 as a promising therapeutic drug.

AB  - Lipotoxicity is a recognized pathological trigger and accelerator of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the molecular basis of lipotoxicity-induced NASH remains elusive. Here, we systematically mapped the changes in hepatic transcriptomic landscapes in response to lipotoxic insults across multiple species. Conserved and robust activation of the arachidonic acid pathway, in particular the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) gene, was closely correlated with NASH severity in humans, macaques with spontaneously developed NASH, as well as swine and mouse dietary NASH models. Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, we found that ALOX12 markedly exacerbated NASH in both mice and Bama pig models. ALOX12 was shown to induce NASH by directly targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) via a lysosomal degradation mechanism. Overall, our findings reveal a key molecular driver of NASH pathogenesis and suggest that ALOX12-ACC1 interaction may be a therapeutic target in NASH.

AB  - Background and purpose: Although a large collection of data has shown that ginsenosides, the major active ingredients from Ginseng, have neuroprotective and anti-depressant effect, the mechanism of action is incompletely understood. This study aims to elucidate the antidepressant mechanism of ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), a poorly absorbed ginsenoside, from the perspective of gut microbe to brain signaling. Methods: A mouse model of depression was induced by unpredictable mild stress (UMS). Behavioral and neurochemical tests were conducted to evaluate the effect and mechanism of Rg1 on depressive behavior. Nontarget and target metabolomics were performed to identify the signaling metabolites underlying the antidepressant efficacy of Rg1. Gut microbial structure was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and the potential functional strains associated with Rg1 action were investigated by in vitro bacterial culture. Chemical intervention was used to explore the mechanism of Rg1 and signaling metabolite. Results: Rg1 improved UMS-induced despair, anxiety-like and social avoidance behaviors in mice, which were accompanied by increased hypothalamic oxytocin secretion and restored neural proliferation in the hippocampus. Metabolomic analysis of the gut-brain axis revealed that Rg1 increased the concentration of serum and brain indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a bacterial metabolite that was partially attributed to the enrichment of Lactobacillus murinus in the gut microbiome. Oral supplementation of IAA mimicked the anti-depressant action of Rg1, while oxytocin receptor antagonist abrogated the anti-depressant effects of both Rg1 and IAA. Conclusion: Our work provides a new gut-to-brain signaling mechanism for the antidepressant effects of Rg1. In particular, Rg1 enriches the abundance of Lactobacillus murinus, which in turn increases the level of brain IAA and potentiates hypothalamic oxytocin signal. These findings suggest a promising pathway for producing antidepressant effects through gut-brain crosstalk.

AB  - We evaluated the effectiveness of Scrophularia buergeriana extract (Brainon) on cognitive dysfunction and determined its underlying mechanisms in a scopolamine (SCO)-treated mouse model of memory impairment. Brainon treatment for 28 days ameliorated the symptoms of memory impairment as indicated by the results of both passive avoidance performance and the Morris water mazes. Brainon lowered acetylcholinesterase activity and raised acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus. The treatment elevated the protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding (CREB). Additionally, the excessive generation of SCO-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent oxidative stress were suppressed by the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1 and SOD-2 proteins. mRNA levels of upregulated interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, as well as the apoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) expression after SCO injection were downregulated by Brainon treatment. Collectively, these findings suggested that Brainon possesses anti-amnesic effects through the CREB-BDNF pathway. Moreover, it exerted antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects in SCO-induced mice exhibiting cognitive impairment and memory loss.

AB  - Humanized mouse models can be used to explore human gene regulatory elements (REs), which frequently lie in non-coding and less conserved genomic regions. Epigenetic modifications of gene REs, also in the context of gene x environment interactions, have not yet been explored in humanized mouse models. We applied high-accuracy measurement of DNA methylation (DNAm) via targeted bisulfite sequencing (HAM-TBS) to investigate DNAm in three tissues/brain regions (blood, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) of mice carrying the human FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, an important candidate gene associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders. We explored DNAm in three functional intronic glucocorticoid-responsive elements (at introns 2, 5, and 7) of FKBP5 at baseline, in cases of differing genotype (rs1360780 single nucleotide polymorphism), and following application of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We compared DNAm patterns in the humanized mouse (N = 58) to those in human peripheral blood (N = 447 and N = 89) and human postmortem brain prefrontal cortex (N = 86). Overall, DNAm patterns in the humanized mouse model seem to recapitulate DNAm patterns observed in human tissue. At baseline, this was to a higher extent in brain tissue. The animal model also recapitulated effects of dexamethasone on DNAm, especially in peripheral blood and to a lesser extent effects of genotype on DNAm. The humanized mouse model could thus assist in reverse translation of human findings in psychiatry that involve genetic and epigenetic regulation in non-coding elements.

AB  - Porcine models are frequently used for burn healing studies; however, factors including anatomic location and lack of standardised wound methods can impact the interpretation of wound data. The objectives of this study are to examine the influence of anatomical locations on the uniformity of burn creation and healing in porcine burn models. To optimise burn parameters on dorsal and ventral surfaces, ex vivo and in situ euthanized animals were first used to examine the location-dependence of the burn depth and contact time relationship. The location-dependent healing in vivo was then examined using burn and excisional wounds at dorsal, ventral, caudal and cranial locations. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and H&E were used to assess burn depth and wound re-epithelialization. We found that burn depth on the ventral skin was significantly deeper than that of the dorsal skin at identical thermal conditions. Compared with burns created ex vivo, burns created in situ immediately post-mortem were significantly deeper in the ventral location. In live animals, 2 out of 12 burn wounds were fully re-epithelialized after 14 days in contrast to complete re-epithelialization of all excisional wounds. Among the burn wounds, those at the cranial-dorsal site exhibited faster healing than at the caudal-dorsal site. This study showed that anatomical location is an important consideration for the consistency of burn depth creation and healing. These data support symmetric localization of treatment and control for comparative assessment of burn healing in porcine models to prevent misinterpretation of results and increase the translatability of findings to humans.

AB  - This research sought to assess the effects of dietary supplements with Gracilaria lichenoides and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, either individually or combined, on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal function of Penaeus monodon. A total of 840 shrimps were randomly assigned to 28 tanks with an average initial weight of (1.04 +/- 0.03) g (30 shrimp per tank) with 7 different treatment groups and 4 replicates per treatment. The control treatment (C) consisted of a basal diet; in contrast, the experimental groups were complement with varying levels of G. lichenoides (3% or 8%), either alone (S3 and S8) or in combination with B.amyloliquefaciens at different concentrations (3% G. lichenoides and 10(9) CFU/g-S3B9; 8% G. lichenoides and 10(11) CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens-S8B11; 10(9) CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens-S9; 10(11) CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens-B11). The results indicated that the maximum values of final body weight (FBW) (10.49 +/- 0.90) g, weight gain rate (WGR) (908.94 +/- 33.58) g, and specific growth rate (SGR) (4.20 +/- 0.06) g were perceived in the 3% G. lichenoide diet treatment, and compared with the control group, the difference was significant (p < 0.05). The whole-body lipid content of shrimp in the B9 group was significantly higher than that in the B11 group (p < 0.05), but no significant difference was observed when compared with shrimp fed other diets (p > 0.05). The ash content of shrimp in the B9 group was found to be significantly higher than that in the S3B9 group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the lipase activity in the stomach and intestines of the experimental groups exhibited a statistically significantly increase compared to the control (p < 0.05). In comparison to the control group, the hepatopancreas of the S3 group exhibited a significant increase in the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and antioxidant genes [SOD, catalase (CAT), GSH-Px, thioredoxin (Trx), Hippo, and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)] expression levels (p < 0.05). Additionally, the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), SOD, peroxidase (POD), and antioxidant genes (CAT, GSH-Px, Trx, and Hippo) in the S3B9 treatment of hepatopancreas showed significant improvement (p < 0.05). The inclusion of dietary G. lichenoides and B. amyloliquefaciens resulted in enhanced relative expression of intestinal lipid metabolism genes (fatty acid synthetase (FAS), lipophorin receptor (LR), fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1)) and suppressed the expression of the long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 (LCL4) gene. Analysis of microbiota sequencing indicated improvements in composition and structure, with notable increases in Firmicutes at the phylum level and Vibrio at the genus level in the S3 group, as well as an increase in Tenericutes at the genus level in the S8B11 group. Overall, the inclusion of dietary G. lichenoides and B. amyloliquefaciens positively impacted the growth, antioxidant capacity, and microbial composition of shrimp, with particular enhancement observed in shrimp fed a supplementary 3% G. lichenoides diet.

AB  - The subiculum is positioned at a critical juncture at the interface of the hippocampus with the rest of the brain. However, the exact roles of the subiculum in most hippocampal-dependent memory tasks remain largely unknown. One obstacle to make comparisons of neural firing patterns between the subiculum and hippocampus is the broad firing fields of the subicular cells. Here, we used spiking phases in relation to theta rhythm to parse the broad firing field of a subicular neuron into multiple subfields to find the unique functional contribution of the subiculum while male rats performed a hippocampal-dependent visual scene memory task. Some of the broad firing fields of the subicular neurons were successfully divided into multiple subfields similar to those in the CA1 by using the theta phase precession cycle. The new paradigm significantly improved the detection of task-relevant information in subicular cells without affecting the information content represented by CA1 cells. Notably, we found that multiple fields of a single subicular neuron, unlike those in the CA1, carried heterogeneous task-related information such as visual context and choice response. Our findings suggest that the subicular cells integrate multiple task-related factors by using theta rhythm to associate environmental context with action.

AB  - Follicular ovarian cysts (FOCs) are characterized by follicles in the ovaries that are >20 mm in diameter and persist for >10 days without the corpus luteum, leading to anovulation, dysregulation of folliculogenesis and subfertility in humans and livestock species. Despite their clinical significance, the precise impact of FOCs on oocyte reserve, maturation, and quality still needs to be explored. While FOCs are observed in both human and livestock populations, they are notably prevalent in livestock species. Consequently, livestock species serve as valuable models for investigating the molecular intricacies of FOCs. Thus, in this study, using goat FOCs, we performed integrated proteomic, metabolomic and functional analyses to demonstrate that oocyte maturation hampered due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in FOCs follicular fluid (FF) via downregulation of glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), a critical antioxidant seleno enzyme required to negate oxidative stress. Notably, GPX1 reduction was positively correlated with the FF's decline of free selenium and selenocysteine metabolic enzymes, O-phosphoryl-tRNA (Sec) selenium transferase (SEPSECS) and selenocysteine lyase (SCLY) levels. Adding GPX1, selenocysteine, or selenium to the culture media rescued the oocyte maturation abnormalities caused by FOCs FF by down-regulating the ROS. Additionally, we demonstrate that substituting GPX1 regulator, Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) in the in vitro maturation media improved the oocyte maturation in the cystic FF by down-regulating the ROS activity via suppressing Non-sense-mediated decay (NMD) of GPX1. In contrast, inhibition of IGF-1R and the target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) hampered the oocyte maturation via NMD up-regulation. These findings imply that the GPX1 regulation via selenocysteine metabolism and the IGF-1mediated NMD may be critical for the redox homeostasis of FF. We propose that GPX1 enhancers hold promise as therapeutics for enhancing the competence of FOCs oocytes. However, further in vivo studies are necessary to validate these findings observed in vitro.

AB  - Psychiatric and neurological symptoms, as well as cognitive deficits, represent a prominent phenotype associated with variable forms of autoimmune encephalitis, regardless of the neurotransmitter receptor targeted by autoantibodies. The mechanistic underpinnings of these shared major neuropsychiatric symptoms remain however unclear. Here, we investigate the impacts of patient-derived monoclonal autoantibodies against the glutamatergic NMDAR (NMDAR mAb) and inhibitory GABAaR (GABAaR mAb) signalling in the hippocampal network. Unexpectedly, both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic receptor membrane dynamics, content and transmissions are altered by NMDAR or GABAaR mAb, irrespective of the affinity or antagonistic effect of the autoantibodies. The effect of NMDAR mAb on inhibitory synapses and GABAaR mAb on excitatory synapses requires neuronal activity and involves protein kinase signalling. At the cell level, both autoantibodies increase the excitation/inhibition balance of principal cell inputs. Furthermore, NMDAR or GABAaR mAb leads to hyperactivation of hippocampal networks through distinct alterations of principal cell and interneuron properties. Thus, autoantibodies targeting excitatory NMDAR or inhibitory GABAaR trigger convergent network dysfunctions through a combination of shared and distinct mechanisms.
   Patient-derived autoantibodies against the NMDA or GABAa receptor similarly alter the excitation/inhibition balance of principal hippocampal neurons. This shared pathological effect is triggered by similar and distinct mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels.Patient-derived monoclonal autoantibodies against the NMDA (NMDAR mAb) or GABAa receptors (GABAaR mAb) alter both glutamatergic and GABAa receptor surface diffusion and synaptic transmissions in an activity- and protein kinase-dependent manner. At principal CA1 neurons, both NMDAR and GABAa mAbs increase the excitation/inhibition balance of inputs. NMDAR or GABAaR mAb triggers a hyperactivation of hippocampal networks through distinct alterations of principal cell and interneuron properties.

AB  - RAC1 encodes a Rho family small GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization and intracellular signaling pathways. Pathogenic RAC1 variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder with diverse phenotypic manifestations, including abnormalities in brain size and facial dysmorphism. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Here, we present the case of a school-aged male who exhibited global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and acquired microcephaly. Through whole exome sequencing, we identified a novel de novo variant in RAC1, (NM_006908.5): c.92 A > G,p.(E31G). We then examined the pathophysiological significance of the p.E31G variant by focusing on brain development. Biochemical analyses revealed that the recombinant RAC1-E31G had no discernible impact on the intrinsic GDP/ GTP exchange activity. However, it exhibited a slight inhibitory effect on GTP hydrolysis. Conversely, it demonstrated a typical response to both a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor and a GTPase-activating protein. In transient expression analyses using COS7 cells, RAC1-E31G exhibited minimal interaction with the downstream effector PAK1, even in its GTP-bound state. Additionally, overexpression of RAC1-E31G was observed to exert a weak inhibitory effect on the differentiation of primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Moreover, in vivo studies employing in utero electroporation revealed that acute expression of RAC1-E31G resulted in impairments in axonal elongation and dendritic arborization in the young adult stage. These findings suggest that the p.E31G variant functions as a dominant-negative version in the PAK1-mediated signaling pathway and is responsible for the clinical features observed in the patient under investigation, namely microcephaly and intellectual disability.

AB  - The prevalence of obesity increases alarmingly every year mostly due to external factors such as high-fat and high-refined sugar intake associated with a sedentary lifestyle. It triggers metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, hyperlipemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of a combined intervention with caloric restriction, nutraceutical intake, and a mixed training protocol on oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut dysbiosis derived from the development of obesity in a C57BL6/J mouse experimental model of diet-induced obesity (4.6 Kcal/g diet, 45% Kcal as fat, and 20% fructose in the drinking fluid). The nutraceutical was formulated with ethanolic extracts of Argania spinosa pulp (10%) and Camelina sativa seeds (10%) and with protein hydrolysates from Psoralea corylifolia seeds (40%) and Spirodela polyrhiza whole plants (40%). The combination of nutraceutical and exercise decreased the animals' body weights and inflammatory markers (TNF alpha, IL-6, and resistin) in plasma, while increasing gene expression of cat, sod2, gsta2, and nqo1 in the liver. Obese animals showed lower beta-diversity of microbiota and a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio vs. normocaloric controls that were reversed by all interventions implemented. Dietary inclusion of a nutraceutical with high antioxidant potential combined with an exercise protocol can be beneficial for bodyweight control and improvement of metabolic status in patients undergoing obesity treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Maternal vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Here we explored the mechanism through which VDD induced IUGR.Methods: Female SD rats were fed a control normal diet (VD > 800 IU/Kg) or VDD diet (VD: 0 IU/Kg) for 8 weeks. Then, females were mated with 12-week-old male SD rats, and fetal and placental tissue were collected on the gestational day 13 (GD13) or 18 (GD18) to analyze the effects of VDD on pregnancy outcome and embryonic development. In vitro, the VDR gene of HTR-8/SVneo cells was knocked down to establish VDD model. Then, HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with the MST1/2 inhibitor XMU-MP-1 or 0.1 mu M/L calcitriol for 24 h (h). The mechanism of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in VDD-induced placental dysplasia was further investigated by western blot, invasion assay, wound healing assay and Hoechst/PI staining. Results: The IUGR of the pregnant rats in the VDD group was significant, the placental structure and function were damaged, and there was an obvious inflammatory response, accompanied by a significant increase in the level of the transcription co-activator YAP phosphorylation. In vitro, VDD significantly inhibited the migratory and invasive abilities of HTR-8/SVneo cells, accompanied by decreased EMT capacity and increased apoptosis. When intervening with XMU-MP-1 in advance, we found that the effects of VDD were neutralized by Hippo-YAP signaling blocker.Discussion: Maternal VDD causes placental dysplasia and IUGR, and these abnormal changes may be associated with the activation of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.

AB  - A biological invasion of the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) to the island of Oahu was discovered in late 2013, posing a threat to palm trees on the island and potential for accidental export to other Hawaiian Islands and sub-tropical palm growing regions of California and Florida. Delineation of populations by physical trapping in remote, undeveloped areas is a critical part of the program for containment and eradication. Continuous surveillance near ports of entry is especially important to eliminate incipient populations rapidly and mitigate the risk of human-assisted transport. Traditional trap monitoring for the CRB is labor-intensive, costly, and temporally inadequate. We have developed an autonomous trap surveillance system framework using electronic sensors and front and backend remote cloud systems for monitoring the CRB trap contents. The customized surveillance system incorporates a camera and digital microphone, and communicates data through a cellular network using Category-M (CAT-M) Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) with an integrated GNSS chip for precise geolocation of catches. Hourly monitoring data from early deployments of the system have demonstrated that adult CRB have a crepuscular behavior, with over two-thirds of catches occurring after sunset within three hours of twilight, and fewer than 1% occurring unambiguously during daylight. The system represents a significant advance for trap monitoring, and can prove valuable for identifying biological behaviors that might be exploited for more effective control.

AB  - This study looks at how incorporating nanofiller into sisal/flax-fibre-reinforced epoxy-based hybrid composites affects their mechanical and water absorption properties. The green Al2O3 NPs are generated from neem leaves in a proportion of leaf extract to an acceptable aluminium nitrate combination. Both natural fibres were treated with different proportions of NaOH to eliminate moisture absorption. The following parameters were chosen as essential to achieving the objectives mentioned above: (i) 0, 5, 10, and 15% natural fibre concentrations; (ii) 0, 2, 4, and 6% aluminium powder concentrations; and (iii) 0, 1, 3, and 5% NaOH concentrations. Compression moulding was used to create the hybrid nanocomposites and ASTM standards were used for mechanical testing such as tension, bending, and impact. The findings reveal that combining sisal/flax fibre composites with nanofiller improved the mechanical features of the nanocomposite. The sisal and flax fibre hybridised successfully, with 10% fibres and 4% aluminium filler. The water absorption of the hybrids rose as the fibre weight % increased, and during the next 60 h, all of the specimens achieved equilibrium. The failed samples were examined using scanning electron Microscopic (SEM) images better to understand the composite's failure in the mechanical experimentations. Al2O3 NPs were confirmed through XRD, UV spectroscope and HPLC analysis. According to the HPLC results, the leaf's overall concentrations of flavonoids (gallocatechin, carnosic acid, and camellia) are determined to be 0.250 mg/g, 0.264 mg/g, and 0.552 mg/g, respectively. The catechin concentration is higher than the phenolic and caffeic acid levels, which could have resulted in a faster rate of reduction among many of the varying configurations, 4 wt.% nano Al2O3 particle, 10 wt.% flax and sisal fibres, as well as 4 h of NaOH with a 5 wt.% concentration, producing the maximum mechanical properties (59.94 MPa tension, 149.52 Mpa bending, and 37.9 KJ/m(2) impact resistance). According to the results, it can be concluded that botanical nutrients may be used effectively in the manufacturing of nanomaterials, which might be used in various therapeutic and nanoscale applications.

AB  - Exposure to an acute stressor triggers a complex cascade of neurochemical events in the brain. However, deciphering their individual impact on stress-induced molecular changes remains a major challenge. Here, we combine RNA sequencing with selective pharmacological, chemogenetic, and optogenetic manipulations to isolate the contribution of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system to the acute stress response in mice. We reveal that NA release during stress exposure regulates a large and reproducible set of genes in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus via beta-adrenergic receptors. For a smaller subset of these genes, we show that NA release triggered by LC stimulation is sufficient to mimic the stress-induced transcriptional response. We observe these effects in both sexes, and independent of the pattern and frequency of LC activation. Using a retrograde optogenetic approach, we demonstrate that hippocampus-projecting LC neurons directly regulate hippocampal gene expression. Overall, a highly selective set of astrocyte-enriched genes emerges as key targets of LC-NA activation, most prominently several subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3d, Ppp1r3g) and type II iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2). These results highlight the importance of astrocytic energy metabolism and thyroid hormone signaling in LC-mediated hippocampal function and offer new molecular targets for understanding how NA impacts brain function in health and disease.

AB  - Inadequate hygienic conditions and poor handling are the primary causes of contamination in abattoirs. This study aimed to identify and molecularly detect pathogenic bacteria in sheep meat at slaughterhouses in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the study evaluated the sensitivity of these bacteria to various antimicrobials. In total, 150 samples were collected three times every two months from November 2021 to March 2022 from four abattoirs located in the south, west, east, and north of Riyadh. Pathogenic bacteria were separated using selective media, and the Vitek 2 system was utilized to identify all species and test their response to antibiotics. PCR was employed to detect virulence genes. The four pathogenic bacteria identified in all samples were Escherichia coli (12%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.3%), Salmonella enterica (7.3%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6%). Abattoir D had a high number of bacteria isolated in January. K. pneumoniae and S. enterica exhibited resistance to ampicillin. S. enterica also demonstrated resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. P. aeruginosa was resistant to tigecycline. PCR results indicated positive tests for the E. coli gene FimH, the P. aeruginosa genes plcH and toxA, and the K. pneumoniae gene mrkD. Pathogenic bacteria with positive results for virulence genes have the potential to cause contamination and human diseases. To improve quality and reduce contamination, the government must address the issue of providing adequate and safe water for activities in all abattoirs in Riyadh City.

AB  - Objectives Drosophila melanogaster has become an excellent model organism to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying tumour progression. Here, by using well-established Drosophila tumour models, we identified Toll-7 as a novel regulator of tumour growth and invasion. Materials and methods Transgenic flies and genetic epistasis analysis were used. All flies were raised on a standard cornmeal and agar medium at 25 degrees C unless otherwise indicated. Immunostaining and RT-qPCR were performed by standard procedures. Images were taken by OLYMPUS BX51 microscope and Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. Adobe Photoshop 2020 and Zeiss Zen were used to analyse the images. All results were presented in Scatter plots or Column bar graphs created by GraphPad Prism 8.0. Results Loss of Toll-7 suppresses Ras(V12)/lgl(-/-)-induced tumour growth and invasion, as well as cell polarity disruption-induced invasive cell migration, whereas expression of a constitutively active allele of Toll-7 is sufficient to promote tumorous growth and cell migration. In addition, the Egr-JNK signalling is necessary and sufficient for Toll-7-induced invasive cell migration. Mechanistically, Toll-7 facilitates the endocytosis of Egr, which is known to activate JNK in the early endosomes. Moreover, Toll-7 activates the EGFR-Ras signalling, which cooperates with the Egr-JNK signalling to promote Yki-mediated cell proliferation and tissue overgrowth. Finally, Toll-7 is necessary and sufficient for the proper maintenance of EGFR protein level. Conclusions Our findings characterized Toll-7 as a proto-oncogene that promotes tumour growth and invasion in Drosophila, which shed light on the pro-tumour function of mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs).

AB  - Simple Summary The infrequent northward migration of wild Asian elephants in Xishuangbanna, China, has attracted global attention due to its rarity. Elephant migration is a complex ecological process, and the factors driving this long-distance migration remain the subject of ongoing research. In this study, by comparing the diets and fecal metagenomes of breastfed elephant calves, captive elephants, and their wild counterparts, we revealed that wild elephants exhibit a preference for crops and grains with a low fiber content. Furthermore, their gastrointestinal tracts harbor distinct microbial communities, functional hydrolases, and metabolic pathways tailored for processing these foods. These findings suggest that wild elephants have adapted to favor a low-fiber diet. This dietary preference, shaped by their unique gut microbiota, provides a significant explanation for the uncommon long-distance migration observed in wild Asian elephants.Abstract The rare northward migration of wild Asian elephants in Xishuangbanna, China, has attracted global attention. Elephant migration is a complex ecological process, and the factors driving this long-distance migration remain elusive. In this study, fresh fecal samples were collected from both captive and wild Asian elephants, along with breastfed calves residing within the Wild Elephant Valley of Xishuangbanna. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between diet, gut microbiota, and migration patterns in Asian elephants through comprehensive metagenomic sequencing analyses. Among the breastfed Asian elephant group, Bacteroidales and Escherichia emerged as the dominant bacterial taxa, while the primary carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) enriched in this group were GH2, GH20, GH92, GH97, GH38, GH23, and GH43, aligning with their dietary source, namely breast milk. The bacterial taxa enriched in captive Asian elephants (CAEs) were mainly Butyrivibrio, Treponema, and Fibrobacter, and the enriched lignocellulose-degrading enzymes mainly included GH25, GH10, GH9, and cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4). These findings are consistent with the high-fiber diet of captive elephants. In contrast, the main bacterial taxa enriched in wild Asian elephants (WAEs) were Ruminococcus and Eubacterium, and the enriched CAZymes included GH109, GH20, GH33, GH28, GH106, and GH39. The abundance of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria and CAZyme content was low in WAEs, indicating challenges in processing high-fiber foods and explaining the low-fiber diet in this group. These findings suggest that wild elephant herds migrate in search of nutritionally suitable, low-fiber food sources.

AB  - Objective: Depression, a prevalent and severe mental disorder, continues to be a significant area of research concerning its pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Conventional antidepressants are often limited by delayed therapeutic effects and notable adverse reactions, necessitating the development of innovative and efficacious treatment modalities. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that peripheral and central inflammation play a role in depression, and that anti-inflammatory drugs can ameliorate depressive symptoms in patients with inflammation-related depression. Pinocembrin (PB), a natural bioactive compound, is renowned for its antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties, while the effect and mechanism of PB are still unclear. Consequently, this study employs PB as an intervention to investigate its effects on depression in mice model, with the objective of establishing a novel therapeutic strategy and foundational data for the treatment of depression. Methods: (1) The acute inflammation model used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce depression-like behavior in mice by injecting LPS intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.83 mg/kg. The effects of PB (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on improving depression behavior in mice were evaluated. (2) To explore the specific mechanism of PB in improving depression-like behavior in LPS mice by regulating NLRP3 and Netrin-1/DCC pathway. Results: The results showed that after intraperitoneal injection of LPS, the mice exhibited a significant decrease in body weight, sucrose preference score, and a significant increase in tail suspension immobility time. Treatment with PB and MCC950 increased the sucrose preference score and decreased the tail suspension immobility time. Besides, PB and MCC950 could inhibit the expression of NLRP3 related neuroinflammation, down-regulated the Netrin-1/DCC signaling pathway, and improved hippocampal neuroplasticity in mice. Conclusion: In conclusion, PB significantly improved LPS-induced depression-like behavior in mice by reducing the expression of hippocampal NLRP3 inflammasome and down-regulating the Netrin-1/DCC signaling pathway. Additionally, PB was found to regulate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazole receptor (AMPAR) and post- synaptic density 95 (PSD95), protecting excitatory synaptic transmission and enhancing synaptic plasticity. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of PB in improving depressive symptoms induced by LPS and provides a new strategy for the clinical treatment of depression.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ischemic stroke is an acute central nervous system disease that poses a threat to human health. It induces a series of severe pathological mechanisms, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death in the brain due to local ischemia and hypoxia. Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD), as a representative formula for treating ischemic stroke, has shown good therapeutic effects in stroke patients. Aim of the study: This study aimed to explore the mechanism of BYHWD in promoting neural remodeling after ischemic stroke from the perspective of neuronal synaptic plasticity, based on the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. Materials and methods: A modified suture technique was employed to establish a rat model of MCAO. The rats were divided into sham, model, and BYHWD (20 g/kg) groups. After the corresponding intervention, rat brains from each group were collected. TMT quantitative proteomics technology was employed for the research. Following proteomics studies, we investigated the mechanism of BYHWD in the intervention of ischemic stroke through animal experiments and cell experiments. The experimental animals were divided into sham, model, and BYHWD (5 g/kg, 10 g/kg, and 20 g/kg) groups. Infarct volume and severity of brain injury were measured by TTC staining. HE staining was utilized to evaluate alterations in tissue morphology. The Golgi staining was used to observe changes in cell body, dendrites, and dendritic spines. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of synapses in the cortex and hippocampus. TUNEL staining was conducted to identify apoptotic neurons. Meanwhile, a stable and reliable (OGD/R) SH-SY5Y cell model was established. The effect of BYHWD-containing serum on SH-SY5Y cell viability was measured by CCK-8 kit. The apoptosis situation of SHSY5Y cells was determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI. Immunofluorescence was employed to measure the fluorescence intensity of synaptic-related factors Syt1, Psd95, and Syn1. Synaptic plasticity pathways were assessed by using RT-qPCR and Western blot to determine the expression levels of cAMP, Psd95, Prkacb, Creb1/p-Creb1, BDNF, Shank2, Syn1, Syt1, Bcl-2, Bcl-2/Bax mRNA and proteins. Results: After treatment with BYHWD, notable alterations were detected in the signaling pathways linked to synaptic plasticity and the cAMP signaling pathway-related targets among the intervention targets. This trend of change was also reflected in other bioinformatics analyses, indicating the important role of synaptic plasticity changes before and after modeling and drug intervention. The results of vivo and vitro experiments showed that BYHWD improved local pathological changes, and reduced cerebral infarct volume, and neurological function scores in MCAO rats. It increased dendritic spine density, improved synaptic structural plasticity, and had a certain neuroprotective effect. BYHWD increased the postsynaptic membrane thickness, synaptic interface curvature, and synaptic quantity. 10% BYHWD-containing serum was determined as the optimal concentration for treatment. 10% BYHWD-containing serum significantly reduced the overall apoptotic rate of (OGD/R) SHSY5Y cells. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that 10% BYHWD-containing serum could improve synaptic plasticity and increase the relative expression levels of synaptic-related proteins Syt1, Psd95, and Syn1.
   BYHWD and decoction-containing serum upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels in (OGD/R) SH-SY5Y cells and MCAO rats, suggesting its ability to improve damaged neuronal synaptic plasticity and enhance transmission efficiency, which might be achieved through the regulation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Conclusions: This study may provide a basis for clinical medication by elucidating the underlying experimental evidence for the promotion of neural plasticity after ischemic stroke by BYHWD.

AB  - Traditionally, fermented food and beverages are prepared by adding a mixture of plant residues as a starter or source of microbes. Most of the conventional fermented foods use a local starter which contains a mixture of herbs or old ferment or otherwise cereal dust-coated tablet. In this study, we have made an attempt to prepare a rice-based fermented food with the herbal starter (0.5% w/w) of Elephantopus scaber L. rhizome, and also examined its microbial and nutrient profiles. The food product is fortified with organic acid and titratable acidity of 0.58% and also contained an excellent source of microbes (LAB and Bifidobacterium sp.). The fermented food contains significant amount of fat, protein, minerals, vitamins, oligosaccharide, unsaturated fatty acids (omega 3, omega 6, omega 7 and omega 9) and a pool of free amino acids. The presence of phytochemical contents in the fermented rice was also exhibited significant effects against commercially available free radicals (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and OH -radicals). Thus, food-grade microbes containing newly formulated fermented food would provide essential macro-and micro-nutrients to the individuals and convey the sustainability of good health. Therefore, the mentioned plant part would be used as an effective starter for aiding rice-based food products.

AB  - Epilepsy is a prevalent and severe neurological disorder and generally requires prolonged electrode implantation and tether brain stimulation in refractory cases. However, implants may cause potential chronic immune inflammation and permanent tissue damage due to material property mismatches with soft brain tissue. Here, we demonstrated a nanomaterial-enabled near-infrared (NIR) neuromodulation approach to provide nongenetic and nonimplantable therapeutic benefits in epilepsy mouse models. Our study showed that crystal-exfoliated photothermal black phosphorus (BP) flakes could enhance neural activity by altering the membrane capacitive currents in hippocampus neurons through NIR photothermal neuromodulation. Optical stimulation facilitated by BP flakes in hippocampal slices evoked action potentials with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, BP flake-enabled NIR neuromodulation of hippocampus neural circuits can suppress epileptic signals in epilepsy model mice with minimal invasiveness and high biocompatibility. Consequently, nanomaterial-enabled NIR neuromodulation may open up opportunities for nonimplantable optical therapy of epilepsy in nontransgenic organisms.

AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a global epidemic enteropathogenic coronavirus that mainly infects piglets, and causes huge losses to the pig industry. However, there are still no commercial vaccines available for PDCoV prevention and controlment. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located at the S1 subunit of PDCoV and is the major target for developing viral inhibitor and vaccine. In this study, the characteristics of the RBD were analyzed by bioinformatic tools, and codon optimization was performed to efficiently express the PDCoV-RBD protein in the insect baculovirus expression system. The purified PDCoV-RBD protein was obtained and fully emulsified with CPG2395 adjuvant, aqueous adjuvant and Al(OH)3 adjuvant, respectively, to develop vaccines. The humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed on mice. The results showed that both the RBD/ CPG2395 and RBD/aqueous adjuvant could induce stronger immune responses in mice than that of RBD/Al (OH)3. In addition, the PDCoV challenge infection was conducted and the RBD/CPG2395 could provide better protection against PDCoV in mice. Our study showed that the RBD protein has good antigenicity and can be used as a protective antigen, which provided a basis for the development of the PDCoV vaccine.

AB  - Decreased hippocampal connectivity and disruption of functional networks are established resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) features that are associated with neuropsychiatric symptom severity in human anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. However, the underlying pathophysiology of NMDAR encephalitis remains poorly understood. Application of patient-derived monoclonal antibodies against the NR1 (GluN1) subunit of the NMDAR now allows for the translational investigation of functional connectivity in experimental murine NMDAR antibody disease models with neurodevelopmental disorders. Using rs-fMRI, we studied functional connectivity alterations in (1) adult C57BL/6 J mice that were intrathecally injected with a recombinant human NR1 antibody over 14 days (n = 10) and in (2) a newly established mouse model with in utero exposure to a human recombinant NR1 antibody (NR1-offspring) at the age of (2a) 8 weeks (n = 15) and (2b) 10 months (n = 14). Adult NR1-antibody injected mice showed impaired functional connectivity within the left hippocampus compared to controls, resembling impaired connectivity patterns observed in human NMDAR encephalitis patients. Similarly, NR1-offspring showed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the hippocampus after 8 weeks, and impaired connectivity in the hippocampus was likewise observed in NR1-offspring at the age of 10 months. We successfully reproduced functional connectivity changes within the hippocampus in different experimental murine systems that were previously observed in human NMDAR encephalitis patients. Translational application of this method within a combined imaging and histopathological framework will allow future experimental studies to identify the underlying biological mechanisms and may eventually facilitate non-invasive monitoring of disease activity and treatment responses in autoimmune encephalitis.

AB  - The present study investigated the nutritional indices and immune responses of Agelastica alni L. larvae in heavy metal pollution (cadmium, zinc, copper, nickel, and iron). Larvae collected from 2 different localities with different levels of heavy metal pollution were fed with leaves from 3 different localities. The localities and the corresponding plant samples were designated as low-pollution, moderate-pollution, and high-pollution regions based on their degree of pollution. The development duration, the nutritional indices (approximate digestibility, Efficiency of conversion of digested food, Efficiency of conversion of ingested food, Relative comcumption rate, and Relative growth rate), and the phenoloxidase activity of the larvae were determined. It was determined that approximate digestibility, efficiency of conversion of digested food, efficiency of conversion of ingested food values decreased when the larvae from the low-pollution locality were fed on the leaves with high pollution. The increase in the heavy metal content caused an increase in the approximate digestibility value for the larvae collected from high-pollution localities. In addition, the relative consumption rate values of the larvae collected from low-pollution localities were higher than the corresponding values for the larvae collected from high-pollution localities. The increase in heavy metals other than iron caused an increase in the phenoloxidase activities of the high-pollution larvae.

AB  - Camellia nitidissima Chi. is an ornamental plant of the genus Camellia L. Its flowers contain a lot of flavonoids and polyphenols. Flavonoid 3 '-hydroxylase (F3 ' H) plays an important role in the synthesis of flavonoids, polyphenols and anthocyanins. We used PCR amplification, quantitative PCR, High-performance liquid chromatography, subcellular localization, and agrobacterium-mediated leaf disk method to study the the function of CnF3 ' H. The full length of CnF3 ' H was 1859 bp (GenBank code: HQ290518.1), with an open reading frame of 1577 bp, and encoded 518 amino acid. A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that CnF3 ' H was closely related to Camellia sinensis L. and C. sinensis cultivar Zhonghuang. CnF3 ' H was expressed in flowers, leaves, fruits, sepals, petals and stamens of C. nitidissima, and during the flowering process the expression level in flower decreased initially and then increased. CnF3 ' H expression was significantly positive correlated with polyphenol contents in C. nitidissima. A CnF3 ' H-EGFP expression vector was constructed to do the subcellular localization, we found that CnF3 ' H was obviously localized in the nuclear envelope and cytomembrane. In transgenic tobacco flowers, the total polyphenol content and various polyphenol constituents were significantly increased with high CnF3 ' H expression level, while total flavonoid contents and some flavonol constituents were increased slightly. These findings suggest that CnF3 ' H promotes the synthesis of polyphenols better than flavonoids.

AB  - Assessing maturity status of fish and invertebrate species is important for understanding population dynamics with results (e.g., estimates of reproductive potential) often used to inform fisheries management strategies (e.g., the setting of minimum legal size requirements for fishing). Maturity rates may vary substantially across a population's range, as well as between years. In addition, maturity data are typically obtained from fisheries-independent surveys that may be incomplete (or missing) from year to year. Here we propose a spatial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) framework for maturity data that includes spatially correlated random effects to address variations in space, and a sliding window approach to deal with unbalanced maturity data in both space and time. We demonstrate, with both real data and a simulation study, that this combined approach results in unbiased estimates of important growth parameters. Results of using our spatial GLMM framework with Greenland halibut (Rheinhardtius hippoglossoides) mature-at-length data from surveys of the eastern Canadian Arctic show that females mature at a much larger size than do males. The length at which 50% of the stock is mature (L50$$ {L}_{50} $$) is found to be higher in Baffin Bay compared to Davis Strait, and a declining trend in the L50$$ {L}_{50} $$ in recent years is revealed for both sexes. Our proposed methodology extends far beyond our current application in being useful for analyzing unbalanced spatiotemporal data from an array of diverse scientific fields.

AB  - Recessive gene mutations underlie many developmental disorders and often lead to disabling neurological problems. Here, we report identification of a homozygous c.170G>A (p.Cys57Tyr or C57Y) mutation in the gene coding for protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3, also known as ERp57), an enzyme that catalyzes formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum, to be associated with syndromic intellectual disability. Experiments in zebrafish embryos show that PDIA3(C57Y) expression is pathogenic and causes developmental defects such as axonal disorganization as well as skeletal abnormalities. Expression of PDIA3(C57Y) in the mouse hippocampus results in impaired synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Proteomic and functional analyses reveal that PDIA3(C57Y) expression leads to dysregulation of cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton dynamics, associated with altered integrin biogenesis and reduced neuritogenesis. Biochemical studies show that PDIA3(C57Y) has decreased catalytic activity and forms disulfide-crosslinked aggregates that abnormally interact with chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, rare disease gene variant can provide insight into how perturbations of neuronal proteostasis can affect the function of the nervous system.

AB  - Modern hyper-prolific sows produce large litters with a high within-litter variation in birth weight and an increased number of low-birth-weight piglets per litter with higher mortality rates and lower growth rates compared to heavier littermates. This study aimed to describe fetal development in hyper-prolific sows, to characterize differences between large and small fetuses, and to determine when within-litter variation in fetal weight can be detected. Forty-seven multiparous sows were blood-sampled and slaughtered at day 28, 33, 45, 50, and 56 of gestation. Number of fetuses were counted, fetal body and organ weights were measured, and the intrauterine positioning was recorded. Length, width, and area of each placenta was measured and the fetus weight/placental weight ratio was calculated. The umbilical cords of the smallest, medium and the largest fetus of each litter were sampled for histological analysis. In total measurements were obtained for 1161 fetuses. The results revealed no difference in fetal survival between the gestational days (P > 0.05). Intrauterine positioning near the cervix significantly reduced fetal weight at day 56 (P < 0.05). Total litter weight and average fetal weight increased with gestational age and individual fetal weight was negatively affected by litter size from day 33 and onwards (P < 0.05). The coefficient of variation for within-litter variation in fetal weight was higher at day 28 compared to the other gestational days (P < 0.05). Relative brain-and heart weights decreased from day 28-56 (P < 0.001). Small fetuses had relatively heavier brains and hearts at day 45, 50 and 56 (P < 0.001). Size of placenta, fetus weight/placental weight ratio and length of umbilical cord increased with gestational age (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between size of placenta and weight of individual fetus (P < 0.001), the weight of the fetus was positively correlated with umbilical cord length (P < 0.001) and the umbilical cross-sectional area was correlated to fetal weight at day 56 (P < 0.01). Individual fetal weight was positively correlated to the fetus weight/placental weight ratio (P < 0.001). In conclusion, fetal growth was affected by litter size, placental weight, and-area, and umbilical cord length. Light-weight fetuses were characterized by having placentas with lower weight and area and shorter umbilical cords. Lastly, within-litter variation in fetal weight was detectable at day 28, and the coefficient of variance remained stable from day 33-56.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) has no cure. Earlier, we showed that partial inhibition of mitochondrial complex I (MCI) with the small molecule CP2 induces an adaptive stress response, activating multiple neuroprotective mechanisms. Chronic treatment reduced inflammation, A beta and pTau accumulation, improved synaptic and mitochondrial functions, and blocked neurodegeneration in symptomatic APP/PS1 mice, a translational model of AD. Here, using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) and three-dimensional (3D) EM reconstructions combined with Western blot analysis and next-generation RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that CP2 treatment also restores mitochondrial morphology and mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) communication, reducing ER and unfolded protein response (UPR) stress in the APP/PS1 mouse brain. Using 3D EM volume reconstructions, we show that in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, dendritic mitochondria primarily exist as mitochondria-on-a-string (MOAS). Compared to other morphological phenotypes, MOAS have extensive interaction with the ER membranes, forming multiple mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCS) known to facilitate abnormal lipid and calcium homeostasis, accumulation of A beta and pTau, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, and apoptosis. CP2 treatment reduced MOAS formation, consistent with improved energy homeostasis in the brain, with concomitant reductions in MERCS, ER/UPR stress, and improved lipid homeostasis. These data provide novel information on the MOAS-ER interaction in AD and additional support for the further development of partial MCI inhibitors as a disease-modifying strategy for AD.

AB  - Microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) is a toxin secreted by freshwater cyanobacteria that is considered a potential environmental risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A previous study indicated that tau protein hyperphosphorylation via protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and GSK-3 beta inhibition was the mechanism by which MC-LR induces neurotoxicity; however, how MC-LR-induced neurotoxicity can be effectively prevented remains unclear. In this study, the reversal effect of metformin on MC-LR-induced neurotoxicity was investigated. The results showed that metformin effectively prevented tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser202 caused by MC-LR through PP2A and GSK-3b activity. The effect of metformin on PP2A activity was dependent on the inhibition of mTOR in MC-LR-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Metformin prevented spatial memory deficits in rats caused by intrahippocampal MC-LR administration. In sum, the results suggested that metformin can ameliorate the MC-LR-induced AD-like phenotype by preventing tau phosphorylation at Ser202, which was mainly mediated by mTOR-dependent PP2A and GSK-3 beta activation.

AB  - Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) has been shown to disturb the gut microbiome homeostasis and cause initiation of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration via gut-brain bi-directional axis. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic and mutagenic, are important organic constituents of PM2.5 that could be involved in the microbiome-gut-brain axis-mediated neurodegeneration. Melatonin (ML) has been shown to modulate the microbiome and curb inflammation in the gut and brain. However, no studies have been reported for its effect on PM2.5-induced neuroinflammation. In the current study, it was observed that treatment with ML at 100 & mu;M significantly inhibits microglial activation (HMC-3 cells) and colonic inflammation (CCD-841 cells) by the conditioned media from PM2.5 exposed BEAS2B cells. Further, melatonin treatment at a dose of 50 mg/kg to C57BL/6 mice exposed to PM2.5 (at a dose of 60 & mu;g/animal) for 90 days significantly alleviated the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration caused by PAHs in PM2.5 by modulating olfactory-brain and microbiome-gut-brain axis.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of drug-resistant epilepsy, severely affects quality of life. However, the underlying mechanism of TLE remains unclear and deserves further exploration. Sorbs2, a key synaptic regulatory protein, plays an important role in the regulation of synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression pattern of Sorbs2 in a kainic acid (KA)-induced TLE mouse model and in patients with TLE to further determine whether Sorbs2 is involved in seizure activity and to explore the potential mechanism by which Sorbs2 affects seizures in this TLE mouse model. First, we found that the expression of Sorbs2 was obviously increased in the hippocampus and cortex of a TLE mouse model and in the temporal cortex of TLE patients, indicating an abnormal expression pattern of Sorbs2 in TLE. Importantly, subsequent behavioral analyses and local field potential (LFP) analyses of a TLE mouse model demonstrated that the downregulation of hippocampal Sorbs2 could prolong the latency to spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) and protect against SRSs. We also found that the knockdown of Sorbs2 in the hippocampus could decrease excitatory synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the hippocampal CA1 region and reduce the expression levels of the AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2. Thus, we speculated that Sorbs2 may promote epileptogenesis and the development of TLE by affecting AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in PNs in the CA1 region. Therefore, reducing the expression of hippocampal Sorbs2 could restrain epileptogenesis and the development of TLE.

AB  - Chronic exposure to vehicle exhaust emissions are known to cause several adverse health effects. In this study, we examined the impact of several parameters of behavioral, cardiovascular and biochemical functions upon exposure of pro-oxidants CO2, NO2 and CO (simulated vehicle exhaust exposure: SVEE) in male and female rats. Adult rats were subjected to SVEE or ambient air in whole body chambers (5 h/day, 2 weeks). Male, but not female, rats developed memory deficits, and exhibited anxiety- and depression-like behavior, accompanied with significantly high levels of serum corticosterone, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers (CRP and TNF alpha), associated with lower levels of total antioxidant capacity, glutathione, glyoxalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Brain region-specific downregulation of Cu/Zn SOD, Mn SOD, GSR, PKC alpha, ERK1/2, CaMKIV, CREB, BDNF and NMDAR subunit protein expression were also observed in male, but not female, rats. Blood pressure, heart rate and eGFR were not negatively impacted by SVEE. Our results suggest that SVEE, through its pro-oxidant content, induces oxido-inflammation in susceptible brain regions in a sex-dependent manner.

AB  - Soft actuators and micro-robots receive significant attention for their potential applications in transportation, photovoltaic conversion devices, clinical care, and other fields. In this work, a polyvinyl alcohol/Chinese ink mixture was uniformly coated on polyethylene film for preparing structure-stabilized bilayer soft actuators. Due to the significant difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the two layers, the actuator can achieve a large bending deformation with a fast response speed under xenon light. A large amplitude of bending angle of 1260(degrees) was achieved in 6 s. A soft-body robot similar to an inchworm was constructed by changing the intensity of xenon or near-infrared light combined with the bionic structure design of an inchworm. The robot can realize various forms of movements (such as crawling and pushing boxes) on different surfaces (such as paper and leaves). Light-driven applications such as hands capable of grasping objects (grasping objects 14 times their weight), cats exhibiting variable expressions, elephant trunks performing curling and retraction, and bionic flowers realizing flowering and closing can be realized. In addition, based on the good photothermal conversion and pressure sensing performance of the bilayer actuator, it is able to monitor daily human activities (such as joint flexion, abdominal breathing, water swallowing, and other movements) and integrate with photoelectric conversion devices. This versatile and diverse drive-mode soft robot exhibits significant potential for applications such as wearable devices, transportation, photovoltaic conversion devices, and clinical therapies.

TI  - Ergothioneine improves cognitive function by ameliorating mitochondrial damage and decreasing neuroinflammation in a <sc>d</sc>-galactose-induced aging model
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Ergothioneine (EGT) is a sulfur-containing amino acid with strong antioxidant activity. In this study, a d-galactose induced mouse aging model was used to investigate the anti-aging effects of EGT. EGT intervention could significantly improve the recognition memory of aging mice. Additionally, it improved the d-galactose induced decrease in the number of neurones, enhanced the levels of cAMP and BDNF in the brain, and increased the density and expression of PSD95 in aging mice. Meanwhile, EGT could attenuate oxidative stress by reducing the content of MDA and enhancing T-SOD activity via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In addition, EGT could alleviate mitochondrial function by regulating the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha pathway, which in turn attenuated d-galactose induced hippocampal neuronal injury and improved the learning and memory abilities in mice. This study provides a potential dietary strategy to improve age-induced memory impairment.

AB  - Simple Summary The fatty acid composition of the mammalian brains varies by functional region, development, sex, and diet. In the current study, diets for growing female and castrated male bovines were supplemented with the calcium salts of palm or fish oil for 220 days. The cattle had unrestricted access to the supplements. At slaughter, the brains were removed from the cranium and blocked to the functional region. Analysis of the fatty acid content of the brain revealed they had similar fatty acid contents to other species including rodents and wild ungulates. Although diet differences across the regions were small, cattle supplemented with fish oil had greater contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with arachidonic acid levels being greater in palm-oil-supplemented cattle. Fatty acid contents across regions were similar to what has been reported for other species, and it suggests that a conserved lipid metabolism creates a uniform brain fatty acid profile. Fatty acid composition across functional brain regions was determined in bovine brains collected from cattle that were provided supplements of calcium salts containing either palm or fish oil. The Angus cattle were divided into two groups, with one group offered the supplement of calcium salts of palm oil and the other offered the calcium salts of fish oil (n = 5 females and n = 5 males/supplement) for 220 days. These supplements to the basal forage diet were provided ad libitum as a suspension in dried molasses. The fish oil exclusively provided eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3). The functional regions were dissected from the entire brains following commercial harvest. While the cattle provided diets supplemented with the calcium salts of palm oil had increased (p < 0.01) liver concentrations of C18:1 n-9, C18:2 n-6, and arachidonic acid, the fish-oil-supplemented cattle had greater (p < 0.01) concentrations of liver EPA, DHA, and C18:3 n-3. In the brain, DHA was the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the amygdala, pons, frontal lobe, internal capsule, and sensory cortex, DHA concentrations were greater (p < 0.05) in the brains of the cattle fed fish oil. Differences among the supplements were small, indicating that brain DHA content is resistant to dietary change. Arachidonic acid and C22:4 n-6 concentrations were greater across the regions for the palm-oil-supplemented cattle. EPA and C22:5 n-3 concentrations were low, but they were greater across the regions for the cattle fed fish oil. The effects of sex were inconsistent. The fatty acid profiles of the brain regions differed by diet, but they were similar to the contents reported for other species.

AB  - Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly prevalent yet neglected health burden for women. Strengthening thepelvic floor with bioactive tissue-engineered meshes is an emerging concept. The study investigates tissue regenerative design parameters, including degradability, porosity, and angulation, to develop alternative degradable melt electrowritten (MEW) constructs for surgical applications of POP. MEW constructs are fabricated in hierarchical geometries by two-way stacking of the fibers with three different inter layer angles of 90 degrees, 45 degrees, or 22.5 degrees. Implants printed at 22.5 degrees have higher tensile strength under dry conditions and show better vaginal fibroblast (VF) attachment in vitro. In vivo assessment using preclinical mouse and ovine models demonstrates more effective degradation and improved tissue integration in 22.5 degrees angular meshes compared to 90 degrees and 45 degrees meshes, with evidence of neo-collagen deposition within implants at 6 weeks. The pattern and geometry of the layered MEW implants also influence the foreign body response, where in the anti-inflammatory phenotype shows a greater ratio of anti-inflammatory CD206+ M2 macrophages/pro-inflammatory CCR7+ M1 macrophages. This presents an attractive strategy for improving the design and fabrication of next-generation vaginal implants for pelvic reconstructive surgery.
   Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a significant health challenge for women, especially with the lack of optimal surgical options post-withdrawal of synthetic transvaginal meshes. The study pioneers degradable melt electrowrite vaginal implants with precise 22.5 degrees angles and specific porosity. These configurations significantly influence macrophage behavior and gene expression, enhancing tensile strength, fibroblast attachment, and anti-inflammatory response. image

AB  - The enhancement of photosynthesis of tea leaves can increase tea yield. In order to explore the regulation mechanism of exogenous melatonin (MT) on the photosynthetic characteristics of tea plants, tea variety 'Zhongcha 108' was used as the experimental material in this study. The effects of different concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 mM) of melatonin on the chlorophyll (Chl) content, stomatal opening, photosynthetic and fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activity, and related gene expression of tea plants were detected and analyzed. The results showed that under 0.2-mM MT treatment, chlorophyll (Chl) content, photosynthetic rate (P-n), stomatal conductance (G(s)), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), and transpiration rate (T-r) improved, accompanied by a decrease in stomata density and increase in stomata area. Zero point two millimolar MT increased Chl fluorescence level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, indicating that MT alleviated PSII inhibition and improved photochemical efficiency. At the same time, 0.2 mM MT induced the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and chlorophyll metabolism to varying degrees. The study demonstrated that MT can effectively enhance the photosynthetic capacity of tea plants in a dose-dependent manner. These results may promote a comprehensive understanding of the potential regulatory mechanism of exogenous MT on photosynthesis in tea plants.

AB  - Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of drug-related learning and memory formation may help the treatment of cognitive disorders. Dysfunction of the cannabinoid and serotonergic systems has been demonstrated in learning and memory disorders.
   The present paper investigates the phenomenon called state-dependent memory (SDM) induced by ACPA (a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) and 8-OH-DPAT (a nonselective 5-HT1A receptor agonist) with special focus on the role of the 5-HT1A receptor in the effects of both ACPA and 8-OH-DPAT SDM and cross state-dependent memory retrieval between ACPA and 8-OH-DPAT in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task.
   The dorsal hippocampal CA1 regions of adult male NMRI mice were bilaterally cannulated, and all drugs were microinjected into the intended injection sites. A single-trial step-down inhibitory avoidance task was used to assess memory retrieval and state-dependence.
   Post-training and/or pre-test microinjections of ACPA (1 and 2 ng/mouse) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 and 1 mu g/mouse) dose-dependently induced amnesia. Pre-test administration of the same doses of ACPA and 8-OH-DPAT reversed the post-training ACPA- and 8-OH-DPAT-induced amnesia, respectively. This phenomenon has been named SDM. 8-OH-DPAT (1 mu g/mouse) reversed the amnesia induced by ACPA (0.5, 1, and 2 ng/mouse) and induced ACPA SDM. ACPA (2 ng/mouse) reversed the amnesia induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mu g/mouse) and induced 8-OH-DPAT SDM. Pre-test administration of a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, (S)-WAY 100,135 (0.25 and 0.5 mu g/mouse), 5 min before ACPA and 8-OH-DPAT dose-dependently inhibited ACPA- and 8OH-DPAT-induced SDM, respectively.
   The present study results demonstrated ACPA- and 8-OH-DPAT- induced SDM. Overall, the data revealed that dorsal hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor mechanisms play a pivotal role in modulating cross state-dependent memory retrieval between ACPA and 8-OH-DPAT.

AB  - Simple Summary This project aimed to find biological themes affecting growth in dromedaries. Candidate SNPs associated with growth were mapped to 22 genes, and 25 significant themes were identified related to growth. The main biological functions included calcium ion binding, protein binding, DNA-binding transcription factor activity, protein kinase activity, tropomyosin binding, myosin complex, actin-binding, ATP binding, receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT, and cytokine activity. EFCAB5, MTIF2, MYO3A, TBX15, IFNL3, PREX1, and TMOD3 genes are candidates for improving growth in camel breeding programs. Growth is an important heritable economic trait for dromedaries and necessary for planning a successful breeding program. Until now, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and QTL-mapping have identified significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with growth in domestic animals, but in dromedaries, the number of studies is very low. This project aimed to find biological themes affecting growth in dromedaries. In the first step, 99 candidate SNPs were chosen from a previously established set of SNPs associated with body weight, gain, and birth weight in Iranian dromedaries. Next, 0.5 kb upstream and downstream of each candidate SNP were selected from NCBI (assembly accession: GCA_000803125.3). The annotation of fragments with candidate SNPs regarding the reference genome was retrieved using the Blast2GO tool. Candidate SNPs associated with growth were mapped to 22 genes, and 25 significant biological themes were identified to be related to growth in dromedaries. The main biological functions included calcium ion binding, protein binding, DNA-binding transcription factor activity, protein kinase activity, tropomyosin binding, myosin complex, actin-binding, ATP binding, receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT, and cytokine activity. EFCAB5, MTIF2, MYO3A, TBX15, IFNL3, PREX1, and TMOD3 genes are candidates for improving growth in camel breeding programs.

AB  - Ferroptosis has attracted extensive interest from cancer researchers due to its substantial potential as a therapeutic target. The role of LATS2, a core component of the Hippo pathway cascade, in ferroptosis initiation in hepatoblastoma (HB) has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of decreased LATS2 expression remains largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated decreased LATS2 expression in HB and that LATS2 overexpression inhibits HB cell proliferation by inducing ferroptosis. Increased LATS2 expression reduced glycine and cysteine concentrations via the ATF4/PSAT1 axis. Physical binding between YAP1/ATF4 and the PSAT1 promoter was confirmed through ChIP-qPCR. Moreover, METTL3 was identified as the writer of the LATS2 mRNA m6A modification at a specific site in the 5' UTR. Subsequently, YTHDF2 recognizes the m6A modification site and recruits the CCR4-NOT complex, leading to its degradation by mRNA deadenylation. In summary, N6-methyladenosine modification of LATS2 facilitates its degradation. Reduced LATS2 expression promotes hepatoblastoma progression by inhibiting ferroptosis through the YAP1/ATF4/PSAT1 axis. Targeting LATS2 is a potential strategy for HB therapy.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in a number of disorders where reward processing is disrupted but whether new neurons regulate specific aspects of reward-related decision making remains unclear. Given the role of the hippocampus in future-oriented cognition, here we tested whether adult neurogenesis regulates preference for future, advantageous rewards in a delay discounting paradigm for rats. Indeed, blocking neurogenesis caused a profound aversion for delayed rewards, and biased choice behavior toward immediately available, but smaller, rewards. Consistent with a role for the ventral hippocampus in impulsive decision making and future-thinking, neurogenesis-deficient animals displayed reduced activity in the ventral hippocampus. In intact animals, delay-based decision making restructured dendrites and spines in adult-born neurons and specifically activated adult-born neurons in the ventral dentate gyrus, relative to dorsal activation in rats that chose between immediately-available rewards. Putative developmentally-born cells, located in the superficial granule cell layer, did not display task-specific activity. These findings identify a novel and specific role for neurogenesis in decisions about future rewards, thereby implicating newborn neurons in disorders where short-sighted gains are preferred at the expense of long-term health.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with cognitive deficits, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Animal models have recapitulated features of PTSD, but no comparative RNA sequencing analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain between PTSD and animal models of traumatic stress has been carried out. We compared DEGs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of an established stress model to DEGs from the dorsolateral PFC (dIPFC) of humans. We observed a significant enrichment of rat DEGs in human PTSD and identified 20 overlapping DEGs, of which 17 (85%) are directionally concordant. N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a known indirect antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective compound with antidepressant and plasticity-facilitating effects. We tested the capacity of DMT, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) harmaline, and "pharmahuasca" (DMT + harmaline) to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammatory gene expression and to modulate neuroplasticity-related gene expression in the model. We administered DMT (2 mg/kg IP), harmaline (1.5 mg/kg IP), pharmahuasca, or vehicle every other day for 5 days, following a 30 day stress regiment. We measured ROS production in the PFC and hippocampus (HC) by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and sequenced total mRNA in the PFC. We also performed in vitro assays to measure the affinity and efficacy of DMT and harmaline at SHT2AR compared to 5-HT. DMT and pharmahuasca reduced ROS production in the PFC and HC, while harmaline had mixed effects. Treatments normalized 9, 12, and 14 overlapping DEGs, and pathway analysis implicated that genes were involved in ROS production, inflammation, growth factor signaling, neurotransmission, and neuroplasticity.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), a ubiquitous toxic heavy metal, with the intractable trait of low degradation, can induce multiple organ damage. Whereas, far less is known about its neurotoxicity and the specific mechanism in the chronic low Cd exposure. To investigate the chronic neurotoxicity of Cd2+, we traced its effects for up to 30 months in mice which were exposed to Cd2+ by drinking the mimicking Cd-polluted water. We found the toxicity of chronic Cd exposure was a process associated with the transition from autophagy to apoptosis, and the switch of autophagy-apoptosis was Cd dose-dependent with the threshold of [Cd2+] 0.04 mg/L. Furthermore, JNK was found to be a hub molecule orchestrated the switch of autophagy-apoptosis by interacting with Sirt1 and p53. At last, the hippocampus-dependent learning and memory was damaged by continuous neuron apoptosis rather than deficit of neurogenesis. Therefore, elucidation of the effect, process, and potential molecular mechanism of the chronic low Cd2+ exposure is important for controlling of the environmental-pollutant Cd.

AB  - Osteoporotic vertebral fractures often necessitate fusion surgery, with high rates of implant failure. We present a novel bioactive composite of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) and the collagen I mimetic P-15 for pedicle screw augmentation in osteoporotic bone. Methods involved expression analysis of osteogenesis-related genes during osteoblastic differentiation by RT-PCR and immunostaining of osteopontin and Ca2+ deposits. Untreated and decalcified sheep vertebrae were utilized for linear pullout testing of pedicle screws. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Expression of ALPI II (p < 0.0001), osteopontin (p < 0.0001), RUNX2 (p < 0.0001), and osteocalcin (p < 0.0001) was upregulated after co-culture of MSC with CPC-P-15. BMD was decreased by 28.75% & PLUSMN; 2.6%. Pullout loads in untreated vertebrae were 1405 & PLUSMN; 6 N (p < 0.001) without augmentation, 2010 & PLUSMN; 168 N (p < 0.0001) after augmentation with CPC-P-15, and 2112 & PLUSMN; 98 N (p < 0.0001) with PMMA. In decalcified vertebrae, pullout loads were 828 & PLUSMN; 66 N (p < 0.0001) without augmentation, 1324 & PLUSMN; 712 N (p = 0.04) with PMMA, and 1252 & PLUSMN; 131 N (p < 0.0078) with CPC-P-15. CPC-P-15 induces osteoblastic differentiation of human MES and improves pullout resistance of pedicle screws in osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic bone.</p>

AB  - Background/Objectives: Kv2 channels have important conducting and nonconducting functions and are regulated by their co-assembly with 'silent' Kv subunits, including Kv9.1. Kv9.1 is co-expressed with Kv2 channels in sensory neurons, and a common allele that changes Ile489 to Val in human Kv9.1 is associated with pain hypersensitivity in patients. The mechanism responsible for this association remains unknown, but we hypothesise that these two variants differ in their regulation of Kv2.1 properties, and this is what we set out to test. Methods: Expression was carried out using HEK293 cells, OHeLa cells, and primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, and the biophysical and trafficking properties of homomeric and heteromeric channels were assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy and patch clamp analysis. Results: Both Kv9.1Ile and Kv9.1Val were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed individually, but when co-expressed with Kv2.1, they co-localised with Kv2.1 within the surface clusters. Both variants reduced the surface expression of Kv2.1 channels and the size of channel clusters, with Kv9.1Val producing a greater reduction in surface expression in both the HeLa cells and neurons. They both caused a similar hyperpolarising shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation. Concatamers of Kv2.1 and Kv9.1 suggested that both 3:1 and 2:2 ratios of Kv2.1 to Kv9.1 were permitted, although 2:2 resulted in lower surface expression and function. Conclusions: The Ile489Val substitution in Kv9.1 does not disrupt its ability to co-assemble with Kv2 channels, nor its effects on the voltage-dependence of channel gating, but it did produce a greater reduction in the Kv2.1 surface expression, suggesting that this underlies its association with pain hypersensitivity.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate whether AuNPs (gold nanoparticles) synthesized with the Cynara scolymus (CS) leaf exert protective and/or alleviative effects on arsenic (As)-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity in mice. Neurotoxicity in mice was developed by orally treating 10 mg/kg/day sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) for 21 days. 10 mu g/g AuNPs, 1.6 g/kg CS, and 10 mu g/g CS-AuNPs were administered orally simultaneously with 10 mg/ kg As. CS and CS-AuNPs treatments showed down-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels. CS and CS-AuNPs also ameliorated apoptosis and reduced the alterations in the expression levels of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors induced by As. Simultaneous treatment with CS and CS-AuNPs improved As-induced learning, memory deficits, and motor coordination in mice assessed by water maze and locomotor tests, respectively. The results of this study provide evidence that CS-AuNPs demonstrated neuroprotective roles with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as improving D1 and D2 signaling, and eventually reversed neurobehavioral impairments.

AB  - Developmental pluripotency-associated 2 (Dppa2) and developmental pluripotency-associated 4 (Dppa4) as positive drivers were helpful for transcriptional regulation of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Here, we systematically assessed the cooperative interplay of Dppa2 and Dppa4 in regulating cell pluripotency and found that simultaneous overexpression of Dppa2/4 can make induced pluripotent stem cells closer to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Compared with other pluripotency transcription factors, Dppa2/4 can regulate majorities of signaling pathways by binding on CG-rich region of proximal promoter (0-500 bp), of which 85% and 77% signaling pathways were significantly activated by Dppa2 and Dppa4, respectively. Notably, Dppa2/4 also can dramatically trigger the decisive signaling pathways for facilitating ZGA, including Hippo, MAPK and TGF-beta signaling pathways and so on. At last, we found alkaline phosphatase, placental-like 2 (Alppl2) was completely silenced when Dppa2 and 4 single- or double-knockout in ESC, which is consistent with Dux. Moreover, Alppl2 was significantly activated in mouse 2-cell embryos and 4-8 cells stage of human embryos, further predicted that Alppl2 was directly regulated by Dppa2/4 as a ZGA candidate driver to facilitate pre-embryonic development.

AB  - Corn silk (Stigma maydis), rich in flavonoids, is traditionally used to treat edema, depression, and hyperglycemia and may alleviate ischemic stroke symptoms in Chinese medicine. This study examined whether corn silk water extract (CSW) could alleviate ischemic stroke symptoms and post-stroke hyperglycemia in Mongolian gerbils with transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). After being given 0.05% (I/R-LCSW) and 0.2% (I/R-HCSW), 0.02% aspirin (I/R-aspirin), and cellulose (I/R-control) in their 40 energy% fat diets for three weeks, the gerbils underwent an artery occlusion for eight minutes and reperfusion. They took the assigned diet for an additional three weeks. Sham-operated gerbils without artery occlusion had the same diet as Sham-control. CSW intake reduced neuronal cell death in gerbils with I/R and dose-dependently improved the neurological symptoms, including drooped eyes, crouched posture, flexor reflex, and walking patterns. CSW intake also alleviated the short-term memory and spontaneous alteration and grip strength compared to the I/R-control group. The protection against ischemic stroke symptoms was associated with the reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, superoxide, and lipid peroxide levels, promoting superoxide dismutase activity in the hippocampus in the CSW groups, compared to the I/R-control. The blood flow measured by Doppler was improved with CSW compared to the I/R-control. Furthermore, CSW intake prevented the post-stroke hyperglycemia related to decreasing pancreatic beta-cell mass as much as the Sham-control, and it was related to protection against beta-cell apoptosis, restoring the beta-cell mass similar to the Sham-control. CSW intake elevated the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Allobaculum, and Akkermansia compared to the I/R-control. Picrust2 analysis showed that CSW increased the propionate and butyrate metabolism and the starch and glucose metabolism but reduced lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis compared to the I/R-control. In conclusion, CSW intake protects against neuronal cell death and post-hyperglycemia by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and increasing blood flow and the beta-cell mass. The alleviation was associated with promoting the gut-brain axis by changing the gut microbiome community.

AB  - Betaine is an endogenous osmolyte that exhibits therapeutic potential by mitigating various neurological disorders. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for its neuroprotective effects remain puzzling.In this study, we describe a possible mechanism behind the positive impact of betaine in preserving neurons from excitotoxicity. Here we demonstrate that betaine at low concentration modulates the GABA uptake by GAT1 (slc6a1), the predominant GABA transporter in the central nervous system. This modulation occurs through the temporal inhibition of the transporter, wherein prolonged occupancy by betaine impedes the swift transition of the transporter to the inward conformation. Importantly, the modulatory effect of betaine on GAT1 is reversible, as the blocking of GAT1 disappears with increased extracellular GABA. Using electrophysiology, mass spectroscopy, radiolabelled cellular assay, and molecular dynamics simulation we demonstrate that betaine has a dual role in GAT1: at mM concentration acts as a slow substrate, and at mu M as a temporal blocker of GABA, when it is below its K0.5. Given this unique modulatory characteristic and lack of any harmful side effects, betaine emerges as a promising neuromodulator of the inhibitory pathways improving GABA homeostasis via GAT1, thereby conferring neuroprotection against excitotoxicity.

AB  - Diabetic foot ulcers are one of the most serious of the numerous complications of diabetes mellitus, causing great physical trauma and financial stress to patients, and accelerating wound healing in diabetic patients remains one of the major clinical challenges. Exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells can directly and indirectly promote wound healing. However, due to the low retention rate of exosomes in the wound, exosome treatment is difficult to achieve the expected effect. Therefore, it is of great significance to synthesize a composite scaffold that can stably load exosomes and has antibacterial properties. In this study, fresh pig skin was decellularized to obtain decellularized matrix (dECM). Secondly, quaternized chitosan (Qcs) was modified with quaternary ammonium salt to make it soluble in water after quaternization. Finally, Gel-dECM-Qcs (GDQ) bioink was prepared by adding acellular matrix and quaternized chitosan with temperature sensitive gelatin (Gel) as carrier. Tissue engineered composite scaffolds were then prepared by extrusion 3D printing technology. Subsequently, the physicochemical properties, biocompatibility and antimicrobial capacity of the composite scaffolds were determined, and the data showed that the composite scaffolds had good mechanical properties, biocompatibility and antimicrobial capacity, and the maximum stress of the composite scaffolds was 1.16 +/- 0.05 MPa, the composite scaffolds were able to proliferate and adhered to the L929 cells, and the kill rates of composite scaffolds against E. coli and S. aureus after incubation for 24 h were 93.24 +/- 1.22 % and 97.34 +/- 0.23 %, respectively. Overall, the GDQ composite scaffolds have good mechanical properties adapted to skin bending, its good biocompatibility can promote the growth and migration of fibroblasts, reshape injured tissues, accelerate the wound healing, and excellent antimicrobial ability can inhibit the growth of E. coli and S. aureus, reducing the impact of bacterial infections on wounds. Moreover, the composite scaffolds have the potential to be used as exosom-loaded hydrogel dressings, which provides a basis for the subsequent research on the repair of diabetic foot ulcers.

AB  - Incidence of cognitive and emotional alterations are reportedly two times more in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic population with hitherto unexplained causation and mechanism. Purview of the hippocampus functional diversity sanctions the accessibility and the necessity to investigate the regional neuro-immunological aspects of neurodegeneration and related functional alterations following diabetes. We examined the possible involvement of microglia activation, macrophage response, oxidative stress and inflammatory stature in both ventral and dorsal hippocampus of rats rendered diabetic by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 45 mg/ kg body weight; intraperitoneal). Cognitive and behavioural alterations were studied using open field test (locomotor activity), elevated plus maze (anxiety), Barnes maze (spatial cognition) and T maze (working memory) at 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th week post diabetic confirmation. Oxidative stress was investigated via measuring the level of lipid peroxidation biochemically. Scenario of microglia activation, macrophage response and inflammation was gauged using qualitative and quantitative analysis. Pronounced macrophage expression and activation directed microglia phenotypic switching was prominent in both ventral and dorsal hippocampus indicating the impact of oxidative stress following diabetes in hippocampus. The resultant inflammatory response was also progressive and persistent in both ventral and dorsal hippocampus parallel to the altered cognitive, locomotor ability and anxiety behaviour in diabetic rats. Conclusively, present data not only comprehends the microglia, macrophage physiology and related immune response in functionally different hippocampal regions associated cognitive and behavioural deficits, but also offers a suggestive region-specific cellular mechanism pathway for developing an imminent therapeutic approach during particular diabetes deficits.

AB  - Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) binding to co-activator yes-associated protein (YAP1) leads to a transcription factor of the Hippo pathway. TEADs are regulated by S-palmitoylation of a conserved cysteine located in a deep well-defined hydrophobic pocket outside the TEAD & BULL;YAP1 interaction interface. Previously, we reported the discovery of a small molecule based on the structure of flufenamic acid that binds to the palmitate pocket, forms a covalent bond with the conserved cysteine, and inhibits TEAD4 binding to YAP1. Here, we screen a fragment library of chloroacetamide electrophiles to identify new scaffolds that bind to the palmitate pocket of TEADs and disrupt their interaction with YAP1. Time- and concentration-dependent studies with wild-type and mutant TEAD1-4 provided insight into their reaction rates and binding constants and established the compounds as covalent inhibitors of TEAD binding to YAP1. Binding pose hypotheses were generated by covalent docking revealing that the fragments and compounds engage lower, middle, and upper sub-sites of the palmitate pocket. Our fragments and compounds provide new scaffolds and starting points for the design of derivatives with improved inhibition potency of TEAD palmitoylation and binding to YAP1.

AB  - Background: Depression has been reported as a common comorbidity in diabetes mellitus although the underlying mechanism responsible for this is not well known. Although both ginger and cinnamon has anti-diabetic, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, their efficacy in inhibiting neuroinflammation, when simultaneously administrated, has not been investigated yet.
   Objectives: The study was designed to assess the synergistic effect of Cinnamomum cassia and Zingiber officinale on regulating blood glucose, improve hippocampal structural changes and depressive-like alternations in diabetic rats, and try to identify the mechanism behind this effect.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five equal groups (n = 6): the normal control, untreated streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic, cinnamon-treated diabetic [100 mg/kg of body weight (BW)/day for 6 weeks], ginger-treated diabetic (0.5 g/kg BW/day for 6 weeks), and ginger plus cinnamon-treated diabetic groups. Forced swim test and elevated plus maze behavioral tests were performed at the end of the experiment. HOMA-IR, HOMA beta-cells, blood glucose, insulin, corticosterone, pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (INF-alpha) and IL-6), and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAO) were assessed in the serum. BDNF mRNA level was assessed in hippocampus using qRT-PCR. Hippocampal histopathological changes were also assessed, and immunoexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), caspase-3, and Ki-67 was measured.
   Results: Diabetes-induced depressive-like changes in the STZ group were biochemically confirmed by assessing serum corticosterone level, as well as behaviorally using FST and EPM tests. Diabetes also induced degenerative changes in the hippocampus. Treatment of diabetic rats with ginger, cinnamon, or the combination of these alleviated the degenerative structural changes and significantly up-regulated serum insulin, TAC, hippocampal BDNF mRNA, and hippocampal immunoexpression of ki67, while they significantly reduced serum blood glucose, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL1 beta, as well as hippocampal immunoexpression of GFAP and Caspase-3 compared to the untreated diabetic group. Improvement induced by the combination of ginger and cinnamon was superior to the single administration of either of these.
   Conclusion: Cinnamomum cassia and Zingiber officinale have synergistic antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant-like, and neuroprotective effects. The use of a combination of these plants could be beneficial as alternative or complementary supplements in managing DM and decreasing its neuronal and psychiatric complications.

AB  - Obesity-related cognitive dysfunction poses a significant threat to public health. The present study demonstrated mitigating effects of intermittent fasting (IF) and its combination with isomalto-oligosaccharides and IF (IF + IMO) on cognitive impairments induced by a high-fat-high-fructose (HFHF) diet in mice, with IF + IMO exhibiting superior effects. Transcriptomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed that the protective effects on cognition might be attributed to the suppression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF kappa B signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Moreover, both IF and IF + IMO modulated the gut microbiome and promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids, with IF + IMO displaying more pronounced effects. IF + IMO-modulated gut microbiota, metabolites, and molecular targets associated with cognitive impairments were further corroborated using human data from public databases Gmrepo and gutMgene. Furthermore, the fecal microbiome transplantation confirmed the direct impacts of IF + IMO-derived microbiota on improving cognition functions by suppressing TLR4/NF kappa B signaling and increasing BDNF levels. Notably, prior exposure to IF + IMO prevented weight-regain-induced cognitive decline, suppressed TLR4/NF kappa B signaling and inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus, and mitigated weight regain-caused gut dysbacteriosis without altering body weight. Our study underscores that IMO-augmented alleviating effects of IF on obesity-related cognitive impairment particularly during weight-loss and weight-regain periods, presenting a novel nutritional strategy to tackle obesity-related neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Background: Intracellular iron-mediated lipid oxidative damage, referred to as ferroptosis, plays a crucial role in renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study aims to investigate the effects of a betaine-contained organ preservation solution on renal ferroptosis using the normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) system. Methods: Healthy adult Bama miniature pigs were utilized in this study. Both kidneys were harvested and stored at 4 degrees C using three organ preservation solutions: Hypertonic Citrate Adenine (HCA) solution, University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, and modified multiple-saccharide (MS2) solution, for a duration of 24 h. The kidneys were subsequently divided into HCA, UW, and MS groups. The kidneys stored in cold for 2 h were used as a control. All kidneys were reperfused using the NMP system for 2 h. Biochemical indicators and ferroptosis-related markers, including iron levels, oxidative stress, and Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), were measured. Results: During the 2-hour NMP, prolonged cold storage and reperfusion significantly induced ferroptosismediated renal I/R injury, resulting in severe renal tubular damage. Notably, levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), ACSL4, and iron were significantly elevated in the HCA group compared to the control group (P < 0.05), while these levels were significantly reduced in the UW and MS groups. Additionally, the MS group exhibited results similar to those of the UW group in preventing renal I/R injury. Conclusion: This study indicates that the betaine-containing MS solution attenuates ferroptosis-mediated renal cold I/R injury by inhibiting oxidative stress.

AB  - Down Syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, and leading to various developmental and cognitive defects. A critical feature of DS is the occurrence of oxidative distress particularly in the brain, which exacerbates neurodevelopmental processes. Mitochondria play a crucial role in cell energy metabolism and their impairment is one of the major causes of oxidative distress in several pathologies. Hence, this study investigates mitochondrial proteostasis by the mean of the mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (UPRmt) and the mitochondrial protein quality control (MQC) mechanisms in the context of DS, focusing on their implications in redox homeostasis in brain development. We analyzed key UPRmt markers and mitochondrial function in the frontal cortex isolated fromTs2Cje mice, a model for DS, across different developmental stages. Our results demonstrate significant alterations in UPRmt markers, particularly at postnatal day 0 (P0) and 1 month (1M). These changes indicate early UPRmt activation, primarily driven by the ATF5/GRP75 axis, although compromised by reduced levels of other components. Impaired UPRmt correlates with decreased mitochondrial activity, evidenced by reduced oxygen consumption rates and altered expression of OXPHOS complexes. Additionally, elevated oxidative stress markers such as 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and protein carbonyls (PC) were observed, linking mitochondrial dysfunction to increased oxidative damage. Defects of MQC, including disrupted biogenesis, increased fission, and the activation of mitophagy were evident mostly at P0 and 1M consistent with UPRmt activation. Principal Component Analysis revealed distinct phenotypic differences between Ts2Cje and control mice, driven by these molecular alterations. Our findings underscore the critical role of UPRmt and MQC in DS brain development, highlighting potential therapeutic targets to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative distress, thereby alleviating some of the neurodevelopmental and cognitive impairments associated with DS.

AB  - Intergroup conflict is a major evolutionary force shaping animal and human societies. Males and females should, on average, experience different costs and benefits for participating in collective action. Specifically, among mammals, male fitness is generally limited by access to mates whereas females are limited by access to food and safety. Here we analyse sex biases among 72 species of group-living mammals in two contexts: intergroup conflict and collective movements. Our comparative phylogenetic analyses show that the modal mammalian pattern is male-biased participation in intergroup conflict and female-biased leadership in collective movements. However, the probability of male-biased participation in intergroup conflicts decreased and female-biased participation increased with female-biased leadership in movements. Thus, female-biased participation in intergroup conflict only emerged in species with female-biased leadership in collective movements, such as in spotted hyenas and some lemurs. Sex differences are probably attributable to costs and benefits of participating in collective movements (e.g. towards food, water, safety) and intergroup conflict (e.g. access to mates or resources, risk of injury). Our comparative review offers new insights into the factors shaping sex bias in leadership across social mammals and is consistent with the 'male warrior hypothesis' which posits evolved sex differences in human intergroup psychology.This article is part of the theme issue 'Intergroup conflict across taxa'.

They form a cognitive map that encodes spatial relations in the environment, including reward locations.(1) As part of this encoding, dorsal CA1 (dCA1) place cells accumulate at reward.(2-5) The encoding of learned reward location could vary between the dorsal and intermediate hippocampus, which differ in gene expression and cortical and subcortical connectivity.(6) While the dorsal hippocampus is critical for spatial navigation, the involvement of intermediate CA1 (iCA1) in spatial navigation might depend on task complexity' and learning phase.(8-10 )The intermediate-to-ventral hippocampus regulates reward-seeking,(11)(-15) but little is known about the involvement in reward-directed navigation. Here, we compared the encoding of learned reward locations in dCA1 and iCA1 during spatial navigation. We used calcium imaging with a head-mounted microscope to track the activity of CA1 cells over multiple days during which mice learned different reward locations. In dCA1, the fraction of active place cells increased in anticipation of reward, but the pool of active cells changed with the reward location. In iCA1, the same cells anticipated multiple reward locations. Our results support a model in which the dCA1 cognitive map incorporates a changing population of cells that encodes reward proximity through increased population activity, while iCA1 provides a reward-predictive code through a dedicated subpopulation. Both of these location-invariant codes persisted over time, and together they provide a dual hippocampal reward location code, assisting goal-directed navigation.(16,17)

AB  - Chronic stress can affect gene expression in the hippocampus, which alters neural and cerebrovascular functions, thereby contributing to the development of mental disorders such as depression. Although several differentially expressed genes in the depressed brain have been reported, gene expression changes in the stressed brain remain underexplored. Therefore, this study examines hippocampal gene expression in two mouse models of depression induced by forced swim stress (FSS) and repeated social defeat stress (R-SDS). Transthyretin (Ttr) was commonly upregulated in the hippocampus of both mouse models, as determined by microarray, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analyses. Evaluation of the effects of overexpressed Ttr in the hippocampus using adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer revealed that TTR overexpression induced depression-like behavior and upregulation of Lcn2 and several proinflammatory genes (Icam1 and Vcam1) in the hippocampus. Upregulation of these inflammation-related genes was confirmed in the hippocampus obtained from mice vulnerable to R-SDS. These results suggest that chronic stress upregulates Ttr expression in the hippocampus and that Ttr upregulation may be involved in the induction of depression-like behavior.

AB  - Extensive literature suggests that the brain reward system is crucial in understanding the neurobiology of substance use disorders. However, evidence of reliable deficits in functional connectivity across studies on substance use problems remains limited. Therefore, a voxel-wise seed-based meta-analysis using brain regions of the reward system as seeds of interest was conducted on 96 studies representing 5757 subjects with substance use problems. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibited hyperconnectivity with the ventral striatum and hypoconnectivity with the amygdala and hippocampus. The executive striatum showed hyperconnectivity with the motor thalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hypoconnectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula. Finally, the limbic striatum was found to be hyperconnected to the orbitofrontal cortex and hypoconnected to the precuneus compared with healthy subjects. The current study provided meta-analytical evidence of deficient functional connectivity between brain regions of the reward system and cortico-striato-thalamocortical loops in addiction. These results are consistent with deficits in motivation and habit formation occurring in addiction, and they highlight alterations in brain regions involved in socio-emotional processing and attention salience.

AB  - The occurrence and development of depression are closely related to disorders of the brain and peripheral substances. Abnormal metabolites in the blood affect the signal regulation function of the nerve center, which is one of the key factors for depression episodes. This study was focused on metabolites in serum and the mechanism of its antidepressant in the hippocampus. In the present study, serum metabolites in patients with depression were screened by metabolomic techniques. Various depressive mouse models and behavioral tests were used to assess its antidepressant effects. The expressions of inflammatory signaling were detected by using Western blot, ELISA, and immunofluorescence. We found that the metabolite hypoxanthine in the serum of patients with depression was significantly reduced, and the same result was also found in two mouse models of depression such as chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and social defeat stress (SD). By administering different doses of hypoxanthine (5, 10, 15 mg/kg), we found that only 15 mg/kg was able to significantly reduce the latency and increase food consumption in the novelty suppressed-feeding test (NSF), which was also able to reverse the depressive phenotypes of mice in the CUMS model after a single administration at 2 h later. Hypoxanthine obviously reduced the expressions of inflammation in serum and downregulated the expressions of MAPK and NLRP3-related pathways in the hippocampus in CUMS mice. Moreover, hypoxanthine also suppressed the activations of glial cells including GFAP and IBA-1 in hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG). To sum up, hypoxanthine exerted antidepressant effect relying on the inhibition of peripheral and hippocampal inflammations by regulating MAPK, NLRP3-related pathways, and glial cells. This was the first time that we have found a disordered metabolite in patients with depression and further systematically demonstrated its efficacy and potential mechanism of antidepressants, providing new ideas for antidepressant drug development.

AB  - Axon pruning facilitates the removal of ectopic and misguided axons and plays an important role in neural circuit formation during brain development. Sema3F and its receptor neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) have been shown to be involved in the stereotyped pruning of the infrapyramidal bundle (IPB) of mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the developing hippocampus. Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) were originally identified as an intracellular mediator of semaphorin signaling, and the defective pruning of IPB was recently reported in CRMP2-/- and CRMP3-/- mice. CRMP1 and CRMP4 have high homology to CRMP2 and CRMP3, and their expression in the developing mouse brain overlaps; however, their role in IPB pruning has not yet been examined. In this study, we report that CRMP4, but not CRMP1, is involved in IPB pruning during neural circuit formation in the hippocampus. Our genetic interaction analyses indicated that CRMP2 and CRMP4 have distinct functions and that CRMP2 mediates IPB pruning via Nrp2. We also observed the altered synaptic terminals of mossy fibers in CRMP2 and CRMP4 mutant mice. These results suggest that CRMP family members have a distinct function in the axon pruning and targeting of mossy fibers of the hippocampal DG in the developing mouse brain.

AB  - Early sensory experiences interact with genes to shape precise neural circuits during development. This process is vital for proper brain function in adulthood. Neurological dysfunctions caused by environmental alterations and/or genetic mutation may share the same molecular or cellular mechanisms. Here, we show that early life bilateral whisker trimming (BWT) subsequently affects social discrimination in adult male mice. Enhanced activation of the hippocampal dorsal CA3 (dCA3) in BWT mice was observed during social preference tests. Optogenetic activation of dCA3 in naive mice impaired social discrimination, whereas chemogenetic silencing of dCA3 rescued social discrimination deficit in BWT mice. Hippocampal oxytocin (OXT) is reduced after whisker trimming. Neonatal intraventricular compensation of OXT relieved dCA3 over-activation and prevented social dysfunction. Neonatal knockdown of OXT receptor in dCA3 mimics the effects of BWT, and cannot be rescued by OXT treatment. Social behavior deficits in a fragile X syndrome mouse model (Fmr1 KO mice) could also be recovered by early life OXT treatment, through negating dCA3 over-activation. Here, a possible avenue to prevent social dysfunction is uncovered.

AB  - Assessing inorganic phosphate levels seems crucial in deciphering the biochemical state of organisms or tissues. The concentration of inorganic phosphate in blood is an order of magnitude smaller than in tissues and, on top of that, it is dynamically used to fill temporary gaps in tissues. This is the reason blood inorganic phosphate level is considered a poor proxy for tissue levels. Therefore, tissue biopsy seems to be the dominant method when assessing inorganic phosphate levels for instance in muscles. In this study, we attempted to derive a non-invasive biomarker for phosphate tissue levels. We analyzed surface electromyography signals taken during 31P spectroscopy of leg muscles in five adult pigs. We induced hypophosphatemia via 20 minutes-long hyper-ventilation. It turned out that the proportion of the amplitude of the low frequency band and the high frequency band is significantly (p=0.002) correlated with the relative phosphate levels. The electromyographic signal did not correlate significantly with pCO2 levels in the blood, suggesting that the changes in the signal are a result of inorganic phosphate levels, not hyperventilation. The results might lead to the development of a real-time phosphate fluctuations measurement procedure.

AB  - Respiratory viruses are among the most common causes of human infections. Examining pathological processes linked to respiratory viral infections is essential for diagnosis, treatment strategies, and developing novel therapeutics. Alterations in oxidative stress levels and homeostasis are significant processes associated with respiratory viral infections. The study aimed to compare selected oxidative stress markers: total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the oxidative stress index (OSI) levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities in normal (MRC5 cell line) and tumor (A549 cell line) lung cells infected with human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43 and 229E, human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV5), or human rhinovirus A (HRV A). We observed that a respiratory viral infection more significantly affected non-enzymatic oxidative stress markers in a lung adenocarcinoma model (A549 cells), while human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cell line) presented changes in enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidative stress markers.

AB  - Gastric cancer is one of the most lethal human malignancies in the world. Although great efforts are put in developing novel therapeutic targets, the effective targeting drugs are still limited. Recent studies reveal the abnormality of Hippo/YAP axis play critical role in the oncogenic process of gastric cancer. It is of great importance to demonstrate the regulation of Hippo signaling activity and YAP protein turnover in gastric cancer. Besides, the phosphorylation cascade on YAP function, which has been thoroughly investigated, the ubiquitination of YAP is also important in Hippo signaling status. Here, We utilized the DUB (Deubiquitinase) siRNA library to identify critical DUB for Hippo signaling. We discovered OTUB1 as a critical factor to facilitate gastric cancer cell stemness and progression, which deubiquitinated and stabilized YAP protein. The clinical data analysis implicated OTUB1 was higher expressed in gastric cancer, which correlated with YAP activity and poor survival. OUTB1 interacted with YAP protein via its OTU domain (Ovarian tumor domain) and deubiquitinated YAP at several lysine sites (K90, K280, K343, K494 and K497), which subsequently inhibited YAP degradation. Our study revealed a novel deubiquitinase of Hippo/YAP axis and one possible therapeutic target for YAP-driven gastric cancer.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary l-glutamine (Gln) supplementation on the morphology and function of the intestine and the growth of muscle in piglets. In this study, sixteen 21-day-old piglets were randomly divided into two groups: the Control group (fed a basal diet) and the Gln group (fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.81% Gln). Blood, gut, and muscle samples were collected from all piglets on Day 20 of the trial. Compared with the Control group, the supplementation of Gln increased (p < 0.05) the villus height, villus width, villus surface area, and villus height/crypt depth ratio of the small intestine. Furthermore, the supplementation of Gln increased (p < 0.05) total protein, total protein/DNA, and RNA/DNA in both the jejunum and ileum. It also increased (p < 0.05) the concentrations of carnosine and citrulline in the jejunal mucosa, as well as citrulline and cysteine concentrations in the ileum. Conversely, Gln supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) Gln concentrations in both the jejunum and ileum, along with beta-aminoisobutyric acid and 1-Methylhistidine concentrations, specifically in the ileum. Subsequent research revealed that Gln supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the mRNA levels for glutathione-S-transferase omega 2 and interferon-beta in the duodenum. In addition, Gln supplementation led to an increase (p < 0.05) in the number of Lactobacillus genus in the colon, but a decrease (p < 0.05) in the level of HSP70 in the jejunum and the activity of diamine oxidase in plasma. Also, Gln supplementation reduced (p < 0.05) the mRNA levels of glutathione-S-transferase omega 2 and interferon stimulated genes, such as MX1, OAS1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5 in both the jejunum and ileum, and the numbers of Clostridium coccoides, Enterococcus genus, and Enterobacterium family in the colon. Moreover, Gln supplementation enhanced (p < 0.05) the concentrations of total protein, RNA/DNA, and total protein/DNA ratio in the longissimus dorsi muscle, the concentrations of citrulline, ornithine, arginine, and hydroxyproline, and the mRNA level of peptide transporter 1, while reducing the contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde and the mRNA level of glutathione-S-transferase omega 2 in the longissimus dorsi muscle. In conclusion, dietary Gln supplementation can improve the intestinal function of piglets and promote the growth of the longissimus dorsi muscle.

AB  - The increasing incidence of neurodegenerative and other diseases is considered to involve an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Water supplies are often characterized by excessive organic waste that is decomposed by bacteria, using dissolved oxygen, leading to oxygen depletion. The potassium content of these waters may also affect negatively the mitochondrial metabolism and cellular ROS formation. This work focused on characterizing mitochondrial autofluorescence changes, with flavoprotein origin, and fluorescence ROS signals measured using the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate indicator H(2)DCFDA. All signals were evoked by hypoxia or by the depolarizing agent KCl (20 mM), at the hippocampal mossy fiber synapses of CA3 area. It was observed that both hypoxia and KCl-induced depolarization elicited a small rise in the autofluorescence and ROS changes. The hypoxia-induced signals were maintained upon normal reoxygenation, but of those evoked by KCl, the autofluorescence signals recovered during washout, while the ROS changes were irreversible.

AB  - BACKGROUND. Glucosensing elements are widely distributed throughout the body and relay information about circulating glucose levels to the brain via the vagus nerve. However, while anatomical wiring has been established, little is known about the physiological role of the vagus nerve in glucosensing. The contribution of the vagus nerve to inflammation in the fetus is poorly understood. Increased glucose levels and inflammation act synergistically when causing organ injury, but their interplay remains incompletely understood. We hypothesized that vagotomy (Vx) will trigger a rise in systemic glucose levels and this will be enhanced during systemic and organ-specific inflammation. Efferent vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) should reverse this phenotype. METHODS. Near-term fetal sheep (n = 57) were surgically prepared using vascular catheters and ECG electrodes as the control and treatment groups (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Vx + LPS, Vx + LPS + selective efferent VNS). The experiment was started 72 h postoperatively to allow for post-surgical recovery. Inflammation was induced with LPS bolus intravenously (LPS group, 400 ng/fetus/day for 2 days; n = 23). For the Vx + LPS group (n = 11), a bilateral cervical vagotomy was performed during surgery; of these n = 5 received double the LPS dose, LPS800. The Vx + LPS + efferent VNS group (n = 8) received cervical VNS probes bilaterally distal from Vx in eight animals. Efferent VNS was administered for 20 min on days 1 and 2 +/10 min around the LPS bolus. Fetal arterial blood samples were drawn on each postoperative day of recovery (-72 h, -48 h, and -24 h) as well as at the baseline and seven selected time points (3-54 h) to profile inflammation (ELISA IL-6, pg/mL), insulin (ELISA), blood gas, and metabolism (glucose). At 54 h post-LPS, a necropsy was performed, and the terminal ileum macrophages' CD11c (M1 phenotype) immunofluorescence was quantified to detect inflammation. The results are reported for p < 0.05 and for Spearman R2 > 0.1. The results are presented as the median (IQR). RESULTS. Across the treatment groups, blood gas and cardiovascular changes indicated mild septicemia. At 3 h in the LPS group, IL-6 peaked. That peak was decreased in the Vx + LPS400 group and doubled in the Vx + LPS800 group. The efferent VNS sped up the reduction in the inflammatory response profile over 54 h. The M1 macrophage activity was increased in the LPS and Vx + LPS800 groups only. The glucose and insulin concentrations in the Vx + LPS group were, respectively, 1.3-fold (throughout the experiment) and 2.3-fold higher vs. control (at 3 h). The efferent VNS normalized the glucose concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. The complete withdrawal of vagal innervation resulted in a 72-h delayed onset of a sustained increase in glucose for at least 54 h and intermittent hyperinsulinemia. Under the conditions of moderate fetal inflammation, this was related to higher levels of gut inflammation. The efferent VNS reduced the systemic inflammatory response as well as restored both the concentrations of glucose and the degree of terminal ileum inflammation, but not the insulin concentrations. Supporting our hypothesis, these findings revealed a novel regulatory, hormetic, role of the vagus nerve in the immunometabolic response to endotoxin in near-term fetuses.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of memory and a general cognitive decline leading to dementia. AD is characterized by changes in the behavior of the genome and can be traced across multiple brain regions and cell types. It is mainly associated with beta-amyloid deposits and tau protein misfolding, leading to neurofibrillary tangles. In recent years, however, research has shown that there is a high complexity of mechanisms involved in AD neurophysiology and functional decline enabling its diverse presentation and allowing more questions to arise. In this study, we present a computational approach to facilitate brain region-specific analysis of genes and biological processes involved in the memory process in AD. Utilizing current genetic knowledge we provide a gene set of 265 memory-associated genes in AD, combinations of which can be found co-expressed in 11 different brain regions along with their functional role. The identified genes participate in a spectrum of biological processes ranging from structural and neuronal communication to epigenetic alterations and immune system responses. These findings provide new insights into the molecular background of AD and can be used to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap and allow for new therapeutic hypotheses.

AB  - Glucose is a major energy substrate for porcine adipocytes and also serves as a regulatory signal for adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. In this study, we combined transcriptome and metabolome analyses to reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms of high glucose (HG) on adipogenesis by comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) identified in porcine adipocytes. Results showed that HG (20 mmol/L) significantly increased fat accumulation in porcine adipocytes compared to low glucose (LG, 5 mmol/L). A total of 843 DEGs and 365 DAMs were identified. Functional enrichment analyses of DEGs found that multiple pathways were related to adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and immune-inflammatory responses. PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, ChREBP, and FOS were identified as the key hub genes through module 3 analysis, and PPAR gamma acted as a central regulator by linking genes involved in lipid metabolism and immune-inflammatory responses. Gene-metabolite networks found that PPAR gamma-13-HODE was the most important interaction relationship. These results revealed that PPAR gamma could mediate the cross-talk between adipogenesis and the immune-inflammatory response during adipocyte maturation. This work provides a comprehensive view of the regulatory mechanisms of glucose on adipogenesis in porcine adipocytes.

AB  - Background: Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR2/4) on microglia have been found as important regulators in the inflammatory response during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In China, traditional Chinese medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) and its some components are considered to be effective in rescuing cerebral I/R injury through clinical practice.
   Hypothesis/Purpose: Here we examined the effect of Salvianolic acid A (SAA), a monomer compound in the water extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza, on TLR2/4 of microglia and its mediated inflammatory injury during cerebral I/R in vivo and in vitro.
   Study Design: For exploring the effect of SAA on cerebral I/R and TLR2/4, classic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and oxygen glucose deprivation / reoxygenation (OGD/R) model of co-culture with primary hippocampal neurons and microglia in vitro were used. Signal pathway research and gene knockout have been applied to further explain its mechanism.
   Methods: The evaluation indexes of I/R injury included infarct size, edema degree and pathology as well as primary hippocampal neurons and microglia culture, ELISA, western, RT-PCR, HE staining, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, siRNA gene knockout were also employed.
   Results: SAA significantly improved the degree of brain edema and ischemic area in I/R rats accompanied by decreases in levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Pathological staining revealed that SAA could reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and mcirogila activation after reperfusion. Both protein and gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in ischemic hemisphere were obviously inhibited by SAA treatment while changes were not found in the non-ischemic hemisphere. In order to further study its mechanism, OGD/R model was used to mimic inflammatory damage of ischemic tissue by co-culturing primary rat hippocampal neurons and microglial cells. It was found that SAA also inhibited the protein and gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4 after OGD/R injury in microglia. After TLR2/4 knockout, the inhibitory effect of SAA on IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels in cell supernatant and neuron apoptosis were significantly weakened in each dose group. Moreover, expression levels of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), NF kappa B, IL-1 beta and IL-6 in TLR2/4 mediated inflammatory pathway were reduced with SAA treatment.
   Conclusion: SAA could significantly reduce the inflammatory response and injury in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in vivo and in vitro, and its mechanism may be through the inhibition of TLR2/4 and its related signal pathway.

AB  - Pereskia sacharosa Griseb. is a plant used in traditional herbal medicine to treat inflammation. We analyzed the phenolic content of P. sacharosa leaves (EEPs) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of EEPs and its flavonoid fraction (F10) in animal models subjected to acute neuroinflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Coronal brain sections of C57BL/6JN male mice or Wistar male rats administered with EEPs or F10 before LPS were subjected to in situ hybridization to determine c-fos and CD14 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus or GABA(A) gamma 2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus. Theta oscillations were recorded every 6 h in the hippocampus of Wistar rats. In total, five flavonoids and eight phenolic acids were identified and quantified in P. sacharosa leaves. Either EEPs or F10 crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain and reduced the mRNA expression of c-fos, CD14, and GABA(A) gamma 2. A decrease in theta oscillation was observed in the hippocampus of the LPS group, while the F10 + LPS group overrode the LPS effect on theta activity. We conclude that the bioactive compounds of P. sacharosa reduce the central response to inflammation, allowing the early return of ambulatory activity and well-being of the animal.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lignosus rhinocerus, also known as Tiger Milk Mushroom has been used tradi-tionally to treat a variety of human conditions, including asthma, diabetes, respiratory disease, skin allergy, and food poisoning. The reported activities of Lignosus rhinocerus extracts include anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-asthmatic, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, neuroprotection, and immune modulation effects. However, its effect on human skin is not well documented, including human skin exposed to ultraviolet light (UV). Exposure to UV can trigger various cellular responses, including inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell death, and cellular aging.Aim of the study: The study aims to investigate the effects of methanolic extract prepared from cultured Lignosus rhinocerus (herein referred to as TM02 and its methanol extract as TM02-ME) on UV-irradiated human keratinocytes.Materials and methods: Powdered stock of TM02 was dissolved and sequentially extracted with different solvents to prepare the extracts and the methanol extract was subsequently characterized based on its bio-activities on HaCaT human keratinocytes. The keratinocytes were pre-treated with the methanol extract followed by UV -irradiation. Cellular responses of the HaCaT cells such as cell viability, DNA damage, as well as gene and protein expressions that were responsive to the treatments, were characterized by using bio-assays, including reverse-transcription based PCR, Western blot, cell viability, and mitochondrial Cytochrome C release assays.Results: TM02-ME protected HaCaT cells from UV-induced DNA damage and cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-treatment of HaCaT cells with TM02-ME led to a 39% reduction of cyclobutane pyrimidine di-mers (CPD) and up-regulated the gene expression of REV1 and SPINK5 in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells when compared to the control. In addition, TM-02-ME treated HaCaT cells increased the expression of BCL-XL and BCL-2 proteins which coincided with the down-regulation of mitochondrial Cyt. C release in the UV-B irradiated HaCaT cells. The results were further supported by data that showed the stable clones of HaCaT cells stably expressed BCL-XL were resistant to UVB-induced cell death.Conclusions: -The results showed that TM02-ME confers photoprotective activities to UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells, leading to a reduction in DNA damage and cell death as well as up-regulated the expression of REV1 and SPINK5 which are involved in DNA repair and skin barrier function, respectively. The up-regulation of pro-survival members of the BCL-2 family by TM02-ME confers protection against UVB-induced cell death.

AB  - Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a lipid carrier in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems (CNSs). Lipid-loaded ApoE lipoprotein particles bind to several cell surface receptors to support membrane homeostasis and brain injury repair. In the brain, ApoE is produced predominantly by astrocytes, but it is also abundantly expressed in most neurons of the CNS. In this study, we addressed the role of ApoE in the hippocampus in mice, focusing on its role in response to radiation injury. To this aim, 8-week-old, wild-type, and ApoE-deficient (ApoE-/-) female mice were acutely whole-body irradiated with 3 Gy of X-rays (0.89 Gy/min), then sacrificed 150 days post-irradiation. In addition, age-matching ApoE-/- females were chronically whole-body irradiated (20 mGy/d, cumulative dose of 3 Gy) for 150 days at the low dose-rate facility at the Institute of Environmental Sciences (IES), Rokkasho, Japan. To seek for ApoE-dependent modification during lineage progression from neural stem cells to neurons, we have evaluated the cellular composition of the dentate gyrus in unexposed and irradiated mice using stage-specific markers of adult neurogenesis. Our findings indicate that ApoE genetic inactivation markedly perturbs adult hippocampal neurogenesis in unexposed and irradiated mice. The effect of ApoE inactivation on the expression of a panel of miRNAs with an established role in hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as its transcriptional consequences in their target genes regulating neurogenic program, have also been analyzed. Our data show that the absence of ApoE-/- also influences synaptic functionality and integration by interfering with the regulation of mir-34a, mir-29b, and mir-128b, leading to the downregulation of synaptic markers PSD95 and synaptophysin mRNA. Finally, compared to acute irradiation, chronic exposure of ApoE null mice yields fewer consequences except for the increased microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Exploring the function of ApoE in the hippocampus could have implications for developing therapeutic approaches to alleviate radiation-induced brain injury.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ononin is a flavonoid compound found in several medicinal plants, including Astragalus membranaceus, Sophora flavescens, and Ononis spinosa. These plants have been traditionally used in various parts of the world for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor effects. Major depression is a common, long-lasting, and recurrent psychiatric disorder with a high suicide rate. Naturally occurring flavonoids treat depression via poorly understood mechanisms.Aim of the study: The present study aimed to determine whether ononin conferred an antidepressant-like effect in PC12 cell models and chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced depressive rat models and to explore its possible mechanisms. Materials and methods: Depression-related behaviors were measured using sucrose preference, tail suspension and open-field tests. Furthermore, to explore these mechanisms, we employed in vitro and in vivo assay methods, including neurite outgrowth, western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and staining methods.Results: Treatment with ononin or BDNF significantly increased PC12 cells' neuronal growth and differentiation. Furthermore, ononin promotes the activation of TrkB and growth factors and upregulates the PI3K/Akt and BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathways. The in vitro results were consistent with CMS-induced depressive rat models, in which ononin treatment significantly decreased depression-like behaviors and activated TrkB, growth factors, and BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathways in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Depression-induced microscopic alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats with CMS-induced depression were also mitigated following ononin treatment. Conclusion: Based on these findings, we suggest that ononin is a promising antidepressant candidate for treating depression.

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative condition in the elderly, is marked by a deficit in macroautophagy/autophagy, leading to intracellular MAPT/tau accumulation. While ISG15 (ISG15 ubiquitin like modifier) has been identified as a regulator of selective autophagy in ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), its role in AD remains unexplored. Our study reveals elevated ISG15 levels in the brains of patients with sporadic AD and AD models in vivo and in vitro. ISG15 overexpression in cells and the hippocampus inhibited HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) activity through C-terminal LRLRGG binding to HDAC6. Consequently, this increased CTTN (cortactin) acetylation, disrupted CTTN and F-actin recruitment to lysosomes, and impaired autophagosome (AP)-lysosome (LY) fusion. These disruptions led to MAPT/tau accumulation, synaptic damage, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits. Conversely, ISG15 knockdown in our HsMAPT (human MAPT) pathology model restored HDAC6 activity, promoted AP-LY fusion, and improved cognitive function. This study identifies ISG15 as a key regulator of autophagic flux in AD, suggesting that targeting ISG15-mediated autophagy could offer therapeutic potential for AD.Abbreviation: AAV: adeno-associated virus; AD: Alzheimer disease; ALP: autophagy-lysosomal pathway; ANOVA: analysis of variance; AP: autophagosome; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; CHX: cycloheximide; CQ: chloroquine; CTTN: cortactin; FC: fear conditioning; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GRIN/NMDARs: N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA types; HDAC6: histone deacetylase 6; HEK293: human embryonic kidney 293; HsMAPT: human MAPT; IF: immunofluorescence; IHC: immunohistochemistry; IP: immunoprecipitation; ISG15: ISG15 ubiquitin like modifier; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LY: lysosome; MAPT: microtubule associated protein tau; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MWM: Morris water maze; NOR: novel object recognition; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; ZnF UBP: zinc finger ubiquitin-binding protein.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation in small ruminant is an efficient strategy to distribute spermatozoa for reproductive programmes, but this process reduces the fertility potential of frozen-thawed spermatozoa. The aim of the current research was to evaluate the impact of different concentrations of cysteamine (CYS) in soybean lecithin (SL)-based medium on postthawed buck semen quality and fertility potential. Semen samples were collected from five bucks, twice a week, then diluted in the SL-based extender containing different concentrations of CYS as follows: extender containing 0 mM (control, C0), 1 mM (C1), 2 mM (C2), 4 mM (C4) and 8 mM (C8) CYS. Motility characteristics, membrane integrity, abnormal morphology, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, viability, apoptotic-like changes, lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, ROS concentration, pregnancy rate and kidding rate were evaluated after freeze-thaw process. In results, C1 resulted in greater (p <= 0.05) total motility, progressive motility, average path velocity, membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, viability, pregnancy rate and kidding rate compared to the other groups. Furthermore, supplementation of freezing medium with 1 mM of CYS presented lower (p <= 0.05) apoptotic-like changes, lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation and ROS concentration compared to the other groups. On the other hand, C8 presented the least (p <= 0.05) total motility, progressive motility, average path velocity, membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity and viability as well as the highest (p <= 0.05) apoptotic-like changes, lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation and ROS concentration compared to the other groups. Therefore, supplementation of freezing medium with 1 mM CYS could be a helpful strategy to protect buck's spermatozoa quality and fertility potential during cryopreservation process.

AB  - Visual perception remains stable across saccadic eye movements, despite the concurrent strongly disruptive visual flow. This stability is partially associated with a reduction in visual sensitivity, known as saccadic suppression, which already starts in the retina with reduced ganglion cell sensitivity. However, the retinal circuit mechanisms giving rise to such suppression remain unknown. Here, we describe these mechanisms using electrophysiology in mouse, pig, and macaque retina, 2-photon calcium imaging, computational modeling, and human psychophysics. We find that sequential stimuli, like those that naturally occur during saccades, trigger three independent suppressive mechanisms in the retina. The main mechanism is triggered by contrast-reversing sequential stimuli and originates within the receptive field center of ganglion cells. It does not involve inhibition or other known suppressive mechanisms like saturation or adaptation. Instead, it relies on temporal filtering of the inherently slow response of cone photoreceptors coupled with downstream nonlinearities. Two further mechanisms of suppression are present predominantly in ON ganglion cells and originate in the receptive field surround, highlighting another disparity between ON and OFF ganglion cells. The mechanisms uncovered here likely play a role in shaping the retinal output following eye movements and other natural viewing conditions where sequential stimulation is ubiquitous.

AB  - Sulfide-releasing compounds reduce reperfusion injury by decreasing mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species production. We previously characterised ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM), a clinically used copper chelator, as a sulfide donor in rodents. Here we assessed translation to large mammals prior to clinical testing. In healthy pigs an intravenous ATTM dose escalation revealed a reproducible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship with minimal adverse clinical or biochemical events. In a myocardial infarction (1-h occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery)-reperfusion model, intravenous ATTM or saline was commenced just prior to reperfusion. ATTM protected the heart (24-h histological examination) in a drug-exposure-dependent manner (r(2) = 0.58, p < 0.05). Blood troponin T levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in ATTM-treated animals while myocardial glutathione peroxidase activity, an antioxidant selenoprotein, was elevated (p < 0.05). Overall, our study represents a significant advance in the development of sulfides as therapeutics and underlines the potential of ATTM as a novel adjunct therapy for reperfusion injury. Mechanistically, our study suggests that modulating selenoprotein activity could represent an additional mode of action of sulfide-releasing drugs.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that tryptophan (Trp) regulated the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota. However, the detailed mode of action of Trp on the metabolism of intestinal commensal lactobacilli has not been well characterized. This study aimed to compare the effects of Trp concentration (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 mmol/L) in the media on the metabolism of Lactobacillus amylovorus and Limosilactobacillus mucosae isolated from the small intestine of piglets in vitro by high-performance liquid chromatography and metabolomics study. Results showed that increased Trp concentration increased (P < 0.05) net utilization of lysine, methionine, tryptophan, asparagine/aspartate, glutamine/glutamate, however, increased net production of glycine and taurine in Lac. amylovorus. In contrast, increased Trp concentration decreased (P < 0.05) net utilization of leucine, phenylalanine, and serine and increased (P < 0.05) net utilization of arginine and net production of ornithine and glycine in Lim. mucosae. Targeted metabolomics analysis showed that increased Trp concentration promoted (P < 0.05) the production of indole-3-lactic acid and 3-indoleacetic acid in the two lactobacilli strains. Increased concentration of Trp increased (P < 0.01) glycochenodeoxycholic acid metabolism in Lim. mucosae and glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid metabolism in Lac. amylovorus. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that metabolic pathways related to phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism were regulated by Trp in Lim. mucosae. These findings will help develop new biomarkers and dietary strategies to maintain the functionality of the gut microbiota aiming at improving the nutrition and health of both humans and animals.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Pfaffia glomerata roots are widely used in Brazil to treat various pathological conditions, particularly psychological disorders. 20-hydroxyecdysone, a phytosteroid present in the plant, can promote greater body resistance against exogenous and endogenous stressors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible neuroprotective effect of a 20-hydroxyecdysone-enriched fraction (20E-EF), obtained from P. glomerata roots, in an acute murine stress model.
   Material and methods: The 20E-EF was obtained by partitioning the methanol extract from P. glomerata roots with dichloromethane. Mice were treated by gavage with three doses of 20E-EF (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) and parameters of stress, anxiety, and depression were evaluated. Biomarkers of oxidative stress (enzymes, antioxidant profile, and oxidized molecules) were evaluated in the cortex, striatum (basal ganglia), and hippocampus of animals treated with 30 mg/kg of 20E-EF.
   Results: Mass spectrometry revealed that 20E was the main compound in the dichloromethane fraction. At a dose of 30 mg/kg, 20E-EF reduced stress, anxiety, and depression, while stimulating antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase), promoting antioxidant activity (antioxidant capacity, sulfhydryl groups, and reduced glutathione), and reducing oxidative markers (lipid peroxidation). In addition, 20E increased the concentration of NO in the striatum, possibly improving memory function and antioxidant activity.
   Conclusion: A 30 mg/kg dose of 20E-EF was able to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, in addition to maintaining antioxidant defenses of the cortex and striatum. These findings open new perspectives for under standing the therapeutic properties of P. glomerata and the underlying mechanism(s).

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Silybum marianum is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for treating liver disease. Silybin consisting of silybin A and silybin B, is a member of Silybum marianum, and exerts a therapeutic effect on many diseases. However, the protective effect of silybin on cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity and the stereoisomer contributing to the effect remain unknown. Aim of the study: The present study aimed to study the effect of silybin on cisplatin-induced neuronal injury, compare the difference of protective effect between silybin A and silybin B, and the potential mechanism. Materials and methods: High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to separate silybin A and silybin B. X-ray crystallographic analysis in combination with experimental and calculated ECD were performed to identify the structure of silybin A and silybin B. The toxicity of the silybin or cisplatin against murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was determined through MTT assay. The cell cycle and cell apoptosis were measured by PI staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively, and then subjected to flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was conducted to quantify the expression of proteins related to apoptosis and DNA damage. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the expression of DNA damage marker. In vivo experiment, the behavioral analysis was determined through pole test, swimming test and Morris water maze test. The index of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were examined to evaluate the antioxidant capacity in mice brain. Nissl staining and Tunel assay were used to detect the neuronal viability and apoptosis in hippocampus. Results: We successfully separated and identified silybin A and silybin B. We found both silybin A and silybin B alleviated cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HT22 cells, and silybin B was more effective. We chose silybin B for further mechanism investigation, and found silybin B alleviated DNA damage by enhancing phosphorylation of ATR and decreasing expression of gamma-H2AX. In the in vivo experiment, we observed that silybin B markedly improved the behavioral abnormalities in cisplatin-treated mice, reduced LPO level while increased SOD, GSH and T-AOC in mice brain tissue. Nissl staining and Tunel assay showed that silybin B alleviated cisplatin-induced hippocampal damage. Conclusions: These results suggest that silybin B might serve as a promising drug candidate in mitigating cisplatininduced neural injury in the brain and thereby improving the chemotherapeutic outcomes.

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the main pathogenic bacteria of Portunus trituberculatus and causes mass mortality of P. trituberculatus in aquaculture. In addition, low -salinity stimulation makes P. trituberculatus more susceptible to V. parahaemolyticus infections. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of resistance to V. parahaemolyticus in P. trituberculatus, comparative transcriptomic analysis of blood cells stimulated by low salinity and V. parahaemolyticus was carried out in this study. Transcriptome sequencing of low -salinity stress and pathogen infection at different time points was completed using Illumina sequencing technology. A total of 5827, 6432, 5362 and 1784 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in pathways related to ion transport and immunoregulation were found under low -salinity stress at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h compared with the control at 0 h. In contrast, 4854, 4814, 5535 and 6051 DEGs, which were significantly enriched in Toll and IMD signaling pathways, were found at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h compared with the control at 0 h under V. parahaemolyticus infection. Among them, 952 DEGs were shared in the two treatment groups, which were mainly involved in apoptosis and Hippo signaling pathway. Cluster analysis screened 103 genes that were differentially expressed in two factors that were negatively correlated, including immunoglobulin, leukocyte receptor cluster family, scavenger receptor, macroglobulin and other innate -immune -related genes. These results provide data support for the analysis of the mechanisms of immunity to V. parahaemolyticus under low -salinity stress in P. trituberculatus and help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which environmental factors affect immunity.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is among the most frequent severe brain diseases, with few treatment options available. Neuronal ferroptosis is an important pathogenic mechanism in epilepsy. As a result, addressing ferroptosis appears to be a promising treatment approach for epilepsy. Withaferin A (WFA) is a C28 steroidal lactone that has a broad range of neuroprotective properties. Nonetheless, the antiepileptic action of WFA and the intrinsic mechanism by which it inhibits ferroptosis following epilepsy remain unknown. Purpose: This study aimed at investigating to the antiepileptic potential of WFA in epilepsy, as well as to propose a potential therapeutic approach for epilepsy therapy. Methods: We conducted extensive research to examine the impacts of WFA on epilepsy and ferroptosis, using the kainic acid (KA)-treated primary astrocyte as an in vitro model and KA-induced temporal lobe epilepsy mice as an in vivo model. To analyze the neuroprotective effects of WFA on epileptic mice, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, Nissl staining, and neurological function assessments such as the Morris water maze (MWM) test, Ymaze test, Elevated-plus maze (O-maze) test, and Open field test were used. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the neuroprotective effect of WFA in epilepsy was investigated using the transcriptomics analysis and verified on epileptic patient and epileptic mouse samples using Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. In addition, WB, IF staining and specific antagonists/agonists were used to investigate astrocyte polarization and the regulatory signaling pathways involved. More critically, ferroptosis was assessed utilizing lipocalin-2 (LCN2) overexpression cell lines, siRNA knockdown, JC-1 staining, WB, IF staining, flow cytometry, electron microscopy (TEM), and ferroptosis-related GSH and MDA indicators. Results: In this study, we observed that WFA treatment reduced the number of recurrent seizures and time in seizure, and the loss of neurons in the hippocampal area in in epileptic mice, and even improved cognitive and anxiety impairment after epilepsy in a dose depend. Furthermore, WFA treatment was proven to enhance to the transformation of post-epileptic astrocytes from neurotoxic-type A1 to A2 astrocytes in both in vivo and in vitro experiments by inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /AKT signaling pathway. At last, transcriptomics analysis in combination with functional experimental validation, it was discovered that WFA promoted astrocyte polarity transformation and then LCN2 in astrocytes, which inhibited neuronal ferroptosis to exert neuroprotective effects after epilepsy. In addition, we discovered significant astrocytic LCN2 expression in human TLE patient hippocampal samples. Conclusions: Taken together, for the first, our findings suggest that WFA has neuroprotective benefits in epilepsy by modulating astrocyte polarization, and that LCN2 may be a novel potential target for the prevention and treatment of ferroptosis after epilepsy.

AB  - Neurons that lose part of their afferent input remodel their synaptic connections. While cellular and molecular mechanisms of denervation-induced changes in excitatory neurotransmission have been identified, little is known about the signaling pathways that control inhibition in denervated networks. In this study, we used mouse entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of both sexes to study the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in denervation-induced plasticity of inhibitory neurotransmission. In line with our previous findings in vitro, an entorhinal cortex lesion triggered a compensatory increase in the excitatory synaptic strength of partially denervated dentate granule cells. Inhibitory synaptic strength was not changed 3 days after the lesion. These functional changes were accompanied by a recruitment of microglia in the denervated hippocampus, and experiments in tissue cultures prepared from TNF-reporter mice [C57BL/6-Tg(TNFa-eGFP)] showed increased TNF alpha expression in the denervated zone. However, inhibitory neurotransmission was not affected by scavenging TNF alpha with a soluble TNF receptor. In turn, a decrease in inhibition, i.e., decreased frequencies of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, was observed in denervated dentate granule cells of microglia-depleted tissue cultures. We conclude from these results that activated microglia maintain the inhibition of denervated dentate granule cells and that TNF alpha is not required for the maintenance of inhibition after denervation.

AB  - Simple Summary Energy feeds such as corn, wheat, and barley usually contain large amounts of raw starch, which is generally required to be extruded for animals. In addition, amylase preparations are widely added into the diet to degrade raw starch and promote its digestion in livestock animals. The in vitro degradation of corn starch could be a strategy for improving the starch digestion, as it is unknown whether the starch structure and its in vivo digestion could be improved by adding amylase during extrusion, regulating the extrusion moisture content. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of extruded corn with added amylase under different moisture conditions on the growth performance, intestinal function, and microbiome of weaning piglets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of extruded corn with added amylase under different moisture conditions on the growth performance, intestinal function, and microbiome of weaning piglets. Fourty-eight 24-day-old weaning piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, weaned at 22 +/- 1 d) with an initial body weight of 6.76 +/- 0.15 kg were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments with six replicates per treatment and two pigs per replicate: (1) NL (adding 7.5% water before corn extrusion, negative treatment with low moisture); (2) NH (adding 15.0% water before corn extrusion, negative treatment with high moisture); (3) PL (adding 7.5% water and 4 kg/t alpha-amylase before corn extrusion, positive treatment with low moisture); and (4) PH (adding 15% water and 4 kg/t alpha-amylase before corn extrusion, positive treatment with high moisture). Results showed that amylase supplementation (4 vs. 0 kg/t) increased the contents of small molecular oligosaccharides of extruded corn (p < 0.05). Amylase supplementation significantly improved the average daily feed intake, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, crude protein, gross energy, crude fat, ash, phosphorus, and calcium, and also increased the activities of jejunal trypsin, alpha-amylase, lipase, sucrase, maltase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, improved the duodenal, jejunal and ileal morphology, and increased the relative mRNA expressions of the ZO-1, OCLN, SGLT1, and GLUT2 genes in the jejunum (p < 0.05), whereas it decreased the contents of isobutyric acid in cecal digesta, as well as acetic acid and isobutyric acid in colonic digesta (p < 0.05). Moreover, the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that piglets fed extruded corn with added enzymes contained less intestinal pathogenic bacteria, such as Holdemanella and Desulfovibrio, compared with piglets fed just extruded corn. In summary, the results of the present study indicated that the supplementation of alpha-amylase during the conditioning and extruding process of corn increased the small molecular oligosaccharide content of corn starch. Moreover, piglets receiving extruded enzyme-added corn had better growth performance, which was associated with the improved intestinal digestive and absorptive function, as well as the intestinal microbiome.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The significant contribution of rumen microbiota to the balance of the innate immunity of rumen epithelium has been extensively verified. As the natural rumen microbial metabolites, information regarding the immunoprotective effects of different conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers on ruminal epithelial cells (RECs) is limited. In this study, the 100 mu M trans-10,cis-12-CLA exerted better anti-inflammatory effects than the cis-9,trans-11-CLA by significantly downregulating the expression of genes related to inflammation, cell proliferation and migration in RECs upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The trans-10,cis-12-CLA, but not cis-9,trans-11-CLA, significantly suppressed the biological signals of gene ontology (GO) terms' response to lipopolysaccharide, the regulation of signal transduction and cytokine production and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways NF-kappa B, chemokine, NOD-like receptor, Hippo, PI3K-Akt, TGF-beta and Rap1 signaling in RECs upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, pretreatment with trans-10,cis-12-CLA significantly reduced the expression of lipogenic genes and the biosynthesis of the unsaturated fatty acid pathway in RECs compared with the LPS group, however, cis-9,trans-11-CLA exhibited the opposite results. These results suggest the distinct isomer differences of CLA in the regulation of inflammatory responses and adipocytokine signaling in RECs and will provide important references for determining their target use in the future.

AB  - Background: Cycloastragenol (CAG), a compound extracted from Astragalus, is known for its telomerase activation and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties. However, its potential pharmacological effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to explore potential targets and molecular mechanisms for the role of CAG in alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Methods: CAG was administered to 5 x FAD mice. The senescent cell count was verified by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining. The impact of CAG on microglial phagocytosis was assessed by in vitro and in vivo assays. The potential targets of CAG were identified by network pharmacology and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). The underlying mechanism was validated by molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and western blotting. Results: CAG effectively ameliorated cognitive impairments and microglial senescence in 5 x FAD mice. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that CAG modulated microglial phagocytic activity and reduced hippocampal A beta deposition The analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data of AD patients reported 13 microglial targets for AD intervention. Phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) was identified as the target through which CAG regulated microglial activity by utilizing network pharmacology, molecular docking and SPR. Western blotting revealed that the PDE4B/CREB/BDNF pathway may mediate the regulatory effect of CAG. Conclusion: CAG can enhance microglial phagocytosis and alleviate memory dysfunction and amyloid plaque pathology. Our findings suggest that CAG may regulate microglial function through its interaction with PDE4B, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - The Junggar Bactrian camel, a primitive indigenous breed in China, exhibits low reproductive efficiency under natural grazing conditions. This is partly attributed to the development of the epididymis and the quality of semen, both of which directly affect reproductive performance. The epididymis is a key male reproductive organ responsible for sperm storage and transport. However, the gene expression profile of camel epididymal tissue remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted whole-transcriptome sequencing of epididymal tissues from Junggar Bactrian camels before and after sexual maturity. A total of 683 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were identified, including TPM2, ITGA5, FASN, and ACP5, of which 415 were upregulated and 268 were downregulated. Additionally, 260 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DELncRNAs), including LOC123611838, LOC105083505, and LOC123614702, were identified, with 113 upregulated and 147 downregulated. An additional 11 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs), including eca-miR-206 and eca-miR-216a, were also detected. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed that key differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including TPM2, ITGA5, DDIT4, FASN, and ACP5, were mainly involved in pathways such as Cell Adhesion Molecules, Phospholipase D signaling, Cytokine-Cytokine Receptor Interaction, and Olfactory Transduction. This study presents a comprehensive whole-transcriptome analysis of the epididymis in Junggar Bactrian camels before and after sexual maturity, identifying key genes and regulatory pathways associated with epididymal development and reproductive function. These findings provide a theoretical foundation and valuable data for future research on reproductive performance and epididymal biology in Bactrian camels.

AB  - Gallic acid (GA) is known to be a natural phenolic compound with antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. This study aims to investigate the impact of GA against restraint stress-induced oxidative damage, anxiety-like behavior, neuronal loss, and spatial learning and memory impairment in male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into four groups (n = 8) and subjected to restraint stress for 4 h per day for 14 consecutive days or left undisturbed (control without inducing stress). In the treatment group, the animals were treated with 2 mL normal saline plus 100 mg/kg GA per day for 14 consecutive days (STR + GA group). The animals received the drug or normal saline by gavage 2 h before inducing restraint stress. ELISA assay measured oxidative stress factors. Elevated-plus maze and Morris water maze tests assessed anxiety-like behavior and spatial learning and memory, respectively. Also, neuronal density was determined using Nissl staining. Restraint stress significantly increased MDA and reduced the activities of GPX and SOD in the stressed rats, which were reserved by treatment with 100 mg/kg GA. Restraint stress markedly enhanced the anxiety-like behavior and spatial learning and memory impairment that were reserved by GA. In addition, treatment with GA reduced the neuronal loss in the stressed rats in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. Taken together, our findings suggest that GA has the potential to be used as a good candidate to attenuate neurobehavioral disorders as well as neuronal loss in the hippocampus and PFC induced by restraint stress via reducing oxidative damage.

AB  - Owing to the high prevalence of gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients, the gut-brain axis is considered to play a vital role in neurodevelopment diseases. Recent pieces of evidence have pointed to the usage of antibiotics at an early developmental stage to be a causative factor in autism due to its ability to induce critical changes in the gut microbiota. The purpose of the study is to determine the neuroprotective effect of capric acid (CA) on autism in antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis in rodents. In this study, the effect of CA was observed in penicillin V (31 mg/kg, p.o.) exposed animals by evaluating their autism-like behavioral and biochemical parameters. The establishment of gut dysbiosis was confirmed by 16 RNA sequencing, and behavioral tests were performed. Subsequently, oxidative stress, cytokine levels, and mitochondrial complex activities in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were analyzed. It was observed that the administration of penicillin V during the perinatal period produced gut dysbiosis and long-lasting changes in social behavior with symptoms of anxiety and depression and impaired learning and memory. Treatment with penicillin V also produced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Treatment with CA produced a positive effect on the alterations with maximum effects evident at 400 mg/kg, p.o. through amelioration of behavioral as well as biochemical changes. The current study concluded that CA could act as a likely candidate for the treatment and management of autism via modulation of gut dysbiosis-induced neurobehavioral parameters, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory markers.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Jiao-tai-wan (JTW), a classic herbal formula of traditional Chinese medicine recorded in Han Shi Yi Tong, has been used to alleviate sleep disorders since ancient times. In modern pharmacological research, JTW has been adopted for treating diabetes mellitus and even exerts antidepressant effects. However, the potential mechanisms deserve further elucidation. Aim of the study: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus combined with depressive disorder (DD) is continuing to increase, yet it is currently under-recognized and its treatment remains inadequate. The present study aims to explore the underlying therapeutics and mechanisms of JTW on DD. Materials and methods: Chronic restraint stress was used on db/db mice to construct a mouse model of DD. The therapeutic effects of JTW were assessed by glucolipid metabolic indexes, behavioral tests, and depressionrelated neurotransmitter levels. The inflammatory status and cell apoptosis of different mice were investigated and the changes in the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway were detected. Combining the results of fingerprinting with molecular docking, the active components of JTW were screened. A cellular model was constructed by intervention of glucose combined with corticosterone (CORT). The levels of apoptosis and depression-related neurotransmitters in HT-22 cells were examined, and the changes in the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway were tested. Finally, the activator and inhibitor of the PKA protein were used for reverse validation experiments. Results: JTW could improve the impaired glucose tolerance, lipid metabolism disorders, and depression-like symptoms in DD mice. Meanwhile, JTW could alleviate the inflammatory status, suppress the microglia activation, and improve hippocampal neuron apoptosis in DD mice. The dual effects of JTW might be associated with the activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Berberine (Ber) was identified for the in vitro experiment, it could reverse the apoptosis of HT-22 cells and up-regulate the depression-related neurotransmitter levels, and the effects of Ber were related to the activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway as well. Conclusion: JTW could exert both hypoglycemic and antidepressant effects through activating the cAMP/PKA/ CREB signaling pathway, its active component, Ber, could improve the damage to HT-22 cells induced by glucose combined with CORT via the activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Ber may be one of the effective components of the dual effects of JTW.

AB  - Theta and gamma oscillations in the medial temporal lobe are suggested to play a critical role for human memory formation via establishing synchrony in neural assemblies. Arguably, such synchrony facilitates efficient information transfer between neurons and enhances synaptic plasticity, both of which benefit episodic memory formation. However, to date little evidence exists from humans that would provide direct evidence for such a specific role of theta and gamma oscillations for episodic memory formation. Here, we investigate how oscillations shape the temporal structure of neural firing during memory formation in the medial temporal lobe. We measured neural firing and local field potentials in human epilepsy patients via micro-wire electrode recordings to analyze whether brain oscillations are related to co-incidences of firing between neurons during successful and unsuccessful encoding of episodic memories. The results show that phase-coupling of neurons to faster theta and gamma oscillations correlates with co-firing at short latencies (similar to 20-30 ms) and occurs during successful memory formation. Phase-coupling at slower oscillations in these same frequency bands, in contrast, correlates with longer co-firing latencies and occurs during memory failure. Thus, our findings suggest that neural oscillations play a role for the synchronization of neural firing in the medial temporal lobe during the encoding of episodic memories.

AB  - Soil fertility in mixed farming systems relies on the manure produced by livestock and its recycling in the entire system. In the particular case of crop-livestock system with grazing area, the proper functioning of the system also depends on the presence of nitrogen-fixing plants in the area where livestock grazes (the grazing land). In this paper, we study the impact of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and livestock management on the flux of manure exported outside the grazing land. We address this issue using a modeling approach. We consider a plant-soil model composed of a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that represents the grazing land. We assume that the manure produced by the grazing livestock can be partially exported as a fertilizer outside of this area. Through the mathematical analysis of the model, and analytical and numerical optimization, we then determine the optimal livestock management in terms of grazing rate and manure recycling percentage that lead to the maximal flux of exported manure. We focus more precisely on the role of nitrogen-fixing plants and their impact on the optimal livestock management. When grazing rate is high and the capacity of plants to fix nitrogen is important, we showed that it is necessary to recycle some of the manure produced by the livestock in the grazing land to maximize the flux of exported manure. On the contrary, if we can optimize both the grazing rate and the manure recycling percentage, then it is better to transfer all the produced manure and to adapt the grazing rate accordingly to minimize nitrogen losses from the soil. Finally, to maximize the flux of exported manure, it is also necessary to bring the system to a state in which the plants fix nitrogen. In this way, we can benefit from the nitrogen fixation which provides an additional input of nitrogen in the system.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a mysterious lethal multisystem neurodegenerative disease that gradually leads to the progressive loss of motor neurons. A recent non-contact dying-back injury mechanism theory for ALS proposed that the primary damage is an acquired irreversible intrafusal proprioceptive terminal Piezo2 channelopathy with underlying genetic and environmental risk factors. Underpinning this is the theory that excessively prolonged proprioceptive mechanotransduction under allostasis may induce dysfunctionality in mitochondria, leading to Piezo2 channelopathy. This microinjury is suggested to provide one gateway from physiology to pathophysiology. The chronic, but not irreversible, form of this Piezo2 channelopathy is implicated in many diseases with unknown etiology. Dry eye disease is one of them where replenishing synthetic proteoglycans promote nerve regeneration. Syndecans, especially syndecan-3, are proposed as the first critical link in this hierarchical ordered depletory pathomechanism as proton-collecting/distributing antennas; hence, they may play a role in ALS pathomechanism onset. Even more importantly, the shedding or charge-altering variants of Syndecan-3 may contribute to the Piezo2 channelopathy-induced disruption of the Piezo2-initiated proton-based ultrafast long-range signaling through VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Thus, these alterations may not only cause disruption to ultrafast signaling to the hippocampus in conscious proprioception, but could disrupt the ultrafast proprioceptive signaling feedback to the motoneurons. Correspondingly, an inert Piezo2-initiated proton-based ultrafast signaled proprioceptive skeletal system is coming to light that is suggested to be progressively lost in ALS. In addition, the lost functional link of the MyoD family of inhibitor proteins, as auxiliary subunits of Piezo2, may not only contribute to the theorized acquired Piezo2 channelopathy, but may explain how these microinjured ion channels evolve to be principal transcription activators.

AB  - Cardiomyocyte loss following myocardial infarction cannot be addressed with current clinical therapies. Cell therapy with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) is a potential approach to replace cardiomyocyte loss. However, engraftment rates in pre-clinical studies have been low, highlighting a need to refine current iPSC-CM technology. In this study, we demonstrated that inducing Yes-associated protein (YAP) by genetic and pharmacological approaches resulted in increased iPSC-CM proliferation and reduced apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. Interestingly, iPSC-CM maturation was differently affected by each strategy, with genetic activation of YAP resulting in a more immature cardiomyocyte-like phenotype not witnessed upon pharmacological YAP activation. Overall, we conclude that YAP activation in iPSC-CMs enhances cell survival and proliferative capacity. Therefore, strategies targeting YAP, or its upstream regulator the Hippo signalling pathway, could potentially be used to improve the efficacy of iPSC-CM technology for use as a future regenerative therapy in myocardial infarction.

AB  - Melatonin (MEL) is a neurohormone endowed with neuroprotective activity, exerted both directly on neuronal cells and indirectly through modulation of responsive glial cells. In particular, MEL's effects on microglia are receptor-mediated and in part dependent on SIRT1 activation. In the present study, we exploited the highly preserved cytoarchitecture of organotypic brain cultures (OC) to explore the effects of MEL on hippocampal microglia in a 3D context as compared to a single cell type context represented by the human HMC3 cell line. We first evaluated the expression of MEL receptor MT1 and SIRT1 and then investigated MEL action against an inflammatory stimulation with LPS: OCs were cultured for a total of 2 weeks and during this time exposed to 0.1 mu g/mL of LPS for 24 h either on day 1 (LPS 1 degrees) or on day 11 (LPS 11 degrees). MEL was added immediately after plating and kept for the entire experiment. Under these conditions, both MEL and LPS induced amoeboid microglia. However, the same round phenotype matched different polarization features. LPS increased the number of nuclear-NF-kB+ round cells and MEL alone or in combination with LPS increased BDNF+ round microglia. In addition, MEL contrasted LPS effects on NF-kB expression. Data from HMC3 microglia confirmed MEL's anti-inflammatory effects against LPS in terms of CASP1 induction and BDNF release, identifying SIRT1 as a mediator. However, no effects were evident for MEL alone on HMC3 microglia. Overall, our results point to the importance of the multicellular context for full MEL activity, especially in a preventive view, and support the use of OCs as a favorable model to explore inflammatory responses.

AB  - Now astrocytes appear to be the key contributors to the pathophysiology of major depression. Evidence in rodents shows that chronic stress is associated with a decreased expression of astrocytic GFAP-immunoreactivity within the cortex in addition to changes in the complexity and length of astrocyte processes. Furthermore, postmortem brains of individuals with depression have revealed a decrease in astrocyte density. Notably, astrocytes are extensively coupled to one another through gap junctions to form a network, or syncytium, and we have previously demonstrated that syncytial isopotentiality is a mechanism by which astrocytes function as an efficient system with respect to brain homeostasis. Interestingly, the question of how astrocyte network function changes following chronic stress is yet to be elucidated. Here, we sought to examine the effects of chronic stress on network-level astrocyte (dys)function. Using a transgenic aldh1l1-eGFP astrocyte reporter mouse, a six-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm as a rodent model of major depression, and immunohistochemical approaches, we show that the morphology of individual astrocytes is altered by chronic stress exposure. Additionally, in astrocyte syncytial isopotentiality measurement, we found that UCMS impairs the syncytial coupling strength of astrocytes within the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex-two brain regions that have been implicated in the regulation of mood. Together, these findings reveal that chronic stress leads to astrocyte atrophy and impaired gap junction coupling, raising the prospect that both individual and network-level astrocyte functionality are important in the etiology of major depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Naringenin, a natural flavonoid, exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties; however, its potential effect on VaD remain unclear. Herein, the purpose of present study was to elucidate whether naringenin attenuates cognitive dysfunction in VaD via inhibiting hippocampal oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and promoting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) signaling pathway. A rat model of VaD was established by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion [2-vessel occlusion (2VO)]. Behavioral performance analyses results revealed that administration of naringenin improves cognitive impairment in rats with VaD according to the new object recognition test and the Morris water maze test. In addition, naringenin attenuated hippocampal oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species generation, decreasing malondialdehyde content and recombinant reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (Romo-1) expression, and increasing superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in the hippocampus of VaD rats. Moreover, naringenin decreased the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) levels and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) levels in the hippocampus of 2VO surgery-treated rats, attenuating hippocampal inflammatory response during VaD. Furthermore, naringenin promoted synaptophysin (SYP), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), N-methyl-Daspartic acid receptor 1 (NR1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) expressions levels in hippocampus of VaD rats. Collectively, these findings indicated that naringenin mitigates cognitive impairment in VaD rats partly via inhibiting hippocampal oxidative stress and inflammatory response and restoring NMDARs signaling pathway.

AB  - Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavoring substance added to many ready-to-eat foods and has known neurotoxic effects. This study was performed in order to examine the potential toxic effect of MSG on neurons in various regions of the hippocampus in prepubertal rats. It also investigated the protective effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahex-aenoic acid (DHA) on brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), n-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R), and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) expression in the brain, using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods. Six female prepubertal Wistar albino rats were used in each group. Group 1, the control group, received 0.9% saline solution subcutaneously (sc) on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Group 2 received 4 mg/g MSG sc on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Group 3 received MSG + EPA (4 mg/g sc on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Oral 300 mg/kg for 9 d), while Group 4 received MSG + DHA (4 mg/g sc on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 and 300 mg/kg orally for 9 d, respectively). At the end of the ninth day the hippocampal regions of the brain were removed and either fixed for immunohistochemical staining or stored at -80 degrees C for biochemical parameter investigation. BDNF, NMDA-R, and NPY expression results were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. According to our findings, neurons in the control group hippocampal CA1 and DG regions exhibited strong BDNF, NPY, and NMDA-R reactions, while an expression in both regions decreased in the MSG group (p < 0.00). However, in the MSG-EPA and MSG-DHA groups, BDNF, NPY, and NMDA-R immunoreactions in neurons in the same region were similar to those of the control group (p = 0.00). No significant difference was observed in terms of expression in hippocampal neurons between the MSG-EPA and MSG-DHA groups (p > 0.00). In conclusion, since MSG caused a decrease in BDNF, NMDA-R, and NPY neural signaling molecules in the CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus of prepubertal rats compared to the control group, care is required over the consumption of MSG, since it may affect memory-related neurons in these age groups. In addition, we concluded that the use of omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA in addition to MSG may protect against the neurotoxic effects of MSG.

AB  - Preeclampsia affects 5-7% of all pregnancies and contributes to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. In addition to the short-term effects of preeclampsia, preeclampsia can exert long-term adverse effects on offspring. Numerous studies have demonstrated that offspring of preeclamptic women exhibit cognitive deficits from childhood to old age. However, effective ways to improve the cognitive abilities of these offspring remain to be investigated. The aim of this study was to explore whether environmental enrichment in early life could restore the cognitive ability of the offspring of a rat model of preeclampsia and to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which EE improves cognitive ability. L-NAME was used to establish a rat model of preeclampsia. The spatial learning and memory abilities and recognition memory of 56-day-old offspring were evaluated by the Morris water maze and Novel object recognition (NOR) task. Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis in the DG region of the hippocampus. qRT-PCR was performed to examine the expression levels of neurogenesis-associated genes, pre- and postsynaptic proteins and inflammatory cytokines. An enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay was performed to evaluate the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. The administration of L-NAME led to increased systolic blood pressure and urine protein levels in pregnant rats. Offspring in the L-NAME group exhibited impaired spatial learning ability and memory as well as NOR memory. Hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity were impaired in offspring from the L-NAME group. Furthermore, cell apoptosis in the hippocampus was increased in the L-NAME group. The hippocampus was skewed to a proinflammatory profile, as shown by increased inflammatory cytokine levels. EE improved the cognitive ability of offspring in the L-NAME group and resulted in increased hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic protein expression levels and decreased apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine levels. Environmental enrichment resolves cognitive impairment in the offspring of a rat model of preeclampsia by improving hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity and normalizing the apoptosis level and the inflammatory balance.

AB  - Soybean meal (SBM) is a premier source of protein for feeding food-producing animals. However, its nutritional value can be compromised by protein oxidation. In this study, a total of 54 sources of solvent extracted SBM (SSBM) and eight sources of mechanically extracted SBM (MSBM), collected from different commercial producers and geographic locations in the United States during the years 2020 and 2021, were examined by chemometric analysis to determine the extent of protein oxidation and its correlation with soybean oil extraction methods and non-protein components. The results showed substantial differences between SSBM and MSBM in the proximate analysis composition, protein carbonyl content, lipidic aldehydes, and antioxidants, as well as subtle differences between 2020 SSBM and 2021 SSBM samples in protein oxidation and moisture content. Correlation analysis further showed positive correlations between protein carbonyl content and multiple lipid parameters, including the ether extract, p-anisidine value, individual aldehydes, and total aldehydes. Among the antioxidants in SBM, negative correlations with protein carbonyl content were observed for total phenolic content and isoflavone glycoside concentrations, but not for Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), & alpha;-tocopherol, and & gamma;-tocopherol. Overall, soybean oil extraction methods, together with other factors such as enzyme treatment and environmental conditions, can significantly affect the proximate analysis composition, the protein and lipid oxidation status, and the antioxidant profile of SBM. Lipidic aldehydes and phenolic antioxidants play counteracting roles in the oxidation of soy protein. The range of protein carbonyl content measured in this study could serve as a reference to evaluate the protein quality of SBM from various sources used in animal feed.

AB  - Background: Malignant cell growth and chemoresistance, the main obstacles in treating gastrointestinal cancer (GIC), rely on the Hippo and p53 signalling pathways. However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of these pathways remain complex and poorly understood.
   Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and RT-qPCR were used to analyse the expression of RNF146, miR-3133 and key components of Hippo and p53 pathway. CCK-8, colony formation, drug sensitivity assays and murine xenograft models were used to investigate the effect of RNF146 and miR-3133 in GIC. Further exploration of the upstream regulatory mechanism was performed using bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter gene, immunoprecipitation assays and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP).
   Results: Clinical samples, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that RNF146 exerts oncogenic effects in GIC by regulating the Hippo pathway. Bioinformatics analysis identified a novel miRNA, miR-3133, as an upstream regulatory factor of RNF146. fluorescence in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR assays revealed that miR-3133 was less expressed in gastrointestinal tumour tissues and was associated with adverse pathological features. Functional assays and animal models showed that miR-3133 promoted the proliferation and chemotherapy sensitivity of GIC cells. miR-3133 affected YAP1 protein expression by targeting RNF146, AGK and CUL4A, thus activating the Hippo pathway. miR-3133 inhibited p53 protein degradation and extended p53's half-life by targeting USP15, SPIN1. BSP experiments confirmed that miR-3133 promoter methylation is an important reason for its low expression.
   Conclusion: miR-3133 inhibits GIC progression by activating the Hippo and p53 signalling pathways via multi-targets, including RNF146, thereby providing prognostic factors and valuable potential therapeutic targets for GIC.

AB  - Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an active role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), relaying important physiological information about their host tissues. Circulating EVs are protected from degradation, making them attractive AD biomarkers. However, it is unclear how circulating EVs relate to EVs isolated from disease-vulnerable brain regions. We developed a novel method for collecting EVs from the hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) of live mice. EVs (EVISF) were isolated via ultracentrifugation and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunogold labeling, and flow cytometry. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analyses were performed on EVISF cargo. EVISF were 40-150 nm in size and expressed CD63, CD9, and CD81. Using a model of cerebral amyloidosis (e.g. APPswe,PSEN1dE9 mice), we found protein concentration increased but protein diversity decreased with A deposition. Genotype, age, and A beta deposition modulated proteostasis- and immunometabolic-related pathways. Changes in the microglial EVISF proteome were sexually dimorphic and associated with a differential response of plaque associated microglia. We found that female APP/PS1 mice have more amyloid plaques, less plaque associated microglia, and a less robust- and diverse- EVISF microglial proteome. Thus, in vivo microdialysis is a novel technique for collecting EVISF and offers a unique opportunity to explore the role of EVs in AD.

AB  - With age, neural stem cell (NSC) function in the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) declines, reducing memory and cognitive function in males; however, the impact on females is not well understood. To obtain a global view of how age and sex impact the mouse V-SVZ, we constructed 3D montages after multiplex immunostaining, and used computer-based 3D image analysis to quantify data across the entire niche at 2, 18, and 22 months. We discovered dramatic sex differences in the aging of the V-SVZ niche vasculature, which regulates NSC activity: females showed increased diameter but decreased vessel density with age, while males showed decreased diameter and increased tortuosity and vessel density. Accompanying these vascular changes, males showed significant decline in NSC numbers, progenitor cell proliferation, and more disorganized migrating neuroblast chains with age; however, females did not. By examining the entire 3D niche, we found significant sex differences, with females being relatively spared through very old age.

AB  - Background Human patients often experience an episode of serious seizure activity, such as status epilepticus (SE), prior to the onset of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), suggesting that SE can trigger the development of epilepsy. Yet, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein (Lrp4), a receptor for proteoglycan-agrin, has been indicated to modulate seizure susceptibility. However, whether agrin-Lrp4 pathway also plays a role in the development of SE-induced TLE is not clear.Methods Lrp4 f/f mice were crossed with hGFAP-Cre and Nex-Cre mice to generate brain conditional Lrp4 knockout mice (hGFAP-Lrp4 -/- ) and pyramidal neuron specific knockout mice (Nex-Lrp4 -/- ). Lrp4 was specifically knocked down in hippocampal astrocytes by injecting AAV virus carrying hGFAP-Cre into the hippocampus. The effects of agrin-Lrp4 pathway on the development of SE-induced TLE were evaluated on the chronic seizure model generated by injecting kainic acid (KA) into the amygdala. The spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in mice were video monitored.Results We found that Lrp4 deletion from the brain but not from the pyramidal neurons elevated the seizure threshold and reduced SRS numbers, with no change in the stage or duration of SRS. More importantly, knockdown of Lrp4 in the hippocampal astrocytes after SE induction decreased SRS numbers. In accord, direct injection of agrin into the lateral ventricle of control mice but not mice with Lrp4 deletion in hippocampal astrocytes also increased the SRS numbers. These results indicate a promoting effect of agrin-Lrp4 signaling in hippocampal astrocytes on the development of SE-induced TLE. Last, we observed that knockdown of Lrp4 in hippocampal astrocytes increased the extracellular adenosine levels in the hippocampus 2 weeks after SE induction. Blockade of adenosine A1 receptor in the hippocampus by DPCPX after SE induction diminished the effects of Lrp4 on the development of SE-induced TLE.Conclusion These results demonstrate a promoting role of agrin-Lrp4 signaling in hippocampal astrocytes in the development of SE-induced development of epilepsy through elevating adenosine levels. Targeting agrin-Lrp4 signaling may serve as a potential therapeutic intervention strategy to treat TLE.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease that affects a growing number of elderly individuals worldwide. OAB-14, a novel chemical compound developed by our research group, has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials in patients with AD (approval no. YD-OAB220210). Previous studies have shown that OAB-14 enhances cognitive function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and ameliorates abnormal mitochondrial morphology in the hippocampus. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major risk factor for the development of AD, and maintaining healthy mitochondrial morphology and function is essential for improving the pathological changes and symptoms of AD. However, the protective effects of OAB-14 on mitochondria in AD and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of OAB-14 on the mitochondria of APP/PS1 transgenic mice and N2a/APP cells. Treatment with OAB-14 restored impaired mitochondrial function, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and N2a/APP cells. In APP/PS1 transgenic mice and N2a/APP cells, OAB14-treated elevated the expression and activity of SIRT3, decreased mitochondrial acetylation, and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) levels. OAB-14 also attenuated mitochondrial acetylation, improved mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, and mitigated mtDNA damage in a SIRT3-dependent manner. In addition, OAB-14 suppressed mitochondrial A beta accumulation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. This study provides further clarification on the potential therapeutic mechanisms of OAB-14 in the treatment of AD and lays the groundwork for future drug applications.

AB  - Glial scars have been observed following stab lesions in the spinal cord and brain but not observed and characterized in chemoconvulsant-induced epilepsy models. Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures and can be modeled in rodents. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) exposure, like other real-world organophosphate nerve agents (OPNAs) used in chemical warfare scenarios, can lead to the development of status epilepticus (SE). We have previously demonstrated that DFP-induced SE promotes epileptogenesis which is characterized by the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), gliosis, and neurodegeneration. In this study, we report classical glial scars developed in the piriform cortex, but not in the hippocampus, by 8 days post-exposure. We challenged both male and female rats with 4-5 mg/kg DFP (s.c.) followed immediately by 2 mg/kg atropine sulfate (i.m.) and 25 mg/kg pralidoxime (i.m.) and one hour later by midazolam (i.m). Glial scars were present in the piriform cortex/amygdala region in 73% of the DFP treated animals. No scars were found in controls. Scars were characterized by a massive clustering of reactive microglia surrounded by hypertrophic reactive astrocytes. The core of the scars was filled with a significant increase of IBA1 and CD68 positive cells and a significant reduction in NeuN positive cells compared to the periphery of the scars. There was a significantly higher density of reactive GFAP, complement 3 (C3), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) positive cells at the periphery of the scar compared to similar areas in controls. We found a significant increase in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CS-56) in the periphery of the scars compared to a similar region in control brains. However, there was no change in TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2 positive cells in or around the scars in DFP-exposed animals compared to controls. In contrast to stab-induced scars, we did not find fibroblasts (Thy1.1) in the scar core or periphery. There were sex differences with respect to the density of iNOS, CD68, NeuN, GFAP, C3 and CS-56 positive cells. This is the first report of cortical glial scars in rodents with systemic chemoconvulsant-induced SE. Further investigation could help to elucidate the mechanisms of scar development and mitigation strategies.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop a protocol to reduce the variation in gestation length and synchronise the onset of parturition in sows by using altrenogest in combination with double admin-istrations of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2 alpha). In total, 188 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred sows with parity numbers 3.1 +/- 1.6 were included in the experiment. The sows were classified into two groups: CONTROL (n = 94) and TREATMENT (n = 94). CONTROL sows were allowed to farrow naturally, and TREATMENT sows were orally administered 20 mg/day of altrenogest starting when they entered the farrowing house (107.0 +/- 2.0 days) until 113 (TREAT-113, n = 18), 114 (TREAT-114, n = 29) and 115 (TREAT-115, n = 47) days of gestation. The altrenogest-treated sows were administered PGF2 alpha twice 6 h apart at 24 h after the withdrawal of altrenogest. The litters were randomly selected (25 and 26 litters from CONTROL and TREATMENT groups, respectively) to determine individual body weight at birth and at 24 h after birth. Gestation length of sows that farrowed naturally averaged 115.1 days (range 111-118), whereas gestation length of altrenogest-treated sows averaged 115.1-116.3 days (range 114-118). The colostrum yield of sows averaged 4.25 +/- 1.19 kg and was not affected by the treatment (P > 0.05). Colostrum IgG in the CONTROL group was higher than in the TREAT-114 and TREAT-115 groups (P < 0.05) but did not differ significantly compared to the TREAT-113 group. The proportion of sows that farrowed during working hours (0700-1700 h) in the TREAT-113 group (72.3%) tended to be higher than in the CONTROL (46.4%, P = 0.053). The interval from the last altrenogest treatment until farrowing in the TREAT-113 group was longer than in the TREAT-114 and TREAT-115 groups (62.8, 40.7 and 34.6 h, respectively, P < 0.05). Similarly, the intervals from the first PGF2 alpha administration to the onset of parturition in the TREAT-113 group (38.8 +/- 3.8 h) was longer than TREAT-114 (21.9 +/- 3.5 h, P = 0.002) and TREAT-115 (25.5 +/- 3.7 h, P = 0.016) groups. However, the incidence of stillbirths in the TREAT-113, TREAT-114 and TREAT-115 groups was higher than in the CONTROL (16.4, 17.2, 11.8 and 5.8%, respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, altrenogest supplementation in combination with double administrations of PGF2a can reduce the variation in gestation length and synchronise the onset of parturition in sows. However, its side effects on the incidence of stillbirths should be considered. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple aspects of brain functioning, including arousal, motivation, and cognitive performance, are governed by circadian rhythmicity. Although the recent rise in the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled investigations into the macroscopic correlates of the diurnal brain processes, neuroanatomical studies are scarce. The current work investigated how time-of-day (TOD) impacts white (WM) and grey matter (GM) volumes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in a large dataset (N = 72) divided into two equal, comparable subsamples to assess the replicability of effects. Furthermore, we aimed to assess how the magnitude of these diurnal differences was related to actigraphy-derived indices of sleep health. The results extend the current knowledge by reporting that TOD is predominantly associated with regional WM volume decreases. Additionally, alongside corroborating previously observed volumetric GM decreases, we provide the first evidence for positive TOD effects. Higher replicability was observed for WM, with the only two replicated GM clusters being volumetric increases in the amygdala and hippocampus, and decreases in the retrosplenial cortex, with the latter more pronounced in individuals with shorter sleep times. These findings implicate the existence of region-specific mechanisms behind GM effects, which might be related to cognitive processes taking place during wakefulness and homeostatic sleep pressure.

AB  - As a small molecule flavonoid, astragalin (AST) has anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidation effects. However, the impact and molecular mechanism of AST in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still not clear. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of AST on APP/PS1 mice and A beta 25-35-injured HT22 cells. In this study, we found that AST ameliorated cognitive dysfunction, reduced hippocampal neuronal damage and loss, and A beta pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Subsequently, AST activated autophagy and up-regulated the levels of autophagic flux-related protein in APP/PS1 mice and A beta 25-35-induced injury in HT22 cells. Interestingly, AST down-regulated the phosphorylation level of PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway-related proteins, which was reversed by autophagy inhibitors 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) or Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1). At the same time, consistent with the impacts of Akt inhibitor MK2206 and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, inhibited levels of autophagy in A beta 25-35-injured HT22 cells were activated by the administration of AST. Taken together, these results suggested that AST played key neuroprotective roles on AD via stimulating PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway-mediated autophagy and autophagic flux. This study revealed a new mechanism of autophagy regulation behind the neuroprotection impact of AST for AD treatment.

AB  - Camellia petelotii (Merr.) Sealy is a rare medicinal and edible plant in China whose wild species have a narrow distribution range and poor adaptability to strong light. To explore the light-response mechanism, the transcriptome-and photosynthesis-related physical and chemical indicators of leaves were analyzed under gradient light intensity of three processing conditions (100, 300, 700 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) with 5 h of treatment in this study. A preliminary comparative analysis found that under strong light stress (700 PAR), the thylakoid morphology is abnormal in the leaves, the antioxidant system is damaged and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) contents are lower than those of leaves under the 300 PAR light treatment, the synthesis of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) protein members and the stability of the photosystem complex are reduced, and starch accumulation is also reduced. However, strong light stress promotes the endogenous synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) and soluble sugar accumulation. Our research revealed that 300 PAR is a relatively appropriate growth light condition and that strong light stress (700 PAR) causes damage to the photosystem of C. petelotii. This is the first study to determine the molecular mechanism of the C. petelotii leaf responds to strong light stress at the transcription level and provides important insights for the future scientific cultivation of C. petelotii.

AB  - Simple Summary The illegal hunting (poaching) of wildlife has persisted for decades and adversely effected wildlife populations in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia. It has not been clearly understood why illegal hunting has continued notwithstanding efforts to control it. Therefore, this study was conducted to understand why illegal hunting has persisted despite increased mitigation efforts. The study revealed that illegal hunting has continued because its main root causes are the critical need for survival and sustaining the livelihoods of local hunters, which were not adequately addressed. Furthermore, law enforcement, which was the main intervention measure, failed to adequately deter local hunters from poaching wildlife because it could not address the main root causes of illegal hunting. The study concluded that the illegal harvesting of resources in protected areas may persist when the local people's key motivations for illegal harvesting relate to their critical need to survive and maintain their livelihoods and the main mitigation efforts do not address these critical needs. These study findings are valuable in providing an understanding of how the critical need for survival and maintaining livelihoods and other factors influence the persistence of illegal hunting and in guiding the development of a strategy for the effective control of poaching in the Luangwa Valley.Abstract Decades of illegal hunting (poaching) have adversely affected wildlife populations and thereby limited sustainable wildlife conservation in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia. Despite intervention efforts to address the problem, the illegal hunting of wildlife has persisted. Therefore, this study was conducted to understand the persistence of illegal hunting by investigating the drivers of poaching and intervention measures using a mixed methods approach. Stratified random sampling was used to collect data from 346 respondents through structured questionnaires. Purposive sampling was used to collect data through nine focus group discussions and three in-depth interviews with experts. The study revealed that persistent illegal hunting was mainly driven by people's critical need for survival and sustaining their livelihoods and not by inadequate law enforcement as presumed by resource managers. Although law enforcement was the most prevalent intervention measure, it did not deter local illegal hunters because their main motivations for poaching were not effectively addressed. The key implication of these findings is that where the illegal harvesting of natural resources in protected areas by local resource users is driven by people's critical need for survival and a livelihood, which is ineffectively addressed, illegal harvesting may persist even with increased law enforcement. This study provides empirical evidence, novel conceptual knowledge and an understanding of how prevalent drivers of poaching and other factors may have influenced persistent illegal hunting in the Luangwa Valley.

AB  - Y Acetylcholine (ACh) levels are elevated in actively depressed subjects. Conversely, antagonism of either nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors can have antidepressant effects in humans and decrease stress-relevant behaviors in rodents. Consistent with a role for ACh in mediating maladaptive responses to stress, brain ACh levels increase in response to stressful challenges, whereas systemically blocking acetylcholinesterase (AChE, the primary ACh degradative enzyme) elicits depression-like symptoms in human subjects, and selectively blocking AChE in the hippocampus increases relevant behaviors in rodents. We used an ACh sensor to characterize stress-evoked ACh release, then used chemogenetic, optogenetic and pharmacological approaches to determine whether cholinergic inputs from the medial septum/diagonal bands of Broca (MSDBB) or ChAT-positive neurons intrinsic to the hippocampus mediate stress-relevant behaviors in mice. Chemogenetic inhibition or activation of MSDBB cholinergic neurons did not result in significant behavioral effects, while inhibition attenuated the behavioral effects of physostigmine. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation of septohippocampal terminals or selective chemogenetic activation of ChAT-positive inputs to hippocampus increased stress-related behaviors. Finally, stimulation of sparse ChAT-positive hippocampal neurons increased stress-related behaviors in one ChAT-Cre line, which were attenuated by local infusion of cholinergic antagonists. These studies suggest that ACh signaling results in maladaptive behavioral responses to stress if the balance of signaling is shifted toward increased hippocampal engagement.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Beneficial effects of neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) on cognition, emotions and behavior have been previously reported, suggesting its potential in the prevention and treatment of various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective actions of DHEAS against A beta toxicity in both cellular and animal models of AD. Methods: After optimizing the AD model in vitro, we investigated the DHEAS effects on the viability and death of primary mouse neurons exposed to toxic A beta 42 oligomers for 24 h. In order to extend our research to an in vivo study, we further tested the acute effects of intraperitoneal DHEAS administration on the A beta plaque density in different brain regions of 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model of AD. Results: In cell culture, DHEAS hampered the decrease in the neuronal viability caused by toxic A beta oligomers, primarily by influencing mitochondrial function and apoptosis. DHEAS also counteracted the increase in the mRNA expression of selected genes (PI3K, Akt, Bcl2, Bax), induced in neuronal culture by treatment with A beta 42 oligomers. Obtained data suggested the involvement of mitochondria, caspases 3 and 7, as well as the PI3K/Akt and Bcl2 signaling network in the antiapoptotic properties of DHEAS in neurons. Forty-eight hours after DHEAS treatment, a significantly lower number of A beta plaques was observed in the motor cortex but not in other brain areas of 3xTg-AD mice. Conclusions: Results indicated potential neuroprotective effects of DHEAS against A beta toxicity and accumulation, suggesting that DHEAS supplementation should be further studied as a novel option for AD prevention and/or treatment.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition in the brain has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and neuroinflammation generates AD progression. Therapeutic effects of anti-inflammatory approaches in AD are still under investigation. Curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, has demonstrated therapeutic potential in AD models. However, curcumin's anti-inflammatory molecular mechanisms and its associated cognitive impairment mechanisms in AD remain unclear. The high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) participates in the regulation of neuroinflammation. Herein, we attempted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of chronic oral administration of curcumin and HMGB1 expression in APP/PS1 transgenic mice AD model. We found that transgenic mice treated with a curcumin diet had shorter escape latencies and showed a significant increase in percent alternation, when compared with transgenic mice, in the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. Additionally, curcumin treatment could effectively decrease HMGB1 protein expression, advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (RAGE), Toll-like receptors-4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) in transgenic mice hippocampus. However, amyloid plaques detected with thioflavin-S staining in transgenic mice hippocampus were not affected by curcumin treatment. In contrast, curcumin significantly decreased GFAP-positive cells, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining. Taken together, these data indicate that oral administration of curcumin may be a promising agent to attenuate memory deterioration in AD mice, probably inhibiting the HMGB1-RAGE/TLR4-NF-kappa B inflammatory signalling pathway.

AB  - Postoperative neurocognitive impairment (POCD) is a common complication after surgery and anesthesia, especially in elderly patients. Avenanthramide-C (AVC) test is a vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule inhibitor with strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of AVC on POCD in aged rats to clarify the effect of AVC on POCD in aged rats. The aging rat model was established by continuous 200 mg/kg propofol anesthesia. Repeated propofol anesthesia could severely impair spatial learning ability, memory and cognitive function, and could promote hippocampal apoptosis, oxidative stress injury, neuroinflammation and ferroptosis in aging rats. In addition, AVC not only improved cognitive dysfunction, but also significantly inhibited apoptosis, neuroinflammatory response, ferroptosis and oxidative stress level in the hippocampus of aging rats induced by repeated anesthesia. Further mechanistic studies manifested that the above protective effects of AVC on aging rats induced by repeated propofol anesthesia may be achieved by activating Nrf2/ARE pathway activity. AVC pretreatment has a preventive effect on cognitive dysfunction induced by repeated propofol anesthesia in aging rats, and the preventive effect of AVC may be realized by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway activity. Our results demonstrate that AVC preconditioning reduces postoperative neuronal loss and neuroinflammation, activates the Nrf2/ARE pathway, reduces oxidative stress injury, and improves POCD in aged rats.

AB  - Pain relievers such as tramadol are among the most commonly prescribed around the world. However, Long-term tramadol use has been shown to cause neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment, which has limited its clinical use. Elderberry (EB), a plant extract widely recognized for its medicinal properties, is used in this study to investigate the effects of a plant-based diet on tramadol's adverse effects in the hippocampus region. The effects of EB oral diet on the devastating effects of tramadol on the hippocampus structure and function of 36 male albino rats were evaluated using behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological setups. Three groups (Control, Tramadol, and Tramadol+EB) were examined using behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological setups. The behavioral findings showed that the EB diet could improve most of the memory-related indices in Tramadol+EB compared to the Tramadol group. Regarding the fEPSP slope and population spike amplitude, these electrophysiological parameters returned to control levels in the Tramadol+EB group. Additionally, a decrease in caspase-3 expression was observed in hippocampal cells. While there was a reduction in astrogliosis in the Tramadol+EB group compared to the Tramadol group, no significant differences were noted in the morphological variations of astrocytes between the groups. In conclusion, although further studies are necessary to elucidate other aspects of EB's effects on the brain, it may be considered a potential neuroprotective agent in

AB  - ATP and other nucleotides are important glio-/neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. They bind to purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in various brain regions modulating various physiological and pathophysiological processes. P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels mediating excitatory postsynaptic responses whereas P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors mediating slow synaptic transmission. A variety of P2X and P2Y subtypes with distinct neuroanatomical localization provide the basis for a high diversity in their function. There is increasing evidence that P2 receptor signaling plays a prominent role in learning and memory and thus, in hippocampal neuronal plasticity. Learning and memory are time-of-day-dependent. Moreover, extracellular ATP shows a diurnal rhythm in rodents. However, it is not known whether P2 receptors have a temporal variation in the hippocampus. This study provides a detailed systematic analysis on spatial and temporal distribution of P2 in the mouse hippocampus. We found distinct spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the P2 receptors in different hippocampal layers. The temporal distribution of P2 receptors can be segregated into two large time domains, the early to mid-day and the mid to late night.

AB  - This article presents examples of cogeneration systems, which are standard equipment for biogas installations, based on the production of heat and electricity. It has been shown that in the case of microgeneration, ease of servicing and low installation costs are crucial. Characteristic aspects of developing concepts for mobile installations (small scale) that produce biogas, often with a simple container structure that is ready to be located in the economic infrastructure of the agricultural industry, were indicated. Recommendations for the operation of micro-biogas models are presented, which have the greatest impact on the advisability of using agricultural waste for energy purposes. A characteristic farm was selected, which has a substrate necessary for the process of methane fermentation of slurry from pig farming. The cogenerator, which constitutes a potential energy demand from the point of view of Polish agriculture in the context of renewable energy production, was analyzed. The research goal was to adapt the cogenerator to the conditions existing on a farm, which should meet the technical and technological expectations for the process of managing the produced methane with a value of 80% in agricultural biogas. The assessment of the impact of the amount of biogas on the level of CO, NO, NO2 and PM emissions was carried out at a constant engine speed for various load levels; the percentage of biogas was changed from 40 to approximately 70-80%, i.e., until significant knocking combustion was detected in the tested engines. As a result, the existing control and control system for the operation of the cogeneration unit prevents the most effective mode of operation of the research installation as a prosumer micro-installation. When the AG20P biogas unit operated in parallel with the grid with an active power of up to 11.7 kW, the electricity produced by the unit met the adopted assumptions and requirements. What is new in this article is the use of a cogeneration unit that has been adapted to its functionality, taking into account the assessment of the prospects for optimizing the cogeneration system in the context of the use of renewable energy sources as agricultural biogas. The best method was to attempt to determine the operating conditions of the cogenerator to develop the optimization of a biogas cogeneration unit producing electricity and heat in a micro-installation for the needs of an individual farm.

AB  - Rumen inhabiting Bacillus species possesses a high genetic potential for plant biomass hydrolysis and conversion to value-added products. In view of the same, five camel rumen-derived Bacillus strains, namely B. subtilis CRN 1, B. velezensis CRN 2, B. subtilis CRN 7, B. subtilis CRN 11, and B. velezensis CRN 23 were initially assayed for diverse hydrolytic activities, followed by genome mining to unravel the potential applications. CRN 1 and CRN 7 showed the highest endoglucanase activity with 0.4 U/ml, while CRN 23 showed high beta-xylosidase activity of 0.36 U/ml. The comprehensive genomic insights of strains resolve taxonomic identity, clusters of an orthologous gene, pan-genome dynamics, and metabolic features. Annotation of Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) reveals the presence of diverse glycoside hydrolases (GH) GH1, GH5, GH43, and GH30, which are solely responsible for the effective breakdown of complex bonds in plant polysaccharides. Further, protein modeling and ligand docking of annotated endoglucanases showed an affinity for cellotrioside, cellobioside, and beta-glucoside. The finding indicates the flexibility of Bacillus-derived endoglucanase activity on diverse cellulosic substrates. The presence of the butyrate synthesis gene in the CRN 1 strain depicts its key role in the production of important short-chain fatty acids essential for healthy rumen development. Similarly, antimicrobial peptides such as bacilysin and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) synthesized by the Bacillus strains were also annotated in the genome. The findings clearly define the role of Bacillus sp. inside the camel rumen and its potential application in various plant biomass utilizing industry and animal health research sectors.

AB  - Disentangling human brain connectivity requires an accurate description of nerve fiber trajectories, unveiled via detailed mapping of axonal orientations. However, this is challenging because axons can cross one another on a micrometer scale. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can be used to infer axonal connectivity because it is sensitive to axonal alignment, but it has limited spatial resolution and specificity. Scattered light imaging (SLI) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveal axonal orientations with microscopic resolution and high specificity, respectively. Here, we apply both scattering techniques on the same samples and cross-validate them, laying the groundwork for ground-truth axonal orientation imaging and validating dMRI. We evaluate brain regions that include unidirectional and crossing fibers in human and vervet monkey brain sections. SLI and SAXS quantitatively agree regarding in-plane fiber orientations including crossings, while dMRI agrees in the majority of voxels with small discrepancies. We further use SAXS and dMRI to confirm theoretical predictions regarding SLI determination of through-plane fiber orientations. Scattered light and X-ray imaging can provide quantitative micrometer 3D fiber orientations with high resolution and specificity, facilitating detailed investigations of complex fiber architecture in the animal and human brain.

AB  - Background: Bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain may play an essential role in the cognitive dysfunction associated with chronic sleep deprivation(CSD). Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen, DS), a famous Chinese medicine and functional tea, is extensively used to protect learning and memory capacities, although the mechanism of action remains unknown. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to explore the efficacy and the underlying mechanism of DS in cognitive dysfunction caused by CSD. Methods: DS chemical composition was analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Forty rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 8): control (CON), model (MOD), low- (1.35 g/kg, DSL), high-dose (2.70 g/kg, DSH) DS group, and Melatonin(100 mg/kg, MT) group. A CSD rat model was established over 21 days. DS's effects and the underlying mechanism were explored using the open-field test(OFT), Morris water-maze(MWM), tissue staining (Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining, Nissl staining, Alcian blue-periodic acid SCHIFF staining, and Immunofluorescence), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: We demonstrated that CSD caused gut dysbiosis and cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were more in fecal samples from model group rats, whereas Bacteroidota and Spirochaetota were less. DS therapy, on the contrary hand, greatly restored the gut microbial community, consequently alleviating cognitive impairment in rats. Further research revealed that DS administration reduced systemic inflammation via lowering intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption. Following that, DS therapy reduced Blood Brain Barrier(BBB) and neuronal damage, further decreasing neuroinflammation in the hippocampus(HP). Mechanistic studies revealed that DS therapy lowered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the HP, serum, and colon, consequently blocking the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products(IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and COX2) in the HP and colon. Conclusion: DS treatment dramatically improved spatial learning and memory impairments in rats with CSD by regulating the composition of the intestinal flora, preserving gut and brain barrier function, and reducing inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which DS treats cognitive dysfunction caused by CSD.

AB  - Nuciferine has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine compound preparations and natural edible resources. Most current studies have concentrated on its lipid-lowering and weight-loss effects, while relatively few have explored its impact on central nervous system disorders. To investigate the effects of nuciferine on the nervous system and its potential pharmacological mechanisms, we mapped the distribution of nuciferine and its key metabolites in brain microregions and major organs of mice using air-flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI). Nuciferine was found to be distributed throughout the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, nuciferine was detected in several peripheral organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen. We also identified the distribution of a major demethylated metabolite (M1), which correlated with the localization of the CYP1A2 enzyme. Metabolomic analysis revealed that nuciferine significantly alters purine metabolism, specifically increasing adenosine levels while decreasing xanthine and hypoxanthine. This metabolic shift suggests a potential enhancement of neuroinhibitory effects, contributing to nuciferine's sedative, hypnotic, and analgesic properties. These findings provide novel insights into the neuropharmacological mechanisms of nuciferine.

AB  - This study explored the therapeutic potential hydroalcoholic extract derived from Origanum vulgare leaf in mitigating ethanol-induced working memory impairments and hippocampal oxidative stress in rats. Eight groups, including controls, ethanol-exposed rats, and those treated with extract (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg) alone or combined with ethanol, were assessed using the radial arm maze (RAM) for behavioral tests. Ethanol increased working memory errors and time spent in error zones, effects notably reduced by the extract, especially at 300 mg/kg dose (P <= 0.001). Biochemical tests showed ethanol suppressed catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities within the hippocampus and cortex. while the extract elevated CAT and SOD activities and reduced AChE activity. These results suggest the extract's neuroprotective properties, including oxidative stress reduction and neurotransmitter modulation, which mitigate ethanol-induced hippocampal damage. This highlights Origanum vulgare extract potential as a therapeutic adjunct for memory deficits and oxidative stress-related conditions.

AB  - Introduction Electrical stimulation of the brain has shown promising prospects in treating various brain diseases. Although biphasic pulse stimulation remains the predominant clinical approach, there has been increasing interest in exploring alternative stimulation waveforms, such as sinusoidal stimulation, to improve the effectiveness of brain stimulation and to expand its application to a wider range of brain disorders. Despite this growing attention, the effects of sinusoidal stimulation on neurons, especially on their nonlinear firing characteristics, remains unclear.Methods To address the question, 50 Hz sinusoidal stimulation was applied on Schaffer collaterals of the rat hippocampal CA1 region in vivo. Single unit activity of both pyramidal cells and interneurons in the downstream CA1 region was recorded and analyzed. Two fractal indexes, namely the Fano factor and Hurst exponent, were used to evaluate changes in the long-range correlations, a manifestation of nonlinear dynamics, in spike sequences of neuronal firing.Results The results demonstrate that sinusoidal electrical stimulation increased the firing rates of both pyramidal cells and interneurons, as well as altered their firing to stimulation-related patterns. Importantly, the sinusoidal stimulation increased, rather than decreased the scaling exponents of both Fano factor and Hurst exponent, indicating an increase in the long-range correlations of both pyramidal cells and interneurons.Discussion The results firstly reported that periodic sinusoidal stimulation without long-range correlations can increase the long-range correlations of neurons in the downstream post-synaptic area. These results provide new nonlinear mechanisms of brain sinusoidal stimulation and facilitate the development of new stimulation modes.

AB  - The serotonin 2B (5-HT2B) receptor coupled to Gq-protein contributes to the control of neuronal excitability and is implicated in various psychiatric disorders. The mechanisms underlying its brain function are not fully described. Using peptide affinity chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, we found that the PDZ binding motif of the 5-HT2B receptor located at its C-terminal end interacts with the scaffolding protein channel interacting PDZ protein (CIPP). We then showed, in COS-7 cells, that the association of the 5-HT2B receptor to CIPP enhanced receptor-operated inositol phosphate (IP) production without affecting its cell surface and intracellular levels. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CIPP, the 5-HT2B receptor, and the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor form a macromolecular complex. CIPP increased 5-HT2B receptor clustering at the surface of primary cultured hippocampal neurons and prevented receptor dispersion following agonist stimulation, thus potentiating IP production and intracellular calcium mobilization in dendrites. CIPP or 5-HT2B receptor stimulation in turn dispersed NR1 clusters colocalized with 5-HT2B receptors and increased the density and maturation of dendritic spines. Collectively, our results suggest that the 5-HT2B receptor, the NMDA receptor, and CIPP may form a signaling platform by which serotonin can influence structural plasticity of excitatory glutamatergic synapses.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects older adults. Selenium, an essential micronutrient for humans, plays a crucial role in the body's normal physiological and metabolic processes. A long-term deficiency in selenium intake can lead to various diseases and even contribute to the ageing process. This study aims to explore the ameliorative effect of selenium on cognitive impairment in 3 x Tg-AD mice and to determine if its effects are related to the BDNF/TrkB pathway. Methods: We employed the APP/PS1/tau 3 x Tg-AD mouse model for dietary selenium intervention. Behavioural experiments were conducted to assess learning and memory. Additionally, we measured selenium and GSH-Px levels in whole blood and brain tissue. Neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus was observed using transmission electron microscopy. The expressions of A beta, P-tau, BDNF, TrkB, and CREB were measured via RT-qPCR, while the expressions of A beta, P-tau, BDNF, TrkB, p-CREB, and CREB were quantified using Western blot analysis. Results: Our findings indicate that selenium supplementation can improve spatial learning and memory deficiencies in 3 x Tg-AD mice. Selenium supplementation increased selenium and GSH-Px levels in the brain tissue of 3 x Tg-AD mice and significantly enhanced neuronal conditions. Furthermore, the expression levels of proteins related to the BDNF/TrkB pathway significantly increased following selenium supplementation. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that selenium can ameliorate memory impairment in 3 x Tg-AD mice by activating the BDNF/TrkB pathway.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of morbidity and permanent disability. To date, no treatments for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury can be effectively administered beyond 4-6 h after the ischemic insult. Our study aimed to clarify the significance of Sirt3 during acute cerebral ischemia and explore Sirt3-targeted therapy for ischemic injuries. Upon establishing the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell model, changes of Sirt3 protein levels and the effects of Sirt3 overexpression on primary hippocampal neurons were detected at indicated time points. Moreover, mitochondrial damage was observed in neurons upon OGD/R injury. The results showed that compared with the normoxia group, Sirt3 protein was significantly decreased in hippocampal neurons exposed to 1 h of OGD followed by 12 h of reperfusion. In addition, the reduction of Sirt3 protein levels contributed to OGD/R-induced neuronal injuries, a higher ratio of neuronal apoptosis, and extensive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, all neuronal injuries were partly rescued by Sirt3 overexpression induced by lentivirus transfection. Mitochondrial morphologies were significantly impaired after OGD/R, but partly salvaged by Sirt3 overexpression. We further explored whether pharmacologically activating Sirt3 is protective for neurons, and found that treatment with honokiol (a Sirt3 agonist) after OGD exposure activated Sirt3 during reperfusion and significantly alleviated OGD/R-induced neuronal injuries. Because mitochondrial functions are essential for neuronal survival, the current results indicate that Sirt3 may be an efficient target to suppress ischemic injuries via maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Our current findings shed light on a novel therapeutic strategy against subacute ischemic injuries.

AB  - Acute and chronic exposure to high altitude causes multiple negative neurological consequences. Further research has shown the efficacy of targeted drugs after acute hypoxia. However, the effects and mechanisms of physical therapy like exercise, on after exposed-induced myelin repair and functional improvements have remained unclear. Here, we explored the efficacy of treadmill training at different intensities on recovery in a rat model of acute hypobaric hypoxia (HH) injury. A 4-week treadmill training scheme was used at 30%, 50%, and 70% of maximum speed. The evolution of oligodendrocyte morphometry was observed by immunofluorescence, and the expressions of myelin-related proteins were detected by western blotting. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to study fine myelin structure. In addition, the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM) and Morris water maze (MWM) were used for the observation of cognitive function recovery. Our study revealed varying degrees of demyelination changes in the cortex and hippocampus following acute hypoxia exposure. Additionally, high-intensity treadmill training enhances oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation, improves myelin-related proteins, and increases myelin sheath thickness, thus facilitating myelin repair, rescuing cognitive function and mood disorders, and preserving normal nerve conduction. Finally, the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1 alpha) and key enzymes of cholesterol synthesis (HMGCR/FDPS) induced by high-intensity treadmill training was detected. Our results demonstrate that high-intensity treadmill training as a physical therapy via PGC1 alpha and cholesterol synthesis enhances myelin repair and functional restoration, which should provide new insight for the rehabilitation of remyelination by exercise.

AB  - The kynurenine pathway is implicated in aging, longevity, and immune regulation, but longitudinal studies and assessment of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are lacking. We investigated tryptophan (Trp) and downstream kynurenine metabolites and their associations with age and change over time in four cohorts using comprehensive, targeted metabolomics. The study included 1574 participants in two cohorts with repeated metabolite measurements (mean age at baseline 58 years & PLUSMN;8 SD and 62 & PLUSMN;10 SD), 3161 community-dwelling older adults (age range 71-74 years), and 109 CSF donors (mean age 73 years & PLUSMN;7 SD). In the first two cohorts, age was associated with kynurenine (Kyn), quinolinic acid (QA), and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (KTR), and inversely with Trp. Consistent with these findings, Kyn, QA, and KTR increased over time, whereas Trp decreased. Similarly, QA and KTR were higher in community-dwelling older adults of age 74 compared to 71, whereas Trp was lower. Kyn and QA were more strongly correlated with age in the CSF compared to serum and increased in a subset of participants with repeated CSF sampling (n=33) over four years. We assessed associations with frailty and mortality in two cohorts. QA and KTR were most strongly associated with mortality and frailty. Our study provides robust evidence of changes in tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism with human aging and supports links with adverse health outcomes. Our results suggest that aging activates the inflammation and stress-driven kynurenine pathway systemically and in the brain, but we cannot determine whether this activation is harmful or adaptive. We identified a relatively stronger age-related increase of the potentially neurotoxic end-product QA in brain.

AB  - The hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory. Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the in vivo human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Our results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasise the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in vivo and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.

AB  - As a consequence of long-term coevolution and natural selection, the leaves of mulberry (Morus alba) trees have become the best food source for silkworms (Bombyx mori). Nevertheless, the molecular and genomic basis of defense response remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we assessed changes in the transcriptome changes of mulberry in response to silkworm larval feeding at 0, 3, and 6 h. A total of 4709 (up = 2971, down = 1738) and 3009 (up = 1868, down = 1141) unigenes were identified after 3 and 6 h of silkworm infestation, respectively. MapMan enrichment analysis results show structural traits such as leaf surface wax, cell wall thickness and lignification form the first physical barrier to feeding by the silkworms. Cluster analysis revealed six unique temporal patterns of transcriptome changes. We predicted that mulberry promoted rapid changes in signaling and other regulatory processes to deal with mechanical damage, photosynthesis impairment, and other injury caused by herbivores within 3-6 h. LRR-RK coding genes (THE1, FER) was predicted participated in perception of cell wall perturbation in mulberry responding to silkworm feeding. Ca2+ signal sensors (CMLs), ROS (OST1, SOS3), RBOHD/F, CDPKs, and ABA were part of the regulatory network after silkworm feeding. Jasmonic acid (JA) signal transduction was predicted to act in silkworm feeding response, 10 JA signaling genes (such as OPR3, JAR1, and JAZ1) and 21 JA synthesis genes (such as LOX2, AOS, and ACX1) were upregulated after silkworm feeding for 3 h. Besides, genes of "alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism" and "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis" were activated in 3 h to reprogram secondary metabolism. Collectively, these findings provided valuable insights into silkworm herbivory-induced regulatory and metabolic processes in mulberry, which might help improve the coevolution of silkworm and mulberry.

AB  - Nitrate nitrogen is an important nitrogen source for tea plants' growth and development. LBD transcription factors play important roles in response to the presence of nitrate in plants. The functional study of LBD transcription factors in tea plants remains limited. In this study, the LBD family gene CsLBD39 was isolated and characterized from tea plants. Sequence analysis indicated that CsLBD39 contained a highly conserved CX2CX6CX3CX domain. The phylogenetic tree assay showed that CsLBD39 belonged to class II subfamily of the LBD family. CsLBD39 was highly expressed in flowers and root; we determined that its expression could be induced by nitrate treatment. The CsLBD39 protein was located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity in yeast. Compared with the wild type, overexpression of CsLBD39 gene in Arabidopsis resulted in smaller rosettes, shorter main roots, reduced lateral roots and lower plant weights. The nitrate content and the expression levels of genes related to nitrate transport and regulation were decreased in transgenic Arabidopsis hosting CsLBD39 gene. Compared with the wild type, CsLBD39 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis had smaller cell structure of leaves, shorter diameter of stem cross section, and slender and compact cell of stem longitudinal section. Under KNO3 treatment, the contents of nitrate, anthocyanins, and chlorophyll in leaves, and the content of nitrate in roots of Arabidopsis overexpressing CsLBD39 were reduced, the expression levels of nitrate transport and regulation related genes were decreased. The results revealed that CsLBD39 may be involved in nitrate signal transduction in tea plants as a negative regulator and laid the groundwork for future studies into the mechanism of nitrate response.

AB  - Analyzing the role of herbivore-induced volatiles in plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions is crucial for developing integrated pest management strategies. This study identified 1-octen-3-ol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol as the primary C8 volatiles induced by Megalurothrips usitatus infestation in cowpea flowers. The concurrent accumulation of glycosides of these volatiles, along with the upregulation of LOX and HPL expression, suggested that the increased emissions of 1-octen-3-ol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol result from enhanced de novo biosynthesis regulated by herbivore-induced jasmonate. 1-Octen-3-ol exhibited strong repellent effects against M. usitatus and attracted its natural enemy, Orius similis, at low concentrations. By contrast, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol repelled M. usitatus but did not exert a significant attractant effect on O. similis. These volatiles prime the defense mechanism in cowpea plants against M. usitatus, which highlight their promising role in controlling thirp populations and enhancing cowpea cultivation.

AB  - An appropriate balance between explorative and defensive behavior is essential for the survival and repro-duction of prey animals in risky environments. However, the neural circuit and mechanism that allow for such a balance remains poorly understood. Here, we use a semi-naturalistic predator threat test (PTT) to observe and quantify the defense-exploration balance, especially risk exploration behavior in mice. During the PTT, the activity of the putative dorsal CA3 glutamatergic neurons (dCA3Glu) is suppressed by predatory threat and risk exploration, whereas the neurons are activated during contextual exploration. Moreover, op-togenetic excitation of these neurons induces a significant increase in risk exploration. A circuit, comprising the dorsal CA3, dorsal lateral septal, and dorsomedial hypothalamic (dCA3Glu-dLSGABA-DMH) areas, may be involved. Moreover, activation of the dCA3Glu-dLSGABA-DMH circuit promotes the switch from defense to risk exploration and suppresses threat-induced increase in arousal.

AB  - Diabetic foot ulcers often become infected, leading to treatment complications and increased risk of loss of limb. Therapeutics to manage infection and simultaneously promote healing are needed. Here we report on the development of a Janus liposozyme that treats infections and promotes wound closure and re-epithelialization. The Janus liposozyme consists of liposome-like selenoenzymes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging to restore tissue redox and immune homeostasis. The liposozymes are used to encapsulate photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy of infections. We demonstrate application in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-infected diabetic wounds showing high ROS levels for antibacterial function from the photosensitizer and nanozyme ROS scavenging from the liposozyme to restore redox and immune homeostasis. We demonstrate that the liposozyme can directly regulate macrophage polarization and induce a pro-regenerative response. By employing single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell-deficient Rag1-/- mice and skin-infiltrated immune cell analysis, we further reveal that IL-17-producing gamma delta T cells are critical for mediating M1/M2 macrophage transition. Manipulating the local immune homeostasis using the liposozyme is shown to be effective for skin wound repair and tissue regeneration in mice and mini pigs.
   Therapies for treating bacterial infection and increasing wound healing are needed. Here the authors report a liposozyme that combines reactive oxygen species generation and scavenging for antibacterial action and modulation of redox and immune homeostasis, increasing wound healing.

AB  - Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP; encoded by ALPL gene) has a critical role in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis postnatally. However, the utero-placental expression of TNSALP and the role in phosphate transport in pregnancy is poorly understood. Estrous cycles of ewes were synchronized, and ewes were euthanized and hysterectomized on Days 1, 9, or 14 of the estrous cycle or bred to fertile rams and euthanized and hysterectomized on Days 9, 12, 17, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, or 125 of pregnancy. The expression of ALPL mRNA, immunolocalization of TNSALP protein, and quantification and localization of TNSALP enzymatic activity was performed on ovine endometria and placentomes. Day of the estrous cycle did not alter ALPL mRNA expression or enzymatic activity of TNSALP. TNSALP protein localized to uterine epithelial and stromal cells, blood vessels, myometrium, caruncular, and cotyledonary stroma. TNSALP activity was localized to uterine epithelia, blood vessels, caruncular stroma (from Day 70 of gestation), and the apical surface of chorionic epithelia (from Day 50 of gestation). TNSALP protein and activity localized to the apical surface of uterine epithelia during the estrous cycle and in early pregnancy. Endometrial TNSALP enzymatic activity was downregulated on Days 17 and 30 of gestation (P < 0.05). Expression of ALPL mRNA decreased in late gestation in endometria and placentomes (P < 0.05). TNSALP activity peaked in placentomes on Days 70 and 90 of gestation. Collectively, these results suggest a potential role of TNSALP in the regulation of phosphate transport and homeostasis at the maternal-conceptus interface in ruminants.

AB  - Inspired by insects in nature, an increasing number of soft robots have been proposed to mimic their locomotion patterns. As a wireless actuation method, the magnetic actuation technique has been widely applied to drive soft magnetic robots for diverse applications. Although recent works on soft materials have stimulated the development of soft robots, it is challenging to achieve the efficient movement of soft robots for in vivo biomedical application. Inspired by centipede locomotion, a soft octopodal robot is designed in this paper. The robot is fabricated by mixing magnetic particles with silicone polymers, which is then magnetized by a specific magnetic field. The prototypes can be actuated by an external magnetic field (5-8 mT) produced by custom-made electromagnetic coils. Experimental results show that the soft robot can move at a high speed in the range of 0.536-1.604 mm/s on different surfaces, including paper, wood, and PMMA. This indicates that the soft robot can achieve comparable speeds to other robots, while being driven by a lower magnitude, resulting in energy savings. Furthermore, it achieves a high speed of 0.823 mm/s on the surface of a pig colon. The fine capabilities of the soft robot in terms of crossing uneven biological surfaces and carrying external loads are demonstrated. The results indicate that the reported soft robot exhibits promising applications in the biomedical field.

AB  - Objective The Sumatran rhinoceros is critically endangered, with fewer than 100 individuals surviving across its current range. Accurate census estimates of the remaining populations are essential for development and implementation of conservation plans. In order to enable molecular censusing, we here develop microsatellite markers with amplicon sizes of short length, appropriate for non-invasive fecal sampling. Results Due to limited sample quantity and potential lack of genome-wide diversity, Illumina sequence reads were generated from two Sumatran rhinoceros samples. Genomic screening identified reads with short tandem repeats and loci that were polymorphic within the dataset. Twenty-nine novel polymorphic microsatellite markers were characterized (A = 2.4; H-O = 0.30). These were sufficient to distinguish among individuals (P-ID < 0.0001), and to distinguish among siblings (P-ID(sib) < 0.0001). Among rhinos in Indonesia, almost all markers were established as polymorphic and effective for genotyping DNA from fecal samples. Notably, the markers amplified and displayed microsatellite polymorphisms using DNA extracted from 11 fecal samples collected non-invasively from wild Sumatran rhinoceros. These microsatellite markers provide an important resource for a census and genetic studies of wild Sumatran rhinos.

AB  - Several negative outcomes are associated with current anti-epileptic medications. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a plant-derived compound called catechin and has many medicinal activities, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles are also showing their neuroprotective effect. The anti-epileptic effect of EGCG, alone or with SeNPs, is still debated. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential anti-seizure effect of biosynthesized SeNPs using EGCG (EGCG-SeNPs) against epileptic seizures and hippocampal damage, which is enhanced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection in mice. Mice were grouped as follows: control; PTZ-exposed group (epileptic model); EGCG + PTZ-treated group; sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) + PTZ-treated group; EGCG-SeNPs + PTZ-treated group; and valproic acid (VPA) + PTZ-treated group. EGCG-SeNPs administration showed anti-epileptic activity by increasing the latency time and reducing the seizure duration following the PTZ injection. Additionally, EGCG-SeNPs counteracted the PTZ-induced changes in oxidants and antioxidants. Moreover, EGCG-SeNPs inhibited the inflammatory response by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreasing the immunoreactivity of the glial fibrillary acidic protein and mRNA expression of glutamate receptor subunit zeta-1 (NMDAR; Grin1), showing their inhibitory effect on epilepsy-associated inflammation. Moreover, EGCG-SeNPs reduced PTZ-induced neuronal apoptosis, as indicated by a reduction in the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins and an elevation of the anti-apoptotic protein. Moreover, EGCG-SeNPs administration significantly modulated the PTZ-induced changes in monoamine levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampal tissue. The obtained findings suggest the anti-seizure activity of EGCG-SeNPs via their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, along with their neuromodulatory effect.

AB  - Acute , chronic liver disease are global problems with high morbidity and mortality. Bupleuri Radix (BR) is an herbal medicine that has been prescribed empirically in traditional Asian medicine to modulate liver metabolism. However, its active compounds and therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we integrated a network-based approach and experimental validation to elucidate BR's therapeutic potential in treating oxidative liver injury. Our approach incorporated data collection and network construction utilizing bioinformatics tools , identified active compounds and key mechanisms based on the multiscale interactome. The proposed mecha-nisms were validated using an in vitro oxidative stress model and an in vivo carbon tetrachloride-induced model. We found that BR ameliorated the oxidative hepatic damage by acting on multiple proteins (STAT3, TNF, and BCL2) and signaling pathways (AMPK and Hippo signaling pathways). Subsequent in vitro experiments confirmed that BR significantly inhibited oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. We further validated the effect of BR on the AMPK and Hippo-YAP pathways; a key mechanism for the antioxidant properties of BR. We prioritized the active compounds in BR based on a multiscale interactome-based approach, and further experiments revealed that saikosaponin A was a key active compound involved in hepatocyte protection (EC50 = 50 mu M), similar to the result using metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide. Histochemistry and blood biochemistry established that BR significantly inhibited carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative tissue damage in mice. Thus, BR can be used to develop novel therapeutics for oxidative liver injury. Moreover, we suggest a novel strategy to prioritize and validate the active compounds and key mechanisms of herbal medicine based on the multiscale interactome.

AB  - We tested whether utilising the male effect to stimulate ewes before the mating period can reduce the time to conception following the introduction of entire rams, and increase fertility, prolificacy, and reproductive rate (number of fetuses per 100 ewes exposed to fertile rams). A retrospective analysis was used to analyse records from 59,716 ewes collected over 34 years (1986-2020) from seven genotypes: Border Leicester, Composite (crossbred), Dorset, Merino, Dorset x Polypay, Rambouillet, White Suffolk. The dataset also included nulliparous young ewes (mated at age 8 months) and adult parous ewes. Vasectomized rams were used to stimulate 20,632 ewes before a mating period that lasted 2 or 3 estrous cycles, and the outcomes were compared with those from 39,084 ewes that had not been stimulated. Independently of genotype, utilising the male stimulus advanced the average conception date by 8 days for young ewes (P < 0.0001) and by 1 day for adult ewes (P < 0.0001). The male stimulus also increased the proportion of ewes that conceived in their first cycle by 33 % for young ewes and by 6 % for adult ewes (P < 0.0001). For the cycle of conception, there were significant (P < 0.0001) effects of two interactions: male stimulus x age at mating and male stimulus x live weight at mating. The male stimulus improved fertility in both adult ewes (99.8 % vs 89 %; P < 0.001) and young ewes (77.7 % vs 81.3 %; P < 0.001). The male stimulus increased the number of young ewes (41.9 % vs 11.1 %; P < 0.001) and adult ewes (16.6 % vs 2.7 %; P < 0.001) that conceived multiple fetuses in the first 17 days of the mating period. The reproductive rate was improved by the male stimulus in young ewes (129 % vs 135 %; P < 0.001) but not in adult ewes (120 % vs 122 %; P = 0.12). When all animals for all breeds were included in the analyses, there were improvements in fertility, prolificacy, and reproductive rate as age and live weight increased at mating (P < 0.0001). We conclude that, independently of genotype, utilising the male stimulus before the mating period reduces the time to conception and improves reproductive performance in both young and adult ewes.

AB  - Circular RNA (circRNA) is ubiquitously expressed in highly differentiated eukaryotes, playing an extremely vital regulatory role in muscle growth and development. In this study, we identified circPICALM, a novel circRNA which consists of exons 5 to 9 of the PICALM gene, exhibiting differential expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LD) of adult (QA) and newborn (QN) Queshan Black pigs. CircPICALM is resistant to RNase R, mainly located in the cytoplasm with potential coding capacities. When circPICALM was over-expressed in porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSMSCs), there was a significant decrease in the expression levels of PCNA, CDK4, CDK1 and CCND1, which consequently inhibited the proliferation of PSMSCs. Conversely, miR-132, a target molecule of circPICALM, was found to promote the proliferation of PSMSCs. In addition, circPICALM can upregulate the expression of the target gene PHKB by competitively adsorbing miR-132. The circPICALM-sscmiR-132-PHKB regulatory axis is regulated by METTL3, which increases the m6A level of both PSMSCs and circPICALM, thereby promoting the proliferation of PSMSCs. Overall, this study furnishes a fundamental reference for further in-depth exploration of the specific molecular mechanisms underlying m6A modification and circPICALM in muscle development and progression.

AB  - Ischemic stroke leads to acute neuron death and forms an injured core, triggering delayed cell death at the penumbra. The impaired brain functions after ischemic stroke are hardly recovered because of the limited regenerative properties. However, recent rodent intervention studies manipulating the extracellular environments at the subacute phase shed new light on the regenerative potency of the injured brain. This review introduces the rational design of artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics using supramolecular peptidic scaffolds, which self-assemble via non-covalent bonds and form hydrogels. The facile customizability of the peptide structures allows tuning the hydrogels' physical and biochemical properties, such as charge states, hydrophobicity, cell adhesiveness, stiffness, and stimuli responses. Supramolecular peptidic materials can create safer and more economical drugs than polymer materials and cell transplantation. We also discuss the importance of activating developmental programs for the recovery at the subacute phase of ischemic stroke. Self-assembling molecular medicine mimicking the ECMs and activating developmental programs may stand as a new drug modality of regenerative medicine in various tissues.

We cover the upstream and downstream pathways that regulate the activation state of mTOR complexes. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of mTORC1 and mTORC2 status in ischemia-hypoxia at tissue and cellular levels and analyze the existing evidence related to two types of neural cells, namely glia and neurons. Finally, we discuss the potential use of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as therapeutic targets after stroke.

AB  - Background: The complex bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain is associated with mental disorders such as depression; serotonin, as a crucial neurotransmitter in the communi-cation system between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, has effects on regulating gastrointestinal motility and sensation and improving psychosomatic status. Zuojin pill is used as a traditional Chinese medicine formula for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. This study explored the effects of Zuojin pill on the improvement of depression and gastrointestinal function in CUMS mice via TPH2 and its mechanism.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate whether Zuojin pill could improve depression and concomitant gastrointestinal dysfunction, and to reveal whether Zuojin pill could work through the regulation of the tryp-tophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) pathway.
   Methods: The CUMS model was established to observe the effects of Zuojin pill on depression-like behavior and gastrointestinal function in mice. Nissler staining and HE staining were used to observe the structure of hip-pocampal neurons and intestinal mucosa respectively. 5-HT levels in serum, hippocampus, and intestinal tissues were measured by ELISA, and TPH2 expression in hippocampus and intestinal nerves was observed by WB and immunofluorescence. In order to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of Zuojin pill on PC12 cells, CORT used an in vitro model to produce PC12 cell damage.
   Results: Our study showed that Zuojin pill ameliorated depression-like behavior and gastrointestinal dysfunction in CUMS mice, elevated BDNF, 5-HT, and TPH2 expression in the hippocampus, and restored the ratio of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons between intestinal muscles. In vitro experiments showed that Zuojin pill exerted a protective effect on neurons by regulating TPH2 ubiquitination and thus inhibiting CORT-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells.
   Conclusion: Zuojin pill improves chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behavior and gastrointes-tinal dysfunction in mice via the TPH2/5-HT pathway. Therefore, TPH2 may be a potential therapeutic target for depression with gastrointestinal dysfunction.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Neuroinflammation induced by microglia is closely related to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous study has found that aqueous extract of Epimedii Folium and Curculiginis Rhizoma (EX) had anti-inflammatory effect on AD by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibiting NF-Kappa B/MAPK pathway. However, whether the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of EX is related to microglia or not remains unclear. Aim of the study: The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of EX on cognitive impairment induced by LPS and explore the underlying mechanism of EX. Materials and methods: High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was performed to qualify the major components of EX, EX in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. To evaluate the antiinflammatory effects of EX in vivo, the mice were orally administrated with EX (2.34, 4.68 g kg- 1ed- 1) for 28 days before cotreatment with LPS (1 mg kg- 1ed- 1, i.p.). The leaning and memory abilities of mice were examined by Morris water maze test. The expression of inflammatory related proteins and the activation of microglia were detected by ELISA, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR and Western blotting. Results: HPLC-MS analysis confirmed and quantified 9 components in EX, 5 components in the serum and 4 components in the cerebrospinal fluid. In a LPS-induced neuroinflammatory mouse model, EX was found to exert anti-inflammatory activity by reducing the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), regulating the expression of different phenotypes of microglia, and increasing the expression of proteins related with TREM2 in the hippocampus tissue. Moreover, LPS-induced microglia activation was markedly attenuated in the hippocampus. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that EX exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects via reducing the production of inflammatory mediators, regulating the conversion of microglia and activating the proteins related with TREM2. EX might become a novel herb pairs to treat neuroinflammatory diseases.

AB  - Neonicotinoids are insecticides widely used in the world. Although neonicotinoids are believed to be toxic only to insects, their developmental neurotoxicity in mammals is a concern. Therefore, we examined the effects of developmental exposure to neonicotinoids on immune system in the brain and post-developmental behaviors in this study. Imidacloprid or clothianidin was orally administered to dams at a dosage of 0.1 mg/kg/day from embryonic day 11 to postnatal day 21. Imidacloprid decreased sociability, and both imidacloprid and clothianidin decreased locomotor activity and induced anxiety, depression and abnormal repetitive behaviors after the developmental period. There was no change in the number of neurons in the hippocampus of mice exposed to imidacloprid. However, the number and activity of microglia during development were significantly decreased by imidacloprid exposure. Imidacloprid also induced neural circuit dysfunction in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus during the early postnatal period. Exposure to imidacloprid suppressed the expression of csf1r during development. Collectively, these results suggest that developmental exposure to imidacloprid decreases the number and activity of microglia, which can cause neural circuit dysfunction and abnormal behaviors after the developmental period. Care must be taken to avoid exposure to neonicotinoids, especially during development.

AB  - CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons are the major sources of hippocampal efferents. The structural features of these neurons are presumed to be involved in various normal/abnormal cognitive and emotional outcomes by influencing the pattern of synaptic inputs and neuronal signal processing. Although many studies have described hippocampal structure differences between males and females, these reports mainly focused on gross anatomical features in adult or aged models, and such distinctions on neuronal morphology and dendritic spine density during adolescence, a period of high vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders, have received much less attention. In this work, we analyzed dendritic architecture and density of spines in CA1 and CA3 neurons of male and female rats in early adolescence (postnatal day, PND 40) and compared them with those in late adolescence/young adulthood (PND 60). On PND 40, CA1 neurons of male rats showed more Sholl intersections and spine density in apical and basal dendrites compared to those in females. The Sholl intersections in basal dendrites of CA3 neurons were also more in males, whereas the number of apical dendrite intersections was not significantly different between sexes. In male rats, there was a notable decrease in the number of branch and terminal points in the basal dendrite of CA1 neurons of young adults when compared to their sex-matched adolescent rats. On the other hand, CA1 neurons in young adult females also showed more Sholl intersections in apical and basal dendrites compared to adolescent females. Meanwhile, the total cable length, the number of branches, and terminal points of apical dendrites in CA3 neurons also exhibited a significant reduction in young adult male rats compared to their sex-matched adolescents. In young adult rats, both apical and basal dendrites of CA3 neurons in males showed fewer intersections with Sholl circles, but there were no significant differences in dendritic spine density or count estimation between males and females. On the other hand, young adult female rats had more Sholl intersections and dendritic spine count on the basal dendrites of CA3 neurons compared to adolescent females. Although no significant sex- and age-dependent difference in neuronal density was detected in CA1 and CA3 subareas, CA3 pyramidal neurons of both male and female rats showed reduced soma area compared to adolescent rats. Our findings show that the sex differences in the dendritic structure of CA1 and CA3 neurons vary by age and also by the compartments of dendritic arbors. Such variations in the morphology of hippocampal pyramidal neurons may take part as a basis for normal cognitive and affective differences between the sexes, as well as distinct sensitivity to interfering factors and the prevalence of neuropsychological diseases.
   Sex- and age-dependent differences in dendritic morphology in rat CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons were observed. Specifically, adolescent male rats displayed well-developed pyramidal neurons, whereas in females, dendritic growth persisted into young adulthood.image

AB  - Most biogeographers considered the Maghreb to be part of the Palearctic biogeographic region, though it is relatively recently that the proportion of Palearctic species increased there. How and when exactly these biogeographic changes occurred is not well understood, but they are probably the result of the increasing aridification of the Sahara and decreasing global temperatures. Fossils of Bos primigenius and Ceratotherium simum from a new fossil locality in a terrace of the Oued el Hai (NE Morocco) contribute to our understanding of some of these biogeographic processes and their timing. They also suggest an age between similar to 57 and similar to 100 ka for the terrace. The same evolutionary change in Bos in Europe and the Maghreb suggests geneflow as the most parsimonious explanation, though parallel evolution is an alternative possibility. Oued el Hai has the oldest well-documented record of C. simum in the Maghreb. The dispersal of this species to North Africa, where it replaced C. mauritanicum, may have occurred during a 'Green Sahara Period' between 80-85 or 100-105 ka, when the Maghreb had acquired already a Palearctic character. The study of the biogeography and requirements of the large mammals of the Maghreb may provide information to calibrate the region's climate modelling.

AB  - Simple Summary Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been increasingly studied due to their beneficial health effects. N-3 PUFAs are particularly abundant in the brain and retina, where they play various roles that are important to the maintenance of normal function in those organs. The present study aimed to evaluate the FA profile of lamb brain and retinal tissues after they were fed three experimental diets supplemented with an EPA-rich microalga for 21 days. The microalga was delivered in a different format in each one of the diets (oil, spray-dried and freeze-dried biomass); therefore, its efficiency in altering the FA profile of brain and retina was evaluated for each diet. Overall, our results demonstrated that the brain EPA content remained unchanged after EPA supplementation, in contrast with the retinal EPA, which was very responsive to microalga supplementation. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have special physiological functions in both brain and retinal tissues that are related to the modulation of inflammatory processes and direct effects on neuronal membrane fluidity, impacting mental and visual health. Among them, the long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFAs, as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are of special importance. Scarce data are available about the fatty acid (FA) composition of the ruminant brain in response to dietary intervention. However, we decided to examine the brain and retina FA composition of lambs supplemented with an EPA-rich microalga feed for 21 days, as it is known that despite the extensive biohydrogenation of dietary PUFAs in the rumen, ruminants can selectively accumulate some n-3 LC-PUFAs in their brain and retinal tissues. Twenty-eight male lambs were fed a control diet, or the same diet further supplemented with Nannochloropsis sp. microalga. Their brains and retina were collected for FA characterization. Overall, the brain FA profile remained unchanged, with little alteration in omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) enhancement in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Retinal tissues were particularly responsive to the dietary intervention, with a 4.5-fold enhancement of EPA in the freeze-dried-fed lambs compared with the control lambs. We conclude that retinal tissues are sensitive to short-term n-3 PUFA supplementation in lambs.

AB  - Objectives The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute hypoxia exposure following prenatal stress on the novelty-seeking behavior and hippocampus of adolescent rats. Methods The offspring were divided into prenatal stress (PS) and non-stress (NS) groups. Both groups were exposed to hypoxia on postnatal day 10 (P10) while control groups were undisturbed. Novel object recognition task was performed in each group. Next, brains were collected to examine hippocampus via immunohistochemical and biochemical studies on postnatal day 35 (P35). Results PS decreased novelty discrimination and synaptophysin (SYN) expressions in both CA1 and CA3 of the hypoxia group prominently (p < 0.05). Nestin-expressing cells were reduced while vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was enhanced in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of PS-hypoxia group (p < 0.05). VEGF enhancement triggered angiogenesis in the CA1 and CA3 significantly (p < 0.05). PS also increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels in the hypoxia group as a result of oxidative stress (p < 0.05). Conclusion These findings demonstrated that PS exacerbates neurodevelopmental deficits in the hippocampus of acute hypoxia-induced offspring in adolescence.

AB  - Background: Chronic excessive ethanol consumption damages the central nervous system and causes neurobehavioral changes, such as cognitive impairment, which is related to oxidative stress and inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. It is known that promoting neurogenesis improves learning memory, anxiety and depression. Lycium barbarum L. polyphenol (LBP) is the main active ingredient of Lycium barbarum L., which has excellent neuroprotective effects. However, the effects and mechanisms of LBP on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment are unclear. Purpose: To assess the effects and mechanisms of LBP on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Methods: Eight-weeks-old adult C57BL/6J mice were allowed to drink ethanol (10%) to establish a model of ethanol-induced cognitive impairment. From the 29th day of LBP (25, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg/kg, intragastric administration), the locomotor activity, novel object recognition (NOR), Y maze and Morris water maze (MWM) were sequentially performed to investigate the effect of LBP on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Next, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were used to study the underlying mechanism of LBP on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment. Results: LBP significantly decreased the escape latency and increased the number of crossings of the original platform in MWM, increased the spontaneous alteration behavior in the Y maze, and increased the preference index in the NOR in ethanol-induced mice. Notably, LBP significantly promoted the proliferation of neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells and neuroblasts, and increased the proportion of activated NSCs in mice with ethanol-induced cognitive impairment. Similarly, LBP significantly increased the number of newborn immature neurons and mature neurons. Moreover, LBP increased the levels of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the downstream heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) protein expression, which led to a decrease of oxidative stress levels. Conclusion: LBP significantly improves cognitive impairment in ethanol-induced mice, which is attributed to the promotion of hippocampal neurogenesis and reduction of oxidative stress.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Detarium microcarpum is used to treat typhoid fever, a major public health problem, by indigenous population in Africa. Though its preventive activities have been documented, the curative effect is still to be confirmed.Aim of the study: This study aimed at evaluating the curative effects of the hydroethanolic extract of Detarium microcarpum root bark on Salmonella typhimurium-induced typhoid in rat and exploring the in-silico inhibition of some bacterial key enzymes.Study design: In vitro antioxydant, in vivo antisalmonella of the extract and in silico molecular docking assay on the isolated compounds were carried out to explore the anti-salmonella effects of Detarium microcarpum.Material and methods: The in vitro antioxidant properties of the extract were evaluated using DPPH, ABTS and FRAP tests. The anti-salmonella activity of the extract was assessed through feacal sample from Salmonella typhimurium-infected rat cultured in Salmonella-Shigella agar (SS agar) medium. The affinity of isolated com-pounds (Rhinocerotinoic acid and Microcarposide) from the extract were performed on four key enzymes (Adenylosuccinate lyase, Acetyl coenzyme A synthetase, Thymidine phosphorylase and LuxS-Quorum sensor) using molecular docking simulation to elucidate the molecular level inhibition mechanism.Results: Crude extract of D. microcarpum root bark showed variable activities on DPPH (RSa50: 6.09 +/- 1.04 mu g/ mL), ABTS (RSa50: 24.46 +/- 0.27), and FRAP (RSa50: 23.30 +/- 0.23). The extract at all the doses exhibited significant healing effect of infected rats, with the complete clearance. The extract restored hematological, biochemical and histological parameters closed to the normal control. The molecular docking results indicates that rhinocerotinoic acid and microcarposide present more affinity to the LuxS-Quorum sensor and Acetyl co-enzyme A synthetase protein as compared to the others.Conclusion: These results demonstrate potent anti-typhoid activities of the hydroethanolic of Detarium micro-carpum root bark extract through antioxidant properties and high inhibitory affinity of its compounds on some bacterial key enzymes that justify its use as traditional medicine to typhoid fever.

AB  - Hepatic ischemic reperfusion (HIR) is a common pathophysiological process in many surgical procedures such as liver transplantation (LT) and hepatectomy. And it is also an important factor leading to perioperative distant organ damage. Children undergoing major liver surgery are more susceptible to various pathophysiological processes, including HIR, since their brains are still developing and the physiological functions are still incom-plete, which can lead to brain damage and postoperative cognitive impairment, thus seriously affecting the long-term prognosis of the children. However, the present treatments of mitigating HIR-induced hippocampal damage are not proven to be effective. The important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiological processes of many diseases and in the normal development of the body has been confirmed in several studies. The current study explored the role of miR-122-5p in HIR-induced hippocampal damage progression. HIR-induced hippo-campal damage mouse model was induced by clamping the left and middle lobe vessels of the liver of young mice for 1 h, removing the vessel clamps and re-perfusing them for 6 h. The changes in the level of miR-122-5p in the hippocampal tissues were measured, and its influences on the activity as well as apoptotic rate of neuronal cells were investigated. Short interfering RNA modified with 2'-O-methoxy substitution targeting long-stranded non-coding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear enriched transcript 1 (NEAT1) as well as miR-122-5p antagomir were used to further clarify the role played by the corresponding molecules in hippocampal injury in young mice with HIR. The result obtained in our study was that the expression of miR-122-5p in the hippocampal tissue of young mice receiving HIR is reduced. Upregulated expression of miR-122-5p reduces the viability of neuronal cells and promotes the development of apoptosis, thereby aggravating the damage of hippocampal tissue in HIR young mice. Additionally, in the hippocampal tissue of young mice receiving HIR, lncRNA NEAT1 exerts some anti-apoptotic effects by binding to miR-122-5p, promoting the expression of Wnt1 pathway. An essential observa-tion of this study was the binding of lncRNA NEAT1 to miR-122-5p, which upregulates Wnt1 and inhibits HIR-induced hippocampal damage in young mice.

AB  - Background: Suanzaoren decoction (SZRD) is a classical traditional Chinese prescription. It is widely used to treat mental disorders, including insomnia, anxiety, and depression, in China and other Asian countries. However, the effective components and mechanisms underlying SZRD remained unclear. Purpose: We aimed to develop a new strategy to discover the effects and potential mechanisms of SZRD against anxiety and to further reveal the effective components of SZRD in treating anxiety. Study design and methods: First, the chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced mouse model of anxiety was orally administered SZRD, and behavioral indicators and biochemical parameters were applied to assess efficacy. A chinmedomics strategy based on UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS technology and network pharmacology were then used to screen and explore potentially effective components and therapeutic mechanisms. Finally, molecular docking was applied to further confirm the effective components of SZRD, and a multivariate network for anxiolytic effects was constructed. Results: SZRD exerted anxiolytic effects by increasing the percentage of entries into open arms and the time spent in open arms; improving hippocampal 5-HT, GABA, and NE levels; and increasing serum corticosterone (CORT) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels caused by CRS challenge. Beside, SZRD exerted a sedative effect by decreasing sleep time and prolonging sleep latency with no muscle relaxation effect in CRS mice. A total of 110 components were identified in SZRD, 20 of which were absorbed in the blood. Twenty-one serum bio-markers involved in arachidonic acid, tryptophan, sphingolipid, and linoleic acid metabolism were identified after SZRD intervention. Finally, a multivariate network including prescription-effective components-targets-pathway of SZRD treating anxiety, including 11 effective components, 4 targets and 2 pathway was constructed. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that integrating chinmedomics and network pharmacology was a powerful approach to investigating the effective components and therapeutic mechanisms of SZRD and provided a solid basis for the quality marker (Q-marker) of SZRD.

AB  - Worldwide, the number of mobile phone users has increased from 5.57 billion in 2011 to 6.8 billion in 2019. However, short- and long-term impact of the electromagnetic radiation emitting from mobile phones on tissue homeostasis with particular to brain proteome composition needs further investigation. In this study, we attempted a global proteome profiling study of rat hippocampus exposed to mobile phone radiation for 20 weeks (for 3 h/day for 5 days/week) to identify deregulated proteins and western blot analysis for validation. As a result, we identified 358 hippocampus proteins, of which 16 showed deregulation (log(2) (exposed/sham) >= +/- 1.0, p-value <.05). Majority of these deregulated proteins grouped into three clusters sharing similar molecular pathways. A set of four proteins (Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase: Aldh5a1, Na+ K+ transporting ATPase: Atp1b2, plasma membrane calcium transporting ATPase: PMCA and protein S100B) presenting each functional pathway were selected for validation. Western blot analysis of these proteins, in an independent sample set, corroborated the mass spectrometry findings. Aldh5a1 involve in cellular energy metabolism, both Atp1b2 and PMCA responsible for membrane transport and protein S100B have a neuroprotective role. In conclusion, we present a deregulated hippocampus proteome upon mobile phone radiation exposure, which might influence the healthy functioning of the brain.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bombax costatum Pellegr. & Vuillet is used traditionally in Northern Cameroon to treat memory impairment, anxiety, insomnia and depression.& nbsp;Aim of the study: Investigating the effect of Bombax costatum stem bark aqueous extract (BC) on depression associated with amnesia and vascular disorder, using a chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) model in rats for 30 days.& nbsp;Materials and methods: Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), Forced Swimming Test (FST), corticosteronemia, brain serotonin and dopamine level were evaluated as indices of antidepressant-like effect. The Novel Object Recognition Task (NOR), the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus were also used to verify memory integrity. Oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, the lipid profile and atherogenic index were estimated in blood serum to assess vasoprotective effect. Chlorophenylalanine and haloperidol, were used to delineate the extract's mechanism of action.& nbsp;Results: CMUS induced a decrease in sucrose preference and swimming time in the SPT and FST respectively while BC (27.5 and 55 mg/kg) increased sucrose preference and swimming time. Increments in these parameters were however reversed by the treatment of rats with chlorophenylalanine a serotonin synthesis inhibitor and haloperidol a D2 receptor antagonist. An increase in blood corticosterone level, prefrontal cortex malondialdehyde and nitric oxide concentrations were reversed by the extract. Moreover, BC increased the time spent in the target quadrant of the MWM test and the discrimination index in the NOR test. This was associated with an increase in hippocampus superoxide dismutase and catalase levels, a decrease in acetylcholine esterase level, total blood cholesterol and atherogenicity index compared to CMUS group.& nbsp;Conclusion: Thirty days CMUS induces a depressive state in rats. BC reverses this condition when administered alongside stress exposure. This antidepressive effect is associated with antiamnesic, antioxidant and vasoprotective actions, suggesting its use as a potential candidate in the management of major depressive disorder.

AB  - Simple Summary The composition of milk fat is of interest to milk producers and consumers. Unsaturated fatty acids are important fats in the human diet, and their profile is influenced by the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the FASN gene. This study aimed to determine the relationship of two selected SNPs and their genotypic variants with the fat content and fatty acid profile of milk from Polish Red-and-White (ZR), Polish Red (RP), and Polish Holstein-Friesian Red-and-White (RW) breeds. The frequencies of the genotypes of the SNPs were also determined for each breed included in this study. This study enabled the determination of cattle breeds (each with its specific genotype of a given SNP), which proved to be more conducive to the production of health-promoting milk, as evidenced by the fat and fatty acid content of the milk. It was found that, for one SNP, the RP breed (with a specific genotype) exhibited favorable characteristics, while in the case of the other SNP, the RP, ZR, and RW breeds (each with their specific genotypes) demonstrated favorable attributes. This information can be used in cattle-breeding efforts to improve the quality of milk produced.Abstract Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a metabolic enzyme responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids in milk and meat. The SNPs g.841G/C and g.17924A/G of the FASN gene significantly influence the fat and fatty acid content of milk from cows of various breeds. Therefore, these SNPs were selected for this study. This study aimed to analyze the relationship of SNPs and their genotypes with the fat content and fatty acid profile of milk from Polish Red-and-White (ZR), Polish Red (RP), and Polish Holstein-Friesian Red-and-White (RW) cows. Milk samples were obtained during a milking trial. SNP genotyping was performed using the real-time PCR (HRM) method. It was shown that SNPs (with specific genotypes) were significantly associated with the presence of fatty acids such as C18:1n9t and C18:2n6c in milk. In addition, it was found that the milk fat from the ZR (genotypic variant A/G, AA) and RP (genotypic variant GG, A/G) breeds often exhibited a more attractive fatty acids profile than the milk fat from RW cows. This information can be used by both cattle breeders and people interested in consuming functional foods.

AB  - Evidence continues to accrue that aging and its diseases can be delayed by pharmacologic and dietary strategies that target the underlying hallmarks of the aging process. However, identifying simple, safe, and effective dietary strategies involving the incorporation of whole foods that may confer some protection against the aging process is also needed. Recent observational studies have suggested that nut consumption can reduce mortality risk in humans. Among these, walnuts are particularly intriguing, given their high content of n-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. To this end, 12-month-old male CB6F1 mice were provided either a defined control low-fat diet (LFD), a control high-fat diet (HFD), or an isocaloric HFD containing 7.67% walnuts by weight (HFD + W), and measures of healthspan and related biochemical markers (n = 10-19 per group) as well as survival (n = 20 per group) were monitored. Mice provided the HFD or HFD + W demonstrated marked weight gain, but walnuts lowered baseline glucose (p < 0.05) and tended to temper the effects of HFD on liver weight gain (p < 0.05) and insulin tolerance (p = 0.1). Additional assays suggested a beneficial effect on some indicators of health with walnut supplementation, including preservation of exercise capacity and improved short-term working memory, as determined by Y maze (p = 0.02). However, no effect was observed via any diet on inflammatory markers, antioxidant capacity, or survival (p = 0.2). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the hippocampal transcriptome identified two processes predicted to be affected by walnuts and potentially linked to cognitive function, including estrogen signaling and lipid metabolism, with changes in the latter confirmed by lipidomic analysis. In summary, while walnuts did not significantly improve survival on a HFD, they tended to preserve features of healthspan in the context of a metabolic stressor with aging.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the major concerns considering detriments to human health. This type of pollution leads to several health problems for humans, such as asthma, heart issues, skin diseases, bronchitis, lung cancer, and throat and eye infections. Air pollution also poses serious issues to the planet. Pollution from the vehicle industry is the cause of greenhouse effect and CO2 emissions. Thus, real-time monitoring of air pollution in these areas will help local authorities to analyze the current situation of the city and take necessary actions. The monitoring process has become efficient and dynamic with the advancement of the Internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Localization is the main issue in WSNs; if the sensor node location is unknown, then coverage and power and routing are not optimal. This study concentrates on localization-based air pollution prediction systems for real-time monitoring of smart cities. These systems comprise two phases considering the prediction as heavy or light traffic area using the Gaussian support vector machine algorithm based on the air pollutants, such as PM2.5 particulate matter, PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The sensor nodes are localized on the basis of the predicted area using the meta-heuristic algorithms called fast correlation-based elephant herding optimization. The dataset is divided into training and testing parts based on 10 cross-validations. The evaluation on predicting the air pollutant for localization is performed with the training dataset. Mean error prediction in localizing nodes is 9.83 which is lesser than existing solutions and accuracy is 95%.

AB  - Hidden Markov models (HMMs), which can characterize dynamic heterogeneity, are valuable tools for analyzing longitudinal data. The order of HMMs (ie, the number of hidden states) is typically assumed to be known or predetermined by some model selection criterion in conventional analysis. As prior information about the order frequently lacks, pairwise comparisons under criterion-based methods become computationally expensive with the model space growing. A few studies have conducted order selection and parameter estimation simultaneously, but they only considered homogeneous parametric instances. This study proposes a Bayesian double penalization (BDP) procedure for simultaneous order selection and parameter estimation of heterogeneous semiparametric HMMs. To overcome the difficulties in updating the order, we create a brand-new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm coupled with an effective adjust-bound reversible jump strategy. Simulation results reveal that the proposed BDP procedure performs well in estimation and works noticeably better than the conventional criterion-based approaches. Application of the suggested method to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative research further supports its usefulness.

AB  - In recent years, the damaging effects of night light pollution, one of the environmental pollutions, on memory has been attracting attention. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which light at night, especially blue light at night, impairs memory remains unclear. Here, a total of 42 C57BL6/J mice that exposed to no light at night, dim white light at night (dLAN-WL), or dim blue light at night (dLAN-BL) for 28 days. Behavioral data indicated that exposure to dLAN-BL resulted in severe recognition memory impairment, as evidenced by the reduced recognition index and discrimination index in the novel object recognition test. At the same time, we observed a decrease in plasma insulin levels. Consistent with these changes, we also observed that dLAN-BL reduced the number of neurons in the CA1, CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus, up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of Bax, down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and the protein expression level of pIRS1, pAKT, pGSK3P, P-catenin in the hippocampus. In vitro experiments, we found that insulin (10 nM) inhibited apoptosis and up-regulated the protein expression levels of pAKT, pGSK3P, P-catenin of HT22 cells induced by H2O2 (200 mu M). However, these changes disappeared when the insulin receptors (IR) in HT22 cells were silenced. Taken together, our findings suggested that the impairment of memory in mice induced by dLAN-BL was mediated by insulin via the IR/IRS1/AKT/GSK3P/P-catenin pathway.Data Availability: All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.

AB  - In this study, we have examined the neuroprotective effects of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used in vitro electrophysiological recording in hippocampal slices and performed proteomic analysis of cortical tissue from APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. In wild-type (WT) slices from C57BL6 mice, acute treatment with CBDA (10 mu M) did not alter levels of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP); however, it did reverse the attenuation of LTP produced by acute beta amyloid peptide (A beta 42). We also examined the effects of CBDA or vehicle in APP/PS1 mice and WT littermates over a 5-week period at 8 months. LTP levels recorded in slices from WT mice treated with CBDA at 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg (IP) or vehicle were similar. LTP was attenuated in slices from vehicle-treated APP/PS1 compared to vehicle-treated WT mice, while treatment of APP/PS1 mice with all doses of CBDA reversed the deficits in LTP. There was also a deficit in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in vehicle-treated APP/PS1 compared to WT, indicating altered synaptic function and transmitter release; this was reversed in slices from CBDA-treated APP/PS1 mice. Levels of cortical soluble A beta 42 were similar across CBDA- and vehicle-treated groups; however, the level of aggregated A beta 42 was decreased in the CBDA-treated group. Proteomic analysis of cortical tissue from APP/PS1 cortex compared to WT revealed alterations in protein expression, with pathway enrichment analyses suggesting implicated canonical pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction, protein sorting, and synaptogenesis; all were significantly improved by CBDA treatment. These changes likely facilitate the improvement in synaptic transmission and LTP we observed following CBDA treatment in APP/PS1 mice. This research suggests that CBDA should be considered a novel therapy for AD.

AB  - The present experiments reveal the alterations of the hippocampal neuronal populations in chronic epilepsy. The mice were injected with a single dose of pilocarpine. They had status epilepticus and spontaneously recurrent motor seizures. Three months after pilocarpine treatment, the animals were investigated with the Barnes maze to determine their learning and memory capabilities. Their hippocampi were analyzed 2 weeks later (at 3.5 months) with standard immunohistochemical methods and cell counting. Every animal displayed hippocampal sclerosis. The neuronal loss was evaluated with neuronal-N immunostaining, and the activation of the microglia was measured with Iba1 immunohistochemistry. The neuropeptide Y, parvalbumin, and calretinin immunoreactive structures were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in the hippocampal formation. The results were compared statistically to the results of the control mice. We detected neuronal loss and strongly activated microglia populations. Neuropeptide Y was significantly upregulated in the sprouting axons. The number of parvalbumin- and calretinin-containing interneurons decreased significantly in the Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus. The epileptic animals displayed significantly worse learning and memory functions. We concluded that degeneration of the principal neurons, a numerical decrease of PV-containing GABAergic neurons, and strong peptidergic axonal sprouting were responsible for the loss of the hippocampal learning and memory functions.

AB  - Concepts describe how instances of the same kind are related, enabling the categorization and interpretation of new information.1,2 How concepts are represented is a longstanding question. Category boundaries have been considered defining features of concept representations, which can guide categorical inference,3 with fMRI evidence showing category-boundary signals in the hippocampus.4,5 The underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. The hippocampal-entorhinal system, known for its spatially tuned neurons that form cognitive maps of space,6,7 may support conceptual knowledge formation, with place cells encoding locations in conceptual space.4,8-11 Physical boundaries anchor spatial representations and boundary shifts affect place and grid fields,12-16 as well as human spatial memory,17-19 along manipulated dimensions. These place cell responses are likely driven by boundary vector cells, which respond to boundaries at specific allocentric distances and directions,20-23 the neural correlates of which have been identified in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex 20,24,25 . We hypothesize similar patterns of memory adaptations in response to shifting category boundaries. Our findings show that after category boundary shifts, participants' memory for category exemplars distorts along the changed dimension, mirroring place field deformations. We demonstrate that the boundary vector cell model of place cell firing best accounts for these distortions compared with alternative geometric explanations. Our study highlights a role of category boundaries in human cognition and establishes a new complementary link between hippocampal coding properties with respect to boundaries and human concept representation, bridging spatial and conceptual domains.

AB  - The suppressive roles of Fat1 have been widely revealed in various tumors. However, its effects on the tumor-initiating ability of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have never been elucidated. Currently, we identified that a higher level of Fat1 mRNA expression predicted a longer overall survival and first-progression survival of lung cancer patients, especially in adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, Fat1 mRNA exhibited a lower level in lung cancer tissues relative to that in normal tissues. Functionally, we focused on the effects of Fat1 on the tumor-initiating ability of NSCLC cells and we found that Fat1 overexpression decreased the expression of tumor-initiating markers. Furthermore, overexpression of Fat1 reduced ALDH1 activity and sphere-formation ability of NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, we revealed that Fat1 promoted the nuclear-cytoplasmic transportation of YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1), a critical executor of Hippo signaling, and a mutant form of YAP (YAP-5SA), which can escape from LATS1/2-mediated phosphorylation, rescued the Fat1-mediated inhibition on the tumor-initiating ability of NSCLC cells. This work prompts that Fat1 suppresses the tumor-initiating ability of NSCLC cells by activating Hippo signaling.

AB  - The aim was to characterize and assess the reproductive performance of a long interval prostaglandin (PG)-based protocol for timed AI (TAI) at different times. During breeding season three experiments were done involving 622 Merino ewes, 11 rams, and five androgenized wethers per 100 ewes. All ewes were estrus synchronized with two PG injections 15-day apart (PG15): Day-15 and 0 (Hour 0). Estrous distribution respect to Hour 0, estrous response and synchrony after Hour 0, and interval from Hour 0 to estrus detection (PG-estrus) was evaluated (Experiment I; n = 105 ewes). Interval from estrus detection to ovulation (estrus-ovulation) and from Hour 0 to ovulation (PG-ovulation) was determined (Experiment II; n = 12 ewes). Visual-physical score of cervical mucus at TAI, non-return to service to Day 23 (NRR23), fertility, prolificacy, and fecundity to Day 60 in four cervical fresh semen TAI groups was evaluated (Experiment III; n = 505 ewes; 107 nulliparous-398 multiparous). Three groups with single service at 56 (Control), 44 or 68, and one with double service at 44 and 68 +/- 1.5 h after Hour 0 (PG15-56, PG15-44, PG15-68, and PG15-44/68 groups, respectively) were tested. Ninety-eight-point one percent of the ewes showed estrus from Hour-48 up to 84 respects to Hour 0. Twenty percent of them showed estrus from Hour-48 up to 0, and 78.1 % from Hour 12 up to 84 (Experiment I). The largest proportion of ewes in estrus was observed between Hour 36 and 60 (80.5 %). PG-estrus interval was 54.1 +/- 10 h (means +/- SD). Estrus-ovulation interval was 32.4 +/- 5.8 h, and PG-ovulation interval was 77.0 +/- 16.6 h (Experiment II). Ewe parity did not affect any of the reproductive variables (P > 0.05; Experiment III). There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between Control and different groups in mucus score (2.18 +/- 0.08, 2.02 +/- 0.07, 2.14 +/- 0.09, 2.25 +/- 0.10), NRR23 (76.0, 71.9, 78.6, 79.4 %) or fertility (66.4, 64.1, 66.7, 73.8 %; PG15-56, PG15-44, PG15-68 or PG15-44/68 groups, respectively). Prolificacy in PG15-44 group was lower (1.07 +/- 0.03; P < 0.05) than other groups (1.27 +/- 0.05, 1.23 +/- 0.05, 1.20 +/- 0.04), and fecundity than PG15-44/68 group (0.84, 0.69, 0.82, 0.89), without differences among other groups (PG15-56, PG15-44, PG15-68 or PG15-44/68 groups, respectively). We concluded that any time between 56 and 68 h after PG15 protocol could be used to perform cervical TAI using fresh semen, without benefits of a double TAI service at 44 and 68 h.

AB  - The infected diabetic wound healing is an increasingly severe healthcare problem worldwide. Bacterial infection and the inflammatory microenvironment hinder diabetic wound healing. Meanwhile, the combination of inhibiting bacterial growth and promoting macrophage polarization in the wound microenvironment is beneficial for treating diabetic wounds. Nowadays, hydrogels, as an emerging wound dressing, have great potential to replace or supplement traditional bandages or gauze. Here, glycyl methacrylate gelatin (Gel-Gym), oxidized hyaluronic acid (HA-CHO) and lauric acid (LA) were used to prepare the composite hydrogel (GH/LA) in addressing the clinical dilemma. The hydrogel could withstand 50 % compression deformation, its swelling rate was as low as 18 %, and its adhesion to pig skin reached 14 kPa. Moreover, a diabetic infected wound model was used to evaluate the feasibility of GH/LA hydrogel in vivo. The hydrogels' antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and prorestitutive potentials were further investigated, and GH/LA showed a therapeutic effect on diabetic wounds. Interestingly, macrophage polarization into the M2 phenotype was significantly enhanced in the presence of GH/ LA via GPR40/NF-kappa B pathway. This study provided a new avenue for treating methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infected diabetic wounds.

AB  - This study investigated the time course of lipid accumulation during IVM and assessed the role of lipid modulators added during IVM on lipid content, nuclear maturation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial activity, gene expression, and cryosurvival of cat oocytes. First, the lipid content of immature COCs was compared to those subjected to different IVM duration times (24, 28, and 32 h). Then, the lipid content was investigated after the use of different lipid modulators [conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), forskolin (FSK), l-carnitine (LC)]. Subsequently, both the CONTROL group and MIX 18 (CLA+FSK+LC) were compared regarding nuclear maturation, mitochondrial activity, reactive oxygen 19 species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) levels, to the expression of SDHA, GDF9, BMP15, ZAR-1, 20 PRDX1, SIRT1, and SIRT3 genes (normalized by ACTB and YWHAZ genes); and to vitrification and 21 post-warming viability assessment. When not using any lipid modulator, an increase (P < 0.05) in lipid content could be observed after 28 h of IVM. The MIX group showed the greatest (P < 0.05) reduction in oocyte lipid content after 28 h of IVM. No difference (P > 0.05) was observed in the MII rate in the CONTROL (45%) and MIX (41%) groups and in mitochondrial activity ((1.00 +/- 0.35 A U vs 1.19 +/- 0.14 A U). Although ROS and GSH levels were higher (P < 0.05) in MIX than in CONTROL, the redox balance (ROS/GSH) was greater (P < 0.05) in the latter (C:1.00 +/- 0.20(b) vs M:0.26 +/- 0.06 (a) A.U). The GDF9, HSP70, PRDX1, and SIRT1 transcripts were downregulated (P < 0.05) in MIX-oocytes, compared to the CONTROL. After vitrification, MIX (74%) presented a higher (P < 0.05) viability compared to control (53%). In conclusion, MIX can reduce the total lipid content and improve viability after cryopreservation, however, it seems to affect the oocyte metabolism in a way that still needs to be better understood in the cat biological model.

AB  - Chemoresistance, tumor progression, and metastasis are features that are frequently seen in cancer that have been associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). These cells are a promising target in the future of cancer therapy but remain largely unknown. Deregulation of pathways that govern stemness in non-tumorigenic stem cells (SCs), such as Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog pathways, has been described in CSC pathogenesis, but it is necessary to conduct further studies to discover potential new therapeutic targets. In addition, some markers for the identification and characterization of CSCs have been suggested, but the search for specific CSC markers in many cancer types is still under development. In addition, methods for CSC cultivation are also under development, with great heterogeneity existing in the protocols used. This review focuses on the most recent aspects of the identification, characterization, cultivation, and targeting of human CSCs, highlighting the advances achieved in the clinical implementation of therapies targeting CSCs and remarking those potential areas where more research is still required.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIn the present study, medium and long-chain triacylglycerol (MLCT) was synthesized from camellia oil (CO) and medium chain triglyceride by enzymatic transesterification. Novel MLCT oleogel was constructed using MLCT as substrate oil, as well as beta-sitosterol /gamma-oryzanol (SO), monoglyceride and carnauba wax as oleogelators, and the regulation mechanism of MLCT on self-assembly behavior was investigated.RESULTSThe G ', apparent viscosity, oil binding capacity and hardness of the three MLCT oleogels were reduced compared to CO oleogels. The hydrogen bond strength and intermolecular force of MLCT oleogel was lower than that of CO oleogel, which explains the lower crystal amount and weak thermal stability of MLCT oleogel. Furthermore, MLCT have a lower long carbon chain fatty acids (LCFAs) content than CO, helping to reduce the calorie of the oleogels. Among the three MLCT oleogels, ML-SO formed a strong network with the highest mechanical strength and thermal stability.CONCLUSIONThe introduction of medium chain fatty acids into the glycerol skeleton weaken the gel network structure of oleogel, and this weakening effect was a result of the decrease of unsaturation and LCFAs content in MLCT. This study provides a direction for the development of low calorie functional plastic fat. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Missense mutations of the tumor suppressor Neurofibromin 2 (NF2/Merlin/schwannomin) result in sporadic to frequent occurrences of tumorigenesis in multiple organs. However, the underlying pathogenicity of NF2-related tumorigenesis remains mostly unknown. Here we found that NF2 facilitated innate immunity by regulating YAP/TAZ-mediated TBK1 inhibition. Unexpectedly, patient-derived individual mutations in the FERM domain of NF2 (NF2m) converted NF2 into a potent suppressor of cGAS-STING signaling. Mechanistically, NF2m gained extreme associations with IRF3 and TBK1 and, upon innate nucleic acid sensing, was directly induced by the activated IRF3 to form cellular condensates, which contained the PP2A complex, to eliminate TBK1 activation. Accordingly, NF2m robustly suppressed STING-initiated antitumor immunity in cancer cell-autonomous and -nonautonomous murine models, and NF2m-IRF3 condensates were evident in human vestibular schwannomas. Our study reports phase separation-mediated quiescence of cGAS-STING signaling by a mutant tumor suppressor and reveals gain-of-function pathogenesis for NF2-related tumors by regulating antitumor immunity.

Meanwhile, vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common subtype of dementia, in which inflammation is one of the major pathogenic contributors. However, the protective effect of pterostilbene on VaD is not well understood. In this work, we investigated the effect of pterostilbene on VaD and explored its underlying mechanisms using in vivo and in vitro models. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests showed pterostilbene-attenuated cognitive impairment in mice with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). The hippocampal neuronal death and microglial activation in BCCAO mice were also reduced by pterostilbene treatment. Further, pterostilbene inhibited the expression of TLR4 and downstream inflammatory cytokines in these mice, with similar results observed in an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) BV-2 cell model. In addition, its antiinflammatory effect on OGD/R BV-2 cells was partially blocked by TLR4 overexpression. Moreover, Triad3A-TLR4 interactions were increased by pterostilbene following enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of TLR4, and the inhibitory effect of pterostilbene on inflammation was blocked by Triad3A knockdown in OGD/R-stimulated BV-2 cells. Together, these results reveal that pterostilbene could reduce vascular cognitive impairment and that Triad3A-mediated TLR4 degradation might be the key target.

AB  - Glucocorticoids administered early in infancy can affect the architectonic organization of brain structures, particularly those with a postnatal development and resulting in long-term deficits of neuromotor function and cognition. The present study was undertaken to study the effects of daily corticosterone (CORT) injections at a pharmacological dose from postnatal days 8-15 on cerebellar and hippocampal development in mouse pups. Gene expression status for trophic factors involved in synaptic development and function as well as measures of layer thickness associated with cytochrome oxidase labelling were analyzed in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and specific cerebellar lobules involved in motor control. Repeated CORT injections dysregulated the HPA axis with increased Crh and Nr3c1 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and a resulting higher serum corticosterone level. The CORT treatment altered the morphology of the hippocampus and down-regulated gene transcription for corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) and its type-1 receptor (Crhr1), glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Bdnf and its receptor Ntrk2 (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2). Similar mRNA expression decreases were found in the cerebellum for Crhr1, Crhr2, Nr3c1, and Grid2 (glutamatergic delta 2 receptor). Morphological alterations and metabolic activity variations were observed in specific cerebellar lobules involved in motor control. The paramedian lobule, normally characterized by mitotic activity in the external germinative layer during the second postnatal week, was atrophic but metabolically hyperactive in its granule cell and molecular layers. On the contrary, lobules with an earlier cell proliferation displayed neurogenesis but a hypoactivated granule cell layer, suggesting a developmental delay in synaptogenesis. The results indicate that glucocorticoid, administered daily during the second postnatal week modulated the developmental programming of the hippocampus and cerebellum. These growth and metabolic alterations may lead possibly to morphological and functional changes later in life.

AB  - The variation of gestation length in sows leads to difficulties performing farrowing supervision. The present study was performed to investigate whether oral administration of altrenogest until 112 days of gestation and double administration of PGF2a at 113 days of gestation can synchronise the onset of parturition in sows and minimise deleterious effects on the incidence of stillbirths and colostrum quality. Additionally, the effects of synchronised farrowing on colostrum yield and piglet birth weight, colostrum intake and survival rate of piglets until seven days of postnatal life were also investigated. In total, 193 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred sows were randomly allocated according to parity number into two groups, i.e. control (n = 95) and treatment (n = 98). The control sows were allowed to farrow naturally. The treatment sows were orally administered 20 mg per day of altrenogest for four days from 109 to 112 days of gestation and were administered PGF2a twice on day 113 of gestation. Individual body weight at birth and 24 h after birth of piglets in all litters were determined in both control (n = 1609) and treatment (n = 1707) groups. Colostrum consumption of all piglets, colostrum yield, colostrum IgG and serum progesterone of sows were determined. On average, the total number of piglets born per litter were 17.0 +/- 3.1. The proportion of sows farrowed before 114 days of gestation was higher in the control than the treatment group (8.4% and 2.0%, respectively, P = 0.05) and 92.8% of sows in the treatment group farrowed on day 114 of gestation. The percentage of stillborn piglets per litter did not differ significantly between control and treatment groups (4.5% and 4.6%, respectively). Colostrum yield of sows did not differ between control and treatment groups (5.52 +/- 0.13 and 5.28 +/- 0.12 kg, respectively, P = 0.174). However, colostrum intake of piglets was lower in the treatment than the control group (354.7 +/- 6.6 and 381.2 +/- 7.0 g, respectively, P = 0.012). Colostrum IgG was higher in the control than the treatment group (41.2 +/- 1.1 and 37.3 mg per ml, P = 0.013). In conclusion, altrenogest treatment from 109 to 112 days and double administrations of PGF2a on day 113 of gestation can control gestation length in sows. No deleterious effects of this protocol on the incidence of stillbirths and sow colostrum yield were detected. However, piglet colostrum intake and colostrum IgG were compromised. Thus, care of newborn piglets in the treatment group should be considered. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Andean cat is one of the rarest cats in South America. Although it has a broad distribution in the Andes there are few reliable records and many sites whose presence has not been confirmed. The objective of this study was to confirm the presence of the Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita) in the Andenes of Cuyocuyo priority site, located in southeast Peru. In 2018, with an effort of 1275 camera-traps/day, 123 detections of 11 mammals were obtained, the most frequent being: Lagidium viscacia, Leopardus jacobita, Hippocamelus antisensis, and Leopardus garleppi. The relative abundance index of the Andean cat was 9.09 (N= 12, DE= 32.20) and the period of activity indicates that they have diurnal (Fr= 0.42) and nocturnal (Fr= 0.33) habits. The confirmation of the Andean cat in the priority site highlights the need to implement conservation mechanisms with the human communities that ensure the conservation of the Andean cat and other mammals in this region of Peru.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, represents a highly contagious swine disease that causes substantial economic losses in the global pig industry. As the most prevalent RNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as a crucial epitranscriptomic regulator of host-pathogen interactions, although its functional significance in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) remains to be fully elucidated. This study drew m6A maps before and after ALKBH5 interfering with IPEC-J2 cells, revealing the mechanism by which ALKBH5 mediated m6A regulates PEDV infection in IPECJ2 cells. This study employs an in vitro model of PEDV-induced IPEC-J2 cell damage to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of m6A methylation in host antiviral responses. Utilizing a comprehensive multi-omics approach, including MeRIP-seq, RNA-seq, qPCR, Western blot, MeRIP-qPCR, and RIP-qPCR, we systematically uncovered the critical role of m6A methylation in antiviral defense. Our findings reveal that ALKBH5, a key demethylase during PEDV infection, plays a pivotal role in modulating m6A modification levels. Specifically, gene silencing of ALKBH5 significantly upregulates m6A modification but downregulates expression of the antiviral effector genes IFIT3 and HERC5. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the YTHDC2 protein selectively recognizes m6A modification sites within IFIT3 and HERC5 transcripts, thereby mediating ALKBH5-dependent regulation of mRNA stability and protein expression. Functional analyses further reveal that IFIT3 activates the IRF3/TBK1 signaling axis, while HERC5 enhances antiviral responses by modulating the key effector molecule ISG15. Together, these findings establish a synergistic antiviral mechanism in IPEC-J2 cells. This study is the first to elucidate the novel ALKBH5-YTHDC2-m6A molecular axis, which orchestrates host antiviral immunity through a dual-pathway regulatory mode. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of RNA epigenetic modifications in enterovirus infections and offer a molecular basis for developing m6A-targeted strategies to prevent and control porcine infectious gastroenteritis.

AB  - Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and their extensions have proven to be powerful tools for classification of observations that stem from systems with temporal dependence as they take into account that observations close in time are likely generated from the same state (i.e., class). When information on the classes of the observations is available in advanced, supervised methods can be applied. In this paper, we provide details for the implementation of four models for classification in a supervised learning context: HMMs, hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs), autoregressive-HMMs, and autoregressive-HSMMs. Using simulations, we study the classification performance under various degrees of model misspecification to characterize when it would be important to extend a basic HMM to an HSMM. As an application of these techniques we use the models to classify accelerometer data from Merino sheep to distinguish between four different behaviors of interest. In particular in the field of movement ecology, collection of fine-scale animal movement data over time to identify behavioral states has become ubiquitous, necessitating models that can account for the dependence structure in the data. We demonstrate that when the aim is to conduct classification, various degrees of model misspecification of the proposed model may not impede good classification performance unless there is high overlap between the state-dependent distributions, that is, unless the observation distributions of the different states are difficult to differentiate.

AB  - Dense core vesicles (DCVs) transport and release various neuropeptides and neurotrophins that control diverse brain functions, but the DCV secretory pathway remains poorly understood. Here, we tested a prediction emerging from invertebrate studies about the crucial role of the intracellular trafficking GTPase Rab10, by assessing DCV exocytosis at single-cell resolution upon acute Rab10 depletion in mature mouse hippocampal neurons, to circumvent potential confounding effects of Rab10's established role in neurite outgrowth. We observed a significant inhibition of DCV exocytosis in Rab10-depleted neurons, whereas synaptic vesicle exocytosis was unaffected. However, rather than a direct involvement in DCV trafficking, this effect was attributed to two ER-dependent processes, ER-regulated intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, and protein synthesis. Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed proteins upon Rab10 depletion identified substantial alterations in synaptic and ER/ribosomal proteins, including the Ca2+ pump SERCA2. In addition, ER morphology and dynamics were altered, ER Ca2+ levels were depleted, and Ca2+ homeostasis was impaired in Rab10-depleted neurons. However, Ca2+ entry using a Ca2+ ionophore still triggered less DCV exocytosis. Instead, leucine supplementation, which enhances protein synthesis, largely rescued DCV exocytosis deficiency. We conclude that Rab10 is required for neuropeptide release by maintaining Ca2+ dynamics and regulating protein synthesis. Furthermore, DCV exocytosis appeared more dependent on (acute) protein synthesis than synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

AB  - Seizures due to cortical dysplasia are notorious for their poor prognosis even with medications and surgery, likely due to the widespread seizure network. Previous studies have primarily focused on the disruption of dysplastic lesions, rather than remote regions such as the hippocampus. Here, we first quantified the epileptogenicity of the hippocampus in patients with late-stage cortical dysplasia. We further investigated the cellular substrates leading to the epileptic hippocampus, using multiscale tools including calcium imaging, optogenetics, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. For the first time, we revealed the role of hippocampal somatostatin-positive interneurons in cortical dysplasia-related seizures. Somatostatin-positive were recruited during cortical dysplasia-related seizures. Interestingly, optogenetic studies suggested that somatostatin-positive interneurons paradoxically facilitated seizure generalization. By contrast, parvalbumin-positive interneurons retained an inhibitory role as in controls. Electrophysiological recordings and immunohistochemical studies revealed glutamate-mediated excitatory transmission from somatostatin-positive interneurons in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, our study reveals a novel role of excitatory somatostatin-positive neurons in the seizure network and brings new insights into the cellular basis of cortical dysplasia.

AB  - Mammalian SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodelers play dosage-sensitive roles in many human malignancies and neurologic disorders. The gene encoding the BAF subunit actin-like 6a (ACTL6A) is amplified early in the development of many squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), but its oncogenic role remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ACTL6A overexpression leads to its stoichiometric assembly into BAF complexes and drives their interaction and engagement with specific regulatory regions in the genome. In normal epithelial cells, ACTL6A was substoichiometric to other BAF subunits. However, increased ACTL6A levels by ectopic expression or in SCC cells led to near saturation of ACTL6A within BAF complexes. Increased ACTL6A occupancy enhanced polycomb opposition genome-wide to activate SCC genes and facilitated the co-dependent loading of BAF and TEAD-YAP complexes on chromatin. Both mechanisms appeared to be critical and function as a molecular AND gate for SCC initiation and maintenance, thereby explaining the specificity of the role of ACTL6A amplification in SCCs.

AB  - Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling mental disorder, involving numerous genetic changes that are associated with abnormal functions in multiple regions of the brain. However, there is little transcriptomic-wide characterization of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) to comprehensively compare the transcriptional changes in multiple brain regions. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) was used to reveal the spatial difference of gene expression in the control, resilient (RES) and susceptible (SUS) mouse brains, and annotated eight anatomical brain regions and six cell types. The gene expression profiles uncovered that CSDS leads to gene synchrony changes in different brain regions. Then it was identified that inhibitory neurons and synaptic functions in multiple regions were primarily affected by CSDS. The brain regions Hippocampus (HIP), Isocortex, and Amygdala (AMY) present more pronounced transcriptional changes in genes associated with depressive psychiatric disorders than other regions. Signalling communication between these three brain regions may play a critical role in susceptibility to CSDS. Taken together, this study provides important new insights into CSDS susceptibility at the ST level, which offers a new approach for understanding and treating depression.
   In this study, Wang et al. explored the potential pathogenesis of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depressive-like behaviour in mice using 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) technique. Many of the depression-related gene changes were identified and more pronounced in the hippocampus (HIP), cortex (Isocortex), and amygdala (AMY) in susceptible (SUS) mice compared to control and resilient (RES) mice. In particular, compared to other cell types, inhibitory interneurons, and synaptic function were most significantly affected in multiple brain regions following CSDS. image

AB  - BackgroundElectroacupuncture (EA) is a complementary and alternative therapy which has shown protective effects on vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely understood.MethodsRat models of VCI were established with cerebral ischemia using occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or bilateral common carotid artery. The brain structure and function imaging were measured through animal MRI. miRNA expression was detected by chip and qPCR. Synaptic functional plasticity was detected using electrophysiological techniques.ResultsThis study demonstrated the enhancement of Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) activity of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the entorhinal cortical (EC) and hippocampus (HIP) in response to EA treatment. miR-219a was selected and confirmed to be elevated in HIP and EC in VCI but decreased after EA. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor1 (NMDAR1) was identified as the target gene of miR-219a. miR-219a regulated NMDAR-mediated autaptic currents, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC), and long-term potentiation (LTP) of the EC-HIP CA1 circuit influencing synaptic plasticity. EA was able to inhibit miR-219a, enhancing synaptic plasticity of the EC-HIP CA1 circuit and increasing expression of NMDAR1 while promoting the phosphorylation of downstream calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), improving overall learning and memory in VCI rat models.ConclusionInhibition of miR-219a ameliorates VCI by regulating NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity in animal models of cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Sperm morphology is an important marker of fertility in livestock. Since poor sperm morphology can disqualify a sire from being sold or used for breeding, it is crucial to understand the factors that influence changes in sperm morphology over time. It is often hypothesised that little variation exists in sperm morphology from ejaculate to ejaculate so long as factors such as nutrition, season, health, and thermal status remain the same. This study aimed to test this hypothesis by investigating the morphology of sperm collected from rams (Ovine aries) (n = 3) twice daily, three times per week, over an 8-week period. Sperm morphology was evaluated using an eight-category classification system. Results revealed that each ram exhibited high levels of variability, with only 10.4% of ejaculates within +/- 5% of their own mean percentage normal sperm (PNS). The percentage of normal sperm over the 8-week period was significantly influenced by intra-week variation, although no consistent trend was observed across the full duration of the study. Within each day, a significant decline in the percentage of normal sperm was observed when a second ejaculate was collected consecutively. This decline was primarily attributed to an increase in cytoplasmic droplets and midpiece abnormalities. These findings suggest that rams subjected to regular semen collection in a controlled environment are likely to exhibit considerable variation in the percentage of normal sperm from ejaculate to ejaculate. For artificial breeding centres and veterinarians, repeated semen collection on the same day may reduce the proportion of normal sperm. As such, assessment of each separate ejaculate for sperm morphology is recommended before pooling for processing or insemination.

AB  - Simple Summary Oxidative stress may reduce the growth performance and intestinal health status of weanling piglets. Due to the fact that the body can synthesize glycine, it is generally treated as an amino acid which is nonessential for nourishment. However, previous research has demonstrated that synthesized glycine was unable to support piglets' newborn growth and development. Moreover, according to several findings, glycine is crucial for relieving oxidative stress and intestinal damage. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether glycine could lessen the intestinal damage caused by diquat in weanling piglets and the relationship between ferroptosis and diquat-induced intestinal epithelial cell death. The results showed that dietary glycine reduced intestinal oxidative stress induced by diquat in weanling piglets. Furthermore, with increasing anti-oxidative capacity, dietary glycine was able to restrain intestinal epithelial cell ferroptosis triggered by diquat. The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of glycine on intestinal injury caused by oxidative stress in piglets. A 2 x 2 factorial experiment with diets (basic diet vs. 1% glycine diet) and oxidative stress (saline vs. diquat) was conducted on 32 weanling piglets. On day 21, all piglets received an injection of either saline or diquat. After 7 days, all pigs were slaughtered and intestinal samples were collected. Dietary glycine supplementation improved intestinal mucosal morphology, increased the activities of disaccharidases and enhanced intestinal mucosal antioxidant capacity, while regulating the expression of ferroptosis mediators in the piglets under oxidative stress. These findings suggested that dietary glycine supplementation improved the morphology and function of the intestinal mucosa, which was involved in regulating antioxidant capacity and ferroptosis.

AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a widely used glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist drug in the treatment of T2D, has been demonstrated the therapeutic effects on diabetic encephalopathy (DE). Especially, the Ex-4 ameliorates the tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment in DE. And these crucial alterations are also important bridge between T2D and AD. However, its unique mechanism is unclear.
   Methods The db/db mice, high-fat-diet (HFD) / streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic (HF-diabetic) mice, and high-glucose-damaged (HGD) HT-22 hippocampal cells were enrolled to examine the effects of Ex-4 on AD-like changes in T2D. The Novel object recognition test (NORT) and Morris water maze test (MWMT) were conducted to evaluate the cognitive impairment. The Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) was employed to weaken the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway to explore the mechanism of Ex-4 in protecting the brain functions. The JASPAR was based to predict the interaction between NeuroD1 and the promoter region of Ins2. Moreover, the chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) and luciferase reporter assays were performed.
   Results Ex-4 alleviated the tau hyperphosphorylation, increased the brain-derived insulin, and improved the PI3K/AKT/GSK3-beta signalling in db/db mice, HF-diabetic mice, and HGD HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells. The NORT and MWMT indicated that Ex-4 alleviated the learning and memory deficits in HF-diabetic mice. The inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway significantly blocked the protective effects of Ex-4. Regarding further molecular mechanisms, NeuroD1 was affected by Ex-4 in vivo and in vitro, and the knockdown or overexpression of NeuroD1 suggested its crucial role in promoting the brain insulin by Ex-4. Meanwhile, the ChIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays confirmed the combination between NeuroD1 and the promoter region of the insulin-encoding gene Ins2. And this interaction could be promoted by Ex-4.
   ConclusionsOur study proposes that Ex-4 alleviates tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive dysfunction by increasing Ins2-derived brain insulin through the Wnt/beta-catenin/NeuroD1 signaling in T2D. And its also show new lights on part of the progress and mechanism on treatment targets for the DE in T2D.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bacopa floribunda (BF), a locally available plant has been employed traditionally as memory enhancer in Southwestern, Nigeria. It has been utilized in traditional and Ayurvedic medicine as brain tonic for enhancing memory, anti-aging and forestalling series of psychological disorders. However, there is a dearth of scientific information on the mechanism(s) of action of important phytochemicals from BF extract on dementia.& nbsp;Aim of the study: Alzheimer's disease, the commonest form of dementia has been postulated to triple by 2050 as a result of increase in life expectancy. This study therefore assessed and compared the possible mechanism(s) of action of flavonoids and saponins from BF on Amyloid beta (A beta 1-42)-induced dementia in male BALB/c mice.& nbsp;Materials and methods: Eighty (80) healthy BALB/c mice divided into 10 groups (n = 8) were given a single bilateral ICV injection of A beta 1-42 or normal saline. Graded doses of Saponins and flavonoids (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) were used as treatment for 21 days. Hippocampal homogenates were assayed for the levels of antioxidants, oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory markers. In vitro antioxidant activity of flavonoids and saponins were equally assessed using standard procedures. The extent of microglial activation was quantified through immunohistochemistry procedure.& nbsp;Results: A beta 1-42 successfully caused a spike in hippocampal levels of MDA, IL1 beta, TNF-alpha including MPO levels and invariably decreased antioxidant activities. Likewise an increase in reactive microglia (microgliosis) was observed. However, crude saponins and flavonoids from BF were able to suppress microgliosis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation induced by A beta 1-42 and were observed to be more effective at higher doses of saponins (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and flavonoid (100 mg/kg).& nbsp;Conclusions: Phytochemicals from BF efficiently exhibited dose dependent alleviation of some symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent modification to RNA in higher eukaryotes. ALKBH5 is an RNA demethylase that impacts RNA export and metabolism, and its aberrant expression is associated with the generation of tumours. In this study, we found that ALKBH5 was highly expressed in both primary CD138(+) plasma cells isolated from multiple myeloma (MM) patients and MM cell lines. Downregulation of ALKBH5 inhibited myeloma cell proliferation, neovascularization, invasion and migration ability, and promoted the apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. MeRIP-seq identified the SAV1 gene as main target gene of ALKBH5. Inhibiting ALKBH5 in MM cells increased SAV1 m(6)A levels, decreased SAV1 mRNA stability and expression, suppressed the stem cell related HIPPO-pathway signalling and ultimately activates the downstream effector YAP, exerting an anti-myeloma effect. Additionally, MM stem cell phenotype was suppressed in ALKBH5-deficient cells and the expression of pluripotency factors NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4 were also decreased. Altogether, our results suggest that ALKBH5 acts as an oncogene in MM and might serve as an attractive potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Qifu Yin (QFY) originates from "Jingyue Quanshu center dot Volume 51 center dot New Fang Bazhen center dot Buzhen" a work by Zhang Jingyue, a distinguished Chinese medical practitioner from the Ming Dynasty. QFY is composed of Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle, Ziziphi Spinosae Semen, and Polygalae Radix. QFY is frequently employed to address memory loss and cognitive impairment stemming from vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related conditions. Our findings indicate that QFY can mitigate nerve cell damage. Moreover, the study explores the impact of QFY on the calcium ion pathway and sphingolipid metabolism in mice with myocardial infarction, presenting a novel perspective on QFY's mechanism in ameliorating myocardial infarction through lipidomics. While this research provides an experimental foundation for the clinical application of QFY, a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of its improvement mechanism remains imperative. Aim of the study: To clarify the regulatory mechanism of QFY on intestinal microecology in mice with memory impairment (MI). Material and methods: The memory impairment mouse model was established by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine hydrobromide. Kunming (KM) mice were randomly divided into blank group, Ginkgo tablet group (0.276 g/kg), QFY high, medium and low dose groups (17.2 g/kg, 8.6 g/kg, 4.3 g/kg). The effect on memory ability was evaluated by open field and step-down behavioral experiments. The morphological changes of nerve cells in the hippocampus of mice were observed by pathological method. The contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the brain tissue of mice were detected. The expression levels of CREB, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Recombinant Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in the hippocampus of mice were determined using immunohistochemistry. The expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) related factors in the serum of mice was analyzed by ELISA. The levels of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mRNA in the hippocampus were detected by quantitative real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The intestinal feces of mice were collected, and the 16 S rDNA technology was used to detect the changes in intestinal microbiota microecological structure of feces in each group. Results: Behavioral experiments showed that the high-dose QFY group exhibited a significant increase in exercise time (P<0.05) and a decrease in diagonal time (P<0.05) compared to the model group. The medium-dose group of QFY showed a reduction in diagonal time (P<0.05). Additionally, the latency time significantly increased in the medium and high-dose groups of QFY (P<0.01). The number of errors in the low, medium and high dose groups was significantly decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.01). The nerve cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions of QFY-treated mice demonstrated close arrangement and clear structure. Furthermore, the content of SOD significantly increased (P<0.01) and the content of MDA significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the low and highdose QFY groups. The content of CAT in the medium-dose group significantly increased (P < 0.05).
   Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant reduction in the number of APP expression particles in the CA1 and CA3 regions of all QFY groups. Moreover, BDNF expression significantly increased in the medium and high-dose groups, while CREB expression significantly increased in the low and medium-dose groups of QFY within the CA1 and CA3 regions. Serum analysis revealed significant increases in CREB content in the low, medium, and high dose groups of QFY (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.05), and decreases in NMDAR content across all QFY dose groups (P<0.01). PCR analysis showed a significant decrease in the contents of ASK1 and JNK in the medium-dose group (P<0.01). Microecological analysis of intestinal microbiota demonstrated a significant restoration trend in the relative abundance of Fusobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia (P<0.01 or P<0.05) at the phylum level in the QFY groups. At the genus level, Akkermansia, Paramuribaculum, Herminiimonas, Erysipelatoclostridium and other genera in the QFY groups showed a significant trend of relative abundance restoration (P<0.01 or P<0.05). Conclusion: QFY can improve the memory of MI animals induced by scopolamine hydrobromide by restoring the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota and regulating related indexes in serum and brain tissue.

AB  - Demand for probiotics has increased significantly in recent years due to the growing consumer awareness of their benefits and advantages. In this study, we investigated the probiotic potential use of three antifungal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains namely Lactiplantibacillus pentosus 22B, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 21B and Enterococcus faecium LC2V5 isolated from wheat and camel milk. A series of in vitro probiotic tests were performed to evaluate their functional and safety properties. Results indicated that consumption of these three strains does not present any health risk, as they showed no undesirable virulence factors (hemolysins and DNAse) or transmissible antibiotic resistance. All strains exhibited high tolerance to simulated oro-gastro-intestinal tract conditions since the number of viable cells was 10(9) CFU/mL after exposure to these digestive stress environments. Evaluation of cell surface characteristics revealed that the three strains showed high degrees of auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and co-aggregation with pathogens. Moreover, the strains demonstrated strong antagonistic activity against all tested pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Furthermore, they were able to produce exopolysaccharides and ferment lactose. The studied strains showed also antioxidant activity by scavenging 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals. In conclusion, the probiotic features demonstrated by the studied LAB strains suggest their suitability for potential use as probiotics.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is part of a neurovascular structure located in the brain's micro vessels, that is essential to maintain brain homeostasis, but prevents the brain uptake of most drugs. Because of its importance in neuro-pharmacotherapy, the BBB has been the subject of extensive research since its discovery over 100 years ago. Major advances in understanding the structure and function of the barrier have been made. Drugs are re-designed to cross the BBB. However, despite these efforts, overcoming the BBB efficiently to treat brain diseases safely remains challenging. The majority of BBB research studies focus on the BBB as a homogenous structure throughout the different brain regions. However, this simplification may lead to an inadequate understanding of the BBB function with significant therapeutic consequences. From this perspective, we analyzed the gene and protein expression profiles of the BBB in the micro vessels from the brains of mice that were isolated from two different brain regions, namely the cortex and the hippocampus. The expression profile of the inter-endothelial junctional protein (claudin-5), three ABC transporters (P-glycoprotein, Bcrp and Mrp-1), and three BBB receptors (lrp-1, TRF and GLUT-1) were analyzed. Our gene and protein analysis showed that the brain endothelium in the hippocampus exhibits different expression profiles compared to the brain cortex. Specifically, brain endothelial cells (BECs) of the hippocampus express higher gene levels of abcb1, abcg2, lrp1, and slc2a1 compared to the BECs of the cortex regions with a trend of increase for claudin-5, while BECs of the cortex express higher gene levels of abcc1 and trf compared to the hippocampus. At the protein levels, the P-gp expression was found to be significantly higher in the hippocampus compared to the cortex, while TRF was found to be up-regulated in the cortex. These data suggest that the structure and function of the BBB are not homogeneous, and imply that drugs are not delivered similarly among the different brain regions. Appreciation of the BBB heterogeneity by future research programs is thus critical for efficient drug delivery and the treatment of brain diseases.

AB  - In recent years, research has been conducted to develop new medical treatments by simulating environments existing in space, such as zero-gravity. In this study, we evaluated the cell proliferation and gene expression of activated primary human hepatic stellate cells (HHSteCs) under simulated microgravity (SMG). Under SMG, cell proliferation was slower than in 1 G, and the evaluation of gene expression changes on day 1 of SMG by serial analysis of gene expression revealed the presence of Sirtuin, EIF2 signaling, hippo signaling, and epithelial adherence junction signaling. Moreover, reactive oxygen species were upregulated under SMG, and when N-acetyl-cystein was added, no difference in proliferation between SMG and 1 G was observed, suggesting that the oxidative stress generated by mitochondrial dysfunction caused a decrease in proliferation. Upstream regulators such as smad3, NFkB, and FN were activated, and cell-permeable inhibitors such as Ly294002 and U0126 were inhibited. Immunohistochemistry performed to evaluate cytoskeletal changes showed that more beta-actin was localized in the cortical layer under SMG.

The neuroprotective effect of andrographolide (AGA) has been confirmed, anda acetylated derivative of AGA (3,14,19-triacetylandrographolide, ADA) was considered to have stronger efficacy.
   Purpose: The current study aims to investigate the impact of ADA on cognitive ability in a sporadic AD model and explore its potential mechanism.
   Study design/ methods: Apoe4 mouse was adopted for evaluating the impact of AGA on cognitive impairment through a serious of behavioral tests. The molecular mechanism of ADA involved in mitophagy and neuroinflammation was investigated in detailby Western blot, ELISA, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy in Apoe4 mice, as well as Apoe4-transfected BV2 cells and HT22 cells.
   Results: ADA application significantly improved cognitive impairment of Apoe4 mice, and lessened A beta load and neuronal damage, which has stronger activity than its prototype AGA. Accumulated mitophagy markers LC3II, P62, TOM20, PINK1 and Parkin, and decreased mitophagy receptor BNIP3 in hippocampus of Apoe4 mice were greatly reversed after ADA treatment. Meanwhile, ADA promoted the recruitment of BNIP3 to mitochondria, and the transport of damaged mitochondria to lysosome, indicating that disturbed mitophagy in AD mice was restored by ADA. Inhibited SIRT3 and FOXO3a in Apoe4 mice brains were elevated after ADA treatment. ADA also lightened the neuroinflammation caused by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Additionally, damaged mitophagy and/or activated NLRP3 inflammasome were also observed in BV2 cells and HT22 cells transfected with Apoe4, all of which were rescued by ADA incubation. Noteworthily, SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP could abolish the impact of ADA on mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro.
   Conclusion: ADA exerted stronger cognition-enhancing ability in relative to AGA, and ADA could repaire mitophagy deficiency via SIRT3-FOXO3a pathway, and subsequently inhibite NLRP3 inflammasome to mitigate AD pathology.

AB  - A representative sample of Maltese citizens (N = 384) was surveyed about their perception and attitude towards animal welfare and animal-friendly foods. Knowledge about animal welfare was self-evaluated as moderate (36%) or good (27%), and mass media (television, web and newspapers) were the primary information source (73%). Dairy cows were perceived as having the highest welfare (average rating 3 on a 1-to-5 scale), while conditions for broilers and pigs were perceived as more critical (average rating 2.7). Respondents consider animal welfare important (64%), the availability of welfare-friendly products in Malta limited (49%), and would support a national animal-friendly label (84%). Although 49% were willing to pay more for animal-friendly products, the accepted price increase was limited (increase below 10% for 37% of respondents, 20% were not willing to pay more and 27% were price-sensitive). Chi-squared analysis showed that the respondents' profession impacted the support towards an animal welfare label (p < 0.01), with business operators being the least interested. Urban respondents were more critical toward farm animal welfare and more supportive of establishing a national welfare label than rural respondents (p < 0.05). The latter were less convinced that their choices can influence the welfare of farm animals (p < 0.01). Women were more willing to pay for welfare improvements than men (p < 0.01). These findings emphasize a significant concern for animal welfare among respondents, coupled with a moderate willingness to pay. The strong support for a national animal welfare label warrants the question as to whether transparent labelling would allow consumers to translate their sensibility into ethical purchasing behaviour.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe rolling-cutting process (RCP) is a crucial process in crush-tear-curl (CTC) black tea, but its quality formation is far from clear. This study aims to elucidate the dynamics of sensory quality and metabolites through quantitative descriptive analysis, headspace solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTSSixteen key characteristic aromas with ratio of each relative odor activity value (rOAV) to the maximum rOAV (ROAV) >= 0.1, variable importance in projection (VIP) > 1, and P < 0.05 were screened out, and linalool, (2E)-2-nonenal, and (E)-2-hexenal were the top three ROAVs. The RCP mainly facilitated the release of grassy aromas through fatty acid oxidation while also promoting the synthesis of fruity aromas through monoterpene biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid/benzoid biosynthesis. Additionally, 72 non-volatiles (VIP > 1.50, P < 0.01) were identified as characteristic metabolites, and flavonoids accounted for the largest proportion. RCP accelerated the glycosylation of kaempferol and quercetin to enhance the bitter and astringent attributes. CONCLUSIONThese findings will promote the comprehension of CTC black tea quality formation in RCP. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a neuroprotective protein essential for embryonic development, proper brain development, and neuronal plasticity. Its mutation causes the autism-like ADNP syndrome (also called the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome), characterized by neural developmental disorders and motor dysfunctions. Similar to the ADNP syndrome, the ADNP haploinsufficient mouse shows low synapse density, leading to motor and cognitive ability delays. Moderate physical activity (PA) has several neuroprotective and cognitive benefits, promoting neuronal survival, differentiation, neurogenesis, and plasticity. Until now, no study has investigated the effect of moderate exercise on ADNP expression and distribution in the rat brain. The aim of the current investigation was to study the effects of moderate exercise on the ADNP expression and neuronal activation measured by the microtubule protein beta-Tubulin III. In pursuit of this objective, twenty-four rats were selected and evenly distributed into two categories: sedentary control rats and rats exposed to moderate physical activity on a treadmill over a span of 12 weeks. Our results showed that moderate PA increases the expression of ADNP and beta-Tubulin III in the dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal region and cerebellum. Moreover, we found a co-localization of ADNP and beta-Tubulin III in both DG and cerebellum, suggesting a direct association of ADNP with adult neuronal activation induced by moderate PA.

AB  - This research presents the synthesis and characterization of copper nanoparticles employing amino acids, specifically L-arginine and L-aspartic acid, as capping agents at varying concentrations (0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1 g). The study aims to modify corrosion resistance, crystal size, and surface morphology through electrodeposition using a solution containing CuSO4 and additives. Prior to the addition of amino acids, the influences of copper concentration and H2SO4 concentration on the apparent density, shape, and particle size of the resulting powder were investigated. Characterization techniques, including XRD pattern analysis, FE-SEM scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and FTIR, were employed. The scanning electron microscopy images revealed well-distributed particles with an average size of approximately 30 nm. Additionally, the research explores the impact of camel saliva as an additive on the morphology and particle size of copper powder during the electrodeposition process. The overarching objective is to identify non-toxic and environmentally friendly leveling agents, with a focus on utilizing amino acids for an in-depth investigation into the copper dissolution reaction. This understanding contributes to elucidating the redox reactions involved when metals dissolve in strong acids, providing insights into the development of inhibitory materials that yield nanoscale sizes. Such nanomaterials find applications in diverse fields, including medicine, electronics, and industry.

AB  - Rhynchophylline (Rhy) is an attractive candidate, harboring ameliorative effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, its application is impeded by its low water solubility and poor bioavailability. Here we synthesized and characterized the Rhy-loaded hyaluronic acid-modified hafnium metal-organic frameworks (HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF). The drug release profiles of free Rhy from HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF were evaluated, and the cellular toxicity was assessed through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. In vivo experiments included behavioral experiments of various murine capabilities, with neuronal damage appraised through Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and Nissl staining. Subsequently, the formation of AD-related amyloid beta (A beta) plaques formation and Tau phosphorylation were measured. The HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF with spherical shape were presented as uniformly dispersed and with a negative charge, exhibiting a pronounced pharmacological sustained-release effect and minimal cellular toxicity. Findings from the Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and elevated plus maze test substantiated that HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF effectively mitigated cognitive deficiency and anxiety, and enhanced spatial learning in AD mice. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot both illustrated that HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF could attenuate hippocampal A beta formation and deposition, as well as tau hyperphosphorylation. In conclusion, HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF exerts its therapeutic efficacy against AD by targeting the deposition of A beta plaques and inhibiting site-specific phosphorylation of Tau.

AB  - Muscular insufficiency is observed in many conditions after injury, chronic inflammation, and especially in elderly populations. Causative cell therapies for muscle deficiencies are not state of the art. Animal models to study the therapy efficacy are, therefore, needed. We developed an improved protocol to produce myoblasts suitable for pre-clinical muscle therapy studies in a large animal model. Myoblasts were isolated from the striated muscle, expanded by employing five different protocols, and characterized on transcript and protein expression levels to determine procedures that yielded optimized regeneration-competent myoblasts and multi-nucleated myotubes. We report that swine skeletal myoblasts proliferated well under improved conditions without signs of cellular senescence, and expressed significant levels of myogenic markers including Pax7, MyoD1, Myf5, MyoG, Des, Myf6, CD56 (p <= 0.05 each). Upon terminal differentiation, myoblasts ceased proliferation and generated multi-nucleated myotubes. Injection of such myoblasts into the urethral sphincter complex of pigs with sphincter muscle insufficiency yielded an enhanced functional regeneration of this muscle (81.54% of initial level) when compared to the spontaneous regeneration in the sham controls without myoblast injection (67.03% of initial level). We conclude that the optimized production of porcine myoblasts yields cells that seem suitable for preclinical studies of cell therapy in a porcine large animal model of muscle insufficiency.

AB  - Both the livestock and biomedical fields require a large supply of high-quality mature oocytes. However, the in vitro maturation (IVM) process often leads to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause defects in oocyte meiosis and embryo development, ultimately compromising oocyte quality. Urolithin A (UA), known for its antioxidant properties, has not been thoroughly investigated for its potential to mitigate the negative effects of oxidative stress during the in vitro culturing of oocytes, and its underlying mechanism is not well understood. In this study, an in vitro oxidative stress model was established using porcine oocytes treated with H2O2, followed by exposure to varying concentrations of UA. The results revealed that 30 mu M UA significantly improved both the quality of oocyte culture and the developmental potential of the resulting embryos. UA was found to enhance oocyte autophagy, reduce oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage, and restore mitochondrial function. Additionally, it lowered ROS and DNA damage levels in the oocytes, maintained proper spindle/chromosome alignment and actin cytoskeleton structure, promoted nuclear maturation, prevented abnormal cortical granule distribution, and supported oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. As a result, UA alleviated oxidative stress-induced defects in oocyte maturation and cumulus cell expansion, thereby improving the developmental potential and quality of parthenogenetic embryos. After supplementation with UA, pig parthenogenetic embryo pluripotency-related genes (Nanog and Sox2) and antiapoptotic genes (Bcl2) were upregulated, while proapoptotic genes (Bax) were downregulated. In conclusion, this study suggests that adding UA during IVM can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of oxidative stress on porcine oocytes, presenting a promising strategy for enhancing their developmental potential in vitro.

AB  - Simple Summary Dogs are part of our everyday lives. It is therefore important that descriptors and definitions used to label their emotional states are understood correctly. Are laypersons able to interpret basic dog behaviour and emotions correctly in order to prevent dangerous situations? This study compared whether descriptors, such as "fearful", could be matched to their correct definitions, e.g., "dog may try to flee, hide or freeze; ears back", by laypersons. To this end, two sets of descriptors-one for veterinary situations and one for shelter situations-were used. Matching was substantially above chance; nonetheless, the mean proportion of correct responses was only 50% (SD +/- 16.6%) for the veterinary QBA set and 33% (SD +/- 14.3%) for the shelter QBA set. Emotional terms describing dog behaviour need to be clearly defined to avoid misinterpretations.Abstract A basic understanding of dog behaviour and emotion is relevant not only for professionals, such as veterinary personnel or dog trainers, but also for dog owners and for people with little contact with dogs. Information about dog behaviour and emotions is mostly conveyed verbally. This study explores whether definitions of dog behaviour and emotion are understood in such a way that they can be allocated to a descriptor (i.e., a label such as "fearful"), even by people with low background knowledge. If people can match descriptors to definitions, this suggests that the definitions are distinct enough and elicit mental representations of behaviour that can fit the label. Good agreement on the definitions is a prerequisite for the validity of the descriptors used; however, no study to date has tested this. A sample of 236 adults was asked to match descriptors of Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) for veterinary and shelter situations to their correct definitions, e.g., the descriptor "fearful" to its definition "dog may try to flee, hide or freeze; ears back". Matching was substantially above chance; nonetheless, the mean proportion of correct responses was only 50% (SD +/- 16.6%) for the veterinary QBA set and 33% (SD +/- 14.3%) for the shelter QBA set. Performance in the matching task was positively correlated with measures of experience with dogs. Taken together, the results suggest that descriptor-definition pairs used to describe dog behaviour need to be clearly defined to avoid misinterpretations when teaching laypeople how to interpret canine behaviour.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly severe neurodegenerative condition that affects the hippocampus and is characterized by memory loss and dementia. This investigation aims to determine the potential of a bacterial protease enzyme produced by a new mutant strain of bacteria (Bacillus cereus S6-3/UM90) to influence the rat behavioural, biochemical, histological, and immuno-histochemical functions induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) experimentally. The administration of LPS exhibited a decline in memory performance via Morris' Water Maze test along with an elevation of IL-6, IL-17, amino acid neurotransmitters, Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and 8-OHdG, whereas a decrease in ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), monoamine transmitters, AChE (acetylcholinesterase) and PC (phosphatidylcholine). Additionally, there was a notable increase in GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and p-Tau protein immuno-expression levels along with obvious histological lesions in the hippocampal CA3 region. Moreover, the administration of protease or Donepezil restored the measured parameters to nearly normal levels and improved the histological architecture of the hippocampus and ameliorated memory impairments. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that the treatment with Bacterial protease can improve the memory and learning impairments of LPS-induced AD and may be used as a promising therapeutic agent to manage AD since it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

   Increased knowledge of reproduction and health of domesticated animals is integral to sustain and improve global competitiveness of U.S. animal agriculture, understand and resolve complex animal and human diseases, and advance fundamental research in sciences that are critical to understanding mechanisms of action and identifying future targets for interventions. Historically, federal and state budgets have dwindled and funding for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) competitive grants programs remained relatively stagnant from 1985 through 2010. This shortage in critical financial support for basic and applied research, coupled with the underappreciated knowledge of the utility of non-rodent species for biomedical research, hindered funding opportunities for research involving livestock and limited improvements in both animal agriculture and animal and human health. In 2010, the National Institutes of Health and USDA NIFA established an interagency partnership to promote the use of agriculturally important animal species in basic and translational research relevant to both biomedicine and agriculture. This interagency program supported 61 grants totaling over $107 million with 23 awards to new or early-stage investigators. This article will review the success of the 9-year Dual Purpose effort and highlight opportunities for utilizing domesticated agricultural animals in research.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary bacteriophage administration on diarrhea and intestinal impairment induced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in a newly weaned mouse model. Forty-four newly weaned C57BL/6 mice were divided into four treatment groups, where they were provided either the control diet or the bacteriophage-supplemented diet, with or without ETEC infection. The results show that the bacteriophage administration resulted in increased body weight, decreased diarrhea score, and improved jejunal histopathology in ETEC-infected mice. The bacteriophage administration enhanced the intestinal barrier function of the ETEC-infected mice, as indicated by the reduced serum DAO level and the increased expression of Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels in the jejunum. Also, the bacteriophage administration resulted in a decrease in serum TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels, a down-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA levels in the jejunum, and the inhibition of jejunal TLR-4/NF-kappa B pathway activation induced by ETEC infection. Moreover, the bacteriophage administration increased the levels of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and total short-chain fatty acids in the caecum content. The bacteriophage administration increased the Shannon index, increased the abundance of Bacteroidota and Muribaculaceae, and decreased the abundance of Verrucomicrobiota and Akkermansiaceae in the colon contents of the ETEC-infected mice. Spearman's correlation analysis indicates that the protective effects of bacteriophage on ETEC-induced intestinal impairment, inflammation, and intestinal barrier function are associated with regulating the abundance of Bacteroidota and Muribaculaceae in the colon contents of mice. Collectively, bacteriophage administration alleviates ETEC-induced diarrhea and intestinal impairment through regulating intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota in newly weaned mice.

AB  - BackgroundTau phosphorylation is a tightly regulated process that ensures proper neuronal function. Indeed, hyperphosphorylation of tau closely contributes to neuronal dysfunction leading to neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies, which are characterized by excessive and aberrant tau phosphorylation and cognitive decline. Therefore, it is important to understand how to regulate its phosphorylation. In this regard, the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta (PTPRD) has been genetically implicated in tau pathology in humans, but the mechanisms underlying its role in tau regulation remain unclear. This study investigates the impact of Ptprd deficiency on tau phosphorylation, cognitive function, neuroinflammation, and synaptic markers in aging mice.ResultsMice lacking Ptprd showed increased tau phosphorylation at multiple sites associated with its pathological aggregation. This effect was accompanied by the activation of the tau-related kinase Abl1, particularly in the hippocampus. Behavioral assessments revealed significant impairments in learning and memory, demonstrating the functional impact of these alterations. Moreover, Ptprd knockout mice showed increased microgliosis in both the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, suggesting a pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, the synaptic protein PSD95 was also reduced in the cortex, indicating potential synaptic dysfunction.ConclusionsThe loss of Ptprd leads to increased tau phosphorylation, cognitive impairments, microgliosis, and synaptic alterations in older mice. Our findings also suggest that Ptprd plays a critical role in maintaining tau homeostasis through the Abl1 kinase. This indicates a new potential therapeutic approach for tauopathies, where PTPRD could serve a protective role against tau-related pathologies and may act as a key modulator in disease progression.

AB  - There is still a lack of effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia and cognitive decline. Identifying reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets is crucial for advancing AD research. In this study, we developed an aggregative multi-filter gene selection approach to identify AD biomarkers. This method integrates hub gene ranking techniques, such as degree and bottleneck, with feature selection algorithms, including Random Forest and Double Input Symmetrical Relevance, and applies ranking aggregation to improve accuracy and robustness. Five publicly available AD-related microarray datasets (GSE48350, GSE36980, GSE132903, GSE118553, and GSE5281), covering diverse brain regions like the hippocampus and frontal cortex, were analyzed, yielding 803 overlapping differentially expressed genes from 464 AD and 492 normal cases. An independent dataset (GSE109887) was used for external validation. The approach identified 50 prioritized genes, achieving an AUC of 86.8 in logistic regression on the validation dataset, highlighting their predictive value. Pathway analysis revealed involvement in critical biological processes such as synaptic vesicle cycles, neurodegeneration, and cognitive function. These findings provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for AD.

AB  - Simple Summary PRRS is one of the most important diseases that has brought significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. SLAMF1 is a costimulatory factor that is involved in innate immunity, inflammation, and infection. In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of the SLAMF1 gene inhibited PRRSV replication significantly and reduced the levels of key signaling pathways, including MyD88, RIG-I, TLR2, TRIF, and inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-8, TNF-beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-alpha in vitro. However, the knockdown of the SLAMF1 gene could enhance the replication of the PRRSV and the levels of key signaling pathways and inflammatory factors. Overall, our results identify a new antagonist of the PRRSV, providing a new reference and direction for PRRSV disease resistance breeding. The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes a highly contagious disease in domestic swine. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1) is a costimulatory factor that is involved in innate immunity, inflammation, and infection. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the SLAMF1 gene inhibited PRRSV replication significantly and reduced the levels of key signaling pathways, including MyD88, RIG-I, TLR2, TRIF, and inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-8, TNF-beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-alpha in vitro. However, the knockdown of the SLAMF1 gene could enhance replication of the PRRSV and the levels of key signaling pathways and inflammatory factors. Overall, our results identify a new, to our knowledge, antagonist of the PRRSV, as well as a novel antagonistic mechanism evolved by inhibiting innate immunity and inflammation, providing a new reference and direction for PRRSV disease resistance breeding.

AB  - The efficiency of biological control agents can be influenced by several factors, such as the quality of their herbivore hosts and the nutritional status of the host plants. This study focused on the parasitism capacity of Habrobracon hebetor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) reared on different nitrogen fertilized tomato plant cultivars. Four cultivars, namely Kingston, Early Urbana, Super strain-B, and Primo Early, with four nitrogen levels (0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.9 g/pot Nitrogen as Urea 46%), were used. The results showed that the net parasitism rate (C0) of H. hebetor varied from 9.50 to 11.04 and 10.3 to 12.34 host/parasitoid on H. armigera reared on four host plant cultivars with the lowest and highest N levels, respectively. The transformation rate (Qp) on treatments was close to 1. The total parasitism capacity of a stable population (psi) ranged from 0.224 to 0.358 host/parasitoid. Moreover, the highest recorded values of the finite parasitism rate (omega) included 0.281, 0.390, 0.329 and 0.431 day-1 on the hosts reared on Early Urbana, Super strain-B, Primo Early and Kingston at the highest N levels, respectively. Based on the estimated biological attributes in the current study, the optimum performance for H. hebetor belonged to the hosts fed on Kingston and Super strain-B cultivars. Moreover, the parasitism capacity of the parasitoid was positively influenced by nitrogen fertilized treatments as an effective bottom-up factor.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and seriously affects the quality of life of the elderly. Neurodegeneration is closely related to hippocampal dysfunction in AD patients. The hippocampus is key to creating new memories and is also one of the first areas of the brain to deteriorate with age. Mammalian neurogenesis occurs mainly in the hippocampus. Recent studies have confirmed that neurogenesis in the hip-pocampus is sustainable but decreases with age, which seriously affects the learning and memory function of AD patients. At present, our understanding of neurogenesis is still relatively shallow, especially pertaining to the influence and role of neurogenesis during aging and cognitive deficits in AD patients. Interestingly, many recent studies have described the characteristics of neurogenesis in animal models. This article reviews the progress of neurogenesis research in the context of aging and AD to provide new insights into neurogenesis.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE), the most severe form of epilepsy, leads to brain damage. Uncertainty persists about the mechanisms that lead to the pathophysiology of epilepsy and the death of neurons. Overloading of intracellular iron ions has recently been identified as the cause of a newly recognized form of controlled cell death called ferroptosis. Inhibiting ferroptosis has shown promise as a treatment for epilepsy, according to recent studies. So, the current study aimed to assess the possible antiepileptic impact of CoQ10 either alone or with the standard antiepileptic drug sodium valproate (SVP) and to evaluate the targeted effect of COQ10 on hippocampal oxidative stress and ferroptosis in a SE rat model. Using a lithium-pilocarpine rat model of epilepsy, we evaluated the effect of SVP, CoQ10, or both on seizure severity, histological, and immunohistochemical of the hippocampus. Furthermore, due to the essential role of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in inducing ferroptosis, we evaluated malonaldehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferritin in tissue homogenate. Our work illustrated that ferroptosis occurs in murine models of lithium-pilocarpine-induced seizures (epileptic group). Nissl staining revealed significant neurodegeneration. A significant increase in the number of astrocytes stained with an astrocyte-specific marker was observed in the hippocampus. Effective seizure relief can be achieved in the seizure model by administering CoQ10 alone compared to SVP. This was accomplished by lowering ferritin levels and increasing GPX4, reducing MDA, and increasing GSH in the hippocampus tissue homogenate. In addition, the benefits of SVP therapy for regulating iron stores, GPX4, and oxidative stress markers were amplified by incorporating CoQ10 as compared to SVP alone. It was concluded that CoQ10 alone has a more beneficial effect than SVP alone in restoring histological structures and has a targeted effect on hippocampal oxidative stress and ferroptosis. In addition, COQ10 could be useful as an adjuvant to SVP in protecting against oxidative damage and ferroptosis-related damage that result from epileptic seizures.

AB  - Gallbladder stones are a major pathogenic factor leading to cholecystitis, and it is increasingly important to explore innovative drug delivery methods for gallstones. In the present study, docosahexaenoic acid-coupled limonene bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (LIM-DHA-BSA-NPs) were constructed. The LIM-DHA-BSA-NPs are spherical structures, and the distribution was relatively uniform, and, more importantly, it has low cytotoxicity and good safety. The LIM-DHA-BSA-NPs solution shows higher uptake rates by RAW264.7 cells when compared with free limonene (LIM). The fluorescence intensity of FITC-modified BSA NPs was significantly higher than that of free FITC, which further indicated that the uptake of DHA-conjugated BSA NPs by RAW264.7 cells was stronger than that of the free drugs. Moreover, the in vivo distribution experiment showed that the enrichment of DiD-loaded BSA NPs in the gallbladder was significantly enhanced when compared with that of free DiD. The semi-quantitative fluorescence intensity results showed that the uptake of DiD-DHA-BSA-NPs was 4.5 times higher when compared with the free DiD. It is preliminarily shown that the DHA-conjugated BSA NPs that were constructed, have an ability to target the gallbladder. Furthermore, the Pearson colocalization coefficient R-coloc from in vivo colocalization results indicates that the DHA-BSA-NPs had a good colocalization effect on the gallbladder epithelial cells (GBECs). In addition, the LIM-DHA-BSA-NPs solution not only significantly reduced the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) secreted by inflammatory model cells and the number of peripheral blood leukocytes in guinea pigs with cholecystitis, but also significantly decreased the activities of the aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glutamyl endopeptidase (GGT), total bile acid (TBA), and total bilirubin (TBIL) enzymes. Collectively, the LIM-DHA-BSA-NPs could be used as an effective anti-inflammatory agent at the cellular and animal levels. This experiment, for the first time, showed that DHA-conjugated BSA NPs could be absorbed into GBECs by megalin receptor-mediated endocytosis and then they exert an anti-cholecystitis effect because of the LIM. The active uptake of DHA-conjugated BSA NPs by the megalin receptors of the GBECs is expected to become an effective therapeutic strategy for cholecystolithiasis.

AB  - Grid cells and place cells represent the spatiotemporal continuum of an animal's past, present, and future locations. However, their spatiotemporal relationship is unclear. Here, we co-record grid and place cells in freely foraging rats. We show that average time shifts in grid cells tend to be prospective and are proportional to their spatial scale, providing a nearly instantaneous readout of a spectrum of progressively increasing time horizons ranging hundreds of milliseconds. Average time shifts of place cells are generally larger compared to grid cells and also increase with place field sizes. Moreover, time horizons display nonlinear modulation by the animal's trajectories in relation to the local boundaries and locomotion cues. Finally, long and short time horizons occur at different parts of the theta cycle, which may facilitate their readout. Together, these findings suggest that population activity of grid and place cells may represent local trajectories essential for goal -directed navigation and planning.

AB  - Prenatal stress impairs cognitive function in rats, while Piromelatine treatment corrects memory decline in male rats with chronic mild stress. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with the melatonin analogue Piromelatine on the associative and spatial hippocampus-dependent memory of male and female offspring with a history of prenatal stress (PNS). We report that male and female young adult offspring with PNS treated with a vehicle had reduced memory responses in an object recognition test (ORT). However, the cognitive performance in the radial arm maze test (RAM) was worsened only in the male offspring. The 32-day treatment with Piromelatine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) of male and female offspring with PNS attenuated the impaired responses in the ORT task. Furthermore, the melatonin analogue corrected the disturbed spatial memory in the male offspring. While the ratio of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (pCREB/CREB) was reduced in the two sexes with PNS and treated with a vehicle, the melatonin analogue elevated the ratio of these signaling molecules in the hippocampus of the male rats only. Our results suggest that Piromelatine exerts a beneficial effect on PNS-induced spatial memory impairment in a sex-dependent manner that might be mediated via the pCREB/CREB pathway.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic neurological disorder that is divided into two subtypes, complex partial seizures (CPS) and simple partial seizures (SPS), based on clinical phenotypes. Revealing differences among the functional networks of different types of TLE can lead to a better understanding of the symbology of epilepsy. Whereas Although most studies had focused on differences between epileptic patients and healthy controls, the neural mechanisms behind the differences in clinical representations of CPS and SPS were unclear. In the context of the era of precision, medicine makes precise classification of CPS and SPS, which is crucial. To address the above issues, we aimed to investigate the functional network differences between CPS and SPS by constructing support vector machine (SVM) models. They mainly include magnetoencephalography (MEG) data acquisition and processing, construction of functional connectivity matrix of the brain network, and the use of SVM to identify differences in the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). The obtained results showed that classification was effective and accuracy could be up to 82.69% (training) and 81.37% (test). The differences in functional connectivity between CPS and SPS were smaller in temporal and insula. The differences between the two groups were concentrated in the parietal, occipital, frontal, and limbic systems. Loss of consciousness and behavioral disturbances in patients with CPS might be caused by abnormal functional connectivity in extratemporal regions produced by post-epileptic discharges. This study not only contributed to the understanding of the cognitive-behavioral comorbidity of epilepsy but also improved the accuracy of epilepsy classification.

AB  - Exercise enhances synaptic plasticity and alleviates depression symptoms, but the mechanism through which exercise improves high-fat diet-induced depression remains unclear. In this study, 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were administered a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal from fat) to a HFD model for 8 weeks. The RUN group also received 1 h of daily treadmill exercise in combination with the HFD. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by behavioral assessments for all groups. The key mediator of the effect of exercise on high-fat diet-induced depressive-like behaviors was detected by RNA-seq. The morphology and function of the neurons were evaluated via Nissl staining, Golgi staining, electron microscopy and electrophysiological experiments. The results showed that exercise attenuated high-fat diet-induced depressive-like behavior and reversed hippocampal gene expression changes. RNA-seq revealed Wnt5a, which was a key mediator of the effect of exercise on high-fat diet-induced depressive-like behaviors. Further work revealed that exercise significantly activated neuronal autophagy in the hippocampal CA1 region via the Wnt5a/CamkII signaling pathway, which enhanced synaptic plasticity to alleviate HFD-induced depressive-like behavior. However, the Wnt5a inhibitor Box5 suppressed the ameliorative effects of exercise. Therefore, this work highlights the critical role of Wnt5a, which is necessary for exercise to improve high-fat diet-induced depression.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a pervasive and devastating mental disease. Broad spectrum histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are considered to have potential for the treatment of depressive phenotype in mice. However, due to its non-specific inhibition, it has extensive side effects and can not be used in clinical treatment of MDD. Therefore, finding specific HDAC subtypes that play a major role in the etiology of MDD is the key to develop corresponding specific inhibitors as antidepressants in the future. Copy number variation in HDAC9 gene is thought to be associated with the etiology of some psychiatric disorders. Herein, we found that HDAC9 was highly expressed in the hippocampus of chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model of depression. Upregulation of HDAC9 expression in hippocampal neurons of mice induced depression-like phenotypes, including anhedonia, helplessness, decreased dendritic spine density, and neuronal hypoexcitability. Moreover, knockdown or knockout of HDAC9 in hippocampal neurons alleviated depression-like phenotypes caused by chronic restraint stress (CRS) in WT mice. Importantly, using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we further found that Annexin A2 (ANXA2) was coupled to and deacetylated by HDAC9. This coupling resulted in the inhibition of ubiquitinated ANXA2 degradation and then mediates depression-like behavior. Overall, we discovered a previously unrecognized role for HDAC9 in hippocampal neurons in the pathogenesis of depression, indicating that inhibition of HDAC9 might be a promising clinical strategy for the treatment of depressive disorders.

AB  - Cajal-Retzius cells (CRs) are peculiar neurons in the developing mammalian cerebral cortex. They robustly secrete Reln, a glycoprotein essential for the establishment of cortical layers through the control of radial migration. We previously identified Gmnc as a crucial fate determinant for P73+ CR subtypes. In Gmnc-/- mutants, P73+ CRs are initially produced and cover the telencephalic vesicle but undergo massive apoptosis resulting in their complete depletion at midcorticogenesis. Here, we investigated the consequences of such a CR depletion on dorsal cortex lamination and hippocampal morphogenesis. We found that preplate splitting normally occurs in Gmnc-/- mutants but is followed by defective radial migration arrest in the dorsal cortex, an altered cellular organization in the lateral cortex, aberrant hippocampal CA1 folding and lack of vasculature development in the hippocampal fissure. We then performed conditional Reln deletion in P73+ CRs to evaluate its relative contribution and found that only radial migration defects were recapitulated. We concluded that at mid-corticogenesis, CR-derived Reln is required for radial migration arrest and additionally identified Reln-independent functions for CRs in the control of hippocampal fissure formation and CA1 folding.

AB  - Neurons in the brain frequently experience glucose shortage and utilize oxidative fuels instead. Here, the authors demonstrate that glucose deprivation drives neuronal expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3, which stimulates oxidative ATP synthesis in hippocampal nerve terminals to sustain neurotransmission.
   Neurotransmission is an energetically expensive process that underlies cognition. During intense electrical activity or dietary restrictions, the glucose level in the brain plummets, forcing neurons to utilize alternative fuels. However, the molecular mechanisms of neuronal metabolic plasticity remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that glucose-deprived neurons activate the CREB and PGC1 alpha transcriptional program, which induces expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) both in vitro and in vivo. We show that Sirt3 localizes to axonal mitochondria and stimulates mitochondrial oxidative capacity in hippocampal nerve terminals. Sirt3 plays an essential role in sustaining synaptic transmission in the absence of glucose by providing metabolic support for the retrieval of synaptic vesicles after release. These results demonstrate that the transcriptional induction of Sirt3 facilitates the metabolic plasticity of synaptic transmission.

AB  - The strategy of emulsion coating was used for grape preservation. Camellia oil (CO) was incorporated with KGM/ curdlan (KC) to fabricate KC-CO emulsion systems. KC-CO emulsions were analyzed by droplet size distribution and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and KC-CO films were investigated by scanning electron mi-croscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), mechanical properties, dissolution, gas permeability, water contact angle (WCA). KC-CO coating was used for preservation of 'Kyoho' grapes. The results indicated that the addition of CO had a positive effect on KC system. CO could form a uniform emulsion with KC, and the droplets were evenly dispersed in the KC matrix. KC-CO films displayed a continuous microstructure, and elongation at break (EAB) was improved, while tensile strength decreased. The dissolution, water vapor permeability (WVP), and WCA were significantly enhanced, while the permeability of oxygen and carbon dioxide exhibited no advantage compared with KC film. KC-CO-10 possessed optimal properties and was selected as an emulsion coating for preservation. The results suggested that KC-CO-10 significantly maintained the appearance, total solid and acid content of 'Kyoho' grapes, and delayed the weight loss and firmness decrease. This study contributed to the understanding of polysaccharide-lipid emulsion system and the applications.

AB  - Simple SummaryAvian colibacillosis is one of the major causes of animal death and egg-production decline, which has caused economic losses to the poultry industry. When encountering avian colibacillosis, many poultry farms tend to use antibiotics to reduce losses. Additionally, the utilization of antimicrobials is also disputable. Our study shows that luteolin can alleviate the inflammation and oxidative stress caused by Escherichia coli in the ilea of chicks and may be used as a substitute for antibiotics to control avian colibacillosis.Avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) is typically the cause of avian colibacillosis, which can result in oxidative stress, inflammation, and intestinal damage (APEC). Luteolin, in the form of glycosylation flavone, has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, its effects on APEC-induced intestinal oxidative stress and NF-kappa B-mediated inflammation in chicks remains poorly understood. After hatching, one-day-old chicks were stochastically assigned to four groups: a control group (basic diet), an E. coli group (basic diet) and L10 and L20 groups (with a dry matter of luteolin diet 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively), with fifteen chicks in each group and one repeat per group. They were pretreated for thirteen days. The body weight, mortality, histopathological changes in the ileum, antioxidant status, and the mRNA and protein-expression levels of factors associated with the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-kappa B signal axis of the chicks were measured. The results showed that luteolin treatment decreased the mRNA and protein-expression level of the related factors of HMGB1/TLR4/NF-kappa B signal axis in the ileum, reduced inflammation, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and reduced intestinal injury. Collectively, luteolin alleviated APEC-induced intestinal damage by means of hindering the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-kappa B signal axis, which suggests that luteolin could be a good method for the prevention and treatment of avian colibacillosis.

AB  - Simple Summary Poor in vitro embryo development is a major obstacle in porcine assisted reproduction. In the current study, we utilized modified Spirulina maxima pectin nanoparticles as a supplement to improve porcine in vitro maturation medium. Results showed that modified Spirulina maxima pectin nanoparticles at 2.5 mu g/mL improved oocyte maturation in form of first polar body extrusion, reduced oxidative stress, and increased the developmental competence of the oocytes after parthenogenetic activation and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Moreover, the relative transcripts quantification showed significant increase in the pluripotency-associated transcripts in the resultant cloned embryos after modified Spirulina maxima pectin nanoparticles supplementation. Therefore, we provide an optimum in vitro maturation condition to improve the in vitro embryo production in porcine. Molecular approaches have been used to determine metabolic substrates involved in the early embryonic processes to provide adequate culture conditions. To investigate the effect of modified Spirulina maxima pectin nanoparticles (MSmPNPs) on oocyte developmental competence, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) retrieved from pig slaughterhouse ovaries were subjected to various concentrations of MSmPNPs (0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mu g/mL) during in vitro maturation (IVM). In comparison to the control, MSmPNPs-5.0, and MSmPNPs-10 groups, oocytes treated with 2.5 mu g/mL MSmPNPs had significantly increased glutathione (GSH) levels and lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Following parthenogenetic activation, the MSmPNPs-2.5 group had a considerably higher maturation and cleavage rates, blastocyst development, total cell number, and ratio of inner cell mass/trophectoderm (ICM:TE) cells, when compared with those in the control and all other treated groups. Furthermore, similar findings were reported for the developmental competence of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-derived embryos. Additionally, the relative quantification of POU5F1, DPPA2, and NDP52 mRNA transcript levels were significantly higher in the MSmPNPs-2.5 group than in the control and other treated groups. Taken together, the current findings suggest that MSmPNP treatment alleviates oxidative stress and enhances the developmental competence of porcine in vitro matured oocytes after parthenogenetic activation and SCNT.

AB  - Infertility is increasing worldwide; male factors can be identified in nearly half of all infertile couples. Histopathologic evaluation of testicular tissue can provide valuable information about infertility; however, several different evaluation methods and semi-quantitative score systems exist. Our goal was to describe a new, accurate and easy-to-use quantitative computer-based histomorphometric-mathematical image analysis methodology for the analysis of testicular tissue. On digitized, original hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained slides (scanned by slide-scanner), quantitatively describable characteristics such as area, perimeter and diameter of testis cross-sections and of individual tubules were measured with the help of continuous magnification. Immunohistochemically (IHC)-stained slides were digitized with a microscope-coupled camera, and IHC-staining intensity measurements on digitized images were also taken. Suggested methods are presented with mathematical equations, step-by-step detailed characterization and representative images are given. Our novel quantitative histomorphometric-mathematical image analysis method can improve the reproducibility, objectivity, quality and comparability of andrological-reproductive medicine research by recognizing even the mild impairments of the testicular structure expressed numerically, which might not be detected with the present semi-quantitative score systems. The technique is apt to be subjected to further automation with machine learning and artificial intelligence and can be named 'Computer-Assisted or -Aided Testis Histology' (CATHI).

AB  - This study investigated the effects of potassium magnesium sulfate (PMS) on intestinal dissociation and absorption rate, immune function, and expression of the NOD-like receptor thermal domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, aquaporins (AQPs), and potassium and magnesium ion channels in weaned piglets. Experiment 1 involved the assessment of the dissociation rate of PMS in pig digestive fluid and the absorption rate of PMS in the small intestine using an Ussing chamber in vitro. In Experiment 2, 216 healthy 21-day-old weaned piglets were selected and randomly assigned to six groups (0%, 0.15%, 0.30%, 0.45%, 0.60%, and 0.75% PMS), with each group 6 replicates of six piglets per replicate. The in vitro Ussing chamber results indicated that the absorption of K+ and Mg2+ in the jejunum and ileum was significantly higher than that in the duodenum (p < 0.05). The in vivo study demonstrated that the addition of PMS resulted in a linear increase in serum K+, IgG, and interleukin (IL)-2 levels while simultaneously reducing serum IL-1 beta levels (p < 0.05). Dietary PMS significantly elevated serum IL-10 and Mg2+ levels in feces (p < 0.05). Furthermore, supplementation with 0.60% or 0.75% PMS significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of NLRP3 in the jejunum (p < 0.05). Dietary PMS supplementation linearly reduced the mRNA expression levels of cysteine protease 1 (Caspase-1) and IL-1 beta in both the jejunum and colon as well as the mRNA expression levels of two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 5 (KCNK5) in these regions (p < 0.05). Notably, supplementation with 0.15% PMS significantly decreased the mRNA expression of transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPM6) in the jejunum and significantly increased the expression of TRPM6 in the colon (p < 0.05). Dietary addition of 0.45% and 0.60% PMS significantly increased the mRNA expression of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) in the colon (p < 0.05), whereas 0.75% PMS significantly increased the mRNA expression of aquaporin 8 (AQP8) in both the jejunum and colon. Moreover, the expression levels of AQP3 and AQP8 were significantly negatively correlated with the diarrhea rate observed between days 29 and 42. In conclusion, dietary PMS supplementation improved immune function, inhibited the activation of intestinal NLRP3, and modulated the expression of water and ion channels in weaned piglets, thereby contributing to the maintenance of intestinal water and ion homeostasis, which could potentially alleviate post-weaning diarrhea in piglets. The recommended supplemental level of PMS in the corn-soybean basal diet for weaned piglets is 0.30%.

AB  - Caipirasuchus is a genus of sphagesaurid notosuchian from the Bauru Basin (Upper Cretaceous), southeast Brazil. They were small-sized herbivorous/omnivorous animals, that measured around 1 metre in length, and had a wide diversity and geographical dispersion in the basin. Here, we diagnosed the 6th species of the genus, originating from sandstones of the Adamantina Formation in the municipality of Catanduva, S & atilde;o Paulo State. Caipirasuchus presents a significant variation in the morphology of structures in the choana region. In particular, the new species has chambers in the wings of the pterygoids that connect with an extension of the airways, suggesting a region of resonance used in vocalisation. The different palatal structures in Caipirasuchus may be related to distinct bioacoustic signatures and indicate apossible improvement in the social organisation of Caipirasuchus.

AB  - Vaccine boosters and infection can facilitate the development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with improved potency and breadth. Here, we observe superimmunity in a camelid extensively immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). We rapidly isolate a large repertoire of specific ultra-high-affinity nanobodies that bind strongly to all known sarbecovirus clades using integrative proteomics. These pan-sarbecovirus nanobodies (psNbs) are highly effective against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, with the best median neutralization potency at single-digit nanograms per milliliter. A highly potent, inhalable, and bispecific psNb (PiN-31) is also developed. Structural determinations of 13 psNbs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD reveal five epitope classes, providing insights into the mechanisms and evolution of their broad activities. The highly evolved psNbs target small, flat, and flexible epitopes that contain over 75% of conserved RBD surface residues. Their potencies are strongly and negatively correlated with the distance of the epitopes from the receptor binding sites.

AB  - In the particular case of the Camelidae family, immunoglobulin proteins have evolved into a unique and more simplified architecture with only heavy chains. The variable domains of these chains, named V(H)Hs, have a number of Complementary Determining Regions (CDRs) reduced by half, and can function as single domains making them good candidates for molecular tools. 3D structure prediction of these domains is a beneficial and advantageous step to advance their developability as molecular tools. Nonetheless, the conformations of CDRs loops in these domains remain difficult to predict due to their higher conformational diversity. In addition to CDRs loop diversity, our earlier study has established that Framework Regions (FRs) are also not entirely conformationally conserved which establishes a need for more rigorous analyses of these regions that could assist in template selection. In the current study, V(H)Hs models using different template selection strategies for comparative modeling using Modeller have been extensively assessed. This study analyses the conformational changes in both CDRs and FRs using an original strategy of conformational discretization based on a structural alphabet. Conformational sampling in selected cases is precisely reported. Some interesting outcomes of the structural analyses of models also draw attention towards the distinct difficulty in 3D structure prediction of VHH domains.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain disorder manifested by a gradual decline in cognitive function due to the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, disruptions in neuronal substance transport, and the degeneration of neurons. In affected neurons, incomplete clearance of toxic proteins by neighboring microglia leads to irreversible brain inflammation, for which cellular signaling is poorly understood. Through single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we discovered distinct regional differences in the ability of microglia to clear damaged neurites. Specifically, microglia in the septal region of wild type mice exhibited a transcriptomic signature resembling disease-associated microglia (DAM). These lateral septum (LS)-enriched microglia were associated with dense axonal bundles originating from the hippocampus. Further transcriptomic and proteomic approaches revealed that primary cilia, small hair-like structures found on cells, played a role in the regulation of microglial secretory function. Notably, primary cilia were transiently observed in microglia, and their presence was significantly reduced in microglia from AD mice. We observed significant changes in the secretion and proteomic profiles of the secretome after inhibiting the primary cilia gene intraflagellar transport particle 88 (Ift88) in microglia. Intriguingly, inhibiting primary cilia in the septal microglia of AD mice resulted in the expansion of extracellular amyloid plaques and damage to adjacent neurites. These results indicate that DAM-like microglia are present in the LS, a critical target region for hippocampal nerve bundles, and that the primary ciliary signaling system regulates microglial secretion, affecting extracellular proteostasis. Age-related primary ciliopathy probably contributes to the selective sensitivity of microglia, thereby exacerbating AD. Targeting the primary ciliary signaling system could therefore be a viable strategy for modulating neuroimmune responses in AD treatments.
   Microglial phagocytosis and exocytosis of A beta are mediated by primary cilia, which influence extracellular proteostasis, A beta plaque formation, and neurite dystrophy. When microglia in wild-type mice develop into the disease-associated state, they require genes involved in primary ciliogenesis and extracellular vesicle secretion. Inhibition of Ift88, a key cilia gene, in microglia stimulates phagocytosis and the secretion of extracellular vesicles with an altered proteomic composition, leading to the failure of extracellular proteostasis and neurite degeneration.

AB  - Germline alterations of the NF2 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 2, a syndrome manifested with benign tumors, and Nf2 deletion in mice also results in slow tumorigenesis. As a regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, NF2 induces LATS1/2 kinases and consequently represses YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ oncoproteins are also inhibited by motin family proteins (Motins). Here, we show that the Hippo signaling is fine-tuned by Motins in a NF2-dependent manner, in which NF2 recruits E3 ligase RNF146 to facilitate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Motins. In the absence of NF2, Motins robustly accumulate to restrict full activation of YAP/TAZ and prevent rapid tumorigenesis. Hence, NF2 deficiency not only activates YAP/TAZ by inhibiting LATS1/2 but also stabilizes Motins to keep YAP/TAZ activity in check. The upregulation of Motins upon NF2 deletion serves as a strategy for avoiding uncontrolled perturbation of the Hippo signaling and may contribute to the benign nature of most NF2-mutated tumors.

AB  - Background: Prolyl-4-hydroxylase-A2 (P4HA2) is a pivotal enzyme involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis and progression. However, the precise biological roles and potential functions of P4HA2 in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remain poorly elucidated. Methods: Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were employed to investigate the underlying biological effects of P4HA2 on PTC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, RIP assay, MeRIP assay, polysome fractionation, dual luciferase reporter assay, LC-MS/MS, and rescue experiments were conducted to explore the intricate relationships between YTHDF3, P4HA2 and Hippo signaling pathway. Results: P4HA2 exhibited significant up-regulation in PTC and was associated with unfavorable clinical characteristics and prognosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that P4HA2 promoted PTC cell proliferation and metastasis, while also contributing to tumorigenesis through the activation of glycolysis. Mechanistically, P4HA2 facilitated hydroxylation-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of SAV1, leading to enhanced expression of YAP1 in the Hippo signaling pathway. Additionally, YTHDF3 binding to P4HA2 mRNA in an N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-dependent manner decreased its stability, thereby inhibiting glycolysis in PTC. Conclusion: The YTHDF3-regulated P4HA2 acts as an oncogenic factor, regulating glycolysis in PTC through the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that P4HA2 holds potential as a promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for patients with PTC.

AB  - During development, different tissues acquire distinct lipotypes that are coupled to tissue function and homeostasis. In the brain, where complex membrane trafficking systems are required for neural function, specific glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol are highly abundant, and defective lipid metabolism is associated with abnormal neural development and neurodegenerative disease. Notably, the production of specific lipotypes requires appropriate programming of the underlying lipid metabolic machinery during development, but when and how this occurs is unclear. To address this, we used high-resolution MSALL lipidomics to generate an extensive time-resolved resource of mouse brain development covering early embryonic and postnatal stages. This revealed a distinct bifurcation in the establishment of the neural lipotype, whereby the canonical lipid biomarkers 22:6-glycerophospholipids and 18:0-sphingolipids begin to be produced in utero, whereas cholesterol attains its characteristic high levels after birth. Using the resource as a reference, we next examined to which extent this can be recapitulated by commonly used protocols for in vitro neuronal differentiation of stem cells. Here, we found that the programming of the lipid metabolic machinery is incomplete and that stem cell-derived cells can only partially acquire a neural lipotype when the cell culture media is supplemented with brain-specific lipid precursors. Altogether, our work provides an extensive lipidomic resource for early mouse brain development and highlights a potential caveat when using stem cell-derived neuronal progenitors for mechanistic studies of lipid biochemistry, membrane biology and biophysics, which nonetheless can be mitigated by further optimizing in vitro differentiation protocols.

AB  - The radula is a crucial adaptation for food-processing in molluscs. A deeper understanding of the interaction between the radula and the preferred food is lacking, complicating the inference of the precise ecological roles of radular structures. This study presents the first experimental set-up that allows to study the influence of the radular morphology, specifically the degree of tooth-tooth interlocking (so-called collective effect), on the feeding efficiency. For this purpose, physical 3D models of the teeth were designed using CAD software and 3D printing technique. The feeding efficiencies with models of different degree of interlocking were determined by tensile tests, pulling the models trough agar gels with different viscosities. The forces generated by the models and the masses of the removed gel fragments were determined. We found, that radular models with a high degree of tooth-tooth interlocking performed best as they were able to remove most agar. We additionally broke the teeth and determined, that the teeth with the highest degree of interlocking could resist to highest force. Overall, the study highlights the complex interplay between radular morphology and its ecological function, suggesting that even minor morphological alterations can significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of food gathering. Understanding these interactions cannot only shed light on the ecological adaptations of molluscs, but provide further insights into development of more effective grinding, scraping, and cleaning technical devices.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with long non-coding RNAs and DNA methylation; however, the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (lncRNA SNHG1) and subsequent involvement of DNA methylation in AD development are not known. The aim of this study was to examine the regulatory mechanisms attributed to lncRNA SNHG1 gene utilizing 2 strains of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model of AD and compared to senescence-accelerated mouse resistant (SAMR) considered a control. Both strains of the mouse were transfected with either blank virus, psLenti-U6-SNHG1(low gene expression) virus, and psLenti-pA-SNHG1(gene overexpression) virus via a single injection into the brains for 2 weeks. At 2 weeks mice were subjected to a Morris water maze to determine any behavioral effects followed by sacrifice to extract hippocampal tissue for Western blotting to measure protein expression of p-tau, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, and p-Akt. No marked alterations were noted in any parameters following blank virus transfection. In SAMP8 mice, a significant decrease was noted in protein expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and p-Akt associated with rise in p-tau and TET1. Transfection with ps-Lenti-U6-SNHG1 alone in SAMR1 mice resulted in a significant rise in DNMTs and p-Akt and a fall in p-tau and TET1. Transfection of SAMP8 with ps-Lenti-U6-SNHG1 blocked effects on overexpression noted in this mouse strain. However, knockdown of lncRNA SNHG1 yielded the opposite results as found in SAMR1 mice. In conclusion, the knockdown of lncRNA SNHG1 enhanced DNA methylation through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby reducing the phosphorylation levels of tau in SAMP8 AD model mice with ameliorating brain damage attributed to p-tau accumulation with consequent neuroprotection.

AB  - Evolution on islands, together with the often extreme phenotypic changes associated with it, has attracted much interest from evolutionary biologists. However. measuring the rate of change of phenotypic traits of extinct animals can be challenging, in part due to the incompleteness of the fossil record. Here, we use combined molecular and fossil evidence to define the minimum and maximum rate of dwarfing in an extinct Mediterranean dwarf elephant from Puntali Cave (Sicily).(1) Despite the challenges associated with recovering ancient DNA from warm climates,(2) we successfully retrieved a mitogenome from a sample with an estimated age between 175,500 and 50,000 years. Our results suggest that this specific Sicilian elephant lineage evolved from one of the largest terrestrial mammals that ever lived(3) to an island species weighing less than 20% of its original mass with an estimated mass reduction between 0.74 and 200.95 kg and height reduction between 0.15 and 41.49 mm per generation. We show that combining ancient DNA with paleontological and geochronological evidence can constrain the timing of phenotypic changes with greater accuracy than could be achieved using any source of evidence in isolation.

AB  - Rising ecological concerns are driving industries, including leather manufacturing, to adopt more sustainable practices. A major focus is transitioning from traditional chemical-based methods to bio-based alternatives. Enzyme-based unhairing has emerged as a potential replacement for the conventional lime-sulfide process. However, it faces challenges such as poor enzyme stability under harsh processing conditions, high cost, and possible grain damage resulting from uncontrolled enzymatic activity. Herein, we propose using egg-derived L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (EPC) liposomes as protective carriers to encapsulate protease, aiming to improve its stability and efficacy during the unhairing process. Protease-loaded EPC liposomes (EPC+Pro) were synthesized and characterized for their size, zeta potential, thermal behavior, and morphology. The average size of EPC+Pro liposomes was 386 +/- 10 nm with a zeta potential of -46 +/- 0.1 mV. When applied to goat skin, EPC+Pro liposomes enabled complete (100%) hair removal within 3 h, while the unhairing process using free protease required 5 h to achieve comparable results. Beyond ensuring quick and efficient hair removal, EPC+Pro demonstrated a dual function by acting as a natural fatliquor, markedly enhancing the softness of leather with low fatliquor consumption. The treated leather showed a softness of 5.13 +/- 0.2 mm, higher than the 4.26 +/- 0.3 mm observed with free protease treatment. Overall, EPC+Pro treated leather demonstrated superior physical properties. This study highlights the potential of protease-encapsulated liposomes as a dual-functional, efficient, and sustainable solution for enzymatic unhairing, offering improved process efficiency, enhanced leather quality, and reduced chemical usage for commercial leather processing.

AB  - Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is linked to neurotoxic effects. This study aims to close knowledge gaps regarding the specific modes of action of PCBs in female C57BL/6J mice (>6 weeks) orally exposed for 7 weeks to a human-relevant PCB mixture (MARBLES mix) at 0, 0.1, 1, and 6 mg/kg body weight/day. PCB and hydroxylated PCB (OH-PCBs) levels were quantified in the brain, liver, and serum; RNA sequencing was performed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and liver, and metabolomic analyses were performed in the striatum. Profiles of PCBs but not their hydroxylated metabolites were similar in all tissues. In the prefrontal cortex, PCB exposure activated the oxidative phosphorylation respiration pathways, while suppressing the axon guidance pathway. PCB exposure significantly changed the expression of genes associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases in the striatum, impacting pathways like growth hormone synthesis and dendrite development. PCBs did not affect the striatal metabolome. In contrast to the liver, which showed activation of metabolic processes following PCB exposure and the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the expression of xenobiotic processing genes was not altered by PCB exposure in either brain region. Network analysis revealed complex interactions between individual PCBs (e.g., PCB28 [2,4,4 '-trichlorobiphenyl]) and their hydroxylated metabolites and specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs), underscoring the need to characterize the association between specific PCBs and DEGs. These findings enhance the understanding of PCB neurotoxic mechanisms and their potential implications for human health.

AB  - The taxonomic classification of Babu tea (Family Theaceae) was preliminarily investigated by analyzing its epigenetic morphology and chromosomal features. Morphological observations of three Babu Tea phenotypes (red flower/purple bud, pink flower/purple bud, and white flower/green bud) revealed that the stomata were located exclusively on the lower epidermis, and the anticlinal walls of epidermal cells were deeply undulated. The stomatal apparatus also consisted of two crescent-shaped guard cells, forming a spindle shape with thickened "T-shaped" ends. Furthermore, the outer stomatal arches had smooth surfaces, while the inner ones were shallowly undulated. Finally, subsidiary cells were covered by a shallowly undulated epidermal stratum corneum that was composed of three layers. Their pollen grains exhibited a prolate spherical shape. Based on pollen morphology, the Babu Tea was therefore classified within Sect. Theopsis Coh. St., Camellia. Chromosome counting and karyotype analysis further confirmed that the three phenotypes share a chromosome count of 2n = 2x = 30, with their karyotypes classified as Type 2A. These findings suggest that the three phenotypes share a common evolutionary origin.

AB  - Excitatory neurotransmission is principally mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Negative allosteric modulators are therapeutic candidates that inhibit AMPAR activation and can compete with positive modulators to control AMPAR function through unresolved mechanisms. Here we show that allosteric inhibition pushes AMPARs into a distinct state that prevents both activation and positive allosteric modulation. We used cryo-electron microscopy to capture AMPARs bound to glutamate, while a negative allosteric modulator, GYKI-52466, and positive allosteric modulator, cyclothiazide, compete for control of the AMPARs. GYKI-52466 binds in the ion channel collar and inhibits AMPARs by decoupling the ligand-binding domains from the ion channel. The rearrangement of the ligand-binding domains ruptures the cyclothiazide site, preventing positive modulation. Our data provide a framework for understanding allostery of AMPARs and for rational design of therapeutics targeting AMPARs in neurological diseases.
   Using cryo-electron microscopy, the authors reveal the mechanism by which perampanel-like molecules inhibit AMPA receptors. They show that the inhibitors decouple the ligand-binding domain from the ion channel after neurotransmitter binding and outcompete positive modulators.

AB  - Vanadium is a prevalent neurotoxic transition metal with therapeutic potentials in some neurological conditions. Hydrocephalus poses a major clinical burden in neurological practice in Africa. Its primary treatment (shunting) has complications, including infection and blockage; alternative drug-based therapies are therefore necessary. This study investigates the function and cytoarchitecture of motor and cerebellar cortices in juvenile hydrocephalic mice following treatment with varying doses of vanadium. Fifty juvenile mice were allocated into five groups (n = 10 each): controls, hydrocephalus-only, low- (0.15 mg/kg), moderate- (0.3 mg/kg), and high- (3.0 mg/kg) dose vanadium groups. Hydrocephalus was induced by the intracisternal injection of kaolin and sodium metavanadate administered by intraperitoneal injection 72hourly for 28 days. Neurobehavioral tests: open field, hanging wire, and pole tests, were carried out to assess locomotion, muscular strength, and motor coordination, respectively. The cerebral motor and the cerebellar cortices were processed for cresyl violet staining and immunohistochemistry for neurons (NeuN) and astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein). Hydrocephalic mice exhibited body weight loss and behavioral deficits. Horizontal and vertical movements and latency to fall from hanging wire were significantly reduced, while latency to turn and descend the pole were prolonged in hydrocephalic mice, suggesting impaired motor ability; this was improved in vanadium-treated mice. Increased neuronal count, pyknotic cells, neurodegeneration and reactive astrogliosis were observed in the hydrocephalic mice. These were mostly mitigated in the vanadium-treated mice, except in the high-dose group where astrogliosis persisted. These results demonstrate a neuroprotective potential of vanadium administration in hydrocephalus. The molecular basis of these effects needs further exploration.
   The neuroprotective potentials of varying doses of vanadium were studied in an experimental model of hydrocephalus. All doses improved motor function, restored neuronal and glial count, and architecture; however, the high dose resulted in persistent astrocytic reactivity.image

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Qingyangshen (Cynanchum otophyllum C.K.Schneid.PI.Wilson.) is the folk medicine of Yunnan which is renowned for its use in the management of neuropsychiatric diseases. The isolated glycosides from Qingyangshen have demonstrated relief in the social defeat stress, however, mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated.Aim of the study: This study is aimed to elucidate the effect of Qingyangshen glycosides (QYS) on chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depression-like symptoms and the related mechanism.Materials and methods: In mice, CSDS model was developed, and the effect of QYS was evaluated by observing the behavioral performance of these mice exposed to tasks related to depression-like activities. Moreover, microscopic pathological examinutesation was also done. Furthermore, the protein expressions related to social defeat stress were also determined to elucidate the possible underlying mechanism.Results: Our results indicated that QYS treatment reversed the CSDS-induced depressive-like behaviors as measured by the increased sucrose preference, open field activity, and social interactions among mice. The reversal of the morphological changes in the hippocampus of the CSDS mice was also noted. Additionally, QYS treatment also upregulated the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), fibronectin III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins.Conclusions: Our study indicated that QYS had a good anti-social defeat stress effect on CSDS-induced depression in mice, mainly through SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha/FNDC5/BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway activation.

AB  - The progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) in specific areas of the brain is a common prelude to late-onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although activation of liver X receptors (LXR) with agonists decreases A beta levels and ameliorates contextual memory deficit, concomitant hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia limits their clinical application. DMHCA (N,N-dimethyl-3 beta-hydroxycholenamide) is an LXR partial agonist that, despite inducing the expression of apolipoprotein E (main responsible of A beta drainage from the brain) without increasing cholesterol/triglyceride levels, shows nil activity in vivo because of a low solubility and inability to cross the blood brain barrier. Herein, we describe a polymer therapeutic for the delivery of DMHCA. The covalent incorporation of DMHCA into a PEG-dendritic scaffold via carboxylate esters produces an amphiphilic copolymer that efficiently self-assembles into nanometric micelles that exert a biological effect in primary cultures of the central nervous system (CNS) and experimental animals using the intranasal route. After CNS biodistribution and effective doses of DMHCA micelles were determined in nontransgenic mice, a transgenic AD-like mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis was treated with the micelles for 21 days. The benefits of the treatment included prevention of memory deterioration and a significant reduction of hippocampal A beta oligomers without affecting plasma lipid levels. These results represent a proof of principle for further clinical developments of DMHCA delivery systems.

AB  - The prevalence of depressive disorders in women has been reported in many countries. However, the cellular mechanisms mediating such sex differences in stress susceptibility remain largely unknown. Previously, we showed that lateral habenula (LHb) neurons are more activated in female mice than in male mice by restraint stress. Given the important role of LHb in depressive disorders, we aimed to investigate the synaptic differences between male and female LHb and to examine the possible impact of the estrous cycle on neurotransmission in LHb. We found that the passive and active properties of LHb neurons differed according to the estrous cycle. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents exhibited higher amplitudes during the diestrus stage and lower frequencies in females than in males, whereas inhibitory postsynaptic currents showed no significant differences. Acute stress-induced hyperpolarization of resting membrane potentials (RMP) was observed in both sexes, with notable changes in female silent and tonic neurons. Stress exposure eliminated estrous cycle-dependent RMP differences and introduced cycle-specific excitability changes, especially in the metestrus and diestrus stages, suggesting that the hormonal cycle may set the synaptic tone of the LHb, thus modulating stress responses in females. Our study provides invaluable groundwork for understanding the detailed interaction between the estrous cycle and stress exposure in female LHb.

AB  - The prevention, mitigation and treatment of depression has become a global issue that needs to be solved urgently. Sayram Ketteki, a traditional natural fermented yoghurt from the region with the world's fourth highest life expectancy, has been known as the "longevity secret", whose longevity and anti-depression factors are speculated to come from its rich microorganisms. Therefore, for the first time, we systematically studied in depth the microbes of Sayram Ketteki, screened a new edible probiotic strain, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum R6-3, and explored its anti-depression effect in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in mice. It is encouraging that L. plantarum R6-3 was significantly superior to the classic anti-depressant drug, fluoxetine, in the performance of promoting sucrose preference test (SPT) behavior by 18% (p < 0.001), lowering the serum CORT content by 5.6% (p < 0.05), accelerating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level by 5.9% (p < 0.01), increasing the serum IL-10 concentration by 2.3% (p < 0.05), up-regulating the expression of BDNF and phosphorylated-ERK by 74% (p < 0.01) and 45% (p < 0.001), respectively, and facilitating the secretion of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including n-butyric, n-valeric, and isovaleric acid by 47% (p < 0.01), 42% (p < 0.05) and 38% (p < 0.05), respectively. Through the microbiota-gut-brain axis, L. plantarum R6-3 promoted the secretion of intestinal SCFAs through regulation of the composition and function of the gut microbiota, and activated the production of the monoamine neurotransmitter, renewed the level of brain neurotrophic factor, and suppressed the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by adjusting the hippocampal BDNF/TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway, thereby improving the immune and oxidative stress status, protecting hippocampal tissue from damage, maintaining a healthy weight and preventing CUMS-induced depressive behavior in mice. It has great prospects for the development of natural functional foods, the prevention and treatment of depression and in innovative microecological preparations.

AB  - The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), a class A GPCR, is a known player in neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and is also implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent studies have revealed its oligomerization with metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGlu5R), a class C G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that exists in the homodimeric form. Simultaneous activation of both receptors synergistically enhances mGlu5R-mediated effects in the hippocampus. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions remain unclear. In this study, we used molecular modelling techniques, including molecular docking, extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and detailed analysis, to elucidate the interactions between mGlu5R and A2AR in the inactive and active states. Our findings provide molecular-level insights into the permissive role of A2AR in mGlu5R activation, demonstrating that the inactive A2AR interface within the oligomer blocks the mGlu5R transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), which is crucial for activation. Upon A2AR activation, the oligomer interface undergoes conformational rearrangement, exposing mGlu5R-TM6 and allowing for mGlu5R activation. Furthermore, we identified a pivotal role of the mGlu5R-TM4:A2AR-TM4 interface in facilitating mGlu5R activation. These results highlight the intricate architecture of the mGlu5R:A2AR oligomer, advancing our understanding of GPCR oligomerization and its regulatory mechanisms on receptor activity.

AB  - A hippocampal mossy fiber synapse implicated in learning and memory is a complex structure in which a presynaptic bouton attaches to the dendritic trunk by puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs) and wraps multiply branched spines. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) are localized at the heads of each of these spines and faces to the presynaptic active zones. We previously showed that the scaffolding protein afadin regulates the formation of the PAJs, PSDs, and active zones in the mossy fiber synapse. Afadin has two splice variants: l-afadin and s-afadin. l-Afadin, but not s-afadin, regulates the formation of the PAJs but the roles of s-afadin in synaptogenesis remain unknown. We found here that s-afadin more preferentially bound to MAGUIN (a product of the Cnksr2 gene) than l-afadin in vivo and in vitro. MAGUIN/CNKSR2 is one of the causative genes for nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability accompanied by epilepsy and aphasia. Genetic abla-tion of MAGUIN impaired PSD-95 localization and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic (AMPA) receptor surface accumulation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed that the postsynaptic response to glutamate, but not its release from the presynapse, was impaired in the MAGUIN-deficient cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, disruption of MAGUIN did not increase the seizure susceptibility to flurothyl, a GABAA receptor antagonist. These results indicate that s-afadin binds to MAGUIN and regulates the PSD-95-dependent cell surface localization of the AMPA receptor and glutamatergic synaptic responses in the hippocampal neurons and that MAGUIN is not involved in the induction of epileptic seizure by flurothyl in our mouse model.

AB  - Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (pNCD) are a common neurological complication, especially in elderly following anesthesia and surgery. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of pNCD remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms that compromise synaptic metaplasticity in pNCD development with a focus on the involvement of Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) in the pathogenesis of pNCD in aged mice. Aged mice subjected to anesthesia and laparotomy surgery exhibited anxiety-like behavior and contextual fear memory impairment. Moreover, the procedure significantly increased NogoA and NgR1 expressions, particularly in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. This increase led to the depolymerization of F-actin, attributed to the activation of the RhoA-GTPase, resulting in a reduction of dendritic spines and changes in their morphology. Additionally, these changes hindered the efficient postsynaptic delivery of the subunit GluA1 and GluA2 of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), consequently diminishing excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Importantly, administering the competitive NgR1 antagonist peptide NEP1-40 (Nogo-A extracellular peptide residues 1-40 amino acids of Nogo-66) and Fasudil (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) effectively mitigated synaptic impairments and reversed neurocognitive deficits in aged mice following anesthesia and surgery. Our work indicates that high hippocampal Nogo66-NgR1 signaling disrupts postsynaptic AMPA receptor surface delivery due to F-actin depolymerization in the pathophysiology of pNCD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to progressive memory decline, and alterations in hippocampal function are among the earliest pathological features observed in human and animal studies. GABAergic interneurons (INs) within the hippocampus coordinate network activity, among which type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calretinin play a crucial role. These cells provide primarily disinhibition to principal excitatory cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA1 region, regulating incoming inputs and memory formation. However, it remains unclear whether AD pathology induces changes in the activity of I-S3 cells, impacting the hippocampal network motifs. Here, using young adult 3xTg-AD mice, we found that while the density and morphology of I-S3 cells remain unaffected, there were significant changes in their firing output. Specifically, I-S3 cells displayed elongated action potentials and decreased firing rates, which was associated with a reduced inhibition of CA1 INs and their higher recruitment during spatial decision-making and object exploration tasks. Furthermore, the activation of CA1 PCs was also impacted, signifying early disruptions in CA1 network functionality. These findings suggest that altered firing patterns of I-S3 cells might initiate early-stage dysfunction in hippocampal CA1 circuits, potentially influencing the progression of AD pathology.

AB  - Pre-implantation embryo biopsy is a well-established technique in large livestock like cattle. However, its application in porcine embryos remains relatively limited. In this study, we successfully obtained trophectoderm cells from porcine IVP blastocysts using laser-assisted microdissection. First, we obtained trophectoderm cells of varying cell numbers (Group 1: less than three cells; Group 2: more than five cells) using laser-assisted microdissection and then evaluated the impact of this dissection procedure on embryo morphology. The morphological observation confirmed the complete normal post-biopsy recovery of blastocysts in the two groups. Furthermore, the expression of proteins associated with cell junction and structural integrity remained unaffected. Comparative analysis of blastocyst cell numbers and apoptotic rates among Group 1, Group 2 and the control group further validated the minimalinvasiveness of the laser-assisted microdissection when cutting less than three cells. The quality and utility of the biopsied trophectoderm cells were confirmed through successful sex identification and transcriptome sequencing. In conclusion, this study successfully established a minimal invasive laser-assisted microdissection technique for porcine blastocysts, enabling pre-implantation sex identification and blastocyst quality assessment.

AB  - Nicotine exposure in pregnant rats and sheep has shown a more than 50% increase in female fetal testosterone (FFT) levels. Increased testosterone levels have also been linked to infertility, increased anogenital distance (AGD), and reduced second to fourth digit (2D:4D) finger length ratios (FLR). In humans, we hypothesized that maternal total testosterone (MTT) levels would increase in smoking mothers and would cause increased FFT levels, increased AGD, and decreased 2D:4D FLR. This prospective study separated women expecting a female fetus into nonsmoking and smoking cohorts. Maternal cotinine (MC) was tested at 3rd trimester and delivery to assess nicotine exposure. MTT levels were drawn at delivery, and FFT levels were collected from cord blood. The AGD and 2D:4D FLRs were measured at birth. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric tests. The data of 36 smokers and 28 nonsmokers were analyzed. Smoking mothers had higher parity, drug abuse history and were more likely white race. No statistical differences were seen among the primary outcomes of MTT and FFT. MTT was higher among nonsmokers versus smokers (144 versus 107 ng/dL). No correlations were noted between MC levels at delivery, MTT, and FFT levels. No statistical differences were noted among secondary outcomes of AGD and FLR. Although animal studies showed increased FFT levels after nicotine exposure, this was not seen in our human study. Placental differences in animals and humans may be at work. Our pilot study reveals a need for research on the effects of smoking in pregnancy on fetal hormones.

AB  - Due to its advantageous antioxidant phytochemical components, Psidium guajava L. has become an indispensable plant in pharmaceutical formulations, playing a crucial role in safeguarding human health. On ruminant animals, however, there has been limited investigation. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the phytochemical profiles and biological potential of Farang (P. guajava L.) leaf extracts for ruminant health. Methanolic and hexanoic extracts from various agricultural areas were prepared over a five-month period. By means of HPLC-DAD, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), essential oil (eugenol), tannin (gallic acid), cinnamic acids (caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, and ferulic acid), and flavonoids (catechin, rutin, myricetin, quercetin, apigenin, and kaempferol) were detected and quantified. Solvent type, but not cultivation site or sampling time, explained the observed variation in phytochemical profile. Phytochemicals were found in lower concentrations in hexanoic extracts than in methanolic extracts. Catechin and sinapic acid were discovered to be the two most abundant phytochemicals in the methanolic extract of Farang leaf, followed by other phenolic compounds, essential oils, and water-soluble vitamins. Compared with the methanolic extract, the hexanoic extract of Farang leaves was less effective at scavenging oxidation in terms of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide, and superoxide, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Hexanoic extract was found to be less protective against oxidative damage in ruminant erythrocytes than methanolic extract in terms of inhibiting hemoglobin oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and hemolysis. According to the findings of this study, the leaves of Farang (P. guajava L.) are a potential source of phytochemical compounds with wellness properties for ruminant production.

AB  - The aim of this study was to use local LAB cultures for the production of organic acid-rennet cheeses from unpasteurized cow's milk. Under industrial conditions, three types of cheese were produced, i.e., traditionally with acid whey (AW), with starter culture L. brevis B1, or with starter culture L. plantarum Os2. Strains were previously isolated from traditional Polish cheeses. Chemical composition, physico-chemical, microbiological, and sensory studies during 2 months of storage were carried out. As a result of this research, it was found that the basic composition was typical for semi-hard, partially skimmed cheeses. Mainly saturated fatty acids were detected. The cheeses were rich in omega-3, -6, and -9 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and were characterized by good lipid quality indices (LQI). All of the cheeses were characterized by a high number of lactic acid bacteria, with Enterobacteriaceae, yeast, molds, and staphylococci contaminants, which is typical microbiota for unpasteurized milk products. Water activity, pH, and total acidity were typical. A lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of cheeses with the addition of strains and stability of the products during storage were observed. The B1 and Os2 cheeses were lighter, less yellow, had a more intense milk and creamy aroma, were softer, moister, and more elastic than AW cheese. The research results indicate the possibility of using environmental LAB strains in the production of high-quality acid-rennet cheeses, but special attention should be paid to the production process due to the microbiological quality of the cheeses.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common in sexually active women, but cervical cancer only develops in a small fraction of HPV-infected women, suggesting that unknown intrinsic factors associated with the unique genetic/genomic background of the high-risk population play a critical role in cervical carcinogenesis. Although our previous studies have identified the hyperactivated YAP1 oncogene as a critical contributor to cervical cancer, the molecular mechanism by which YAP1 drives cervical cancer is unknown. In the present study, we found that although the hyperactivated YAP1 caused a malignant transformation of immortalized cervical epithelial cells, it induced cellular senescence in cultures of primary human cervical epithelial cells (HCvECs). However, the hyperactivated YAP1 induced malignant transformation of HCvECs in the presence of high-risk HPV E6/E7 proteins, suggesting that the hyperactivated YAP1 synergizes with HPV to initiate cervical cancer development. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate that YAP1, via up-regulating LATS2, formed a YAP1-LATS2 negative feedback loop in cervical epithelial cells to maintain homeostasis of cervical tissue. Intriguingly, we found that high-risk HPV targets LATS2 to disrupt the feedback loop leading to the malignant transformation of cervical epithelial cells. Finally, we report that mitomycin C, an FDA-approved drug that could upregulate LATS2 and drive cellular senescence in vitro and in vivo, induced a regression of cervical cancer in a pre-clinial animal model. Thus, high-risk HPV targeting the YAP1-LATS2 feedback loop represents a new mechanism of cervical cancer development.

AB  - Our objective was to investigate how sepsis influences cellular dynamics and amyloid formation before and after plaque formation. As such, APP-mice were subjected to a polymicrobial abdominal infection resulting in sepsis at 2 (EarlySepsis) and 4 (LateSepsis) months of age. Behavior was tested before sepsis and at 5 months of age. We could not detect any short-term memory or exploration behavior alterations in APP-mice that were subjected to Early or LateSepsis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a lower area of NeuN(+) and Iba1(+) signal in the cortex of Late compared with EarlySepsis animals (p = 0.016 and p = 0.01), with an increased astrogliosis in LateSepsis animals compared with WT-Sepsis (p = 0.0028), EarlySepsis (p = 0.0032) and the APP-Sham animals (p = 0.048). LateSepsis animals had larger areas of amyloid compared with both EarlySepsis (p = 0.0018) and APP-Sham animals (p = 0.0024). Regardless of the analyzed markers, we were not able to detect any cellular difference at the hippocampal level between groups. We were able to detect an increased inflammatory response around hippocampal plaques in LateSepsis compared with APP-Sham animals (p = 0.0003) and a decrease of AQP4 signal far from Sma(+) vessels. We were able to show experimentally that an acute sepsis event before the onset of plaque formation has a minimal effect; however, it could have a major impact after its onset.

AB  - Environmental cadmium exposure during pregnancy or adolescence can cause neurodevelopmental toxicity, lead to neurological impairment, and reduce cognitive abilities, such as learning and memory. However, the mechanisms by which cadmium causes neurodevelopmental toxicity and cognitive impairment are still not fully elucidated. This study used hippocampal neurons cultured in vitro to observe the impact of cadmium exposure on mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. Exposure to 5 mu M cadmium causes degradation of hippocampal neuron cell bodies and axons, morphological destruction, low cell viability, and apoptosis increase. Cadmium exposure upregulates the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins Drp1 and Fis1, reduces the expression of mitochondrial fusion-related proteins MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, as well as reduces the expression of PGC-1a. Mitochondrial morphology detection demonstrated that cadmium exposure changes the morphological structure of mitochondria in hippocampal neurons, increasing the number of punctate and granular mitochondria, reducing the number of tubular and reticular mitochondria, decreasing mitochondrial mass, dissipating mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), and reducing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Cadmium exposure increases the global methylation level of the genome and upregulates the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3 alpha in hippocampal neurons. 5-Aza-CdR reduces cadmium-induced genome methylation levels in hippocampal neurons, increases the number of tubular and reticular mitochondria, and promotes cell viability. In conclusion, cadmium regulates the expression of mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins by increasing hippocampal neuron genome methylation, changing mitochondrial morphology and function, and exerting neurotoxic effects.

AB  - Prodigiosin (2-methyl-3-pentyl-6-methoxyprodiginine), a red-colored microbial pigment, is produced in large quantities by Serratia marcescens KMR-3. This bacterium can grow in a medium with a Cd2+ concentration of 500 mg/L, but it does not produce prodigiosin when the Cd2+ concentration in the medium is higher than 140 mg/L. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms by which Cd2+ inhibits prodigiosin synthesis. Upon addition of Cd2+ to the medium, the expression of the prodigiosin (pig) gene cluster was significantly downregulated. Simultaneously, genes encoding proteins related to the synthesis of arginine and proline(prodigiosin precursors) were significantly downregulated, while the degradation-related genes were upregulated. Furthermore, PigF, which encodes a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of 4-methoxy-2,2 '-bipyrrole-5-carboxaldehyde and PigC, which encodes a key enzyme involved in the last step of prodigiosin synthesis, were downregulated by 80% and 55%, respectively, following Cd2+ treatment. As PigC and PigF are located on the cell membrane and are involved in the final steps of prodigiosin synthesis, the cell membrane might be presumed to be the site of prodigiosin synthesis. The bacterial membrane exhibited different degrees of elongation, folding, fragmentation, and sagging after the addition of Cd2+, while likely destroying the site of prodigiosin synthesis.

AB  - Age-related diseases, including dementia, are a major health concern affecting daily human life. Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) is the most eaten fruit worldwide due to its exceptional aroma and flavor. However, it's rapid softening and decay limit its shelf-life. Freezing and boiling represent the well-known conservation methods to extend its shelf-life. Therefore, we aimed to discover the phytochemical content differences of fresh and processed strawberries associated with investigating and comparing their neuroprotective effects in a rat model of aging. Female Wistar rats were orally pretreated with fresh, boiled, and frozen F. ananassa methanolic extracts (250 mg kg(-1)) for 2 weeks, and then these extracts were concomitantly exposed to d-galactose [65 mg kg(-1), subcutaneously (S/C)] and AlCl3 (200 mg kg(-1), orally) for 6 weeks to develop aging-like symptoms. The results of UPLC/ESI-MS phytochemical profiling revealed 36 secondary metabolites, including phenolics, flavonoids, and their glycoside derivatives. Compared with boiled and frozen extracts, the fresh extract ameliorated the behavioral deficits including anxiety and cognitive dysfunction, upregulated brain HO-1 and Nrf2 levels, and markedly reduced caspase-3 and PPAR-gamma levels. Moreover, LDH and miRNA-9, 124 and 132 protein expressions were reduced. The histological architecture of the brain hippocampus was restored and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoexpression was downregulated. In conclusion, the fresh extract has neuroprotective activity that could have a promising role in ameliorating age-related neurodegeneration.

AB  - Developing prolonged antigen delivery systems that mimic long-term exposure to pathogens appears as a promising but still poorly explored approach to reach durable immunities. In this study, we have used a simple technology by which His-tagged proteins can be assembled, assisted by divalent cations, as supramolecular complexes with progressive complexity, namely protein-only nanoparticles and microparticles. Microparticles produced out of nanoparticles are biomimetics of secretory granules from the mammalian hormonal system. Upon subcutaneous administration, they slowly disintegrate, acting as an endocrine-like secretory system and rendering the building block nanoparticles progressively bioavailable. The performance of such materials, previously validated for drug delivery in oncology, has been tested here regarding the potential for time-prolonged antigen release. This has been completed by taking, as a building block, a nanostructured version of p30, a main structural immunogen from the African swine fever virus (ASFV). By challenging the system in both mice and pigs, we have observed unusually potent pro-inflammatory activity in porcine macrophages, and long-lasting humoral and cellular responses in vivo, which might overcome the need for an adjuvant. The robustness of both innate and adaptive responses tag, for the first time, these dynamic depot materials as a novel and valuable instrument with transversal applicability in immune stimulation and vaccinology.

AB  - Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remains one of the most drug-resistant focal epilepsies. Glutamate excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation which leads to loss of synaptic proteins and neuronal death appear to represent a pathogen that characterizes the neurobiology of TLE. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a rapidly growing therapy for the attenuation of neuronal degeneration harboring non-invasiveness benefits. However, the detailed effects of PBM on excitotoxicity or neuroinflammation remain unclear. We investigated whether tPBM exerts neuroprotective effects on hippocampal neurons in epilepsy mouse model by regulating synapse and synapse-related genes.Methods: In an in vitro study, we performed imaging analysis and western blot in primary hippocampal neurons from embryonic (E17) rat pups. In an in vivo study, RNA sequencing was performed to identify the gene regulatory by PBM. Histological stain and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to assess synaptic connections, neuroinflammation and neuronal survival. Behavioral tests were used to evaluate the effects of PBM on cognitive functions.Results: PBM was upregulated synaptic connections in an in vitro. In addition, it was confirmed that transcranial PBM reduced synaptic degeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and neuroinflammation in an in vivo. These effects of PBM were supported by RNA sequencing results showing the relation of PBM with gene regulatory networks of neuronal functions. Specifically, Nlgn3 showed increase after PBM and silencing the Nlgn3 reversed the positive effect of PBM in in vitro. Lastly, behavioral alterations including hypoactivity, anxiety and impaired memory were recovered along with the reduction of seizure score in PBM-treated mice.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that PBM attenuates epileptic excitotoxicity, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline induced by TLE through inhibition of the Nlgn3 gene decrease induced by excitotoxicity.

AB  - Simple Summary Automated and non-intrusive recognition of individual livestock such as a cow or a pig is a vital requirement for obtaining individual information, something which has played a significant role in the intelligent management and welfare of livestock. However, individual cow identification remains a demanding task mainly due to the quite yet subtle inter-class differences in an open herd setting. The objective of this study is to develop a novel unified global and part feature deep network model (GPN) to learn more discriminative and robust features that can facilitate cow face representation for re-identification and verification. The results of various contrast experiments on collecting the large-scale cow face dataset show that the proposed GPN model outperforms the existing representative re-identification methods, and the further improved GPN-ST model has a higher accuracy rate (up by 2.8% and 2.2% respectively) in Rank-1 and mAP, compared with the GPN model. In conclusion, using the proposed framework can effectively ameliorate the performance of cow face re-identification. In precision dairy farming, computer vision-based approaches have been widely employed to monitor the cattle conditions (e.g., the physical, physiology, health and welfare). To this end, the accurate and effective identification of individual cow is a prerequisite. In this paper, a deep learning re-identification network model, Global and Part Network (GPN), is proposed to identify individual cow face. The GPN model, with ResNet50 as backbone network to generate a pooling of feature maps, builds three branch modules (Middle branch, Global branch and Part branch) to learn more discriminative and robust feature representation from the maps. Specifically, the Middle branch and the Global branch separately extract the global features of middle dimension and high dimension from the maps, and the Part branch extracts the local features in the unified block, all of which are integrated to act as the feature representation for cow face re-identification. By performing such strategies, the GPN model not only extracts the discriminative global and local features, but also learns the subtle differences among different cow faces. To further improve the performance of the proposed framework, a Global and Part Network with Spatial Transform (GPN-ST) model is also developed to incorporate an attention mechanism module in the Part branch. Additionally, to test the efficiency of the proposed approach, a large-scale cow face dataset is constructed, which contains 130,000 images with 3000 cows under different conditions (e.g., occlusion, change of viewpoints and illumination, blur, and background clutters). The results of various contrast experiments show that the GPN outperforms the representative re-identification methods, and the improved GPN-ST model has a higher accuracy rate (up by 2.8% and 2.2% respectively) in Rank-1 and mAP, compared with the GPN model. In conclusion, using the Global and Part feature deep network with attention mechanism can effectively ameliorate the efficiency of cow face re-identification.

AB  - In architecture, AM technologies have been used for rapid prototyping since the early 1990s. However, using AM for automated building construction represent a revolution for the industry that requires modeling the complex relationships between materials, printing system, and designs. An important aspect of research in this area is the deformation of concrete during printing and how it affects shape accuracy and structural stability of the printed geometries. A previous experimental study proposed a series of equations to predict material deformation for a specific concrete mix. This study incorporates these equations in a shape grammar-based algorithm to decompose complex geometries into simpler ones, slice the simpler geometries, and generate compensated toolpaths. The algorithm was implemented in Grasshopper, a Rhino plugin, and it can be used as a 3D slicer specifically for 3D printing concrete purposes. The slicer is validated with two printing experiments, involving a simple and a complex shape. The algorithm can be extended to other material mixes by developing similar experimental studies and incorporating the resulting equations.

AB  - Leveraging comparative biology could lead to breakthrough discoveries in the development of fertility technologies while supporting conservation efforts. Here, we discuss examples and opportunities to learn from stem cell systems in nontraditional animal models, primarily from the amniote phylum, focusing on challenges and insights in the in vitro derivation of primordial germ cells and gametes, as well as the promise of gonadal stem cells. Embryo models and organoid systems provide a further opportunity to explore germ cell specification and maturation within a proxy 'in vivo' context. Additionally, stem cells enable high-throughput molecular studies to explore the mechanisms underlying fertility-related diseases. Using the international effort to derive gametes from stem cells of the Northern White Rhino as a case study, we highlight the contribution of alternative mammalian systems within the field of assisted reproductive treatments and point toward promising directions for future research. Contextualizing stem cell derivation and differentiation within a comparative species framework will be essential for harnessing the full potential of reproductive technologies for human fertility while simultaneously opening new frontiers in wildlife conservation.

AB  - Like protein phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation is a common post-translational protein modification. We already reported that O-GlcNAcylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in response to insulin signaling reduces neurotoxic amyloid-beta (A beta) production via inhibition of APP endocytosis. Internalized APP is delivered to endosomes and lysosomes where A beta is produced. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the effect of APP O-GlcNAcylation on APP trafficking remains unknown. To investigate the relationship between APP O-GlcNAcylation and APP endocytosis, we tested the effects of insulin on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing APP and BACE1, and cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The present study showed that APP O-GlcNAcylation translocated APP from lipid raft to non-raft microdomains in the plasma membrane by using immunocytochemistry and discontinuous sucrose gradients method. By using the biotinylation method, we also found that APP preferentially underwent endocytosis from lipid rafts and that the amount of internalized APP from lipid rafts was specifically reduced by O-GlcNAcylation. These results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation can regulate lipid raft-dependent APP endocytosis via translocation of APP into non-raft microdomains. Our findings showed a new functional role of O-GlcNAcylation for the regulation of APP trafficking, offering new mechanistic insight for A beta production.

AB  - BackgroundEriophyoid mites (Eriophyoidea) are among the largest groups in the Acariformes; they are strictly phytophagous. The higher-level phylogeny of eriophyoid mites, however, remains unresolved due to the limited number of available morphological characters-some of them are homoplastic. Nevertheless, the eriophyoid mites sequenced to date showed highly variable mitochondrial (mt) gene orders, which could potentially be useful for resolving the higher-level phylogenetic relationships.ResultsHere, we sequenced and compared the complete mt genomes of 153 eriophyoid mite species, which showed 54 patterns of rearranged mt gene orders relative to that of the hypothetical ancestor of arthropods. The shared derived mt gene clusters support the monophyly of eriophyoid mites (Eriophyoidea) as a whole and the monophylies of six clades within Eriophyoidea. These monophyletic groups and their relationships were largely supported in the phylogenetic trees inferred from mt genome sequences as well. Our molecular dating results showed that Eriophyoidea originated in the Triassic and diversified in the Cretaceous, coinciding with the diversification of angiosperms.ConclusionsThis study reveals multiple molecular synapomorphies (i.e. shared derived mt gene clusters) at different levels (i.e. family, subfamily or tribe level) from the complete mt genomes of 153 eriophyoid mite species. We demonstrated the use of derived mt gene clusters in unveiling the higher-level phylogeny of eriophyoid mites, and underlines the origin of these mites and their co-diversification with angiosperms.

AB  - Maternal folate status during pregnancy is associated with the neurodevelopment of offspring; however, study results on the association between paternal folate status and offspring neurodevelopment are inconsistent. This study aimed to explore whether parental folic acid deficiency affects the neurobehavioral development of offspring by affecting the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into neurons. In the present study, the offspring were divided into four groups: parental folic acid deficient group (D-D), maternal folic acid deficient and paternal folic acid normal group (D-N), maternal folic acid normal and paternal folic acid deficient group (N-D), and parental folic acid normal group (N-N). For in vivo study, neurobehavioral indexes, and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the brain hippocampus and cerebral cortex of offspring were measured at different time points. For in vitro study, NSCs were cultured from the hippocampus and striatum, and neuronal and astrocytic differentiation were measured. The results demonstrated that parental folic acid deficiency decreased the brain folate level in offspring, delayed early sensory-motor reflex development, impaired spatial learning and memory ability in adolescence and adulthood, decreased differentiation of NSCs into neurons and increased differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes in vivo and in vitro . These impacts on the neurodevelopment of offspring were most pronounced in D-D group, followed by D-N group and N-D group. In conclusion, parental folic acid deficiency inhibits the neurobehavioral development of offspring, possibly by inhibiting the differentiation of NSCs into neurons.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Endometriosis is a gynecological and painful condition affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by dysfunctional endometrium-like implants outside of the uterine cavity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Hidrox(R), an aqueous extract of olive pulp containing hydroxytyrosol, on endometriotic lesions associated with pro-oxidative alterations and pain-like behaviors. Endometriosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of uterine fragments, and Hidrox(R) was administered daily. At the end of the 14-day treatment, behavioral alterations were assessed and hippocampal tissues were collected. Laparotomy was performed, and the endometrial implants were harvested for histological and biochemical analysis. Hidrox(R) treatment reduced endometriotic implant area, diameter and volumes. Vehicle-treated rats showed lesional fibrosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation, angiogenesis and pro-oxidative alterations in the peritoneal cavity. Hidrox(R) treatment reduced the aniline blue-stained area, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) and CD34 positive expressions. Moreover, it reduced mast cell recruitment into the lesions, myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione levels in the endometrial explants. In the peritoneal fluid, Hidrox(R) treatment reduced interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL2, IL6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and vascular endothelial grow factor (VEGF) levels increased by the disease. Hidrox(R) administration also reduced peripheral and visceral sensibility as shown by the behavioral tests (open field test, hot plate test, elevated plus maze test and acetic-acid-induced abdominal contractions). Animals treated with Hidrox(R) also showed reduced blood-brain barrier permeability and mast cell infiltration in the hippocampus, as well as astrocyte and microglia activation and brain oxidative status restoring brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein expression and increasing Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nfr2) nuclear translocation. In conclusion, Hidrox(R) displayed potential ameliorative effects on endometriotic implants and related pain-induced behaviors due to its potent antioxidative properties.

AB  - Idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) is a group of rare diseases of unknown etiology, with a pathognomonic muscular deficiency. Antisynthetase syndrome is a subtype of IIM with an associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), characterized by pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis mediated by TGF-beta. Pirfenidone is a new molecule with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, used for the treatment of idiopathic ILD, but has never been assessed in IIM. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of pirfenidone on IIM-associated ILD. Thirty-two BALB/c male mice were divided into three groups: Sham, IIM-untreated (IIM), and IIM pirfenidone-treated (IIM + PIR). IIM was induced by intramuscular injections of guinea pig muscle myosin extract and intraperitoneal injections of Pertussis toxin. Pirfenidone was given orally at a dose of 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for two months. Muscle force, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples, as well as muscle and lung tissues, were analyzed. Progressive deterioration of muscle force and infiltration of the muscular tissue by inflammatory cells were observed with IIM. Auto-immune antibodies specific to the antisynthetase syndrome were also increased in IIM mice. Pirfenidone attenuated IIM-associated ILD with anti-inflammatory properties evidenced by decreased peribronchial inflammation and TGF-beta 1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Likewise, pirfenidone attenuated pulmonary fibrosis by fine-tuning TGF-beta 1-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal and fibrotic signaling pathways; profibrotic SMAD3, ZEB2 and STAT1 expression and activation were decreased, whereas anti-fibrotic SMAD2 activation was increased. This study unravels for the first time that pirfenidone has the potential to fine-tune TGF-beta 1 fibrotic signaling in IIM-associated ILD.

AB  - Simple Summary Neurotrophins are growth factors that help the brain grow and function well. One of them is called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF affects how much we weigh and how well we learn and remember things. There are mice with reduced levels of BDNF. Mice have been developed that do not express BDNF at all, but they die soon after they are born. So, mice that have only half of the normal BDNF level and mice that have very low BDNF levels in some brain cells, but normal BDNF levels in other brain cells, have been generated. Furthermore, it is possible to generate new mouse lines by breeding these two types of mice together. These new mice have very little BDNF in their brain. They are alive, but they weigh more and have smaller brains than normal mice. They also act differently, especially in how they move.Abstract Neurotrophins, which belong to the family of growth factors, not only play crucial roles during development but are also involved in many processes in the postnatal brain. One representative of neurotrophins is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF plays a role in the regulation of body weight and neuronal plasticity and is, therefore, also involved in processes associated with learning and memory formation. Many of the studies on BDNF have been carried out using BDNF-deficient mice. Unfortunately, homozygous deletion of BDNF is lethal in the early postnatal stage, so heterozygous BDNF-deficient mice are often studied. Another possibility is the use of conditional BDNF-deficient mice in which the expression of BDNF is strongly downregulated in some brain cells, for example, in the neurons of the central nervous system, but the expression of BDNF in other cells in the brain is unchanged. To further reduce BDNF expression, we crossed heterozygous BDNF-deficient mice with mice carrying a deletion of BDNF in neurofilament L-positive neurons. These offspring are viable, and the animals with a strong reduction in BDNF in the brain show a strongly increased body weight, which is accompanied by a reduction in brain weight. In addition, these animals show behavioral abnormalities, particularly with regard to locomotion.

AB  - Desmodus rotundus plasminogen activator alpha 1 (DSPA alpha 1) is a thrombolytic protein with advantages, such as a long half-life, high accuracy and specificity for thrombolysis, wide therapeutic window, and no neurotoxicity. To date, DSPA alpha 1 has only been expressed in the Chinese hamster ovary, insect cells, transgenic tobacco plants, and Pichia pastoris. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the expression of DSPA alpha 1 in transgenic rabbit mammary glands, extract the product, and analyze its pharmacology activity. An efficient mammary gland-specific expression vector pCL25/DSPA alpha 1 was transferred to prokaryotic zygotes in rabbits by microinjection to generate six DSPA alpha 1 transgenic rabbits. The recombinant DSPA alpha 1 (rDSPA alpha 1) expression in transgenic rabbit milk was 1.19 +/- 0.26 mg/mL. The rDSPA alpha 1 purification protocol included pretreatment, ammonium sulfate precipitation, benzamidine affinity chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and Cibacron blue affinity chromatography; approximately 98% purity was achieved using gel electrophoresis. According to sequencing results, the primary structure of rDSPA alpha 1 was consistent with the theoretical design sequence, and its molecular weight was consistent with that of the natural protein. N-terminal sequencing results indicated rDSPA alpha 1 to be a mature protein, as the goat signal peptide sequence of the expression vector was no longer detected. The fibrinolytic activity of rDSPA alpha 1 was estimated to be 773,333 IU/mg. Fibrin-agarose plate assay and in vitro rat blood clot degradation assay showed that rDSPA alpha 1 had strong thrombolytic activity. In conclusion, we report recombinant DSPA alpha 1 with high thrombolytic activity expressed in transgenic rabbit mammary glands.

AB  - Maternal overnutrition has been reported to affect brain plasticity of the offspring by altering gene expression, regulating both synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis. However, whether perinatal metabolic stress may influence the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the development of neurodegeneration remains to be clarified. We investigated the impact of maternal high fat diet (HFD) in an experimental model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 3xTg-AD mice born to overfed mothers showed an impairment of synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits earlier than controls. Maternal HFD also altered the expression of genes regulating amyloid-beta-protein (A beta) metabolism (i.e., Bace1, Ern1, Ide and Nicastrin) and enhanced A beta deposition in the hippocampus. Finally, we found an epigenetic derangement and an aberrant recruitment of transcription factors NF-kB and STAT3 and chromatin remodeler HDAC2 on the regulatory sequences of the same genes. Collectively, our data indicate that early life metabolic stress worsens the AD phenotype via epigenetic alteration of genes regulating A beta synthesis and clearance.

AB  - Dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has been reported to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Stearidonic acid (SDA), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid, has been targeted as a potential surrogate for fish-based fatty acids. However, its role in neuronal degeneration is unknown. This study was designed to evaluate effects of SDA on Amyloid-beta(A-beta)-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal cells. Results showed that SDA effectively converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in hippocampal cells. A beta-induced apoptosis in H19-7 cells was protected by SDA pretreatment as evidenced by its regulation on the expression of relevant pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, as well as the inhibition on caspase activation. SDA also protected H19-7 cells from A beta-induced oxidative stress by regulating the expression of relevant pro- and anti-oxidative genes, as well as the improvement in activity of catalase. As for A beta/LPS-induced neuronal inflammation, SDA pretreatment reduced the release of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. Further, we found that the anti-A beta effect of SDA involves its inhibition on the expression of amyloid precursor protein and the regulation on MAPK signaling. These results demonstrated that SDAs have neuroprotective effect in A beta-induced H19-7 hippocampal cells. This beneficial effect of SDA was attributed to its antiapoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.

AB  - OxyR, a LysR family transcriptional regulator, plays vital roles in bacterial oxidative stress response. In this study, we found that the deletion of oxyR not only inhibited the antioxidant capacity of S. marcescens FS14, but also decreased the production of prodigiosin. Further study revealed that OxyR activated the prodigiosin biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. Complementary results showed that not only the wild-type OxyR but also the reduced form OxyRC199S could activate the prodigiosin biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that reduced form of wild type OxyR could bind to the promoter of pig gene cluster, and identified the binding sites which is different from oxidized OxyR binding sites in E. coli. Our results demonstrated that OxyR in FS14 uses oxidized form to regulate the expression of the antioxidant related genes and utilizes reduced form to activate prodigiosin production. Further in silico analysis suggested that the activation of prodigiosin biosynthesis by reduced OxyR should be general in S. marcesencs. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that OxyR uses the reduced form to activate the gene's expression, therefore, our results provide a novel regulation mechanism of OxyR.

AB  - Studies have shown that downregulation of nuclear-enriched autosomal transcript 1 (Neat1) may adversely affect the recovery of nerve function and the increased loss of hippocampal neurons in mice. Whether Neat1 has protective or inhibitory effects on neuronal cell apoptosis after secondary brain injury remains unclear. Therefore, the effects of Neat1 on neuronal apoptosis were observed. C57BL/6 primary neurons were obtained from the cortices of newborn mice and cultured in vitro, and an oxygen and glucose deprivation cell model was established to simulate the secondary brain injury that occurs after traumatic brain injury in vitro. The level of Neat1 expression in neuronal cells was regulated by constructing a recombinant adenovirus to infect neurons, and the effects of Neat1 expression on neuronal apoptosis after oxygen and glucose deprivation were observed. The experiment was divided into four groups: the control group, without any treatment, received normal culture; the oxygen and glucose deprivation group were subjected to the oxygen and glucose deprivation model protocol; the Neat1 overexpression and Neat1 downregulation groups were treated with Neat1 expression intervention techniques and were subjected to the in oxygen and glucose deprivation protocol. The protein expression levels of neurons p53-induced death domain protein 1 (PIDD1, a pro-apoptotic protein), caspase-2 (an apoptotic priming protein), cytochrome C (a pro-apoptotic protein), and cleaved caspase-3 (an apoptotic executive protein) were measured in each group using the western blot assay. To observe changes in the intracellular distribution of cytochrome C, the expression levels of cytochrome C in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of neurons from each group were detected by western blot assay. Differences in the cell viability and apoptosis rate between groups were detected by cell-counting kit 8 assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay, respectively. The results showed that the apoptosis rate, PIDD1, caspase-2, and cleaved caspase-3 expression levels significantly decreased, and cell viability significantly improved in the Neat1 overexpression group compared with the oxygen and glucose deprivation group; however, Neat1 downregulation reversed these changes. Compared with the Neat1 downregulation group, the cytosolic cytochrome C level in the Neat1 overexpression group significantly decreased, and the mitochondrial cytochrome C level significantly increased. These data indicate that Neat1 upregulation can reduce the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm by inhibiting the PIDD1-caspase-2 pathway, reducing the activation of caspase-3, and preventing neuronal apoptosis after oxygen and glucose deprivation, which might reduce secondary brain injury after traumatic brain injury. All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China, on December 19, 2020 (approval No. 2020-895).

AB  - (1) Background: Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the frequently prescribed antiepileptic drugs and is generally considered well tolerated. However, VPA neurologic adverse effects in the absence of liver failure are fairly common, suggesting that in the mechanism for the development of VPA-induced encephalopathy, much more is involved than merely the exposure to hyperammonemia (HA) caused by liver insufficiency to perform detoxification. Taking into account the importance of the relationship between an impaired brain energy metabolism and elevated ammonia production, and based on the ability of VPA to interfere with neuronal oxidative pathways, the current study intended to investigate a potential regional ammoniagenic effect of VPA on rats' brains by determining activities of the enzymes responsible for ammonia production and neutralization. (2) Methods: Rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of VPA (50, 100, 250, 500 mg/kg). Plasma, the neocortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus were collected at 30 min after injection. The levels of ammonia, urea, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured in blood plasma. The activities of glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in mitochondria and the activities of AMP deaminase (AMPD), adenosine deaminase (ADA), and glutamine synthetase (GS) in cytosolic fractions isolated from rat brain regions were measured. Ammonia, ALT, and AST values were determined in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. (3) Results: Multi-dose VPA treatment did not significantly affect the plasma levels of ammonia and urea or the ALT and AST liver enzymes. Significant dose-independent increases in the accumulation of ammonia were found only in the cytosol from the cerebellum and there was a strong correlation between the ammonia level and the ADA activity in this brain structure. A significant decrease in the AMPD and AST activities was observed, while the ALT activity was unaffected. Only the highest VPA dose (500 mg/kg) was associated with significantly less activity of GS compared to the control in all studied brain structures. In the mitochondria of all studied brain structures, VPA caused a dose-independent increases in ammonia levels, a high concentration of which was strongly and positively correlated with the increased GDH and ALT activity, while glutaminase activity remained unchanged, and AST activity significantly decreased compared to the control in all studied brain structures. (4) Conclusions: This study highlights the rat brain region-specific ammoniagenic effects of VPA, which may manifest themselves in the absence of hyperammonemia. Further research should analyze how the responsiveness of the different brain regions may vary in VPA-treated animals that exhibit compromised energy metabolism, leading to increased ammoniagenesis.

AB  - Introduction: Tau is a microtubule associated phosphoprotein found principally in neurons. Prevailing dogma continues to define microtubule stabilization as the major function of tau in vivo, despite several lines of evidence suggesting this is not the case. Most importantly, tau null mice have deficits in axonal outgrowth and neuronal migration while still possessing an extensive microtubule network. Instead, mounting evidence suggests that tau may have a major function in the regulation of fast axonal transport (FAT) through activation of neuronal signaling pathways. Previous studies identified a phosphatase activating domain (PAD) at the tau N-terminal that is normally sequestered, but is constitutively exposed in tauopathies. When exposed, the PAD activates a signaling cascade involving PP1 and GSK3 beta which affects cellular functions including release of cargo from kinesin. Furthermore, we discovered that PAD exposure can be regulated by a single phosphorylation at T205. Exposure of the PAD is an early event in multiple tauopathies and a major contributing factor to neurodegeneration associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. However, effects of tau PAD exposure on anterograde FAT raised the interesting possibility that this pathway may be a mechanism for physiological regulation of cargo delivery through site-specific phosphorylation of tau and transient activation of PP1 and GSK3 beta. Significantly, there is already evidence of local control of PP1 and GSK3 beta at sites which require cargo delivery.Methods: To investigate this hypothesis, first we evaluated cellular localization of tau PAD exposure, pT205 tau phosphorylation, and active GSK3 beta in primary hippocampal neurons during development. Second, we analyzed the axonal outgrowth of tau knockout neurons following transfection with full length hTau40-WT, hTau40-& UDelta;PAD, or hTau40-T205A.Results and Discussion: The results presented here suggest that transient activation of a PP1-GSK3 beta signaling pathway through locally regulated PAD exposure is a mechanism for cargo delivery, and thereby important for neurite outgrowth of developing neurons.

AB  - Plant extracts' ability to collect metals and decrease metal ions makes them a superior candidate for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles; hence, they are referred to as bio-nano factories since both living and dead dried biomass are employed to produce metallic nanoparticles. The antiparasitic activity of biosynthesized copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) was examined against cow tick larvae (Rhipicephalus microplus, Haemaphysalis bispinosa, and Hippobosca maculata). These parasitic larvae were treated with various concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of A. marmelos (MLE-AM) and biosynthesized CuO NPs for 24 h. CuO NPs were synthesized quickly using A. marmelos leaf extract, and nanoparticle synthesis was identified within 15 min. The results from characteristic XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX, and TEM analyses confirmed the biosynthesis of CuO NPs. The presence of 26-Hydroxycholesterol was discovered as the predominant chemical present in the GC-MS analysis of MLE-AM. The maximum efficacy was observed in biosynthesized CuO NPs against R. microplus larvae, H. bispinosa adults, and Hip. maculata larvae (LC 50 = 4.30, 9.50, and 11.13 mg/L; and LC 90 = 8.30, 19.57, and 21.65 mg/L; and 6.219, 6.547, and 2.587). Overall, the bio-fabrication of CuO NPs has the potential to develop better and safer antiparasitic control techniques.

AB  - Silicon (Si) can improve plant resistance to herbivorous insect attack. Early shoot borer (ESB), is one of the most solemn lepidopterans borers on sugarcane in India. Even with insecticide application, management of this pest is difficult. The management requires a fresh new approach. As a result, the current study aims to determine the effect of silicon on the early shoot borer, Chilo infuscatellus Walker, through biophysical factor analysis and mandibular wear documentation. When sugarcane leaves were treated with calcium silicate at 1000 kg/ha, scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of silicified cells and trichomes, as well as increased cell wall thickness, silicon content, and waxes content. Furthermore, larvae of an early shoot borer fed silica-treated plants showed a complete wearing of mandibles as compared to untreated check.

AB  - Synchronization of donor cells is an important step for the success of somatic cell nuclear transfer application and facilitates the development of embryos. Contact inhibition, serum starvation and different chemical agents are used in synchronizing different types of somatic cells. In this study, to synchronize the primary ovine adult (POF) and foetal (POFF) fibroblast cells to G0/G1 phases, the contact inhibition, the serum starvation, roscovitine and trichostatin A ( TSA) methods were used. In the first part of the study, roscovitine (10, 15, 20 and 30 mu M) and TSA (25, 50, 75 and 100 nM) were applied for 24 h to determine the optimal concentration for POF and POFF cells. In the second part, optimal concentrations of roscovitine and TSA for these cells were compared with contact inhibition and serum starvation methods. Cell cycle distribution and apoptotic activity analysis were performed by flow cytometry to compare this synchronization methods. Serum starvation method resulted in higher cell synchronization rate in both cells compared to other groups. Although contact inhibition and TSA also achieved high success rates of synchronized cell value, it was observed that the difference between serum starvation and these groups was significant (p <.05). When the apoptosis rates of the two cell types were examined, it was observed that the early apoptotic cells in contact inhibition and late apoptotic cells in the serum starvation were higher than the other groups (p <.05). Although the 10 and 15 mu M concentrations of roscovitine gave the lowest apoptosis rates, it was observed that it failed to synchronize both the ovine fibroblast cells to G0/G1 phase. As a result, it was concluded that while roscovitine was not successful to synchronize both the POFF and POF cell lines, TSA (50 nM for POF cells and 100 nM for POFF cells) can be used efficiently as an alternative to the contact inhibition and the serum starvation methods.

AB  - Background Individual treatment with either the standard chemotherapeutic drug tamoxifen (Tam), the natural product hesperidin (Hes), or camel milk exosomes (Exo) has been shown to inhibit breast cancer MCF7 cells proliferation. However, little is known regarding their combined effect on MCF7 both in vitro and in vivo. Objective This study aimed to investigate whether the combined therapy of Tam, Hes, and Exo could synergistically inhibit the proliferation of MCF7 both in vitro and in vivo and could decrease Tam side effects. Results Combined treatment with Tam, Hes, and Exo significantly inhibited MCF7 proliferation as compared to the individual treatment. This cotreatment also had higher apoptotic, anti-migratory, and anti-invasive effects against MCF7 than individual treatment as revealed by; (1) Bax and caspase3 upregulation and Bcl2 downregulation; (2) downregulation of breast cancer-related genes (EGFR and ER alpha); (3) downregulation of MMP9 and upregulation of TIMP1; and (4) decreased number of migratory cells (transwell assay). This therapeutic potential was confirmed by the results of the in vivo study (mouse model of breast cancer induced by MCF7 xenograft). Cotreated mice had the smallest tumor size, highest Bax and caspase3, lowest Bcl2 and VEGF expression in the xenograft. This cotreatment was safer and reduced Tam side effects as revealed by; (1) lower serum levels of AST, ALT, creatinine, and urea; (2) lower levels of the lipid peroxide MDA; and (3) higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes CAT and GPx. Conclusion Cotreatment with tamoxifen, hesperidin, and camel milk exosomes synergistically inhibited MCF7 proliferation, migration and minimized tamoxifen adverse effects. Therefore, exosomes and hesperidin could be utilized as safe adjuvants/vehicles to tamoxifen during breast cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - Ethnopharmcological relevance: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a series of clinical, imaging, and pathological syndromes caused by brain microvascular damage and treated as a major contributing factor in many neurological diseases. Guyuan Jiannao Decoction (GYJND), a traditional Chinese formular, is clinically used for treating CSVD. However, the fundamental mechanism is nevertheless unknown. Aim of the study: To explore the potential mechanism underlying the effect of GYJND on CSVD. Methods and materials: UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was employed to identify the chemical components of GYJND. Subsequently, CSVD models were utilized to assess the impact of GYJND in vivo. Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate cognitive function. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE), luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were performed to observe pathological changes of brain. Morphology and function of endothelial cells, astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, including Occludin, GFAP and Iba-1 were detected using immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (ICH). Results: A total of 95 compounds were identified from GYJND, mainly including flavonoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, saponins, phenolic acids. In animal experiments, treatment with GYJND effectively improved cognitive function in rats, as observed by MWM. GYJND reduced brain tissue injury and improve the permeability of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and microvascular structure. Further, the morphology and structural damage of neurovascular unit (NVU) were alleviated after treatment of GYJND. GYJND also attenuated neuronal apoptosis, increased NeuN, GFAP and decreased Iba-1, AQP4 level in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In addition, GYJND upregulated PI3K/AKT expression and inhibited NF-kappa B expression. Conclusion: Our study suggested that GYJND treatment can protect NVU in the prefrontal cortex and hippo-campus of CSVD. These effects may be achieved by inhibiting NF-kappa B through activation of PI3K/AKT signaling.

AB  - While fetal growth is dependent on many factors, optimal placental function is a prerequisite for a normal pregnancy outcome. The majority of fetal growth-restricted (FGR) pregnancies result from placental insufficiency (PI). The insulin-like growth factors (IGF1 and IGF2) stimulate fetal growth and placental development and function. Previously, we demonstrated that in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) of the placental hormone, chorionic somatomammotropin (CSH), resulted in two phenotypes. One phenotype exhibits significant placental and fetal growth restriction (PI-FGR), impaired placental nutrient transport, and significant reductions in umbilical insulin and IGF1. The other phenotype does not exhibit statistically significant changes in placental or fetal growth (non-FGR). It was our objective to further characterize these two phenotypes by determining the impact of CSH RNAi on the placental (maternal caruncle and fetal cotyledon) expression of the IGF axis. The trophectoderm of hatched blastocysts (9 days of gestation, dGA) were infected with a lentivirus expressing either a non-targeting sequence (NTS RNAi) control or CSH-specific shRNA (CSH RNAi) prior to embryo transfer into synchronized recipient ewes. At & AP;125 dGA, pregnancies were fitted with vascular catheters to undergo steady-state metabolic studies. Nutrient uptakes were determined, and tissues were harvested at necropsy. In both CSH RNAi non-FGR and PI-FGR pregnancies, uterine blood flow was significantly reduced (p & LE; 0.05), while umbilical blood flow (p & LE; 0.01), both uterine and umbilical glucose and oxygen uptakes (p & LE; 0.05), and umbilical concentrations of insulin and IGF1 (p & LE; 0.05) were reduced in CSH RNAi PI-FGR pregnancies. Fetal cotyledon IGF1 mRNA concentration was reduced (p & LE; 0.05) in CSH RNAi PI-FGR pregnancies, whereas neither IGF1 nor IGF2 mRNA concentrations were impacted in the maternal caruncles, and either placental tissue in the non-FGR pregnancies. Fetal cotyledon IGF1R and IGF2R mRNA concentrations were not impacted for either phenotype, yet IGF2R was increased (p & LE; 0.01) in the maternal caruncles of CSH RNAi PI-FGR pregnancies. For the IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, IGFBP3), only IGFBP2 mRNA concentrations were impacted, with elevated IGFBP2 mRNA in both the fetal cotyledon (p & LE; 0.01) and maternal caruncle (p = 0.08) of CSH RNAi non-FGR pregnancies. These data support the importance of IGF1 in placental growth and function but may also implicate IGFBP2 in salvaging placental growth in non-FGR pregnancies.

AB  - Our previous studies have shown that miR-130b can significantly inhibit subcutaneous fat deposition in pigs. This study aims to further investigate its effect on lipid accumulation at early-stage (24 and 48 h) and late-stage (7 d) adipogenic differentiation and to clarify potential mechanisms using primary rat intramuscular preadipocytes (IMAs). Results showed that at 24 h and 48 h, miR-130b overexpression significantly reduced lipid deposition by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-130b overexpression significantly inhibited the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis marker genes. Specifically, the mRNA expression of Ccnd1 tended to decrease, while the BCL2 protein level was significantly decreased at 48 h. In contrast, miR-130b inhibition significantly increased the BCL2 protein level. At 7 d, the miR-130b mimic significantly decreased intracellular TG content and tended to decrease Hsd11b1 mRNA expression while significantly promoting Lpl mRNA expression. Additionally, the miR-130b mimic significantly increased the CASP3 protein level and tended to decrease the BCL2 protein level. In conclusion, our data indicated for the first time that miR-130b could reduce lipid deposition in rat IMAs through different mechanisms: at the early stage of differentiation by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis and at the late stage by inhibiting adipogenic differentiation, promoting lipid hydrolysis, and promoting apoptosis.

AB  - Photothermal neural activity inhibition has emerged as a minimally invasive neuromodulation technology with submillimeter precision. One of the techniques involves the utilization of plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to modulate neural activity by photothermal effects ("thermoplasmonics"). A surface modification technique is often required to integrate AuNPs onto the neural interface. Here, polydopamine (pDA), a multifunctional adhesive polymer with a wide light absorption spectrum, is introduced both as a primer layer for the immobilization of gold nanorods (GNRs) on the neural interface and as an additional photothermal agent by absorbing near-infrared red (NIR) lights for more efficient photothermal effects. First, the optical and photothermal properties of pDA as well as the characteristics of GNRs attached onto the pDA film are investigated for the optimized photothermal neural interface. Due to the covalent bonding between GNR surfaces and pDA, GNRs immobilized on pDA showed strong attachment onto the surface, yielding a more stable photothermal platform. Lastly, when photothermal neural stimulation was applied to the primary rat hippocampal neurons, the substrate with GNRs immobilized on the pDA film allowed more laser power-efficient photothermal neuromodulation as well as photothermal cell death. This study suggests the feasibility of using pDA as a surface modification material for developing a photothermal platform for the inhibition of neural activities.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Areca Thirteen Pill, also called Gao You-13 (GY-13), is a traditional Mongolian herbal formula and has been extensively used to treat depression in Mongolian areas, which belongs to Heyi disease in Mongolian medicine. Major depressive disorder is a serious psychiatric disease, only one-third of in-dividuals with depression are responsive to current antidepressants in clinic. Growing attention has been attracted by traditional herbal medicines in fighting depression because they are considered safer alternatives to pharmacotherapy.Aim of the study: To reveal the mechanism of GY-13 in the treatment of depression.Materials and methods: The rat depression model was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and primary hippocampal neurons were used to construct a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model. The anti-depressant effect of GY-13 was then assessed by performing sucrose preference tests, open field tests, and body weight measurements on rats. The expression of cAMP and PKA, mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis were measured.Results: The results indicate that GY-13 significantly improves depression-like behavior, rescues decreased cAMP, PKA, recovers the mRNA levels of CREB and BDNF, and increases the proliferative activity of hippo-campus. In addition, blockade of PKA reverses the effects of GY-13 treatment on CREB mRNA, BDNF mRNA levels. In vitro, GY-13 treatment increased hippocampal proliferative activity and attenuated Glu-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons as well as reduced CREB mRNA and BDNF mRNA expression levels. Conclusions: Our research demonstrated that GY-13 treatment exerted a potent antidepressant action via acti-vation of cAMP/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, promoting proliferation, and suppressing apoptosis. This research provides molecular biological ground for developing GY-13 into a potent alternative for the intervention of depression.

AB  - Background: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a crippling illness with limited effective treatment options. Recent findings have suggested that ginseng stem and leaf saponins (GSLS) possess anti-fatigue effects. However, the detailed mechanisms by which GSLS impact CFS have yet to be fully elucidated. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of GSLS in the treatment of peripheral and central fatigue in mice with CFS. Methods: A CFS model was established in male C57BL/6 mice, which were then subjected to prolonged swimming tests. The validity of this model and the efficacy of GSLS were verified using the forced exhaustion swimming test and the Morris water maze test. The anti-fatigue mechanism of GSLS was verified using pathological section observations, biochemical index tests, neurotransmitter analysis, and Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomics analysis. Results: GSLS prolonged the swim time-to-exhaustion in CFS mice and reduced escape latency in the water maze, revealing their anti-fatigue and memory-improving effects. GSLS significantly protected both peripheral (liver) and central (hippocampus) tissues, as shown in pathological sections. Biochemical indices suggested that GSLS mitigate peripheral fatigue by reducing energy expenditure and oxidative damage and inhibiting the production of harmful metabolites. Furthermore, GSLS altered the abnormal levels of 14 neurotransmitters in the brains of CFS mice, including seven upregulated and seven downregulated neurotransmitters, highlighting their role in mitigating central fatigue through neurotransmitter regulation. Serum metabolomics analysis identified alterations in 19 metabolites across 11 metabolic pathways, thereby elucidating the potential mechanisms by which GSLS treat CFS. Conclusion: GSLS ameliorate damage caused by both peripheral and central fatigue. They also act on multiple pathogenic mechanisms by modulating neurotransmitters and serum biomarkers, making them a potential therapeutic agent for CFS.

AB  - The role of cholinergic projection systems of the neocortex and hippocampus in memory consolidation in healthy and neuropathological conditions has been subject to intensive research. On the contrary, the significance of cholinergic cortical and hippocampal interneurons in learning has hardly been studied. We aimed to evaluate the role of both cholinergic projection neurons and interneurons of the neocortex and hippocampus at an early stage of spatial memory consolidation (2s1) in normal and chronic brain hypoperfusion conditions. Control rats and rats subjected to permanent two-vessel occlusion were trained with the Morris water maze, and the activity of membrane-bound and water-soluble choline acetyltransferase was evaluated in the sub-fractions of 'light' and 'heavy' synaptosomes of the neocortex and hippocampus, in which the presynapses of cholinergic projections and interneurons, respectively, are concentrated. Animals were ranked into quartiles according to their performance on stage 2s1. We found: (1) quartile-dependent cholinergic composition of 2s1 function and dynamics of cholinergic synaptic plasticity under cerebral hypoperfusion; (2) cholinergic hippocampal interneurons are necessary for successful 2s1 consolidation; (3) cholinergic neocortical interneurons and projections can be critical for 2s1 consolidation in less learning rats. We conclude that targeted modulation of cholinergic synaptic activity in the hippocampus and neocortex can be effective in reversing the cognitive disturbance of cerebral hypoperfusion. We discuss the possible ways to restore the impaired spatial memory 2s1 in the presence of cerebral hypoperfusion.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant effect of Jujuboside A (JuA) on corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression in mice and explore the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: The mice models were submitted to CORT and treated with JuA (10 and 30 mg/kg) for three weeks. Experiments were also performed on mice with brain-derived neurotrophic factor knockdown (BDNF (+/-)) as control subjects. Behavioral tests, including the open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and Morris water maze (MWM), were then performed to evaluate the antidepressant effect of JuA. The expression levels of BDNF, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampi of mice were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot. The effect of JuA on the viability of mouse hippocampal cells (HT22) was also assessed by CCK-8 assay.
   Results: JuA significantly decreased the OFT and TST immobility time of the mice, the total distance travelled and the time spent in the central area also effectively increased in the OFT. In the MWM, the escape latencies of the mice decreased remarkably, while the number of times the mice crossed the platform and the target quadrant increased significantly after treatment with JuA. In addition, the BDNF, TrkB, and CREB expression levels were significantly increased in the hippocampi of the mice treated with JuA. Furthermore, JuA clearly attenuated CORT-induced cell injury, as evidenced by the increased viability of the HT22 cells.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that JuA may exhibit potential antidepressant effect in mice by increasing protein expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, CREB, and improving the viability of the hippocampal cells. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hippocampal place cells are known for their spatially selective firing and are believed to encode an animal's location while forming part of a cognitive map of space. These cells exhibit marked tuning curves and rate changes when an animal's environment is sufficiently manipulated, in a process known as remapping. Place cells are accompanied by many other spatially tuned cells, such as border cells and grid cells, but how these cells interact during navigation and remapping is unknown. In this work, we build a normative place cell model wherein a neural network is tasked with accurate position reconstruction and path integration. Motivated by the notion of a cognitive map, the network's position is estimated directly from its learned representations. To obtain a position estimate, we propose a non-trainable decoding scheme applied to network output units, inspired by the localized firing patterns of place cells. We find that output units learn place-like spatial representations, while upstream recurrent units become boundary-tuned. When the network is trained to perform the same task in multiple simulated environments, its place-like units learn to remap like biological place cells, displaying global, geometric, and rate remapping. These remapping abilities appear to be supported by rate changes in upstream units. While the model does not learn grid-like units, its place unit centers form clusters organized in a hexagonal lattice in open fields. When we decode the center locations of CA1 place fields in mice, we find preliminary evidence of a similar clustering tendency. This suggests a potential mechanism for the interaction between place cells, border cells, and grid cells. Our model provides a normative framework for learning spatial representations previously reserved for biological place cells, providing new insight into place cell field formation and remapping.

AB  - Our aim was to assess the cognitive and emotional state, as well as related-changes in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression of adolescent C57BL/6J male mice after a 5-week two-bottle choice protocol (postnatal day [pd]21 to pd52). Additionally, we wanted to analyse whether the behavioural and neurobiological effects observed in late adolescence (pd62) lasted until adulthood (pd84). Behavioural testing revealed that alcohol during early adolescence increased anxiety-like and compulsive-related behaviours, which was maintained in adulthood. Concerning cognition, working memory was only altered in late adolescent mice, whereas object location test performance was impaired in both ages. In contrast, novel object recognition remained unaltered. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that alcohol during adolescence diminished BDNF+ cells in the cingulate cortex, the hippocampal CA1 layer and the central amygdala. Regarding hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) functioning, alcohol abuse increased the GR and CRF expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the central amygdala. Besides this, GR density was also higher in the prelimbic cortex and the basolateral amygdala, regardless of the animals' age. Our findings suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure led to long-term behavioural alterations, along with changes in BDNF, GR and CRF expression in limbic brain areas involved in stress response, emotional regulation and cognition.

AB  - Plaques of amyloid-beta (A beta) and neurofibrillary tangles are the main pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, some older adult people with AD pathological hallmarks can retain cognitive function. Unraveling the factors that lead to this cognitive resilience to AD offers promising prospects for identifying new therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis focuses on the contribution of resilience to changes in excitatory synapses at the structural and molecular levels, which may underlie healthy cognitive performance in aged AD animals. Utilizing the Morris Water Maze test, we selected resilient (asymptomatic) and cognitively impaired aged Tg2576 mice. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed similar levels of A beta 42 in both experimental groups, western blot analysis revealed differences in tau pathology in the pre-synaptic supernatant fraction. To further investigate the density of synapses in the hippocampus of 16-18 month-old Tg2576 mice, we employed stereological and electron microscopic methods. Our findings indicated a decrease in the density of excitatory synapses in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 in cognitively impaired Tg2576 mice compared with age-matched resilient Tg2576 and non-transgenic controls. Intriguingly, through quantitative immunoelectron microscopy in the hippocampus of impaired and resilient Tg2576 transgenic AD mice, we uncovered differences in the subcellular localization of glutamate receptors. Specifically, the density of GluA1, GluA2/3, and mGlu5 in spines and dendritic shafts of CA1 pyramidal cells in impaired Tg2576 mice was significantly reduced compared with age-matched resilient Tg2576 and non-transgenic controls. Notably, the density of GluA2/3 in resilient Tg2576 mice was significantly increased in spines but not in dendritic shafts compared with impaired Tg2576 and non-transgenic mice. These subcellular findings strongly support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity and synaptic machinery in the hippocampus play crucial roles in the mechanisms of cognitive resilience in Tg2576 mice.

AB  - Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is one of the most intractable epilepsies. Previously, we reported that mitochondrial DNA deletions were associated with epileptogenesis. While the underlying mechanism of mitochondrial DNA deletions during epileptogenesis remain unknown. In this study, a novel somatic mutation of DNA2 gene was identified in the hippocampal tissue of two MTLE patients carrying mitochondrial DNA deletions, and this mutation decreased the full-length expression of DNA2 protein significantly, aborting its normal functions. Then, we knocked down the DNA2 protein in zebrafish, and we demonstrated that zebrafish with DNA2 deficiency showed decreased expression of mitochondrial complex II-IV, and exhibited hallmarks of epileptic seizures, including abnormal development of the zebrafish and epileptiform discharge signals in brain, compared to the Cas9-control group. Moreover, our cell-based assays showed that DNA2 deletion resulted in accumulated mitochondrial DNA damage, abnormal oxidative phosphorylation and decreased ATP production in cells. Inadequate ATP generation in cells lead to declined Na+, K+-ATPase activity and change of cell membrane potential. Together, these disorders caused by DNA2 depletion increased cell apoptosis and inhibited the differentiation of SH-SY5Y into branched neuronal phenotype. In conclusion, DNA2 deficiency regulated the cell membrane potential via affecting ATP production by mitochondria and Na+, K+-ATPase activity, and also affected neuronal cell growth and differentiation. These disorders caused by DNA2 dysfunction are important causes of epilepsy. In summary, we are the first to report the pathogenic somatic mutation of DNA2 gene in the patients with MTLE disease, and we uncovered the mechanism of DNA2 regulating the epilepsy. This study provides new insight into the pathogenesis of epilepsy and underscore the value of DNA2 in epilepsy.

AB  - Prion diseases arise from the conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into a self-replicating prion isoform (PrPSc). Although this process has been studied mostly in neurons, a growing body of evidence suggests that astrocytes express PrP(C) and are able to replicate and accumulate PrPSc. Currently, prion diseases remain incurable, while downregulation of PrP(C) represents the most promising therapy due to the reduction of the substrate for prion conversion. Here we show that the astrocyte-specific genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) reduces PrP(C) expression in astrocytes. Immunocytochemical analysis of cultured CaN-KO astrocytes and isolation of synaptosomal compartments from the hippocampi of astrocyte-specific CaN-KO (ACN-KO) mice suggest that PrP(C) is downregulated both in vitro and in vivo. The downregulation occurs without affecting the glycosylation of PrP(C) and without alteration of its proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. Direct assessment of the protein synthesis rate and shotgun mass spectrometry proteomics analysis suggest that the reduction of PrP(C) is related to the impairment of global protein synthesis in CaN-KO astrocytes. When WT-PrP and PrP-D177N, a mouse homologue of a human mutation associated with the inherited prion disease fatal familial insomnia, were expressed in astrocytes, CaN-KO astrocytes showed an aberrant localization of both WT-PrP and PrP-D177N variants with predominant localization to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that ablation of CaN affects both WT and mutant PrP proteins. These results provide new mechanistic details in relation to the regulation of PrP expression in astrocytes, suggesting the therapeutic potential of astroglial cells.

AB  - Background: Pyroptosis-related genes (PRG) are closely associated with the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The predictive power of PRGs could be used to assess the clinical outcomes of HCC. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq data and clinical information from patients with liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) were used to identify PRG with differentially expressed between HCC and normal samples. Univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox method, and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to develop a prognostic model that included three PRGs. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify differential immune cells and their associated pathways. The expression of Gasdermin C (GSDMC) in the HCC samples was detected by western blotting, and the function of GSDMC in HCC proliferation and metastasis was detected by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, cell invasion, and wound healing assays. Results: Of 52 PRGs, GSDMC, Bcl-2 homologusantagonist/ killer 1 (BAK1), and NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 6 (NLRP6) were selected to establish a prognostic model. The model successfully differentiated HCC patients with varied survival in the TCGA training and test cohorts, as well as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) validation cohorts. The risk score was proven to be an independent prognostic factor. In addition, we also reported a marked upregulation of GSDMC in HCC tissues, which could be induced by CD274 (PD-L1). Overexpression of GSDMC contributes to HCC cells invasion, proliferation, and migration. Conclusions: The three PRGs signatures containing GSDMC independently predicted HCC prognosis. As a new driver molecule, GSDMC could play a tumor-promoting role by facilitating HCC growth and metastasis.

AB  - We and others have reported that systematic stimulation of the central innate immune system by a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can improve depression-like behavior in chronically stressed animals. However, it is unclear whether similar stimulation by intranasal administration could improve depression-like behavior in animals. We investigated this question using monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a derivative of LPS that lacks the adverse effects of LPS but is still immuno-stimulatory. We found that a single intranasal administration of MPL at a dose of 10 or 20 & mu;g/mouse, but not at a dose of 5 & mu;g/mouse, ameliorated chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behavior in mice, as evidenced by the decrease in immobility time in tail suspension test and forced swimming test and the increase in sucrose intake in sucrose preference test. In the time-dependent analysis, the antidepressant-like effect of a single intranasal MPL administration (20 & mu;g/mouse) was observed 5 and 8 h but not 3 h after drug administration and persisted for at least 7 days. Fourteen days after the first intranasal MPL administration, a second intranasal MPL administration (20 & mu;g/mouse) still showed an antidepressant-like effect. The innate immune response mediated by microglia might mediate the antidepressant-like effect of intranasal MPL administration, because both inhibition of microglial activation by pretreatment with minocycline and depletion of microglia by pretreatment with PLX3397 prevented the antidepressant-like effect of intranasal MPL administration. These results suggest that intranasal administration of MPL can produce significant antidepressant-like effects in animals under chronic stress conditions via stimulation of microglia.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most prevalent methylated modifications of mRNA in eukaryotes. This reversible alteration can directly or indirectly influence biological functions, including RNA degradation, translation, and splicing. This study investigates the impact of chronic morphine administration and varying withdrawal durations (1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks) on the m6A modification levels in brain regions critical to addiction development and persistence. Our findings indicate that in the prefrontal cortex, the m6A levels and METTL3 expression decrease, accompanied by an increase in FTO and ALKBH5 expression, followed by fluctuating, but statistically insignificant changes in methylation-regulating enzymes over prolonged withdrawal. In the striatum, reductions in m6A levels and METTL3 expression are observed at 4 weeks of withdrawal, preceded by non-significant fluctuations in enzyme expression and the m6A modification levels. In contrast, no changes in the m6A modification levels or the expression of related enzymes are detected in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Our data suggest that m6A modification and its regulatory enzymes undergo region-specific and time-dependent changes in response to chronic morphine exposure and subsequent withdrawal.

AB  - Amyloid beta (A beta)-mediated synapse dysfunction is an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and previous studies suggest that NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysregulation may contribute to these pathological effects. Although A beta peptides impair NMDAR expression and activity, the mechanisms mediating these alterations in the early stages of AD are unclear. Here, we observed that NMDAR subunit NR2B and PSD-95 levels were aberrantly upregulated and correlated with A beta(42) load in human postsynaptic fractions of the prefrontal cortex in early stages of AD patients, as well as in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, NR2B and PSD95 dysregulation was revealed by an increased expression of both proteins in A beta-injected mouse hippocampi. In cultured neurons, A beta oligomers increased the NR2B-containing NMDAR density in neuronal membranes and the NMDA-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase, in addition to colocalization in dendrites of NR2B subunit and PSD95. Mechanistically, A beta oligomers required integrin beta 1 to promote synaptic location and function of NR2B-containing NMDARs and PSD95 by phosphorylation through classic PKCs. These results provide evidence that A beta oligomers modify the contribution of NR2B to NMDAR composition and function in the early stages of AD through an integrin beta 1 and PKC-dependent pathway. These data reveal a novel role of A beta oligomers in synaptic dysfunction that may be relevant to early-stage AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Yes-associated protein1 (YAP1), a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is over-expressed in several types of malignancies. We analyzed retrospectively the TCGA database using 447 colorectal cancer (CRC) samples to determine the correlation between YAP1 expression level and CRC patient prognosis. YAP1-enforced expressed CRC cell lines were constructed using the lentivirus particles containing a YAP1 insert. YAP1 was highly expressed in CRC cancerous tissues and is associated with distant metastasis of CRC patients. Kaplan - Meier analysis indicated that CRC patients with a higher YAP1 expression group (n = 104) had worse disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than lower YAP1 expression group (n = 343) (p = 0.008 and p = 0.022). Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that the elevated YAP1 expression predicted the aggressive phenotype and was an independent indicator for OS and DFS of CRC patients. YAP1 over-expression in CRC cells enhanced their migration and invasion significantly which can be reversed by AXL, CTGF, or CYR61 interference. The study suggested that YAP1 affected the prognosis of CRC patients and controlled the abilities of invasion and migration of CRC cells via its target genes AXL, CTGF, and CYR61.

AB  - Ischemia-reperfusion injury remains a fundamental problem during organ transplantation logistics. One key technical factor is the rapid allograft rewarming during the time of vascular reconstruction in the recipient. In this pilot study, a new thermal insulation bag (TIB) for organ transplantation was used. Insulation capacity, tissue compatibility, and usability were tested initially ex vivo on porcine kidneys (n = 24) followed by the first in vivo usage. Fourteen female German landrace pigs underwent kidney auto-transplantation after 24 h cold storage (4 degrees C). During the implantation process the kidney was either insulated with the new TIB, or it was not thermo-protected at all, which represents the clinical standard. In this proof-of-concept study, the usability (knife-to-skin-time) and the general thermal capacity (30 min warm storage at 38 degrees C ex vivo p < 0.001) was shown. The clinical outcome showed significant differences in the determination of CRP and pi-GST levels. Syndecan-1 Antibody staining showed clear significant higher counts in the control group (p < 0.01) indicating epithelial damage. However, the effect on renal outcomes in not severely pre-damaged kidneys does not appear to be conclusively significant. A close follow-up study is warranted, especially in the context of marginal organs or in cases where anastomosis-times are prolonged due to surgical complexity (e.g., multiple vessels and complex reconstructions).

AB  - Potassium ion channels are extensively involved in the regulation of epileptic seizures. The small conductance calcium-sensitive potassium channels (SK channels) and ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels are activated by calcium ion entry and decrease ATP levels, respectively. These channels can underlie the post-burst afterhyperpolarization and be upregulated during seizures, providing negative feedback during epileptic activity. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp method in rat brain slices, we investigated the effect of SK- and K-ATP-affecting drugs on seizure-like events (SLEs) in the 4-aminopyridine model of epileptic seizures in vitro. We demonstrate that SK and K-ATP channels contribute to sustaining the high-frequency firing of the principal neurons in the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex during injections of depolarizing current and epileptiform discharges. Neither the pharmacological blockade nor the activation of these channels was able to prevent the epileptiform activity in brain slices. However, the blockade of K-ATP channels increases the SLE duration, suggesting that these channels may contribute to the termination of SLEs. Thus, K-ATP channels can be considered a promising target for pharmacological interventions for the treatment of epilepsy. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary: In the wild, African elephant calves must stay close to their mothers and the family unit as the African environment holds many threats. African elephant calves in zoos are raised in a protected environment. Therefore, we hypothesize that calves ex situ hold bigger distances and behave differently than in situ. Additionally, those differences are likely to increase with further zoo generations. This study used ethological research methods to compare the mother-calf bond of African elephant calves in situ and ex situ (first and second generation). The results showed that ex situ living calves of both generations maintain greater distances to their mothers and show a wider variation (positive and negative) in behavior than in situ. The detected differences indicate that calves ex situ can behave more freely as they are in a protected environment. Therefore, they can develop faster than in the wild, which agrees with similar findings on African elephant calf development and adult African elephants. The hypothesis that differences between in situ and ex situ increase with the zoo generations could not be verified. Hence, modifications in behavior under different environmental selection pressures may be adaptive.
   African zoo elephants live in safe environments with sufficient resources, are protected from threats, and have their health and body conditions cared for. Calves ex situ undergo the same developmental stages as in situ and are raised by the whole family unit. However, due to environmental differences, there might be behavioral modifications between calves in situ and ex situ. We hypothesize that these differences increase with ongoing generations. This ethological study compares social and general behavior and the distance calves kept to their mothers' between calves of the first (F1) and second (F2) zoo generation and the wild. Using ethological methods, data were collected for similar to 90 in situ calves and 16 ex situ (8 F1, 8 F2) between the ages of 0.5 to 4 years (120 observation hours per group). Results showed that in situ calves spent significantly more time close to mothers than the F1 and the F2 zoo generations (F1/in situ: p = <0.001; F2/in situ: p = 0.007). The behaviors of eating, drinking, trunk movement, washing, and affiliative behaviors showed significant differences between in situ and ex situ calves. The amount and distribution of affiliative and agonistic behavior initiated and received by calves was displayed with a greater variety ex situ. Ex situ calves not only performed affiliative but, in contrast to the in situ, also agonistic behavior (F1/in situ: initiated p = 0.002, received p = 0.010; F2/in situ: initiated p = 0.050, received p = 0.037). The comparison of zoo generations suggests that differences did not increase with the generation. The more casual binding between mothers and offspring in zoos and the age-dependent improvement of social behavior of zoo-born calves are seen as a result of elephants' adaptation to secure zoo conditions. The results of this study agree with the faster development of ex situ African elephants, like earlier puberty and more frequent breeding patterns, as known from the literature.

AB  - Background The pathway involving PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARKIN plays a crucial role in mitophagy, a process activated by artesunate (ART). We propose that patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis exhibit insufficient mitophagy, and ART enhances mitophagy via the PINK1/PARKIN pathway, thereby providing neuroprotection.Methods Adult female mice aged 8-10 weeks were selected to create a passive transfer model of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. We conducted behavioral tests on these mice within a set timeframe. Techniques such as immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were employed to assess markers including PINK1, PARKIN, LC3B, p62, caspase3, and cleaved caspase3. The TUNEL assay was utilized to detect neuronal apoptosis, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine mitochondrial autophagosomes. Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured, treated, and then analyzed through immunofluorescence for mtDNA, mtROS, TMRM.Results In comparison to the control group, mitophagy levels in the experimental group were not significantly altered, yet there was a notable increase in apoptotic neurons. Furthermore, markers indicative of mitochondrial leakage and damage were found to be elevated in the experimental group compared to the control group, but these markers showed improvement following ART treatment. ART was effective in activating the PINK1/PARKIN pathway, enhancing mitophagy, and diminishing neuronal apoptosis. Behavioral assessments revealed that ART ameliorated symptoms in mice with anti-NMDAR encephalitis in the passive transfer model (PTM). The knockdown of PINK1 led to a reduction in mitophagy levels, and subsequent ART intervention did not alleviate symptoms in the anti-NMDAR encephalitis PTM mice, indicating that ART's therapeutic efficacy is mediated through the activation of the PINK1/PARKIN pathway.Conclusions At the onset of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, mitochondrial damage is observed; however, this damage is mitigated by the activation of mitophagy via the PINK1/PARKIN pathway. This regulatory feedback mechanism facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria, prevents neuronal apoptosis, and consequently safeguards neural tissue. ART activates the PINK1/PARKIN pathway to enhance mitophagy, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects and may achieve therapeutic goals in treating anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

AB  - Background The larvicidal and biochemical effects of chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs), namely lufenuron, flufenoxuron and hexaflumuron against the newly molted penultimate instar larvae of the house fly Musca domestica, were investigated. Methods Different concentrations from each tested compound were applied on forty individuals of M. domestica 2nd instar larvae. Four replicates were used for each concentration. Results The recorded LC25 and LC75 values were (166.11, 68.33 and 56.43 ppm) and (732.33, 283.02 and 248.45 ppm) for lufenuron, flufenoxuron and hexaflumuron, respectively. The results showed significant (P < 0.05) increase of mortality in larvae treated with different tested CSIs compounds. Mortality was greater in larvae treated by hexaflumuron than lufenuron and flufenoxuron. The main metabolites were tested in the larval whole-body tissue homogenate and findings could be summarized as follows: tested concentrations of CSIs (a) predominantly reduced the total carbohydrate, protein, lipid and cholesterol content at certain ages tested. (b) Disturbed the total carbohydrate content particularly for larvae treated with LC75 concentration of hexaflumuron. (c) Exerted the protein and lipid profiles and this effect was much more pronounced in larvae treated with hexaflumuron. (d) Reduced the quantitative cholesterol content and this reduction was found to be increased with development. Conclusions Tested CSIs in particular hexaflumuron showed remarkable larval toxicity and reduced the main metabolites content in the larval whole-body tissue homogenate of the house fly, M. domestica.

AB  - Accumulating evidence confirms that sleep insufficiency is a high risk factor for cognitive impairment, which involves inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Resveratrol, an agonist of the Sirt1, has demonstrated anti-inflammation and neuroprotective effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. However, the beneficial effects of resveratrol on sleep deprivation-induced cognitive deficits and its underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, thirty-two male C57BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into a Control+DMSO group, Control+Resveratrol group, SD+DMSO group, and SD+Resveratrol group. The mice in the SD+Resveratrol group underwent 5 days of sleep deprivation after pretreatment with resveratrol (50 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, while the mice in the SD+DMSO group only underwent sleep deprivation. After sleep deprivation, we evaluated spatial learning and memory function using the Morris water maze test. We used general molecular biology techniques to detect changes in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Sirt1/miR-134 pathway-related synaptic plasticity proteins. We found that resveratrol significantly reversed sleep deprivation-induced learning and memory impairment, elevated interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine kinase receptor B, postsynaptic density protein-95, and synaptophysin levels by activating the Sirt1/miR-134 pathway. In conclusion, resveratrol is a promising agent for preventing sleep deprivation-induced cognitive dysfunction by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and improving synaptic function via the Sirt1/miR-134 pathway.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure can impair learning and memory in rodents, but the underlying systematic neural mechanism remains unclear. Due to the important role of the hippocampus for learning and memory, in this study, we systematically investigated the neural circuit, neuron structure, and function of the hippocampus after BPA exposure. First, by employing a virus tracing technique, we observed a decrease in the neural projection ratio of excitatory neural neurons from the "Entorhinal Cortex-Dentate Gyrus-CA3-CA1" and "Entorhinal Cortex-CA1" circuits. Furthermore, BPA exposure led to impairments of the branching complexity and electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons. Additionally, fiber photometry experiments revealed that BPA exposure reduces the level of real-time activity in hippocampal excitatory neurons (CA1, CA3, and DG) during the MWM task. To verify the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in learning and memory impairment caused by BPA, the dorsal hippocampus CA1 neurons were chemogenetically activated, and the spatial memory deficits were rescued. Collectively, our results suggest that BPA exposure impairs the hippocampal neural circuits and neuronal real-time response, leading to the dysfunction of spatial memory in mice. This study expands our understanding of the neurotoxic mechanisms of BPA at the mesoscopic neural level and provides a potential strategy for rescuing BPA-induced learning and memory impairments.

AB  - Headings ethnopharmacological relevance: Anshen Dingzhi prescription (ADP), which was first published in the masterpiece of traditional Chinese Medicine in the Qing Dynasty, "Yi Xue Xin Wu" (1732 CE), is documented to interrupt panic-related disorders. However, the mechanism of its action is still not clear. Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate the effects of ADP on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like behaviors and explore the mechanism from perspective of sirtuin1 (SIRT1)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha)-dependent mitochondrial function. Materials and methods: The changes of SIRT1-PGC-1 alpha signal and mitochondrial function were evaluated in the hippocampus of mice receiving single prolonged stress (SPS). Later, the roles of this signaling pathway played in fear memory generalization and anxiety-like behavior in SPS mice was investigated using two agonists of this signaling pathway. On this basis, the effects of ADP (36.8 mg/kg) with definite therapeutic effects, on mitochondrial function were investigated and further confirmed by a SIRT1 inhibitor. Finally, the possible components of ADP targeting PGC-1 alpha were monitored through bioinformatics. Results: Compared with control mice, SIRT1-PGC-1 alpha signal in the hippocampus was impaired in SPS mice, accompanied with dysfunction of mitochondria and abnormal expression of synaptic proteins. The agonists of SIRT1-PGC-1 alpha signal, ZLN005, as well as resveratrol improved the behavioral changes of mice caused by SPS, reversed the decline of proteins in SIRT1-PGC-1 alpha signal, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the abnormal expression of synaptic proteins. The fingerprint was established for the quality control of ADP. At a dose of 36.8 mg/kg, ADP could prevent fear memory generalization and anxiety-like behavior in SPS mice. Mechanically, ADP promoted SIRT1-PGC-1 alpha signal and repaired mitochondrial function. Importantly, SIRT1 inhibitor, selisistat eliminated the ameliorative effects of ADP on behavioral and mitochondrial function. Through molecular docking simulation, the brain-entering components of ADP, including malkangunin, Rg5, fumarine, frutinone A, celabenzine, and inermin had high binding energy with PGC-1 alpha. Conclusion: Dysfunction of SIRT1-PGC-1 alpha-dependent mitochondrial function is attributed to SPS-triggered fear generalization and anxiety-like behavior, and ADP could improve PTSD-like behaviors likely through activating this signaling pathway.

AB  - We do not understand how neural nodes operate and coordinate within the recurrent action-perception loops that characterize naturalistic self-environment interactions. Here, we record single-unit spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from the dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), parietal area 7a, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as monkeys navigate in virtual reality to 'catch fireflies'. This task requires animals to actively sample from a closed-loop virtual environment while concurrently computing continuous latent variables: (i) the distance and angle travelled (i.e., path integration) and (ii) the distance and angle to a memorized firefly location (i.e., a hidden spatial goal). We observed a patterned mixed selectivity, with the prefrontal cortex most prominently coding for latent variables, parietal cortex coding for sensorimotor variables, and MSTd most often coding for eye movements. However, even the traditionally considered sensory area (i.e., MSTd) tracked latent variables, demonstrating path integration and vector coding of hidden spatial goals. Further, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit coupling (i.e., noise correlations) suggested a functional subnetwork composed by MSTd and dlPFC, and not between these and 7a, as anatomy would suggest. We show that the greater the unit-to-unit coupling between MSTd and dlPFC, the more the animals' gaze position was indicative of the ongoing location of the hidden spatial goal. We suggest this MSTd-dlPFC subnetwork reflects the monkeys' natural and adaptive task strategy wherein they continuously gaze toward the location of the (invisible) target. Together, these results highlight the distributed nature of neural coding during closed action-perception loops and suggest that fine-grain functional subnetworks may be dynamically established to subserve (embodied) task strategies.

AB  - Carboxylesterases 1A (CES1A) is a key enzyme responsible for the hydrolytic metabolism of a great deal of endogenous and exogenous substrates bearing ester-or amide-bond(s). This study aimed to decipher the species difference in CES1A-mediated hydrolytic metabolism by using a newly developed bioluminescence CES1A sensor (termed NLMe) as the probe substrate, while the liver microsomes from six different mammalian species (human, cynomolgus monkey, dog, minipig, rat and mouse) were used as the enzyme sources. Metabolite profiling demonstrated that all tested liver microsomes from various species could catalyze NLMe hydrolysis, but signif-icant difference in hydrolytic rate was observed. Kinetic plots of NLMe hydrolysis in liver microsomes from different species showed that the inherent clearance rates (Clint) of NLMe in human liver microsomes (HLM), cynomolgus monkey liver microsomes (CyLM), and pig liver microsome (PLM) were comparable, while the Clint values of NLMe in dog liver microsomes (DLM), mouse liver microsomes (MLM), and rat liver microsomes (RLM) were relatively small. Moreover, chemical inhibition assays showed that NLMe hydrolysis in all tested liver microsomes could be competently inhibited by BNPP (a potent broad-spectrum inhibitor of CES), but CUA (a selective inhibitor of human CES1A) only inhibited NLMe hydrolysis in human liver microsomes and dog liver microsomes. In summary, the species differences in CES1A-catalyzed NLMe hydrolysis were carefully investi-gated from the views of the similarities in metabolite profile, hydrolytic kinetics and inhibitor response. All these findings provide new insights into the species differences in CES1A-mediated hydrolytic metabolism and suggest that it is necessary for the pharmacologists to choose appropriate animal models to replace humans for evalu-ating the in vivo effects of CES1A inhibitors.

AB  - Alhagi camelorum (AC) is an herbal medicine known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the mechanism by which AC affects skin aging remains unclear. In this study, a polysaccharide with antioxidant activity was extracted from AC seeds (ACSP). The structure of ACSP was characterized by molecular weight determination, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, monosaccharide composition analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and physicochemical analysis. The molecular weight of ACSP was 736,831 Da. ACSP, devoid of a triple-helical conformation, comprised mannose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, and arabinose at a molar ratio of 39.65:0.85:0.59:11.57:40.25:6.60. The anti-skin-aging activity and potential mechanisms of action of ACSP were investigated in vitro. We observed that ACSP delayed the onset of senescence, promoted cell migration, decreased the expression of DNA damage markers and the production of reactive oxygen species, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential in damaged cells. ACSP also significantly reduced the expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in HaCaT cells. In addition, ACSP attenuated the expression of proteins within the IL-17 signaling pathway and suppressed the phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3/NF-kappa B proteins, thereby exerting a senescence-delaying effect on MGO-induced HaCaT cells. In conclusion, we elucidated the potential of ACSP in delaying skin aging and offer a novel plant-derived adjuvant to delay aging.

AB  - Manganese (Mn), although important for multiple cellular processes, has posed environmental health concerns due to its neurotoxic effects. In recent years, there have been extensive studies on the mechanism of Mn-induced neuropathology, as well as the sex-dependent vulnerability to its neurotoxic effects. Nonetheless, cellular mechanisms influenced by sex differences in susceptibility to Mn have yet to be adequately characterized. Since oxidative stress is a key mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity, here, we have probed Hsp70 and Nrf2 proteins to investigate the sex-dependent changes following exposure to Mn. Male and female rats were administered intraperitoneal injections of MnCl2 (10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg) 48 hourly for a total of eight injections (15 days). We evaluated changes in body weight, as well as Mn accumulation, Nrf2 and Hsp70 expression across four brain regions; striatum, cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in both sexes. Our results showed sex-specific changes in body-weight, specifically in males but not in females. Additionally, we noted sex-dependent accumulation of Mn in the brain, as well as in expression levels of Nrf2 and Hsp70 proteins. These findings revealed sex-dependent susceptibility to Mn-induced neurotoxicity corresponding to differential Mn accumulation, and expression of Hsp70 and Nrf2 across several brain regions.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bushen Zhuangjin Decoction (BZD) are an herbal compound commonly used to treat osteoarthritis (OA) in China. Aim of the study: This study aimed to verify the mechanism of Bushen Zhuangjin Decoction in relieving the pain of knee osteoarthritis. Materials and methods: Network pharmacology evaluation was used to discover the potential targets of BZD to relieve pain in KOA. The therapeutic effects of BZD treatment on KOA pain using histomorphology, behavioral assessments, suspension chip analysis, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) assays. The functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore the effects of BZD treatment on brain function associated to KOA. Results: Network pharmacological analysis revealed the association between the analgesic effect of BZD on KOA and the pain signaling neurotransmitter 5-HT. Subsequently, we conducted experiments to verify the therapeutic effect of BZD on pain in KOA animal models. Behavioral tests demonstrated that the pain threshold of knee osteoarthritis rats decreased in PWT and PWL, but BZD was able to increase the pain threshold. Histopathological staining indicated thinning of the cartilage layer and sparse trabeculae in the subchondral bone. Suspension chip analysis revealed a significant increase in pro-inflammatory factors of IL-1 alpha, IL-5, IL-12, IL-17A, RANTES, TNF-alpha and M-CSF in KOA, along with a significant decrease in anti-inflammatory factor of IL-13. However, BZD treatment decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and increased the content of anti-inflammatory factor. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis showed a significant decrease in the serum levels of GABA, E, GSH, Kyn, Met, and VMA in KOA, which were significantly increased by BZD. Conversely, the serum levels of TrpA, TyrA, Spd, and BALa were significantly increased in KOA and significantly decreased by BZD. ELISA and Western blot analysis showed increased expression of subchondral bone pain-related neuropeptides SP, CGRP, TH, NPY, VEGFA, 5-HT3 in KOA, which were decreased in BZD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that BZD exerts its therapeutic effect on KOA by modulating the activity and functional connections of the cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus.

AB  - Prenatal hypoxia (PH) is a common feature of a suboptimal intrauterine environment affecting the development of fetuses. Whether PH leads to abnormal ovary development is not yet clear. This study investigated ovarian function in offspring exposed to PH and the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. SD female rats (n = 12 per group) at 9 weeks of age were housed in individual cages (21% O-2). After the pregnant rats were exposed to hypoxia (10.5% oxygen) from embryonic day (E) 5 to E21, PH offspring were generated. All animals maintained normoxia during lactation. The number of follicles was counted in female offspring at 3 months under an optical microscope. The expression of Nobox, Gdf9, and Tets was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. Global DNA hydroxymethylation was measured by dot blot. The hydroxymethylation level of the Nobox gene was evaluated with an NGS-based multiple targeted CpG hydroxymethylation analysis method. Body weight and ovary weight were significantly decreased in the PH group compared with the control group. PH offspring have abnormal estrous cycle, decreased serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and follicular atresia, which are consistent with the clinical manifestations in patients with ovarian dysfunction. In terms of mechanism, the expression of Nobox was significantly decreased in the PH group. Subsequent high-throughput sequencing results showed that the level of hydroxymethylation in the candidate region of the Nobox gene was reduced. Cultured cells treated with hypoxia exhibited lower levels of both 5hmC and Nobox, while vitamin C, a coactivator of Tets, rescued hypo-hydroxymethylation and increased the expression level of Nobox. This study indicated that PH could cause hypo-hydroxymethylation of Nobox through epigenetic regulation and may consequently contribute to ovarian dysfunction in adult rat offspring.

AB  - The most common form of epilepsy among adults is mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), with seizures often originating in the hippocampus due to abnormal electrical activity. The gold standard for the histopathological analysis of mTLE is histology, which is a two-dimensional technique. To fill this gap, we propose complementary three-dimensional (3D) X-ray histology. Herein, we used synchrotron radiation-based phase-contrast microtomography with 1.6 & mu;m-wide voxels for the post mortem visualization of tissue microstructure in an intrahippocampal-kainate mouse model for mTLE. We demonstrated that the 3D X-ray histology of unstained, unsectioned, paraffin-embedded brain hemispheres can identify hippocampal sclerosis through the loss of pyramidal neurons in the first and third regions of the Cornu ammonis as well as granule cell dispersion within the dentate gyrus. Morphology and density changes during epileptogenesis were quantified by segmentations from a deep convolutional neural network. Compared to control mice, the total dentate gyrus volume doubled and the granular layer volume quadrupled 21 days after injecting kainate. Subsequent sectioning of the same mouse brains allowed for benchmarking 3D X-ray histology against well-established histochemical and immunofluorescence stainings. Thus, 3D X-ray histology is a complementary neuroimaging tool to unlock the third dimension for the cellular-resolution histopathological analysis of mTLE.

AB  - A descriptive analysis of common respiratory pathogens (CRPs) detected in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) from hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness during the fall seasons of the past three years, 2019-2021, in the Lazio region, Italy, was conducted to assess whether or not CRP circulation changed because of COVID-19 during the fall season. The results observed in a total of 633 NPSs subjected to molecular diagnosis for CRPs by multiplex PCR assay during the autumn seasons (exactly from week 41 to week 50) were compared with each other. In 2019, in 144 NPSs, the more represented CRPs were rhinovirus/enterovirus (7.6%) and influenza A/B (4.2%). In 2020, 55 (21.6%) out of 255 NPSs resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 and, except for one case of Legionella pneumophila, the CRPs detected were exclusively rhinovirus/enterovirus (4.7%). In 2021, among 234 NPSs, 25.6% resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2, 14.5% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 12.8% for rhinovirus/enterovirus. Compared with 2019, in 2020, CRP circulation was severely limited to a few cases; in 2021, instead, infections by RSV (detected also among adults), rhinovirus/enterovirus, and other respiratory pathogens were observed again, while influenza was practically absent. The comparison of the CRPs detected in the NPSs depicts a different circulation in the Lazio region during the last three fall seasons. CRP monitoring has a direct impact on the prevention and control strategies of respiratory infectious diseases, such as the non-pharmacological interventions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should investigate the impact of specific interventions on the spread of respiratory infections.

AB  - Corneal endothelial cells (CECs) are essential for maintaining corneal transparency and hydration through their barrier and pump functions. The COL8A2 gene encodes a component of the extracellular matrix of the cornea, which is crucial for the normal functioning of these cells. Mutations in COL8A2 are linked to corneal dystrophies, emphasizing the gene's importance in corneal health. The purpose of this research is to explore the effects of COL8A2 activation within CECs, to understand its contribution to cellular behavior and health. COL8A2 CRISPR/ dCas9 activation system (aCOL8A2) was used to activate the COL8A2. . In rats, wound healing and mitochondrial function were assessed after COL8A2 activation. As a result, aCOL8A2 promoted wound healing of rat corneal endothelium by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential. In cultured human CECs, proteomic analysis was performed to screen and identify the differential protein profiles between control and aCOL8A2 cells. Western blot was used to validate the differential proteins from both cells. Mitochondrial function and intracellular distribution were assessed by measuring ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential. In cultured human CECs, aCOL8A2 increased COL8A2 and phospho-YAP levels. Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was increased and actin cytoskeleton was attenuated by aCOL8A2. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the proteins were mainly involved in the regulation of folate biosynthesis, ECM-receptor interaction, cell differentiation, NADP activity and cytoskeleton. ATP production was increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was polarized and mitochondrial distribution was widespread in the aCOL8A2 group. In conclusion, aCOL8A2 induces a regulatory cascade affecting mitochondrial positioning and efficiency, mediated by alterations in the cytoskeletal architecture and the YAP signaling pathway. This sequence of events serves to bolster the functional capacities of corneal endothelial cells, including their pump and barrier functions, essential for corneal health and transparency.

AB  - Processing bodies (PBs) are ribonucleoprotein granules important for cytokine mRNA decay that are targeted for disassembly by many viruses. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is the etiological agent of the inflammatory endothelial cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and a PB-regulating virus. The virus encodes kaposin B (KapB), which induces actin stress fibers (SFs) and cell spindling as well as PB disassembly. We now show that KapB-mediated PB disassembly requires actin rearrangements, RhoA effectors, and the mechanoresponsive transcription activator, YAP. Moreover, ectopic expression of active YAP or exposure of ECs to mechanical forces caused PB disassembly in the absence of KapB. We propose that the viral protein KapB activates a mechanoresponsive signaling axis and links changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal structures to enhanced inflammatory molecule expression using PB disassembly. Our work implies that cytoskeletal changes in other pathologies may similarly impact the inflammatory environment.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zishen Huoxue Decoction (ZSHXD) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescription for the treatment of vascular dementia (VD). Although the clinical effects of ZSHXD have been demonstrated, the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ZSHXD remain unclear. Aim of the study: To explore whether the neuroprotective effect of Zishen Huoxue Decoction (ZSHXD) treatment is associated with the PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy in hippocampal CA1 region of 2-VO model rats. Materials and methods: Seventy-two male SD rats were randomly divided into the sham group, model group, Donepezil (0.45 mg/kg) group, ZSHXD low dose group (8.9 g/kg), ZSHXD medium dose group (17.8 g/kg), and ZSHXD high dose group (35.6 g/kg). Two-vessel occlusion (2-VO) rat model is established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of ZSHXD pretreatment. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining is conducted to detect the morphological changes of neurons and the number of normal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. Then, the mitochondrial function and structure were reflected by the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Meanwhile, the expression of mitophagy related proteins mediated by PINK1/Parkin was detected by western blot (WB). After that, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were measured by Elisa. At last, the apoptosis-related proteins Caspase-3,Bax,Bcl-2 were measured by WB. Results: The results depict that ZSHXD has dose-dependently improved the cognitive function in 2-VO model rats. It has also been showed that ZSHXD can alleviate neuron damage, rescue the mitochondrial structural injury and dysfunction in hippocampal CA1 region. Besides, ZSHXD has increased the activity of SOD and decreased the activity of MDA. In addition, ZSHXD can inhibit apoptosis with Caspase-3, Bax decreasing and Bcl-2 increasing. Specially, the protection of ZSHXD showed in 2-VO model rats is along with the upregulation of PINK1, Parkin and LC3-II/I, and downregulation of p62 in the hippocampal CA1 region. Conclusions: This study reveals that ZSHXD protects the 2-VO model rats from ischemic injury by activating the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in the hippocampal CA1 region.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinicopathological, and therapeutic aspects of allergic dermatitis caused by Culicoides spp. bites in donkeys. Clinical signs included restlessness and severe itching. Skin lesions were observed across various parts of the body and included areas of alopecia with crusts and serosanguinous exudates. Overall, 378 Culicoides insects were collected and Culicoides ocumarensis Ortiz was identified as the most common species. These findings suggest an association between allergic dermatitis and Culicoides. Additionally, a combination of copaiba oil and a multivitamin emulsion showed therapeutic potential. To date, this is the first study on allergic dermatitis in donkeys in Brazil. An allergy to bites from Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) occurs because of a hypersensitivity reaction caused by the inoculation of insect salivary antigens during the bite, resulting in immune-mediated dermatitis. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have focused on allergic dermatitis in donkeys in Brazil. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinicopathological, and therapeutic aspects of allergic dermatitis in donkeys and to identify the insects involved in its epidemiology. This study reported the occurrence of dermatitis in 17 animals. The clinical signs were restlessness and severe itching. Skin lesions were found on the head, depigmented areas of the muzzle and cheeks, flanks, pelvic and thoracic limbs, and the scrotal sac. The lesions were characterized by areas of alopecia with crusts accompanied by serosanguineous exudates. Histologically, the lesions were characterized as moderate superficial dermatitis with irregular epidermal acanthosis and pronounced diffuse orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis. In total, 378 Culicoides specimens were collected, with Culicoides ocumarensis Ortiz being the most abundant species. The combined application of copaiba oil and a multivitamin emulsion exhibited potential for topical treatment of allergic dermatitis caused by insect bites in donkeys. Our study revealed an association between allergic dermatitis in donkeys and Culicoides.

AB  - The first part of our research focuses on the analysis of animal remains (>6000 identified specimens, NISP) from the Middle La Tene central settlement Haselbach in Lower Austria, one of the largest investigated archaeozoological assemblages of present-day Austria. Based on the age and sex profiles, the faunal assemblage from Haselbach shows characteristics of urbanization and centralization and bears striking similarities to the archaeozoological material of the central settlement of Roseldorf (Lower Austria), some 35 km northwest of Haselbach. The second part of our research discusses the historical and regional context of the archaeozoological results from Haselbach and compares them with other sites, based on a detailed review of published archaeozoological data from the La Tene period (c. 450 BC to the end of the first century BC). In total, 55 faunal assemblages from 46 sites in nine countries in Central Europe, representing different types of sites (lowland settlements, hilltop settlements, central settlements, oppida, assemblages of ritual activity, and mining sites) were examined. The synthesis of the archaeozoological data exhibits different husbandry strategies and suggests major changes, especially during the Middle La Tene period indicating agricultural intensification. The differences in the biological profiles of the major domesticated species are of crucial importance to better understand aspects of socio-economic organization; especially in the case of cattle, age and sex profiles are used to distinguish different patterns of cattle husbandry. Finally, morphometric and recent genetic analyses on cattle bones and teeth from La Tene sites in Central Europe provide new insights into the complex socio-economic behavior as well as longdistance networks, involving animal supply and mobility in an exciting period of change involving centralization and increasing influence from the South during the pre-Roman late Iron Age.

AB  - Exercise is shown to improve cognitive function in various human and animal studies. Laboratory mice are often used as a model to study the effects of physical activity and running wheels provide a voluntary and non-stressful form of exercise. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the cognitive state of a mouse is related to its wheel-running behavior. Twenty-two male C57BL/6NCrl mice (9.5 weeks old) were used in the study. The cognitive function of group-housed mice (n = 5-6/group) was first analyzed in the IntelliCage system followed by individual phenotyping with the PhenoMaster with access to a voluntary running wheel. The mice were divided into three groups according to their running wheel activity: low, average, and high runners. The learning trials in the IntelliCage showed that the high-runner mice exhibited a higher error rate at the beginning of learning trials but improved their outcome and learning performance more compared to the other groups. The high-runner mice ate more compared to the other groups in the PhenoMaster analyses. There were no differences in the corticosterone levels between the groups, indicating similar stress responses. Our results demonstrate that high-runner mice exhibit enhanced learning capabilities prior to access to voluntary running wheels. In addition, our results also show that individual mice react differently when introduced to running wheels, which should be taken into consideration when choosing animals for voluntary endurance exercise studies.

AB  - The behavior of a cell is strongly influenced by the physical properties and stimuli in its microenvironment. Furthermore, the activation and modulation of mechanotransduction pathways are involved in tissue development and homeostasis and even pathological processes. Thus, when developing materials aimed at mimicking the extracellular matrixes of healthy or pathological tissues, their mechanical features should be closely considered. In this context, nanoindentation represents a powerful technique for mechanically characterizing biological tissues and hydrogels at the cell-length scale. However, standardized experimental protocols and data analysis techniques are lacking. Here, we proposed a methodological approach based on the nanoindentation technique for quantitatively analyzing and comparing the time-dependent load relaxation responses of soft biological tissues and hydrogels. As this was an explanatory study, stress-relaxation nanoindentation tests were performed on samples of pig and human lung tissues and of a specific gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to quantify and compare their viscoelastic properties. The proposed method allowed for identifying the characteristic parameters needed for describing the behavior of each sample, permitting us to quantitatively compare their mechanical behaviors. All samples showed load relaxation at a defined indentation depth because of their intrinsic viscoelastic behaviors, and the GelMA samples showed the highest relaxation capabilities. The distribution of the characterization parameters showed that the biological samples presented similar time-dependent responses, while differences were observed in the GelMA samples. Overall, the proposed methodological approach allows for providing key insights into the time-dependent behaviors of soft biological tissues and hydrogels at the cell-length scale in view of supporting tissue engineering and pathophysiological investigations.

AB  - Despite the widespread adoption of wastewater surveillance, more research is needed to understand the fate and transport of viral genetic markers in wastewater. This information is essential for optimizing monitoring strategies and interpreting wastewater surveillance data. In this study, we examined the solid-liquid partitioning behavior of four viruses in wastewater: SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and F+ coliphage/MS2. We used two approaches: (1) laboratory partitioning experiments using lab-grown viruses and (2) distribution experiments using endogenous viruses in raw wastewater. Partition experiments were conducted at 4 and 22 degrees C. Wastewater samples were spiked with varying concentrations of each virus, solids and liquids were separated via centrifugation, and viral RNA concentrations were quantified using reverse-transcription-digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR). For the distribution experiments, wastewater samples were collected from six wastewater treatment plants and processed without spiking exogenous viruses; viral RNA concentrations were measured in wastewater solids and liquids. In both experiments, RNA concentrations were higher in the solid fraction than the liquid fraction by approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude. Partition coefficients (K-F) ranged from 2000-270,000 mL.g(-1) across viruses and temperature conditions. Distribution coefficients (K-d) were consistent with results from partitioning experiments. Further research is needed to understand how virus and wastewater characteristics might influence the partitioning of viral genetic markers in wastewater.

AB  - Much less is known about temporal trendsof PFASs in toppredators that range across the North Pacific Ocean. This study reportsdecreasing trends in PFAS concentrations in the eggs of 4 seabirdspecies sampled along a nearshore-offshore gradient.
   Whether perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkylcarboxylates(PFCAs) are responding to legislative restrictions and showing decreasingtrends in top marine predators that range across the eastern NorthPacific Ocean is unclear. Here, we examined longer-term temporal trends(1973-2019) of 4 PFSAs and 13 PFCAs, as well stable isotopesof & delta;C-13 and & delta;N-15, in the eggs of4 seabird species sampled along a nearshore-offshore gradient; double-crestedcormorants (Nannopterum auritum), pelagiccormorants (Urile pelagicus), rhinocerosauklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), andLeach's storm-petrels (Hydrobates leucorhous) from the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Canada. PFOS was themost abundant PFSA (79-94%) detected in all eggs regardlessof colony and year, with the highest concentrations, on average, measuredin auklet eggs (mean = 58 ng g(-1), range = 11-286ng g(-1) ww). Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA) andperfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTriDA) were the dominant long-chain PFCAs(& GE;30% combined). The majority of PFSAs (including PFOS) arestatistically declining (p < 0.001) in the eggsof all 4 species with PFOS half-lives ranging from 2.6 to 7.8 years.Concentrations of long-chain PFCAs exhibited a trajectory comprisedof linear increases and second-order declines, suggesting that therate of uptake of PFCAs is slowing or leveling off. These trends areconsistent with the voluntarily ceased production of PFSAs by 3M circa2000-2003 and are among the first from the northeast Pacificto indicate a positive response to several regulations and restrictionson PFCAs from facility emissions and product content.

AB  - The NSL complex is a transcriptional activator. Germline-specific knockdown of NSL complex subunits NSL1, NSL2, and NSL3 results in reduced piRNA production from a subset of bidirectional piRNA clusters, accompanied by widespread transposon derepression. The piRNAs most transcriptionally affected by NSL2 and NSL1 RNAi map to telomeric piRNA clusters. At the chromatin level, these piRNA clusters also show decreased levels of H3K9me3, HP1a, and Rhino after NSL2 depletion. Using NSL2 ChIP-seq in ovaries, we found that this protein specifically binds promoters of telomeric transposons HeT-A, TAHRE, and TART. Germline-specific depletion of NSL2 also led to a reduction in nuclear Piwi in nurse cells. Our findings thereby support a role for the NSL complex in promoting the transcription of piRNA precursors from telomeric piRNA clusters and in regulating Piwi levels in the Drosophila female germline.

AB  - The hippocampus plays a central role in long-term memory formation, and different hippocampal network states are thought to have different functions in this process. These network states are controlled by neuromodulatory inputs, including the cholinergic input from the medial septum. Here, we used optogenetic stimulation of septal cholinergic neurons to understand how cholinergic activity affects different stages of spatial memory formation in a reward-based navigation task in mice. We found that optogenetic stimulation of septal cholinergic neurons (1) impaired memory formation when activated at goal location but not during navigation, (2) reduced sharp wave ripple (SWR) incidence at goal location, and (3) reduced SWR incidence and enhanced theta-gamma oscillations during sleep. These results underscore the importance of appropriate timing of cholinergic input in long-term memory formation, which might help explain the limited success of cholinesterase inhibitor drugs in treating memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Rapid adenosine signaling has been detected spontaneously or after mechanical stimulation in the brain, providing rapid neuromodulation in a local area. To measure rapid adenosine signaling, a single carbon-fiber microelectrode has traditionally been used, which limits spatial resolution and an understanding of regional coordination. In this study, we utilized dual-channel fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure the spontaneous or mechanically stimulated adenosine release at two electrodes placed at different spacings in hippocampal CA1 mouse brain slices. For mechanically stimulated adenosine release, adenosine can be detected up to 150 mu m away from where it was stimulated, although the signal is smaller and delayed. While spontaneous adenosine transients were detected at both electrodes, only 10 percent of the events were detected concurrently, and that number was similar at 50 and 200 mu m electrode spacings. Thus, most adenosine transients were not caused by the widespread coordination of release. There was no evidence of diffusion of spontaneous transients to a second electrode 50-200 mu m away. This study shows that spontaneous adenosine events are very localized and thus provide only local neuromodulation. Injury, such as mechanical stimulation, allows adenosine to diffuse farther, but the neuroprotective effects are still regional. These results provide a better understanding of the spatial and temporal profiles of adenosine available to act at receptors, which is crucial for future studies that design neuroprotective treatments based on rapid adenosine signaling.

AB  - The molecular regulation mechanisms for maintaining the homeostasis of mesenchymal stem cells still remains poorly defined. Antler reserve mesenchymal cells (RM cells) persist through the whole rapid antler growth stage as a reserved stem cell population capable of division and differentiation, that makes the RM cells a unique model in stem cell regulation and cancer mechanism studies. Herein, we sequenced and analyzed the extracellular vesicles (EVs) of RM cells in the growth center of antler, and identified a high expression level of miR-143-3p and its target genes IGF1R, TGF(31, BMP2, etc. The upstream positive regulatory factor PRRX1 of miR-143-3p was identified through ATAC and CUT-taq analysis, combined with dual luciferase assay. We showed that PRRX1 overexpression resulted in a decreased proliferation of RM cells and induced a higher expression of miR-143-3p. miR-143-3p enriched EVs derived from PRRX1 overexpression RM cells had an inhibitory effect on RM cells, osteosarcoma 143B cells (considered as excessive proliferation model for RM cells) and in vivo in osteosarcoma bearing mice, and the mRNA and protein levels of IGF1R were significantly reduced. We confirmed that miR143-3p enriched EVs inhibited 3D culture induced chondrogenic differentiation of RM cells and xenogeneic antler chondrogenesis through targeting TGF(31 and BMP2. Together, PRRX1 was identified as an activator of miR-143-3p, and higher amounts of miR-143-3p in EVs of RM cells could inhibit excessive proliferation, and help maintain the undifferentiated state of RM cells. We conclude that PRRX1/miR-143-3p signaling was a regulator of homeostasis of antler RM cells and was a potential regulator of osteosarcoma. Our findings are essential for advancing medical and biological sciences, providing new theoretical foundations and strategies for cancer treatment and tissue regeneration.

AB  - As the amygdala is associated with fear and anxiety, it is important to determine the potential effects of gestational stressors on behavior and stress responses in offspring. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of prenatal transportation stress on amygdala gene expression in 25-day-old Brahman calves, focusing on sex-specific differences. Amygdala tissue samples from prenatally stressed (PNS) and control bull and heifer calves were analyzed using RNA sequencing. A thorough outlier detection process, utilizing visual inspection of multidimensional scaling plots, robust principal component analysis, and PCAGrid methods, led to the exclusion of 5 of 32 samples from subsequent analyses. Differential expression analysis revealed no significant treatment differences between the control and PNS groups within either sex. However, sex-specific differences in gene expression were identified in both the control and PNS groups. The control group showed seven differentially expressed genes between sexes, while ten were identified between PNS males and females, with seven located on the X chromosome. Among these was the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked gene, which plays a role in neurodevelopmental pathways. When comparing males to females, regardless of treatment, a total of 58 genes were differentially expressed, with 45 showing increased expression in females. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that many differentially expressed genes are associated with infectious disease-related pathways. Future research should explore amygdala size and functional responses to various postnatal stimuli.

AB  - The neuroinflammatory process characterizing multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with changes in excitatory synaptic transmission and altered central concentrations of the primary excitatory amino acid, L-glutamate (L-Glu). Recent findings report that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of L-Glu positively correlate with pro-inflammatory cytokines in MS patients. However, to date, there is no evidence about the relationship between the other primary excitatory amino acid, L-aspartate (L-Asp), its derivative D-enantiomer, D-aspartate, and the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the CSF of MS. In the present study, we measured by HPLC the levels of these amino acids in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord of mice affected by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Interestingly, in support of glutamatergic neurotransmission abnormalities in neuroinflammatory conditions, we showed reduced L-Asp levels in the cortex and spinal cord of EAE mice and increased D-aspartate/total aspartate ratio within the cerebellum and spinal cord of these animals. Additionally, we found significantly decreased CSF levels of L-Asp in both relapsing-remitting (n = 157) MS (RR-MS) and secondary progressive/primary progressive (n = 22) (SP/PP-MS) patients, compared to control subjects with other neurological diseases (n = 40). Importantly, in RR-MS patients, L-Asp levels were correlated with the CSF concentrations of the inflammatory biomarkers G-CSF, IL-1ra, MIP-1 beta, and Eotaxin, indicating that the central content of this excitatory amino acid, as previously reported for L-Glu, reflects a neuroinflammatory environment in MS. In keeping with this, we revealed that CSF L-Asp levels were positively correlated with those of L-Glu, highlighting the convergent variation of these two excitatory amino acids under inflammatory synaptopathy occurring in MS.

AB  - Background: An over-the-counter vasoconstrictive nasal solution with oxymetazoline (NS-OXY, 0.05%) has the potential to be used as a dental pulpal hemostatic medicament. A molecular engineering approach examined NS-OXY and its molecular constituent's antimicrobial and blood biomass removal efficacy. Methods: An ex vivo cavity model was developed where standardized prepared teeth were exposed overnight to a model dentinal caries pathogen, S. mutans, and then exposed to sheep's blood for 10 min, which simulated a pulpal exposure. Cavity preparations were rinsed with OXY (0.05%), benzalkonium chloride (BKC-0.025%), NS-OXY (with OXY-0.05% and BKC), ferric sulfate (20%;ViscoStat, FS), and distilled water (DI). For examining the bactericidal effect of NS-OXY, a disk diffusion antimicrobial assay was used where S. mutans was grown (20 h) on brain heart infusion (BHI) w/0.5% glucose agar plates and exposed to the treatment groups. Results: NS-OXY-treated samples had a lower residual bacterial or blood biomass than FS (p = 0.003). The diffusion test showed that NS-OXY, BKC, and FS had zones of inhibition greater than 10 mm, with NS-OXY having higher activity against S. mutans than FS (p = 0.0002), but lower than BKC (p = 0.0082). Conclusions: NS-OXY may be considered as a dental hemostatic agent after traumatic and carious pulpal exposure owing to NS-OXY's antimicrobial and vasoconstrictive properties.

AB  - Background: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is acute and unexplained. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine in several inflammatory diseases. However, its role in SSNHL remains elusive.
   Methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce the inflammatory response of murine auditory cells, HEI-OC1. Silencing of MIF in HEI-OC1 cells was achieved by transfection of short hairpin RNA against MIF. 740Y-P and IMD0354 were used to stimulate the PI3K pathway and suppress the NF-kappa B pathway, respectively. RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to examine MIF and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression in LPS-treated HEI-OC1 cells. ELISA was employed to assess prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations.
   Results: MIF was upregulated in LPS-treated HEI-OC1 cells. MIF knockdown reduced PGE2 synthesis and COX2 expression in LPS-treated HEI-OC1 cells. Moreover, MIF knockdown suppressed activation of the PI3K/AKT and NF-kappa B pathway in LPS-treated HEI-OC1 cells. Additionally, inhibition of MIF decreased PGE2 production and COX2 expression via inactivation of the NF-kappa B pathway.
   Conclusion: Inhibition of MIF alleviated LPS-induced inflammation in HEI-OC1 cells via inactivating the NF-kappa B signaling, which might provide a better understanding for SSNHL development.

AB  - MiR-125b has therapeutic potential in the amelioration of myocardial ischemic injury. MicroRNA isomiRs, with either 5 ' or 3 ' addition or deletion of nucleotide(s), have been reported from next-generation sequencing data (NGS). However, due to technical challenges, validation and functional studies of isomiRs are few. In this study, we discovered using NGS, four 3 ' isomiRs of miR-125b, i.e., addition of A (adenosine), along with deletions of A, AG (guanosine) and AGU (uridine) from rat and sheep heart. These findings were validated using RT-qPCR. Comprehensive functional studies were carried out in the H9C2 hypoxia model. After miR-125b, isomiRs of Plus A, Trim A, AG and AGU mimic transfection, the H9C2 cells were subjected to hypoxic challenge. As assessed using cell viability, apoptosis, CCK-8 and LDH release, miR-125b and isomiRs were all protective against hypoxia. However, Plus A and Trim A were more effective than miR-125b, whilst Trim AG and Trim AGU had far weaker effects than miR-125b. Interestingly, both the gene regulation profile and apoptotic gene validation indicated a major overlap among miR-125b, Plus A and Trim A, whilst Trims AG and AGU revealed a different profile compared to miR-125b. Conclusions: miR-125b and its 3 ' isomiRs are expressed stably in the heart. miR-125b and isomiRs with addition or deletion of A might function concurrently and concordantly under specific physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In-depth understanding of isomiRs' metabolism and function will contribute to better miRNA therapeutic drug design.

AB  - Long-term memory formation requires de novo RNA and protein synthesis. Using differential display PCR, we found that the NCoR1 cDNA fragment is differentially expressed between fast learners and slow learners, with fast learners showing a lower expression level than slow learners in the water maze learning task. Fast learners also show lower NCoR1 mRNA and protein expression levels. In addition, spatial training decreases both NCoR1 mRNA and protein expression, whereas NCoR1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice show enhanced spatial memory. In studying the molecular mechanism, we found that spatial training decreases the association between NCoR1 and DEC2. Both NCoR1 and DEC2 suppress the expression of BDNF, integrin alpha 3 and SGK1 through C/EBP alpha binding to their DNA promoters, but overexpression of DEC2 in NCoR1 cKO mice rescues the decreased expression of these proteins compared with NCoR1 loxP mice overexpressing DEC2. Further, spatial training decreases DEC2 expression. Spatial training also enhances C/EBP alpha binding to Bdnf, Itga3 and Sgk1 promoters, an effect also observed in fast learners, and both NCoR1 and DEC2 control C/EBP alpha activity. Whereas knockdown of BDNF, integrin alpha 3 or SGK1 expression impairs spatial learning and memory, it does not affect Y-maze performance, suggesting that BDNF, integrin alpha 3 and SGK1 are involved in long-term memory formation, but not short-term memory formation. Moreover, NCoR1 expression is regulated by the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings identify DEC2 as a novel interacting protein of NCoR1 and elucidate the novel roles and mechanisms of NCoR1 and DEC2 in negative regulation of spatial memory formation.

AB  - This paper explores and identifies commonalities among recent Digital Twin (DT) technology definitions. additionally, it introduces a framework for a digital twin of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) focusing on English wheel manufacturing as its foundational context. To achieve this, two 3D simulators, namely Grasshopper and Rhino, were employed to faithfully replicate the English wheel process digitally. Subsequently, optimizing these simulators' performance paved the way for a comprehensive visualization of the English wheel using the Microsoft HoloLens. This visualization integrates digital and physical interactions, resulting in a mixed reality environment. The ultimate goal of this research is to enable a bi-directional collaboration within the digital representation of the English wheel, bridging the gap between the virtual and physical realms.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurological illness that causes considerable cognitive impairment. However, there is no effective treatment for this disease. Therefore, the current study aimed at investigating the long-term effects of fluoxetine and memantine on biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease in scopolamine-induced mice. In this study, adult female mice were divided into four equal groups; normal control received distilled water only, the untreated Alzheimer's disease group received scopolamine intraperitoneal IP/SCM for 14 days, following which distilled water was given for six months, the memantine-treated Alzheimer's disease group received IP/SCM for 14 days then memantine hydrochloride for 6 months, the fluoxetine-treated Alzheimer's disease group received IP/SCM for 14 days then fluoxetine hydrochloride for 6 months. The results show that after 2 weeks of induction the mean level of amyloid (3 and MDA were significantly elevated, while the mean level of BDNF and TAS were significantly reduced in comparison with the normal control group. After 3 months, both treatments (memantine and fluoxetine) caused a highly significant decrease in the mean levels of amyloid (3 and malondialdehyde as well as an increase in the mean levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor and total antioxidant status in Alzheimer's disease treated mice in comparison with Alzheimer's disease untreated mice. However, after 6 months of treatment, the effects of fluoxetine were more significant than those of memantine. In conclusion, fluoxetine has significant effects on biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease and these effects are time-dependent as well as more significant than those of memantine, which suggests the potential usefulness of the former in treatment of this disease.

AB  - Simple Summary In this paper, we present the zooarchaeological and taphonomic study of a new Bronze Age site in the inland of the Iberian Peninsula. This study represents a significant contribution within the studied area, as it analyses the Pista de Motos faunal collection, one of the few representative samples from this period. This paper significantly contributes to completing the scarce information available for the Bronze Archaeology in the Middle Tagus Valley, located inland of the Iberian Peninsula.Abstract The Bronze Age zooarchaeological research for the interior and other regions of the Iberian Peninsula is currently limited. Despite several sites with known zooarchaeological profiles from the period, the main issue is that most of these derive from fragmentary and unrepresentative faunal records or are biased profiles from old excavations. New work has yielded novel zooarchaeological results in recent years that could help fill the existing zooarchaeological information gap in the Iberian inland, particularly in the Middle Tagus Valley. However, these projects are in the initial research stages and have not published much of their results. This paper presents the zooarchaeological profile of the Pista de Motos Bronze Age site to help fill this information gap. It analyses the taxonomic representation, skeletal profiles, and human activity patterns associated with faunal use. These observations suggest that animal exploitation at the site followed two primary purposes. One was linked to economic activities, mainly to obtain meat, milk, wool, or animal labour. The other was probably associated with symbolic-ritual practices suggested by the complete animal burials in some excavated units. We contextualise these interpretations with evidence from other Bronze Age sites in the Middle Tagus Valley. Finally, the paper assesses to what extent Pista de Motos is a relevant site for the zooarchaeology of the Bronze Age in the Iberian inland.

AB  - Norepinephrine plays an important role in modulating memory through its beta-adrenergic receptors (Adr & beta;: & beta;(1), & beta;(2) and & beta;(3)). Here, we hypothesized that multisensory stimulation would reverse memory impairment caused by the inactivation of Adr & beta;(3) (Adr & beta;3KO) with consequent inhibition of sustained glial-mediated inflammation. To test this, 21- and 86-day-old Adr & beta;3KO mice were exposed to an 8-week multisensory stimulation (MS) protocol that comprised gustatory and olfactory stimuli of positive and negative valence; intellectual challenges to reach food; the use of hidden objects; and the presentation of food in ways that prompted foraging, which was followed by analysis of GFAP, Iba-1 and EAAT2 protein expression in the hippocampus (HC) and amygdala (AMY). The MS protocol reduced GFAP and Iba-1 expression in the HC of young mice but not in older mice. While this protocol restored memory impairment when applied to Adr & beta;3KO animals immediately after weaning, it had no effect when applied to adult animals. In fact, we observed that aging worsened the memory of Adr & beta;3KO mice. In the AMY of Adr & beta;3KO older mice, we observed an increase in GFAP and EAAT2 expression when compared to wild-type (WT) mice that MS was unable to reduce. These results suggest that a richer and more diverse environment helps to correct memory impairment when applied immediately after weaning in Adr & beta;3KO animals and indicates that the control of neuroinflammation mediates this response.

AB  - Sensitivity for rewarding cues and distress signals from children is fundamental to human caregiving and modulated by the neuropeptide oxytocin. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated whether oxytocin regulates neural responses to reward or distress cues form children. In a placebo-controlled, within-subject design, we measured neural responses to positive, negative, and neutral cues from children in 22 healthy female subjects who received oxytocin (24 IU) versus placebo. Further, based on current literature, we hypothesized that oxytocin effects are modulated by experiences of childhood trauma. The task elicited valence-specific effects-positive images activated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, and right putamen, and images of children in distress activated the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, and right medial superior frontal cortex. The effects of oxytocin depended on subjective reports of childhood emotional neglect. Self-reported neglect interacted with oxytocin administration in the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal areas. In individuals with higher scores of emotional neglect, oxytocin increased neural reactivity of limbic structures to positive and neutral images. Our findings need replication in larger samples and can therefore be considered preliminary but are in line with the recent literature on the modulating effect of childhood adversity on the sensitivity to oxytocin administration.

AB  - Major depression is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder that poses a significant challenge to health. However, development of an effective therapy for the disease has long been difficult. Here, we investigate the efficacy of a novel combinatorial treatment employing sub-effective doses of Ro25-6981, an antagonist targeting GluN2Bcontaining NMDA receptors, in conjunction with ZL006, an inhibitor of the PSD95/nNOS, on mouse models of depression. We employed social isolation, chronic restraint stress, or a combination of both to establish a depressed mouse model. Treatment with the drug combination reduced depressive-like behaviors without affecting locomotor activity in mice subjected to social isolation or chronic restraint stress. Furthermore, the combination therapy ameliorated depressive-like behaviors induced by combined stress of chronic restraint followed by social isolation. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combined treatment downregulated the hippocampal nitric oxide level. However, the therapeutic benefits of this combination were negated by the activation of NMDA receptors with a low dose of NMDA or by increasing nitric oxide levels with L-arginine. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment had negligible effects on object memory and contextual fear memory. Our data establish a combined therapy paradigm, providing a potential strategy targeting major depression.

AB  - ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is intricately linked with infections. Toll-like receptors (TLR) provide a potential link between infection and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) autoimmunity. TLR9 ligation has been shown to promote anti-MPO autoimmunity and glomerular vasculitis in murine MPO-AAV. This study investigates dendritic cell TLR9 ligation in murine experimental anti-MPO glomerulonephritis. We analyzed autoimmune responses to MPO following transfer of TLR9 stimulated, MPO pulsed dendritic cells and kidney injury following a sub-nephritogenic dose of sheep anti-mouse glomerular basement membrane globulin. TLR9 ligation enhanced dendritic cell activation upregulating CD40 and CD80 expression, promoting systemic anti-MPO autoimmunity and T cell recall responses and exacerbating kidney injury. CD40 upregulation by TLR9 was critical for the induction of nephritogenic autoimmunity. The presence of DEC205, which transports the TLR9 ligand to TLR9 located in the endosome, also promoted kidney injury. This confirms TLR9 mediated dendritic cell activation as a mechanism of anti-MPO autoimmunity in AAV and further defines the link between infection and the generation of MPO specific autoimmune inflammation.

AB  - Simple Summary: A common method of alleviating impending threats to wildlife populations is to relocate them from danger, which is known as mitigation translocation. However, these translocations have high failure rates because they lack appropriate funding, resources, and a knowledge of species requirements. Here, we use the endangered western spiny-tailed skink (Egernia stokesii badia) as a case study to exemplify how targeted ecological research can be used to help inform translocation planning. We found that the skinks have specific requirements for predator management, foraging and prey availability, and log pile structures, which can all help improve the targeted selection of translocation sites in the future. Application of a similar scientific framework to planning is likely to improve mitigation translocation success for a range of threatened species.
   Translocation science has made considerable progress over the last two decades; however, reptile translocations still frequently fail around the world. Major knowledge gaps surround the basic ecology of reptile species, including basic factors such as habitat preference, which have a critical influence on translocation success. The western spiny-tailed skink (Egernia stokesii badia) is used here as a case study to exemplify how empirical research can directly inform on-ground management and future translocation planning. A combination of studies, including LiDAR scanning of microhabitat structures, camera trapping, plasticine replica model experiments and unbounded point count surveys to assess predation risk, and visual and DNA analysis of dietary requirements, were all used to better understand the ecological requirements of E. s. badia. We found that the skinks have specific log pile requirements, both native and non-native predator management requirements, and a largely herbivorous, broad diet, which all influence translocation site selection and management planning. The use of E. s. badia as an Australian case study provides a clear strategic framework for the targeted research of meaningful ecological factors that influence translocation decision-making. Similar approaches applied to other reptile species are likely to fundamentally increase the capacity for effective management, and the likelihood of future successful translocations.

AB  - Haifa Bay Area (HBA) contains Israel's principal industrial area, and there are substantial public concerns about health effects from its emissions. We aimed to examine associations between exposure to air pollution from HBA industrial area with prevalent asthma and other atopic diseases at age 17. This is a cross-sectional study. The study population included all adolescents born in Israel and whose medical status was evaluated for mandatory military recruitment by the Israeli medical corps during 1967-2017. We analyzed prevalent asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and rhinoconjunctivitis. We estimated exposure to industrial air pollution by a kriging interpolation of historical SO2 observations and adjusted the associations to the year of birth, SES, school orientation, and traffic pollution. The study population included n = 2,523,745 adolescents, among which 5.9% had prevalent asthma and 4.6% had allergic rhinitis. Residency in HBA was associated with a higher adjusted risk of asthma, compared with non-HBA residency. Still, this association was limited to the three lowest exposure categories, while the highest exposure group had the lowest adjusted risk. Sensitivity analyses and other atopic diseases presented similar results. These results do not provide support for causal relationships between HBA industry-related emissions and prevalent atopic diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a representative neurodegenerative disease characterized by the structural and functional degeneration of neurons. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of Ixeris dentata (ID) extract on trimethyltin (TMT)-induced memory deficit in the rat. Cognitive improving effect and neuronal activity of ID were assessed by using Morris water maze (MWM) test and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) immunohistochemistry. Seven days after TMT injection (8.0 mg/kg, i.p.), each group of rats was administered saline, water extract of ID (WID, 400 or 800 mg/kg, p.o.), ethanol extract of ID (EID, 400 or 800 mg/kg, p.o.), or caffeic acid (CAF, 30 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for fourteen days. Results: Treatment with EID and CAF produced a significant improvement in escape latency time of the acquisition, and retention time in the target area of the MWM task. Additionally, administration of EID or CAF markedly alleviated TMT-induced loss of ChAT- and CREB-immunoreactive cells in the hippocampus. The results demonstrated that EID has a protective effect against TMT-induced memory deficit, partly through increasing the CREB and cholinergic signaling pathway in the hippocampus. These results suggest that ethanol extracts of ID might be useful for improving cognitive functions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Fodder production in arid rangelands has been traditionally considered as the main source of nutrition for livestock. However, the production of these fodder may be influenced by some socioeconomic and climatic factors. This study aims to identify the various rangeland use forms and determine the types of livestock feeding system in the El Ouara rangelands of Ben guarden District in southern Tunisia by analysing the importance of supplemental feeding and main determinants of this practice. Data were collected by a survey that targeted a sample of 50 breeders in the El Ouara rangelands. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the data. The results showed that there are two types of association practiced for breeders:"Cherka" association practiced by 10.00% of breeders and cash payment association practiced by 53.00% of breeders. Then, transhumance, sedentary, and semi-urban forms are the main ways in which breeders use the rangeland. There are four livestock feeding systems in the El Ouara rangelands being used to feed livestock: natural rangeland, rangeland-based, mixed, and concentrate-based feeding systems. Supplemental feeding has become fundamental for the livestock feeding system in the El Ouara rangelands. The breeders with the largest camel size still use the natural rangeland feeding system, while the breeders who have the largest herd size practice the mixed feeding system. The logistic regression results reveal that breeder age, cereal area, herd size, migrant remittance, second activity, and agricultural development group membership can significantly impact the supplemental feeding. In summary, this study can help policy-makers plan innovative practices based on climatic change, ensure the sustainability of livestock feeding system, and make effective decisions for local development.

AB  - The steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein principally mediates steroid hormone biosynthesis by gov-erning the transport of intramitochondrial cholesterol. Neurosteroids progressively decrease during aging, the key risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is triggered by brain-region specific accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) precursor protein (APP), a key pathological factor. We demonstrate that hippocampal neuronal cells overexpressing wild-type (WtAPP) and mutant APP (mAPP) plasmids, conditions mimetic to AD, resulted in decreases in StAR mRNA, free cholesterol, and pregnenolone levels. The magnitude of suppression of the steroidogenic response was more pronounced with mAPP than that of WtAPP. While mAPP-waned assorted anomalies correlate to AD pathology, deterioration of APP/A beta laden StAR expression and neurosteroid biosyn-thesis was enhanced by retinoid signaling. An abundance of mitochondrially targeted StAR expression partially restored APP/A beta accumulated diverse neurodegenerative vulnerabilities. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that overexpression of StAR diminishes mAPP provoked A beta aggregation. Co-expression of StAR and mAPP in hippocampal neurons substantially reversed the declines in mAPP mediated cell survival, mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, and ATP production. Concurrently, induction of mAPP induced A beta loading showed an increase in cholesterol esters, but decrease in free cholesterol, concomitant with pregnenolone biosynthesis, events that were inversely regulated by StAR. Moreover, retinoid signaling was found to augment cholesterol content for facilitating neurosteroid biosynthesis in an AD mimetic condition. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular events by which StAR acts to protect mAPP-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurosteroidogenesis, and these measures are fundamental for ameliorating and/or delaying dementia in individuals with AD.

AB  - Astrocytic receptors influence cognitive function and can promote behavioral deficits in disease. These effects may vary based on variables such as biological sex, but it is not known if the effects of astrocytic receptors are dependent on sex. We leveraged in vivo gene editing and chemogenetics to examine the roles of astrocytic receptors in spatial memory and other processes. We show that reductions in metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), the main astrocytic glutamate receptor in adults, impair memory in females but enhance memory in males. Similarly, increases in astrocytic mGluR3 levels have sex -dependent effects and enhance memory in females. mGluR3 manipulations also alter spatial search strategies during recall in a sex -specific manner. In addition, acute chemogenetic stimulation of G i/o -coupled or G s -coupled receptors in hippocampal astrocytes induces bidirectional and sex -dimorphic effects on memory. Thus, astrocytes are sex -dependent modulators of cognitive function and may promote sex differences in aging and disease.

AB  - The lectin TFF2 belongs to the trefoil factor family (TFF). This polypeptide is typically co-secreted with the mucin MUC6 from gastric mucous neck cells, antral gland cells, and duodenal Brunner glands. Here, TFF2 fulfills a protective function by forming a high-molecular-mass complex with the MUC6, physically stabilizing the mucus barrier. In pigs and mice, and slightly in humans, TFF2 is also synthesized in the pancreas. Here, we investigated the murine stomach, pancreas, and duodenum by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and proteomics and identified different forms of Tff2. In both the stomach and duodenum, the predominant form is a high-molecular-mass complex with Muc6, whereas, in the pancreas, only low-molecular-mass monomeric Tff2 was detectable. We also investigated the expression of Tff2 and other selected genes in the stomach, pancreas, and the proximal, medial, and distal duodenum (RT-PCR analysis). The absence of the Tff2/Muc6 complex in the pancreas is due to a lack of Muc6. Based on its known motogenic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects, we propose a protective receptor-mediated function of monomeric Tff2 for the pancreatic ductal epithelium. This view is supported by a report that a loss of Tff2 promotes the formation of pancreatic intraductal mucinous neoplasms.

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies have revealed that PM2.5 plays a role in regulating iron metabolism and redox homeostasis in the brain, which is closely associated with ferroptosis. In this study, the role and underlying mechanism of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced neurotoxicity were investigated in mice, primary hippocampal neurons, and HT22 cells. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to PM2.5 could induce abnormal behaviors, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss in the hippocampus of mice. These effects may be attributed to ferroptosis induced by PM2.5 exposure in hippocampal neurons. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the upregulation of iron metabolism -related protein Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO -1) and the activation of mitophagy might play key roles in PM2.5-induced ferroptosis in HT22 cells. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that PM2.5 exposure significantly upregulated HO -1 in primary hippocampal neurons and HT22 cells. Moreover, PM2.5 exposure activated mitophagy in HT22 cells, leading to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, alterations in the expression of autophagy-related proteins LC3, P62, and mTOR, as well as an increase in mitophagy-related protein PINK1 and PARKIN. As a heme-degradation enzyme, the upregulation of HO -1 promotes the release of excess iron, genetically inhibiting the upregulation of HO -1 in HT22 cells could prevent both PM2.5-induced mitophagy and ferroptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mitophagy in HT22 cells reduced levels of ferrous ions and lipid peroxides, thereby preventing ferroptosis. Collectively, this study demonstrates that HO -1 mediates PM2.5-induced mitophagy-dependent ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons, and inhibiting mitophagy or ferroptosis may be a key therapeutic target to ameliorate neurotoxicity following PM2.5 exposure.

AB  - Rab40c is a SOCS box-containing protein which binds Cullin5 to form a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (Rab40c/CRL5) to regulate protein ubiquitylation. However, the exact functions of Rab40c remain to be determined, and what proteins are the targets of Rab40c-Cullin5-mediated ubiquitylation in mammalian cells are unknown. Here we showed that in migrating MDA-MB-231 cells Rab40c regulates focal adhesion's number, size, and distribution. Mechanistically, we found that Rab40c binds the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex and ubiquitylates one of its subunits, ankyrin repeat domain 28 (ANKRD28), thus leading to its lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, we identified that phosphorylation of FAK and MOB1 is decreased in Rab40c knock-out cells, which may contribute to focal adhesion site regulation by Rab40c. Thus, we propose a model where Rab40c/CRL5 regulates ANKRD28 ubiquitylation and degradation, leading to a decrease in PP6 activity, which ultimately affects FAK and Hippo pathway signaling to alter focal adhesion dynamics.

AB  - Removal of harmful cyanobacteria is an extremely urgent task in global lake management and protection. Conventional measures are insufficient for simultaneously removing cyanobacteria and hazardous cyanotoxin, efficient and environmental-friendly measures are therefore particularly needed. Herbivorous protozoa have great potentials in controlling algae, however, large-sized colonial Microcystis is inedible for protozoa, which is a central problem to be solved. Therefore, in present study, a measure of protozoa grazing assisted by ultrasound was investigated in laboratory scale for eliminating harmful colonial Microcystis. The results showed that with ultrasound power and time increasing, the proportion of unicellular Microcystis increased significantly. With Ochromonas addition, approximately 80% of colonial Microcystis and microcystin was removed on day 4 under ultrasound power of 100 W for 15 min, while Ochromonas only reduced Microcystis by less than 20% without assistance of ultrasound. Moreover, when directly exposed to low-intensity ultrasound, Ochromonas showed strong resistance to ultrasound and were not inhibited in grazing Microcystis. Overall, ultrasound increases edible food for protozoa via collapsing Microcystis colonies and assists Ochromonas to remove Microcystis, thus intermittently collapsing colonial Microcystis using low-intensity ultrasound can significantly improve the removal efficiency of Microcystis by protozoa grazing, which provided a new insight in controlling harmful colonial Microcystis.

AB  - Grazing livestock contributes to pasture nitrogen (N) through urine and faeces and N losses in pasture-based livestock systems are recognized as an important consideration for sustainable land management. Knowing the frequency and quantity of excreta produced in pasture-based dairy production systems could be useful for informing best management practice. The aim of this experiment was to determine whether data from tail -mounted accelerometers could be used to classify dairy cow excretory events. Ten non-lactating Holstein dairy cows were fitted with a tail-mounted accelerometer set to record data at 1 Hz and were individually observed for 3.3-5.3 h each. The recorded behaviours were urination, defecation, standing and lying (both left and right laterality). G-force acceleration values for X, Y and Z axes were downloaded and windows of varying sizes (3-, 6-, 9-, 12-and 15 s) were used to extract a set of basic features (mean, minimum, maximum and SD) from consecutive sequences of each behaviour. Windows were stepped forward by 1 s for feature extraction and five datasets were developed. Data for all cows were compiled and a random forest algorithm was used for model development. Ten times 10-fold stratified cross-validation (SCV) was used to evaluate data from all window sizes. Sensitivity and precision always exceeded 84% for standing and lying postures in both unbalanced and balanced datasets. Classification performance for excretory events improved significantly (P < 0.01) as window size increased. Due to performance, the 15 s window was selected for further tests with a full feature set. Random forest models were developed using a leave-one-cow-out cross-validation strategy (model developed using n-1 cows and evaluated on the held-out cow). Classification performance for standing and lying remained high (sensitivity & precision >= 91 %) but performance for excretory events was poor and highly variable. SCV results for excretory events were clearly optimistic and more data are needed for further testing. However, it may also be necessary to develop and test individual animal models for comparison because there may be considerable variation between animals for excretory events.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses is a leading model to explain the concept of information storage in the brain. Multiple mechanisms contribute to LTP, but central amongst them is an increased sensitivity of the postsynaptic membrane to neurotransmitter release. This sensitivity is predominantly determined by the abundance and localization of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). A combination of AMPAR structural data, super-resolution imaging of excitatory synapses, and an abundance of electrophysiological studies are providing an ever-clearer picture of how AMPARs are recruited and organized at synaptic junctions. Here, we review the latest insights into this process, and discuss how both cytoplasmic and extracellular receptor elements cooperate to tune the AMPAR response at the hippocampal CA1 synapse.
   The efficiency of excitatory synaptic transmission can be tuned by the sensitivity of the postsynaptic response to glutamate. AMPA-type glutamate receptors possess both intracellular and extracellular domains, allowing cooperative regulation of their organization at the postsynapse during plasticity responses by both cell autonomous processes and intercellular factors. image

AB  - The paraneoplastic Ma antigen (PNMA) proteins are associated with cancer -induced paraneoplastic syndromes that present with an autoimmune response and neurological symptoms. Why PNMA proteins are associated with this severe autoimmune disease is unclear. PNMA genes are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and are ectopically expressed in some tumors. We show that PNMA2, which has been co-opted from a Ty3 retrotransposon, encodes a protein that is released from cells as non -enveloped virus -like capsids. Recombinant PNMA2 capsids injected into mice induce autoantibodies that preferentially bind external "spike"PNMA2 capsid epitopes, whereas a capsid-assembly-defective PNMA2 protein is not immunogenic. PNMA2 autoantibodies in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with anti-Ma2 paraneoplastic disease show similar preferential binding to spike capsid epitopes. PNMA2 capsid-injected mice develop learning and memory deficits. These observations suggest that PNMA2 capsids act as an extracellular antigen, capable of generating an autoimmune response that results in neurological deficits.

AB  - Millions of residents in areas with high-fluoride drinking water supply ingest excessive levels of fluoride for long periods. This study investigated the mechanisms and impacts of lifelong exposure to naturally occurring moderate-high-fluoride drinking water on spatial-memory function by studying mice in controlled experiments. Spatial-memory deficits and disorders of hippocampal neuronal electrical activity were observed in mice exposed to 25-ppm or 50-ppm-fluoride drinking water for 56 weeks, but not in adult or old mice exposed to 50 ppm fluoride for 12 weeks. Ultrastructural analysis showed severely damaged hippocampal mitochondria, evidenced by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content. Mitochondrial biogenesis was impaired in fluoride-exposed mice, manifesting as a significantly reduced mtDNA content, mtDNA-encoded subunits mtND6 and mtCO1, and respiratory complex activities. Fluoride reduced expression of Hsp22, a beneficial mediator of mitochondrial homeostasis, and decreased levels of signaling for the PGC-1 alpha/TFAM pathway-which regulates mitochondrial biogenesis-and the NF-kappa beta/STAT3 pathway-which regulates mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity. Hippocampus-specific Hsp22-overexpression improved fluoride-induced spatial-memory deficits by activating the PGC-1 alpha/TFAM and STAT3 signaling pathways, while Hsp22-silencing aggravated the deficits by inhibiting both pathways. Downregulation of Hsp22 plays a vital role in fluoride-induced spatialmemory deficits by impacting mtDNA-encoding subsets and mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia has been identified as the primary cause of global mortality, but there is currently no effective therapy for treating this condition. Consequently, the search for novel neuroprotective agents that can guard against stroke remains essential. Recent research has demonstrated the importance of alternative treatments in the pathology of cerebral ischemia leading to vascular dementia. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of neurocognitive behavior and beta-amyloid markers in terms of the neuroprotective effects of Edible Bird's Nest (EBN). Male adult Wistar rats were orally administered EBN at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg for 2 weeks prior to and 3 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery to mimic vascular dementia. The rodents were then classified based on their neurological score, beta-amyloid accumulation, volume of cerebral infarction, and acetylcholinesterase activity. We assessed the animals' spatial memory and administered the Morris water maze and radial arm maze tests. We found that EBN substantially decreased beta-amyloid in the hippocampus, decreased acetylcholinesterase activity, and enhanced the animals' neurological scores and spatial memory. We conclude that EBN contains potential substances that promote learning and memory pathways. However, additional research is still necessary to confirm these findings.

AB  - Advanced maternal age (AMA) negatively influences the development and cognitive functions of offspring. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. As hippocampal autophagy and primary cilia play a crucial role in learning and memory abilities, this study aimed to investigate the effects of AMA on hippocampal autophagy and primary cilia, and to explore their relationship with the changes of LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in offspring rats. The whole brains and hippocampus of offspring born to 12-month-old (AMA) and 3-month-old (control) Sprague-Dawley (SD) female rats were collected on post-natal days (P) 14, 28, and 60. Transmission electron microscopy was employed to count the number of autophagosomes. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to quantify gene expression, and immunofluorescence was used to measure primary cilia. The results revealed that autophagic activity was inhibited from childhood to adulthood in the AMA group. Furthermore, in the early developmental stage, primary ciliogenesis and growth in the hippocampus in the AMA group were impaired, with astrocytes being more severely affected. In addition, the AMA group exhibited an abnormal activation of the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway. Thus, in offspring born to mothers of AMA, impaired hippocampal primary ciliary function and aberrant activation of the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway are associated with inhibited autophagic activity.

AB  - This study investigates seasonal variations in the yield and composition of Bactrian camel milk under Mongolia's extensive pastoral systems. Milk samples were collected from 278 lactating camels across ten provinces at 16 time points spanning 30-480 days in milk (DIM). Analyses included fat, protein, lactose, solids-not-fat (SNF), and somatic cell count (SCC). Interviews with 28 camel owning households indicated that milking typically begins between July and September and continues for up to a year, influenced by household labor availability and market access. Results revealed distinct seasonal patterns: peak milk yield (similar to 2.0 L/day) occurred during summer and early autumn (120-240 DIM), possibly reflecting generally more favorable grazing conditions. In contrast, fat and SNF contents increased markedly in winter, while protein followed similar trends. Lactose was higher in summer and autumn. SCC remained stable through mid-lactation but rose toward late lactation. These findings highlight the resilience of Mongolia's camel based pastoral systems and emphasize the importance of supporting herders through improved forage planning and market opportunities to sustain milk production year round.

AB  - Objective Inflammatory infiltration in aortic valves promotes calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) progression. While soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins induce inflammatory responses in aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs), the impact of monocytes on AVIC inflammatory responses is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that monocytes enhance AVIC inflammatory responses to soluble ECM protein in this study. Methods Human AVICs isolated from normal aortic valves were cocultured with monocytes and stimulated with soluble ECM protein (matrilin-2). ICAM-1 and IL-6 productions were assessed. YAP and NF-kappa B phosphorylation were analyzed. Recombinant CD18, neutralizing antibodies against beta(2)-integrin or ICAM-1, and inhibitor of YAP or NF-kappa B were applied. Results AVIC expression of ICAM-1 and IL-6 was markedly enhanced by the presence of monocytes, although matrilin-2 did not affect monocyte production of ICAM-1 or IL-6. Matrilin-2 up-regulated the expression of monocyte beta(2)-integrin and AVIC ICAM-1, leading to monocyte-AVIC adhesion. Neutralizing beta(2)-integrin or ICAM-1 in coculture suppressed monocyte adhesion to AVICs and the expression of ICAM-1 and IL-6. Recombinant CD18 enhanced the matrilin-2-induced ICAM-1 and IL-6 expression in AVIC monoculture. Further, stimulation of coculture with matrilin-2 induced greater YAP and NF-kappa B phosphorylation. Inhibiting either YAP or NF-kappa B markedly suppressed the inflammatory response to matrilin-2 in coculture. Conclusion Monocyte beta(2)-integrin interacts with AVIC ICAM-1 to augment AVIC inflammatory responses to soluble matrilin-2 through enhancing the activation of YAP and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Infiltrated monocytes may promote valvular inflammation through cell-cell interaction with AVICs to enhance their sensitivity to damage-associated molecular patterns.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of SCs consumption by assessing the effects of three novel synthetic cannabinoids (SCs); MDMB-CHMINACA, 5F-ADB-PINACA, and APICA post-drug treatment. SCs are known for their rapid onset (<1 min) and prolonged duration (>= 5 h). Therefore, this research aimed to assess behavioral responses and their correlation with endocannabinoids (ECs) accumulation in the hippocampus, and EC's metabolic enzymes alteration at different timeframes (1-3-5-h) following drug administration. Different extents of locomotive disruption and sustained anxiety-like symptoms were observed throughout all-encompassing timeframes of drug administration. Notably, MDMB-CHMINACA induced significant memory impairment at 1 and 3 h. Elevated levels of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) were detected 1 h post-MDMB-CHMINACA and 5F-ADB-PINACA administration. Reduced mRNA expression levels of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) (AEA and 2-AG degrading enzymes, respectively), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) occurred at 1 h, with FAAH levels remaining reduced at 3 h. These findings suggest a connection between increased EC content and decreased BDNF expression following SC exposure. Cognitive disruption, particularly motor coordination decline and progressive loss manifested in a time-dependent manner across all the analyzed SCs. Our study highlights the importance of adopting a temporal framework when assessing the effects of SCs.

AB  - Arsenic is the leading toxicant of hazardous environmental chemicals, which is linked with neurotoxicity including cognitive dysfunction, neurodevelopmental alterations and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been suggested that sustained pro-inflammatory response is one of the triggering factors of arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. Microglia, the immune cells in the central nervous system, response to physiological and pathological stress, and release a large array of pro-inflammatory cytokines if activated excessively. Several studies indicated that arsenic was capable of inducing microglia activation, however, the role of the subsequently released proinflammatory cytokines in arsenic-induced neurotoxicity remains to be elucidated. Our findings demonstrated that arsenic-induced cognitive dysfunction, microglia activation, up-regulation and release of IL-1 beta and ER stressmediated apoptosis could be attenuated by minocycline, a recognized inhibitor of microglia activation. In addition, the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra diminished arsenic-induced activation of ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathway PERK/eIF2 alpha/ATF4/CHOP and neuronal apoptosis. Our findings provided evidences that arsenic-induced microglia activation also contributed to neuronal apoptosis through pro-inflammatory cytokine. Microglia-derived IL-1 beta promoted hippocampal neuronal apoptosis through ER stress-mediated PERK/eIF2 alpha/ ATF4/CHOP apoptotic pathway. Neuronal apoptosis induced by prolonged activation of microglia was partially involved in the arsenic-induced cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Piper nigrum L. (PN), which contains various bioactive compounds, is a plant with homologous medicine and food. Sleep deprivation (SD) profoundly impacts cognitive function and emotional health. However, the mechanisms by which PN improves cognitive function and depressive mood induced by SD remain unclear. In our study, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to predict the potential mechanisms by which PN regulates SD. In this study, 220 compounds were identified in PN, and 10 core targets were screened through network pharmacology. Animal experiments showed that PN ameliorated depressive mood and cognitive deficits in sleep-deprived mice, upregulated the serum activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT), and downregulated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The ELISA assay showed that PN significantly decreased the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) levels. Histopathological staining of brain tissue demonstrated that PN mitigates SD-induced hippocampal damage, enables the hippocampus to produce more neurotransmitters, including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and dopamine (DA), and reduces glutamate (Glu) levels. RT-qPCR and WB analyses further indicated that PN could exert anti-SD effects by inhibiting the over-activation of the JAK1/STAT3 signalling pathway. In the PC12 cell model, PN could reduce inflammation and prevent apoptosis, exerting neuroprotective effects. In summary, PN has positive effects on alleviating depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunction induced by SD.

AB  - C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) family comprises fifteen highly conserved secretory proteins with diverse central and peripheral functions. In zebrafish, mouse, and human, CTRP4 is most highly expressed in the brain. We previously showed that CTRP4 is a metabolically responsive regulator of food intake and energy balance, and mice lacking CTRP4 exhibit sexually dimorphic changes in ingestive behaviors and systemic metabolism. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing also revealed Ctrp4/C1qtnf4 expression in diverse neuronal cell types across distinct anatomical brain regions, hinting at additional roles in the central nervous system not previously characterized. To uncover additional central functions of CTRP4, we subjected Ctrp4 knockout (KO) mice to a battery of behavioral tests. Relative to wild-type (WT) littermates, loss of CTRP4 does not alter exploratory, anxiety-, or depressive-like behaviors, motor function and balance, sensorimotor gating, novel object recognition, and spatial memory. While pain-sensing mechanisms in response to thermal stress and mild shock are intact, both male and female Ctrp4 KO mice have increased sensitivity to pain induced by higher-level shock, suggesting altered nociceptive function. Importantly, CTRP4 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent associative learning and memory as assessed by trace fear conditioning paradigm. This deficit is sex-dependent, affects only female mice, and is associated with altered expression of learning and memory genes (Arc, c-fos, and Pde4d) in the hippocampus and cortex. Altogether, our behavioral and gene expression analyses have uncovered novel aspects of the CTRP4 function and provided a physiological context to further investigate its mechanism of action in the central and peripheral nervous system.

AB  - Hot metal is produced in a blast furnace. Subsequently, the hot metal is loaded from the blast furnace into a torpedo car and transported to the ladle, where the desulfurization process of the hot metal is realized. After desulfurization, the hot metal is poured from the ladle into the oxygen converter. The temperature of the hot metal has an impact on the steelmaking process realized in the oxygen converter. The complex model presented in the article calculates the temperature drop of the hot metal in the torpedo car and the ladle. Predicting the hot metal temperature behavior allows for determining the length of time the hot metal transport requires and thus initiating steelmaking at its required hot metal temperature. This model, based on heat transfer by conduction, convection, radiation, heat accumulation, and chemical reactions, also allows for the monitoring of the hot metal temperature drop in the torpedo car and the ladle, the analysis of the influence of the linings in terms of heat accumulation, the investigation of the desulfurization process in the ladle, and the optimization torpedo and ladle selection in terms of the accumulated heat in the lining for their entry into the hot metal transport process. An absolute and relative error calculation was used to verify the proposed model.

AB  - Red cell volume is a major determinant of HbS concentration in sickle cell disease. Cellular deoxy-HbS concentration deter-mines the delay time, the interval between HbS deoxygenation and deoxy-HbS polymerization. Major membrane transporter protein determinants of sickle red cell volume include the SLC12/KCC K-Cl cotransporters KCC3/SLC12A 6 and KCC1/ SLC12A4, and the KCNN4/KCa3. 1 Ca2+-activated K+ channel (Gardos channel). Among standard inhibitors of KCC-mediated K-Cl cotransport, only [(dihydroindenyl)oxy]acetic acid (DIOA) has been reported to lack inhibitory activity against the related bumetanide-sensitive erythroid Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1/SLC12A2. DIOA has been often used to inhibit K-Cl cotrans-port when studying the expression and regulation of other K+ transporters and K+ channels. We report here that DIOA at concentrations routinely used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport can also abrogate activity of the KCNN4/KCa3.1 Gardos channel in human and mouse red cells and in human sickle red cells. DIOA inhibition of A23187-stimulated erythroid K+ uptake (Gardos channel activity) was chloride-independent and persisted in mouse red cells genetically devoid of the principal K-Cl cotransporters KCC3 and KCC1. DIOA also inhibited YODA1-stimulated, chloride-independent erythroid K+ uptake. In con-trast, DIOA exhibited no inhibitory effect on K+ influx into A23187-treated red cells of Kcnn4-/- mice. DIOA inhibition of human KCa3.1 was validated (IC50 42 mM) by whole cell patch clamp in HEK-293 cells. RosettaLigand docking experiments identified a potential binding site for DIOA in the fenestration region of human KCa3.1. We conclude that DIOA at concentra-tions routinely used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport can also block the KCNN4/KCa3. 1 Gardos channel in normal and sickle red cells.

AB  - Against the backdrop of a failing vaccine innovation system, innovation policy aimed at creating a COVID-19 vaccine was surprisingly fast and effective. This paper analyzes the influence of the COVID-19 landscape shock and corresponding innovation policy responses on the existing vaccine innovation system. We use document analysis and expert interviews, performed during vaccine development. We find that the sharing of responsibility between public and private actors on various geographical levels, and the focus on accelerating changes in the innovation system were instrumental in achieving fast results. Simultaneously, the acceleration exacerbated existing societal innovation barriers, such as vaccine hesitancy, health inequity, and contested privatization of earnings. Going forward, these innovation barriers may limit the legitimacy of the vaccine innovation system and reduce pandemic preparedness. Next to a focus on acceleration, transformative innovation policies for achieving sustainable pandemic preparedness are still urgently needed. Implications for mission-oriented innovation policy are discussed.

AB  - Functional restoration is an important issue in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Various electrical stimulation devices and protocols have been applied in preclinical studies and have shown therapeutic potential for brain trauma. Short-term invasive cortical electrical stimulation during the acute stage of TBI might be a feasible adjuvant therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe brain injury receiving neurosurgical treatment in the intensive care unit. However, the therapeutic effects of short-term multisession cortical electrical stimulation for brain trauma are not clear. This study explored the therapeutic effects of acute-stage short-term cortical electrical stimulation on TBI. We conducted seven sessions of one-hour cortical electrical stimulation from day 0 to day 6 in rats after brain trauma by controlled cortical impact and then evaluated the functional outcome and histopathological changes. Our data showed that short-term cortical electrical stimulation improved motor coordination, short-term memory, and learning ability and attenuated neurological severity after brain trauma. Lesion volume, apoptosis, and gliosis after brain trauma were reduced, and trauma-induced neurogenesis in the hippocampus for the innate neural reparative response was increased. Our study demonstrated that short-term cortical electrical stimulation applied in the acute stage of traumatic brain injury is a potential adjuvant therapy to improve the recovery of neurological deficits.

AB  - The body condition index (BCI) values in small mammals are important in understanding their survival and reproduction. The upper values could be related to the Chitty effect (presence of very heavy individuals), while the minimum ones are little known. In this study, we analyzed extremes of BCI in 12 small mammal species, snap-trapped in Lithuania between 1980 and 2023, with respect to species, animal age, sex, and participation in reproduction. The proportion of small mammals with extreme body condition indices was negligible (1.33% with a BCI < 2 and 0.52% with a BCI > 5) when considering the total number of individuals processed (n = 27,073). When compared to the expected proportions, insectivores and herbivores were overrepresented, while granivores and omnivores were underrepresented among underfit animals. The proportions of granivores and insectivores were higher, while those of omnivores and herbivores were lower than expected in overfit animals. In several species, the proportions of age groups in underfit and overfit individuals differed from that expected. The male-female ratio was not expressed, with the exception of Sorex araneus. The highest proportion of overfit and absence of underfit individuals was found in Micromys minutus. The observation that individuals with the highest body mass are not among those with the highest BCI contributes to the interpretation of the Chitty effect. For the first time in mid-latitudes, we report individuals of very high body mass in three shrew species.

AB  - The Protein Data Bank (PDB) includes a carefully curated treasury of experimentally derived structural data on biological macromolecules and their various complexes. Such information is fundamental for a multitude of projects that involve large-scale data mining and/or detailed evaluation of individual structures of importance to chemistry, biology and, most of all, to medicine, where it provides the foundation for structure-based drug discovery. However, despite extensive validation mechanisms, it is almost inevitable that among the similar to 215 000 entries there will occasionally be suboptimal or incorrect structure models. It is thus vital to apply careful verification procedures to those segments of the PDB that are of direct medicinal interest. Here, such an analysis was carried out for crystallographic models of L-asparaginases, enzymes that include approved drugs for the treatment of certain types of leukemia. The focus was on the adherence of the atomic coordinates to the rules of stereochemistry and their agreement with the experimental electron-density maps. Whereas the current clinical application of L-asparaginases is limited to two bacterial proteins and their chemical modifications, the field of investigations of such enzymes has expanded tremendously in recent years with the discovery of three entirely different structural classes and with numerous reports, not always quite reliable, of the anticancer properties of L-asparaginases of different origins.

AB  - The heterogeneous nature of human breast cancer (HBC) can still lead to therapy inefficacy and high lethality, and new therapeutics as well as new spontaneous animal models are needed to benefit translational HBC research. Dogs are primarily investigated since they spontaneously develop tumors that share many features with human cancers. In recent years, different natural phytochemicals including berberine, a plant alkaloid, have been reported to have antiproliferative activity in vitro in human cancers and rodent animal models. In this study, we report the antiproliferative activity and mechanism of action of berberine, its active metabolite berberrubine, and eight analogs, on a canine mammary carcinoma cell line and in transgenic zebrafish models. We demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo the significant effects of specific analogs on cell viability via the induction of apoptosis, also identifying their role in inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and activating the Hippo signals with a downstream reduction in CTGF expression. In particular, the berberine analogs NAX035 and NAX057 show the highest therapeutic efficacy, deserving further analyses to elucidate their mechanism of action more in detail, and in vivo studies on spontaneous neoplastic diseases are needed, aiming at improving veterinary treatments of cancer as well as translational cancer research.

AB  - Simple Summary Free-ranging rhinoceros populations are currently threatened due to habitat loss and poaching, and populations under managed care are not self-sustaining. Understanding theriogenology, the study of reproductive medicine, is important if these animals are to be managed effectively to create insurance populations against ecologically or anthropomorphically induced population declines. While there have been many studies evaluating the reproductive physiology and pathology of rhinoceros, there is still a lack of understanding regarding what is considered normal during birth and early calf development. By using video recordings and written medical records, we described the expected timelines for the phases of birth and calf development, as well as the frequency of anterior versus posterior calf positioning during birth and the prevalence of stillbirth. Equine parameters were used as a model for comparison for the results from this study due to the close taxonomic relationship between horses and rhinoceros. The results from this study will help guide clinical decisions for veterinary intervention during and after birth to achieve the best success for the health of the dam and the calf. Establishing references for birth and calf development will aid in sustaining populations of these endangered species in captivity, thereby creating a long-standing impact on the conservation of all rhinoceros species.Abstract Rhinoceros species range from near threatened to critically endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. A sustainable ex situ breeding population is critically important to maintain genetic diversity and help ensure the survival of the species; however, not all populations under human care are self-sustaining. While rhinoceros reproductive physiology and pathology have been well studied, there is still a paucity of information describing the normal parameters of parturition and neonatal landmarks. Using video recordings, medical records, and keeper logs, we reviewed and compared data regarding the parturition of three rhinoceros species (black rhinoceros (BR) (Diceros bicornis), n = 4; greater one-horned rhinoceros (GOHR) (Rhinoceros unicornis), n = 21; and southern white rhinoceros (SWR) (Ceratotherium simum simum), n = 22) managed under human care in the United States. Using equine parameters as a model for comparison, we compiled the following data: the signs of impending parturition, durations of the parturition phases, calving presentation, frequency of dystocia or stillbirth, and time from birth to neonatal landmarks. Data from 47 births, including 26 videos, were examined. The durations of parturition phases I, II, and III had median lengths of 153 min (n = 18), 28 min (n = 21), and 205 min (n = 15), respectively. Anterior presentation of the calf was observed in 59% births, whereas posterior presentation occurred in 41% births. Posterior calving presentation was associated with a longer phase II of parturition (p = 0.04), although more data are needed to determine whether the posterior presentation of the calf carries a higher risk for stillbirth. Most (83%) stillbirths occurred in GOHR, indicating that this species might be at a higher risk for stillbirth compared to SWR (17%) (p = 0.07). The median time from birth to the calf standing was longer in the GOHR (64 min) compared to the SWR (30 min) (p = 0.02).
   Detailed descriptions of the parturition parameters and neonatal landmarks in rhinoceros will aid facilities with rhinoceros breeding programs to recognize abnormalities in the parturient or post-partum periods and guide indications for veterinary intervention.

AB  - Abnormal epigenetic reprogramming of nuclear-transferred (NT) embryos leads to the limited efficiency of producing cloned animals. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, improves NT embryo development, but its role in histone acetylation in porcine embryos cloned with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is not fully understood. This study aimed to compare the effects of TSA on embryo development, histone acetylation patterns, and key epigenetic-related genes between in vitro fertilization (IVF), NT-MSC, and 40 nM TSA-treated NT-MSC (T-NT-MSC). The results demonstrated an increase in the blastocyst rate from 13.7% to 32.5% in the T-NT-MSC, and the transcription levels of CDX2, NANOG, and IGF2R were significantly elevated in T-NT-MSC compared to NT-MSC. TSA treatment also led to increased fluorescence intensity of acH3K9 and acH3K18 during early embryo development but did not differ in acH4K12 levels. The expression of epigenetic-related genes (HDAC1, HDAC2, CBP, p300, DNMT3a, and DNMT1) in early pre-implantation embryos followed a pattern similar to IVF embryos. In conclusion, TSA treatment improves the in vitro development of porcine embryos cloned with MSCs by increasing histone acetylation, modifying chromatin structure, and enhancing the expression of key genes, resulting in profiles similar to those of IVF embryos.

AB  - BackgroundIt has been documented that aerobic exercise (AE) has a positive effect on improving cognitive function in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. Here, we tried to explore how AE regulates the expression of long non-coding RNA in serum-exosomes (Exos), thereby affecting cognitive impairment in T2DM mice as well as its potential molecular mechanism.MethodsT2DM mouse models were constructed, and serum-Exos were isolated for whole transcriptome sequencing to screen differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA, followed by prediction of downstream target genes. The binding ability of miR-382-3p with a long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was explored. Then, primary mouse hippocampal neurons were collected for in vitro mechanism verification, as evidenced by the detection of hippocampal neurons' vitality, proliferation, and apoptosis capabilities, and insulin resistance. Finally, in vivo mechanism verification was performed to assess the effect of AE on insulin resistance and cognitive disorder.ResultsTranscriptome sequencing analysis showed that MALAT1 was lowly expressed and miR-382-3p was highly expressed in serum-Exos samples of T2DM mice. There were targeted binding sites between MALAT1 and miR-382-3p and between miR-382-3p and BDNF. In vitro experiments showed that MALAT1 upregulated BDNF expression by inhibiting miR-382-3p. Silencing MALAT1 or overexpressing miR-382-3p could reduce the expression of INSR, IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3K/AKT, and Ras/MAPK, inhibit neuronal proliferation, and promote apoptosis. In vivo experiments further confirmed that AE could increase the expression of MALAT1 in serum-Exos to competitively inhibit miR-382-3p and upregulate BDNF expression, thereby improving cognitive impairment in T2DM mice.ConclusionAE may upregulate the expression of MALAT1 in serum-Exos to competitively inhibit miR-382-3p and upregulate BDNF expression, thus improving cognitive impairment in T2DM mice.

AB  - Among the enzymes that support brain metabolism, cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes occupy an important place. These enzymes catalyze the biotransformation pathways of neuroactive endogenous substrates (neurosteroids, neurotransmitters) and are necessary for the detoxification processes. The aim of the present study was to assess changes in the CYP2D activity and protein level during the aging process and as a result of serotonin deficiency in the female brain. The CYP2D activity was measured in brain and liver microsomes of Dark Agouti wild type (WT) female rats (mature 15-week-old and senescent 18-month-old rats) and in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2)deficient senescent female rats. The CYP2D activity in mature WT Dark Agouti females was independent of the changing phases of the estrous cycle. In senescent WT females rats, the CYP2D activity and protein level were decreased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and liver, but increased in the brain stem. In the other examined structures (frontal cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum), the enzyme activity did not change. In aging TPH2-deficient females, the CYP2D activity and protein levels were decreased in the frontal cortex, hypothalamus and brain stem (activity only), remaining unchanged in other brain structures and liver, relative to senescent WT females. In summary, the aging process and TPH2 deficit affect the CYP2D activity and protein level in female rats, which may have a negative impact on the compensatory capacity of CYP2D in the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine in cerebral structures involved in cognitive and emotional functions. In the liver, the CYP2D-catalyzed drug metabolism may be diminished in elderly females. The results in female rats are compared with those obtained previously in males. It is concluded that aging and serotonin deficiency exert sex-dependent effects on brain CYP2D, which seem to be less favorable in females concerning CYP2D-mediated neurotransmitter synthesis, but beneficial regarding slower neurosteroid metabolism.

AB  - Gonadal steroid 17 beta-estradiol (E2) exerts rapid, non-genomic effects on neurons and strictly regulates learning and memory through altering glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. However, its non-genomic effects on AMPARs are not well understood. Here, we analyzed the rapid effect of E2 on AMPARs using single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging techniques. We found that E2 rapidly decreased the surface movement of AMPAR via membrane G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) in neurites in a dose-dependent manner. The cortical actin network played a pivotal role in the GPER1 mediated effects of E2 on the surface mobility of AMPAR. E2 also decreased the surface movement of AMPAR both in synaptic and extrasynaptic regions on neurites and increased the synaptic dwell time of AMPARs. Our results provide evidence for understanding E2 action on neuronal plasticity and glutamatergic neurotransmission at the molecular level.

AB  - Tea saponins have high surface-active and biological activities and are widely used in chemicals, food, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Tea saponins are usually extracted using ethanol or water, but both methods have their disadvantages, including a negative impact on the environment, high energy consumption, and low purity. In this study, we explored an effective process for extracting tea saponins from tea meal using deep eutectic solvents combined with ultrasonic extraction and enzymatic techniques. The experimental results showed that a high extraction efficiency of 20.93 +/- 0.48% could be achieved in 20 min using an ultrasonic power of 40% and a binary DES consisting of betaine and ethylene glycol (with a molar ratio of 1:3) at a material-liquid ratio of 1:35 and that the purity of the tea saponins after purification by a large-pore adsorption resin reached 95.94%, which was higher than that of commercially available standard tea saponin samples. In addition, the extracted tea saponins were evaluated for their antioxidant and bacteriostatic activities using chemical and biological methods; the results showed that the tea saponins extracted using these methods possessed antioxidant properties and displayed significant antibacterial activity. Therefore, the present study developed a method for using deep eutectic solvents as an environmentally friendly technological solution for obtaining high-purity tea saponins from tea meal oil. This is expected to replace the current organic solvent and water extraction process and has great potential for industrial development and a number of possible applications.

AB  - The accurate measurement of environmentally-relevant gases such as ammonia (NH3) is increasingly important, especially in agricultural science. Accurate and continuous measurement of gases is essential for evaluating NH3 and other gases as resource-based indicators of air quality in forced ventilation barns and for determining emission rates. To better assess measuring devices under different barn conditions (e.g. relative humidity or concentration range) self-conducted tests should be implemented at the laboratory scale before, during and after (experimental) measurements in the barn, independent of the manufacturer's specifications. Therefore, in this study, a gas calibration unit was set up for measurements at the laboratory scale. Moreover, measurement protocols were developed to investigate the accuracy at different gas concentrations and relative humidity levels and the responsiveness to rapid gas concentration changes. Measurements were performed with photoacoustic gas analysers (INNOVA 1412) and transmitters with electrochemical gas sensors (Polytron 8100 and C300). In addition to the presentation of results of the devices used in this case, this study should above all offer suggestions for quality monitoring to test sensors more intensively at the laboratory scale in order to be able to use them in a more targeted manner according to their optimal suitability.

AB  - Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent mode of non-apoptotic cell death characterized by accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a regulator of ROS, cytoglobin (CYGB) plays an important role in oxygen homeostasis and acts as a tumour suppressor. However, the mechanism by which CYGB regulates cell death is largely unknown. Here, we show that CYGB overexpression increased ROS accumulation and disrupted mitochondrial function as determined by the oxygen consumption rate and membrane potential. Importantly, ferroptotic features with accumulated lipid ROS and malondialdehyde were observed in CYGB-overexpressing colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, CYGB significantly increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to RSL3- and erastin-induced ferroptotic cell death. Mechanically, both YAP1 and p53 were significantly increased based on the RNA sequencing. The knock-down of YAP1 alleviated production of lipid ROS and sensitivity to ferroptosis in CYGB overexpressed cells. Furthermore, YAP1 was identified to be inhibited by p53 knock-down. Finally, high expression level of CYGB had the close correlation with key genes YAP1 and ACSL4 in ferroptosis pathway in colon cancer based on analysis from TCGA data. Collectively, our results demonstrated a novel tumour suppressor role of CYGB through p53-YAP1 axis in regulating ferroptosis and suggested a potential therapeutic approach for colon cancer.

AB  - Adaptation of gene expression is one of the most fundamental response of cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic stimuli. G3bp1, an RNA binding protein with site-specific endoribonuclease activity regulates the processing of pre-miR-1 stem-loop, and thus levels of cardiomyocyte-enriched mature miR-1. Here, we examine the role of G3bp1 in regulating gene expression in quiescent cardiomyocytes and those undergoing growth-factor induced hypertrophy. Further, we determine if these changes are facilitated through G3bp1-mediated regulation of miR-1 in these cardiomyocytes. Using isolated cardiomyocytes with knockdown of endogenous G3bp1, we performed high throughput RNA sequencing to determine the change in cardiac transcriptome. Then, using gain and loss of function approach for both, G3bp1 and miR-1, alone or in combination we examine the G3bp1-miR-1 signaling in regulating gene expression and Endothelin (ET-1)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We show that knockdown of endogenous G3bp1 results in inhibition of genes involved in calcium handling, cardiac muscle contraction, action potential and sarcomeric structure. In addition, there is inhibition of genes that contribute to hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy development. Conversely, an increase is seen in genes that negatively regulate the Hippo signaling, like Rassf1 and Arrdc3, along with inflammatory genes of TGF-beta and TNF pathways. Knockdown of G3bp1 restricts ET-1 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Interestingly, concurrent silencing of G3bp1 and miR-1 rescues the change in gene expression and inhibition of hypertrophy seen with knockdown of G3bp1 alone. Similarly, expression of exogenous G3bp1 reverses the miR-1 induced inhibition of gene expression. Intriguingly, expression of Gfp tagged G3bp1 results in perinuclear accumulations of G3bp1Gfp, resembling Stress Granules. Based on our results, we conclude that G3bp1 through its regulation of mature miR-1 levels plays a critical role in regulating the expression of essential cardiac-enriched genes and those involved in development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

AB  - Different regions of the gastrointestinal tract have specific functions and thus distinct motility patterns. Motility is primarily regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS), an intrinsic network of neurons located within the gut wall. Under physiological conditions, the ENS is influenced by the central nervous system (CNS). However, by using ex vivo organ bath experiments, ENS regulation of gut motility can also be studied in the absence of CNS influences. The current technique enables the characterisation of small intestinal, caecal, and colonic motility patterns using an ex vivo organ bath and video imaging protocol. This approach is combined with the novel edge detection script GutMap, available in MATLAB, that functions across Windows and Mac platforms. Dissected intestinal segments are cannulated in an organ bath containing physiological saline with a camera mounted overhead. Video recordings of gut contractions are then converted to spatiotemporal heatmaps and analysed using the GutMap software interface. Using data analysed from the heatmaps, parameters of contractile patterns (including contraction propagation frequency and velocity as well as gut diameter) at baseline and in the presence of drugs/treatments/genetic mutations can be compared. Here, we studied motility patterns of female mice at baseline and in the presence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N-omega-Nitro-L-arginine; NOLA) (nitric oxide being the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of gut motility) to showcase the application of GutMap. This technique is suitable for application to a broad range of animal models of clinical disorders to understand underlying biological pathways contributing to gastrointestinal dysfunction.
   Key features Enhanced video imaging analysis of gut contractility in rodents using a novel software interface.
   New edge detection algorithm to accurately contour curvatures of the gastrointestinal tract.
   Allows for output of high-resolution spatiotemporal heatmaps across Windows and Mac platforms.
   Edge detection and analysis method makes motility measurements accessible in different gut regions including the caecum and stomach.

AB  - The effects of prenatal hypoxia on neurodevelopment are predominantly associated with impaired maternal glucocorticoid stimulation of the fetus, which is "imprinted " in altered sensitivity of glucocorticoid reception in brain structures of offspring and can affect brain plasticity during lifespan. This study aimed to investigate response of the brain glucocorticoid system to mild stress (MS) in adult rats that survived prenatal severe hypoxia (PSH) on embryonic days 14-16. In response to MS the control (but not PSH) rats demonstrate increased corticosterone levels, a decrease in exploratory activity and increased anxiety. In the raphe nuclei of adult PSH rats the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) is increased without changes in serotonin levels in comparison with the control. MS induces a decrease in GR expression accompanied by up-regulation of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (tph2) and down-regulation of monoamine oxidase A (maoa) transcription in the raphe nuclei of both control and PSH groups. PSH also causes significant deviations in GR expression and GR-dependent transcription in the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex, but not in the amygdala of rats. However, in response to MS, PSH rats demonstrate mild changes in their activity, while in control animals the MS-induced activity of the glucocorticoid system in these brain structures is similar to intact PSH animals. Impaired activity of the glucocorticoid system in the extrahypothalamic brain structures of PSH rats is accompanied by increase in the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels in comparison with the control regardless of MS. Synthesis of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the blood are decreased in response to MS in the pituitary of control rats, which demonstrates a negative glucocorticoid feedback mechanism. Meanwhile, in the pituitary of PSH rats reduced POMC levels were found regardless of MS. Thus, prenatal hypoxia causes depression-like patterns in the brain glucocorticoid system with adverse reaction to mild stressors.

AB  - Engineered vector-based in vivo protein delivery platforms have made significant progress for both prophylactic and therapeutic applications. However, the lack of effective release strategies results in foreign cargo being trapped within the vector, restricting the provision of significant performance benefits and enhanced therapeutic results compared to traditional vaccines. Herein, the development of a Salmonella mRNA interferase regulation vector (SIRV) system is reported to overcome this challenge. The genetic circuits are engineered that (1) induce self-lysis to release foreign antigens into target cells and (2) activate the cytosolic surveillance cGAS-STING axis by releasing DNA into the cytoplasm. Delayed synthesis of the MazF interferase regulates differential mRNA cleavage, resulting in a 36-fold increase in the delivery of foreign antigens and modest activation of the inflammasome, which collectively contribute to the marked maturation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Bacteria delivering the protective antigen SaoA exhibits excellent immunogenicity and safety in mouse and pig models, significantly improving the survival rate of animals challenged with multiple serotypes of Streptococcus suis. Thus, the SIRV system enables the effective integration of various modular components and antigen cargos, allowing for the generation of an extensive range of intracellular protein delivery systems using multiple bacterial species in a highly efficient manner.
   The SIRV system enhances the safety and immunogenicity of Salmonella vectors through the following mechanisms: (1) induce self-lysis to release foreign antigens; (2) activate the cytosolic surveillance cGAS-STING axis; (3) reduce inflammasome activation by impairing flagellin production; (4) promote APC-maturity, thus improving antigen presentation and immunoresponse elicitation.image

AB  - Pipeline maintenance technology based on pipeline intelligent plugging robot (PIPR) has become an effective method for failure accident prevention of high-pressure subsea oil and gas pipelines. However, during the plugging operation, the vortexes and pressure fluctuation are presented under turbulent flow field excitation, which may lead to vortex-induced vibration and failure of the plugging operation. Therefore, in order to ensure the reliability of pipeline plugging, the vibration characteristics are analyzed using numerical simulation, providing guidance on the structural optimization of PIPR's end face. Firstly, the flow field characteristics under different PIPR's end faces are investigated. Secondly, an experimental scheme is designed based on Latin Hypercube Sampling Design (LHSD) optimized by greedy strategy. A mathematical model of the end face's parameters and pressure gradient is established using a back propagation (BP) neural network. Then, an improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) is proposed to optimize the end face's parameters to minimize the pressure gradient of the flow field. Finally, the experimental study is performed to observe the turbulent flow field and pressure fluctuation to validate the optimization results. The results demonstrate that the PIPR's end face has a great influence on the vortex-induced vibration response. After structural optimization, the average pressure gradient of the optimal PIPR's end face has decreased by 84.69% and 54.55% before and after the plugging process, compared to the original end face. This study can provide a reference for pipeline plugging operations, which is significant for preventing pipeline failure accidents.

AB  - Background: Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a sequence of pathophysiological processes after blood recanalization in the patients with ischemic stroke, and has become the hinder for the rehabilitation. Naotaifang formula (NTF) has exhibited the clinical effectiveness for this disease. However, its action effects and molecular mechanisms against CIRI are not fully elucidated. Purpose: The research was to clarify the crosstalk between ferroptosis and necroptosis in CIRI, and uncover the mechanism underlying the neuroprotection of NTF. Methods: This study established MCAO/R rat models with various reperfusion times. Western blot, transmission electron microscope, laser speckle imaging, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and pathological staining were conducted to detect and analyze the obtained results. Subsequently, various NTF doses were used to intervene in MCAO/R rats, and biology experiments, such as western blot, Evans blue, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, were used to analyze the efficacy of NTF doses. The effect of NTF was further clarified through in vitro experiments. Eventually, HT22 cells that suffered OGD/R were subjected to pretreatment with plasmids overexpressing HSP90, MLKL, and GPX4 to indicate the interaction among ferroptosis and necroptosis. Results: There was a gradual increase in the Zea Longa score and cerebral infarction volume following CIRI with prolonged reperfusion. Furthermore, the expression of factors associated with pro-ferroptosis and pro-necroptosis was upregulated in the cortex and hippocampus. NTF alleviated ferroptosis and necroptosis in a dose-dependent manner, downregulated HSP90 levels, reduced blood-brain barrier permeability, and thus protected nerve cells from CIRI. The results in vitro research aligned with those of the in vivo research. HSP90 and MLKL overexpression promoted necroptosis and ferroptosis while activating the GCN2-ATF4 pathway. GPX4 overexpression had no effect on necroptosis or the associated signaling pathway. The administration of NTF alone, as well as its combination with the overexpression of HSP90, MLKL, or GPX4 plasmids, decreased the expression levels of factors associated with pro-ferroptosis and pro-necroptosis and reduced the protein levels of the HSP90-GCN2ATF4 pathway. Moreover, the regulatory effects of the NTF alone group on GSH, ferrous iron, and GCN2 were more significant compared with those of the HSP90 overexpression combination group. Conclusion: Ferroptosis and necroptosis were gradually aggravated following CIRI with prolonged reperfusion. MLKL overexpression may promote ferroptosis and necroptosis, while GPX4 overexpression may have little effect on necroptosis. HSP90 overexpression accelerated both forms of cell death via the HSP90-GCN2-ATF4 pathway. NTF alleviated ferroptosis and necroptosis to attenuate CIRI by regulating the HSP90-GCN2-ATF4 pathway. Our research provided evidence for the potential of drug development by targeting HSP90, MLKL, and GPX4 to protect against ischemic stroke.

AB  - Termites live in a dynamic environment where colony health is strongly influenced by surrounding microbes. However, little is known about the mycobiomes of lower termites and their nests, and how these change in response to disease. Here we compared the individual and nest mycobiomes of a healthy subterranean termite colony (Coptotermes testaceus) to one infected and ultimately eradicated by a fungal pathogen. We identified Trichoderma species in the materials of both nests, but they were also abundant in the infected termites. Methanolic extracts of Trichoderma sp. FHG000531, isolated from the infected nest, were screened for secondary metabolites by UHPLC-HR MS/MS-guided molecular networking. We identified many bioactive compounds with potential roles in the eradication of the infected colony, as well as a cluster of six unknown peptides. The novel peptide FE011 was isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The function of this novel peptide family as well as the role of Trichoderma species in dying termite colonies therefore requires further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUNDSea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) pulp oil is rich in functional components; however, low water solubility and stability limit its applications. This study fabricated sea buckthorn pulp oil microcapsules using whey protein isolate (WPI), soy protein isolate (SPI), sodium caseinate (NaCN), gum arabic (GA), starch sodium octenylsuccinate (OSAS) and SPI mixed with chitosan (CHI). The influences of these wall materials on physicochemical properties, release behavior and digestibility were explored.RESULTSProtein-based wall materials (WPI, NaCN, SPI) demonstrated lower bulk densities due to their porous structures and larger particle sizes, while GA and OSAS produced denser microcapsules. Encapsulation efficiency was the highest for protein-based microcapsules (79.41-89.12%) and the lowest for GA and OSAS. The surface oil percentage of protein-based microcapsules (1.41-4.40%) was lower than that of the other microcapsules. Protein-based microcapsules showed concave and cracked surfaces, while GA and OSAS microcapsules were spherical and smooth. CHI improved reconstitution performance, leading to faster dissolution. During simulated gastrointestinal digestion, protein-based microcapsules released more free fatty acids (FFAs) in the intestinal phase, while CHI-modified SPI microcapsules showed a delayed release pattern due to thicker walls.CONCLUSIONProtein-based wall materials were more effective for sea buckthorn pulp oil microencapsulation, providing higher encapsulation efficiency, better flow properties and releasing more FFAs. The addition of CHI led to the layer-by-layer self-assembly of the microcapsule wall and resulted in sustained release during in vitro intestinal digestion. These findings suggested the potential of protein-based microcapsules for targeted delivery and improved applications of bioactive oils in the food industry. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Simple Summary Methane (CH4) is a byproduct of the digestion of cattle; this gas has a greenhouse effect in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming. As the direct measurement of methane demands time and resources, the objective of this work was to evaluate the ability of a mathematical model (RUMINANT) to predict methane emissions from livestock. With this objective, methane measurements were made in individual chambers, and the results were compared with methane emissions estimated by the RUMINANT model. The model showed a high capacity to predict dry matter intake. However, in the case of methane emissions, it did not. The model substantially underestimates methane emission in all diets (six) but one including Leucaena diversifolia. On diets without Leucaena, the precision of the model was adequate, but on diets with Leucaena, there was not a linear regression between the observed and simulated methane emission values. This may be an effect of the anti-methanogenic factors of Leucaena that are not accounted for by the RUMINANT model. This study contributes to improving national inventories of greenhouse gases from the livestock of tropical countries. Simulation models represent a low-cost approach to evaluating agricultural systems. In the current study, the precision and accuracy of the RUMINANT model to predict dry matter intake (DMI) and methane emissions from beef cattle fed tropical diets (characteristic of Colombia) was assessed. Feed intake (DMI) and methane emissions were measured in Brahman steers housed in polytunnels and fed six forage diets. In addition, DMI and methane emissions were predicted by the RUMINANT model. The model's predictive capability was measured on the basis of precision: coefficients of variation (CV%) and determination (R-2, percentage of variance accounted for by the model), and model efficiency (ME) and accuracy: the simulated/observed ratio (S/O ratio) and slope and mean bias (MB%). In addition, combined measurements of accuracy and precision were carried out by means of mean square prediction error (MSPE) and correlation correspondence coefficient (CCC) and their components. The predictive capability of the RUMINANT model to simulate DMI resulted as valuable for mean S/O ratio (1.07), MB% (2.23%), CV% (17%), R-2 (0.886), ME (0.809), CCC (0.869). However, for methane emission simulations, the model substantially underestimated methane emissions (mean S/O ratio = 0.697, MB% = -30.5%), and ME and CCC were -0.431 and 0.485, respectively. In addition, a subset of data corresponding to diets with Leucaena was not observed to have a linear relationship between the observed and simulated values. It is suggested that this may be related to anti-methanogenic factors characteristic of Leucaena, which were not accounted for by the model. This study contributes to improving national inventories of greenhouse gases from the livestock of tropical countries.

AB  - Goal-directed visual attention is afundamental cognitive function that engages multiple brain regions, yet the neural circuit mechanisms in humans remain unclear. We addressed this question by simultaneously recording neural activity from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and medial frontal cortex (MFC) during a goal-directed visual search task. We found that gamma-band synchronization between the MTL and MFC signaled target detection. Using two additional tasks, we dissociated the neural processes underlying working memory and search decision execution, revealing distinct patterns of synchronization. Further analyses showed that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) spike-MTL LFP synchronization encoded search dynamics and contributed to guiding behavior. Importantly, MTL-MFC synchronization disproportionately modulated neural representational geometry, highlighting its impact on information encoding. Finally, we demonstrated directional gamma influences across brain areas and cross-frequency coupling. Together, these findings illuminate the circuit-level dynamics underlying visual attention and offer insights into how the human brain selectively processes information in complex visual environments.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease which affects more than 40 million people worldwide with progressive loss of memory and cognitive functions. It is reported, persistent AD is also one of the main causes of epilepsy in elders and comorbidity of both these will contribute to worsening the health status of AD patients. Recently, herbal plants with potent neuroprotective and antioxidant properties were used for increasing the quality of life in neurodegenerative disease patients. The present study was conceptualized to access the protective effect of Ocimum sanctum extract (OSE) and Levetiracetam (LEV) and their combination (OSE+LEV) against AD and epilepsy associated with AD in the rat AD model. AD was induced in aged male Wistar albino rats with Amyloid-beta (A beta) by intracerebroventricular administration. The results reveal, treatment with OSE, LEV and OSE+LEV significantly reversed the memory impairment, increases the BDNF expressions and decreases AChE activity in A beta induced AD animals. Expression of A-beta and p-tau in the hippocampus was significantly reduced in treatment group when compared to the control animals. Treatment with OSE and OSE+LEV also restored the hippocampal architecture by ameliorating the neuronal count in CA1, CA3 and DG regions. It also observed that treatment has decreased the excitoneurotoxicity evidenced by decreased glutamate and increased GABA levels and thus provided protection against epilepsy. Treatment groups also exhibited a potent antioxidant activity when tested endogenous antioxidant enzymes SOD, GSH and LPO in the brain hippocampus. Our findings provide evidence for use of OSE, LEV and OSE+LEV against AD and epilepsy associated with AD in A beta induced AD animal model. However, further clinical studies are required to prove the use of OSE, LEV and OSE+LEV in the management of AD and AD-associated epilepsy in human volunteers.

AB  - TRPC channels are critical players in cochlear hair cells and sensory neurons, as demonstrated in animal experiments. However, evidence for TRPC expression in the human cochlea is still lacking. This reflects the logistic and practical difficulties in obtaining human cochleae. The purpose of this study was to detect TRPC6, TRPC5 and TRPC3 in the human cochlea. Temporal bone pairs were excised from ten body donors, and the inner ear was first assessed based on computed tomography scans. Decalcification was then performed using 20% EDTA solutions. Immunohistochemistry with knockout-tested antibodies followed. The organ of Corti, the stria vascularis, the spiral lamina, spiral ganglion neurons and cochlear nerves were specifically stained. This unique report of TRPC channels in the human cochlea supports the hypothesis of the potentially critical role of TRPC channels in human cochlear health and disease which has been suggested in previous rodent experiments.

AB  - Honokiol (HNK) is a biphenolic compound that has been used in traditional medicine for treating various ailments, including cancers. In this study, we determined the effect of HNK on colon cancer cells in culture and in a colitis-associated cancer model. HNK treatment inhibited proliferation and colony formation while inducing apoptosis. In addition, HNK suppressed colonosphere formation. Molecular docking suggests that HNK interacts with reserve stem cell marker protein DCLK1, with a binding energy of -7.0 Kcal/mol. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that HNK suppressed the DCLK1 kinase activity. HNK also suppressed the expression of additional cancer stem cell marker proteins LGR5 and CD44. The Hippo signaling pathway is active in intestinal stem cells. In the canonical pathway, YAP1 is phosphorylated at Ser127 by upstream Mst1/2 and Lats1/2. This results in the sequestration of YAP1 in the cytoplasm, thereby not allowing YAP1 to translocate to the nucleus and interact with TEAD1-4 transcription factors to induce gene expression. However, HNK suppressed Ser127 phosphorylation in YAP1, but the protein remains sequestered in the cytoplasm. We further determined that this occurs by YAP1 interacting with PUMA. To determine if this also occurs in vivo, we performed studies in an AOM/DSS induced colitis-associated cancer model. HNK administered by oral gavage at a dose of 5mg/kg bw for 24 weeks demonstrated a significant reduction in the expression of YAP1 and TEAD1 and in the stem marker proteins. Together, these data suggest that HNK prevents colon tumorigenesis in part by inducing PUMA-YAP1 interaction and cytoplasmic sequestration, thereby suppressing the oncogenic YAP1 activity.

AB  - The group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors) are predominantly expressed presynaptically throughout the central nervous system (CNS) where they regulate the release of glutamate and GABA. These receptors have recently been shown to be anchored by transsynaptic expression of the laminin proteins ELFN1 and ELFN2. In particular, the mGlu(7) receptor is localized at presynaptic active zones from pyramidal cells to somatostatin-containing interneurons with postsynaptic ELFN1, and this interaction drives the rapidly facilitating nature of these synapses in the hippocampus and cortex. Interestingly, individuals with mutations in ELFN1 or GRM7 genes present with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy, and knockout mice of each of these proteins develop seizures with very similar time courses. In the current manuscript, we explore the hypothesis that the pharmacology of positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs) of mGlu(7) might be changed in the presence of ELFN1. These results showed that, across a range of NAMs, we observed similar efficacy in the presence of ELFN1. For PAMs, we observed decreased maximal potentiation when ELFN1 was present, but all examined compounds were still able to potentiate receptor signaling regardless of ELFN1 expression. Finally, we confirm that a tool PAM with mGlu(7) activity is able to potentiate responses at pyramidal cell-somatostatin interneuron synapses where ELFN1 is expressed. These results suggest that, for the modulators shown here, native tissue activity should be retained in the presence of ELFN1 expression.

AB  - Rat is a widely used mammalian model for gut microbiota research. However, due to the difficulties of individual in vitro culture of many of the gut bacteria, much information about the microbial behaviors in the rat gut remains largely unknown. Here, to characterize the in situ growth and division of rat gut bacteria, we apply a chemical strategy that integrates the use of sequential tagging with D-amino acid-based metabolic probes (STAMP) with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to rat gut microbiota. Following sequential gavages of two different fluorescent D-amino acid probes to rats, the resulting dually labeled gut bacteria provides chronological information of their in situ cell wall synthesis. After taxonomical labeling with FISH probes, most of which are newly designed in this study, we successfully identify the growth patterns of 15 bacterial species, including two that have not been cultured separately in the laboratory. Furthermore, using our labeling protocol, we record Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens cells growing at different growth stages of a complete cell division cycle, which offers a new scope for understanding basic microbial activities in the gut of mammalian hosts.

AB  - While neuronal mitochondria have been studied extensively in their role in health and disease, the rules that govern calcium regulation in mitochondria remain somewhat vague. In the present study using cultured rat hippocampal neurons transfected with the mtRCaMP mitochondrial calcium sensor, we investigated the effects of cytosolic calcium surges on the dynamics of mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m). Cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]c) was measured using the high affinity sensor Fluo-2. We recorded two types of calcium events: local and global ones. Local events were limited to a small, 2-5 mu m section of the dendrite, presumably caused by local synaptic activity, while global events were associated with network bursts and extended throughout the imaged dendrite. In both cases, cytosolic surges were followed by a delayed rise in [Ca2+]m. In global events, the rise lasted longer and was observed in all mitochondrial clusters. At the end of the descending part of the global event, [Ca2+]m was still high. Global events were accompanied by short and rather high [Ca2+]m surges which we called spikelets, and were present until the complete decay of the cytosolic event. In the case of local events, selective short-term responses were limited to the part of the mitochondrial cluster that was located directly in the center of [Ca2+]c activity, and faded quickly, while responses in the neighboring regions were rarely observed. Caffeine (which recruits ryanodine receptors to supply calcium to the mitochondria), and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler) could affect [Ca2+]m in both global and local events. We constructed a computational model to simulate the fundamental role of mitochondria in restricting calcium signals within a narrow range under synapses, preventing diffusion into adjacent regions of the dendrite. Our results indicate that local cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium concentrations are highly correlated. This reflects a key role of signaling pathways that connect the postsynaptic membrane to local mitochondrial clusters.

AB  - The geographical distribution of aquatic crustaceans is determined by ambient factors like salinity that modulate their biochemistry, physiology, behavior, reproduction, development and growth. We investigated the effects of exogenous pig FXYD2 peptide and endogenous protein kinases A and C on gill (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, and characterized enzyme kinetic properties in a freshwater population of Macrobrachium amazonicum in fresh water (<0.5 parts per thousand salinity) or acclimated to 21 parts per thousand S. Stimulation by FXYD2 peptide and inhibition by endogenous kinase phosphorylation are salinity-dependent. While without effect in shrimps in fresh water, the FXYD2 peptide stimulated activity in salinity-acclimated shrimps by approximate to 50 %. PKA-mediated phosphorylation inhibited gill (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity by 85 % in acclimated shrimps while PKC phosphorylation markedly inhibited enzyme activity in freshwater- and salinity-acclimated shrimps. The (Na+, K+)-ATPase in salinity-acclimated shrimp gills hydrolyzed ATP at a V-max of 54.9 +/- 1.8 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, corresponding to approximate to 60 % that of freshwater shrimps. Mg2+ affinity increased with salinity acclimation while K+ affinity decreased. (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase activity increased while V(H+)- and Na+- or K+-stimulated activities decreased on salinity acclimation. The 120kDa immunoreactive band expressed in salinity-acclimated shrimps suggests nonspecific alpha-subunit phosphorylation by PKA and/or PKC. These alterations in (Na+, K+)-ATPase kinetics in salinity-acclimated M. amazonicum may result from regulatory mechanisms mediated by phosphorylation via protein kinases A and C and the FXYD2 peptide rather than through the expression of a different alpha-subunit isoform. This is the first demonstration of gill (Na+, K+)-ATPase regulation by protein kinases in freshwater shrimps during salinity challenge.

Behavioral genetics remains, however, among the least understood. We explore the genetic architecture of spatial cognitive abilities in a wild passerine bird, the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli). Mountain chickadees cache thousands of seeds in the fall and require specialized spatial memory to recover these caches throughout the winter. We previously showed that variation in spatial cognition has a direct effect on fitness and has a genetic basis. It remains unknown which specific genes and developmental pathways are particularly important for shaping spatial cognition. To further dissect the genetic basis of spatial cognitive abilities, we combine experimental quantification of spatial cognition in wild chickadees with whole-genome sequencing of 162 individuals, a new chromosome -scale reference genome, and species -specific gene annotation. We have identified a set of genes and developmental pathways that play a key role in creating variation in spatial cognition and found that the mechanism shaping cognitive variation is consistent with selection against mildly deleterious non -coding mutations. Although some candidate genes were organized into connected gene networks, about half do not have shared regulation, highlighting that multiple independent developmental or physiological mechanisms contribute to variation in spatial cognitive abilities. A large proportion of the candidate genes we found are associated with synaptic plasticity, an intriguing result that leads to the hypothesis that certain genetic variants create antagonism between behavioral plasticity and long-term memory, each providing distinct benefits depending on ecological context.

AB  - Sinusitis is one of the most common respiratory inflammatory conditions and a significant health issue that affects millions of people worldwide with a global prevalence of 10-15%. The side effects of available drug regimens of sinus infection demand the urgent development of new drug candidates to combat sinusitis. With the aim of identifying new drug-like candidates to control sinus, we have conducted multifold comprehensive screening of drug-like molecules targeting alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2-AR), which serve as the primary drug target in sinusitis. By structure-based virtual screening of in-house compound's database, ten molecules (CP1-CP10) with agonistic effects for alpha 2-AR were selected, and their binding mechanism with critical residues of alpha-2AR and their physicochemical properties were studied. Moreover, the process of receptor activation by these compounds and the conformational changes in alpha 2-AR caused by these molecules, were further explored by molecular dynamic simulation. The MM-PBSA estimated free energies of compounds are higher than that of reference agonist (Delta G(TOTAL) = 39.0 kcal/mol). Among all, CP2-CP3, CP7-CP8 and CP6 have the highest binding free energies of 78.9 kcal/mol, 77.3 kcal/mol, 75.60 kcal/mol, 64.8 kcal/mol, and 61.6 kcal/mol, respectively. While CP4 (-55.0 kcal/mol), CP5 (-49.2 kcal/mol), CP9 (-54.8 +/- 0.07 kcal/mol), CP10 (-56.7 +/- 0.10 kcal/mol) and CP1 (-46.0 +/- 0.08 kcal/mol) also exhibited significant binding free energies. These energetically favorable binding energies indicate strong binding affinity of our compounds for alpha 2-AR as compared to known partial agonist. Therefore, these molecules can serve as excellent drug-like candidates for sinusitis.

AB  - Age-related bone loss and disease strongly affect the quality of life of the elderly population. Cellular circadian rhythms have been reported to regulate bone aging, and micro RNAs (miRNAs) play crucial posttranscriptional regulatory roles in the peripheral clock network. Proliferation capability, osteogenic lineage commitment, senescence-associated secreted phenotype (SASP) and circadian oscillation of clock genes under osteogenic condition were assessed in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) from young adult and aged adult mice. miRNAs targeting the core clock gene brain and muscle arntl-like protein 1 (Bmal1) were screened and verified in young and old BMSCs with RT-qPCR and Western Blot analysis. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets were mined to define the downstream mechanism and gain- and loss-of-function genetic experiments were performed to confirm the hypothesis. To compare the therapeutic effect of these clock-engineered BMSCs, SASP and osteogenic capability of Bmal1-overexpressing and miR-142-3p-inhibited BMSCs were investigated in vitro and transplanted into bone defects and femur cavities of aged mice. Aged BMSCs displayed an abolished circadian rhythm, impaired self-renewal capability and decreased osteoblast differentiation. miR-142-3p was elevated with aging, which downregulated Bmal1 and diminished the osteogenic potential of BMSCs. In addition, Bmal1 inhibited YAP expression to promote BMSCs osteogenesis, which was independent from the activation of Hippo signaling pathway. Overexpression of Bmal1 or inhibition of miR-142-3p rescued the molecular temporal rhythm and osteoblast differentiation ex vivo. Cell-based circadian therapy showed improved bone formation and higher turnover levels in vivo. This study demonstrates that transcriptional and post-transcriptional level clock-modified BMSCs rescued circadian oscillation and age-related bone loss via miR-142-3p/Bmal1/YAP signaling axis. These data provide promising clinical prospects of circadian-mediated stromal cell-based therapy and bone tissue regeneration.

AB  - Introduction: Perinatal stroke causes lasting neurological deficits and there are currently no effective treatment options. Established animal models of perinatal stroke do not always mimic the clinical presentation of neonatal injury or are technically challenging to perform. The photothrombotic (PT) stroke model is a minimally invasive method that replicates focal ischaemic injury. Few studies have applied the PT model in neonatal contexts, and none have examined both short- and long-term effects across varying injury severities. This study aimed to optimize a protocol to create a mild model of perinatal stroke and subsequently characterize injury progression, neuropathological impact, and motor deficits over time. Methods: On postnatal day 10 we used the PT method to induce perinatal stroke in rat pups. Pups were exposed to various light exposure times (10, 20, or 30 min) to determine the optimal time needed to produce a mild and reproducible cortical stroke injury. Behavioural assessments were conducted on days 4, 10, 20, and 30 post-injury. Brains were collected for analysis on days 3 and 40 post-injury. Results: Three days post-injury, the 20 and 30 min group had significant focal lesions and microbleeds were present in each of the PT groups. All PT groups showed significant neuron loss in the peri-infarct region and the thalamus, and microglia activation in multiple brain regions. As 30 min of light exposure showed extensive cortical tissue loss (>70%), we excluded the 30-min group from long-term assessment. 40 days post-injury, the 10 and 20 min groups demonstrated significant tissue loss and neuronal loss in the peri-infarct region and thalamus, but only the 20 min group showed neuron loss in the hippocampus. The 10 and 20 min groups both demonstrated ongoing motor deficits. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that increasing light exposure time in PT stroke results in a more severe stroke phenotype. 30 min of light exposure resulted in a severe injury at only 3 days post insult, therefore, was not further investigated. 10 and 20 min of light exposure had a similar effect at 3 days, however, after 40 days the 20 min exposure time created a moderate injury phenotype. From this study, we propose that 10 min of light exposure is optimal to create a mild stroke phenotype and is associated with motor deficits and altered neuropathology. This injury phenotype provides a focal and reproducible insult, while still being mild enough to feasibly test therapeutics.

AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal solid tumors in China, with the 5-year overall survival rate less than 20%. Although the carcinogenic process of ESCC is still not clear, recent studies using whole genomic profiling revealed that dysregulation of Hippo signaling pathway might play important roles in ESCC progression. The ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domain 1 (RNF106) was a modifier of DNA methylation and histone ubiquitination. In this study, we evaluate the oncogenic function of RNF106 in ESCC both in vitro and in vivo. Wound healing and transwell data showed that RNF106 was required for ESCC cell migration and invasion. RNF106 depletion dramatically restrained Hippo signaling targeted gene expression. The bioinformatics analysis displayed that RNF106 was increased in ESCC tumor tissues and related with poor survival in ESCC patients. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that RNF106 was associated with LATS2 and facilitate LATS2 K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation, which subsequently inhibited YAP phosphorylation and promoted YAP oncogenic function in ESCC. Taken together, our study revealed a novel link between RNF106 and Hippo signaling in ESCC, suggesting that RNF106 could be a promising target for ESCC therapy.

AB  - Aversive stimuli can cause hippocampal place cells to remap their firing fields, but it is not known whether remapping plays a role in storing memories of aversive experiences. Here, we addressed this question by performing in vivo calcium imaging of CA1 place cells in freely behaving rats (n = 14). Rats were first trained to prefer a short path over a long path for obtaining food reward, then trained to avoid the short path by delivering a mild footshock. Remapping was assessed by comparing place cell population vector similarity before acquisition versus after extinction of avoidance. Some rats received shock after systemic injections of the amnestic drug scopolamine at a dose (1 mg/kg) that impaired avoidance learning but spared spatial tuning and shock-evoked responses of CA1 neurons. Place cells remapped significantly more following remembered than forgotten shocks (drug-free versus scopolamine conditions); shock-induced remapping did not cause place fields to migrate toward or away from the shocked location and was similarly prevalent in cells that were responsive versus non-responsive to shocks. When rats were exposed to a neutral barrier rather than aversive shock, place cells remapped significantly less in response to the barrier. We conclude that place cell remapping occurs in response to events that are remembered rather than merely perceived and forgotten, suggesting that reorganization of hippocampal population codes may play a role in storing memories for aversive events. eLife digestThe human brain is able to remember experiences that occurred at specific places and times, such as a birthday party held at a particular restaurant. A part of the brain known as the hippocampus helps to store these episodic memories, but how exactly is not fully understood.Within the hippocampus are specialized neurons known as place cells which 'label' locations with unique patterns of brain activity. When we revisit a place, such as the restaurant, place cells recall the stored pattern of brain activity allowing us to recognize the familiar location.It has been shown that a new negative experience at a familiar place - for example, if we went back to the restaurant and had a terrible meal - triggers place cells to update the brain activity label associated with the location. However, it remains uncertain whether this re-labelling assists in storing the memory of the unpleasant experience.To investigate, Blair et al. used a technique known as calcium imaging to monitor place cells in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. The rats were given a new experience - a mild foot shock - at a previously explored location. Tiny cameras attached to their heads were then used to record the activity of hundreds of place cells before and after the shock.Initially, the rats remembered the aversive experience and avoided the location where they had been shocked. Over time, the rats began to return to the location; however, their place cells displayed different patterns of activity compared to their previous visits before the shock.To test whether this change in place cell activity corresponded with new memories, another group of rats were administered a mild amnesia-inducing drug before the shock, causing them to forget the experience. These rats did not avoid the shock site or show any changes in place cell activity when they revisited it.These findings imply that new events cause place cells to alter their 'label' for a location only if the event is remembered, not if it is forgotten.
   This indicates that alterations in place cell activity patterns may play a role in storing memories of unpleasant experiences. Having a better understanding of how episodic memories are stored could lead to better treatments for diseases that impair memory, such as Alzheimer's disease and age-related dementia.

AB  - The plant cuticle is a multifunctional barrier that separates the organs of the plant from the surrounding environment. Cuticular ridges are microscale wrinkle-like cuticular protrusions that occur on many flower and leaf surfaces. These microscopic ridges can help against pest insects by reducing the frictional forces experienced when they walk on the leaves and might also provide mechanical stability to the growing plant organs. Here, we have studied the development of cuticular ridges on adaxial leaf surfaces of the tropical Araceae Schismatoglottis calyptrata. We used polymer replicas of adaxial leaf surfaces at various ontogenetic stages to study the morphological changes occurring on the leaf surfaces. We characterized the replica surfaces by using confocal laser scanning microscopy and commercial surface analysis software. The development of cuticular ridges is polar and the ridge progression occurs basipetally with a specific inclination to the midrib on Schismatoglottis calyptrata leaves. Using Colorado potato beetles as model species, we performed traction experiments on freshly unrolled and adult leaves and found low walking frictional forces of insects on both of these surfaces. The changes in the micro-and macroscale morphology of the leaves should improve our understanding of the way that plants defend themselves against insect herbivores.

AB  - Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the endocannabinoid system (ECS) modulate several functions through neurodevelopment including synaptic plasticity mechanisms. The interplay between n-3PUFA and the ECS during the early stages of development, however, is not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of maternal n-3PUFA supplementation (n-3Sup) or deficiency (n-3Def) on ECS and synaptic markers in postnatal offspring. Female rats were fed with a control, n-3Def, or n-3Sup diet from 15 days before mating and during pregnancy. The cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mothers and postnatal 1-2 days offspring were analyzed. In the mothers, a n-3 deficiency reduced CB1 receptor (CB1R) protein levels in the cortex and increased CB2 receptor (CB2R) in both cortex and hippocampus. In neonates, a maternal n-3 deficiency reduced the hippocampal CB1R amount while it increased CB2R. Additionally, total GFAP isoform expression was increased in both cortex and hippocampus in neonates of the n-3Def group. Otherwise, maternal n-3 supplementation increased the levels of n-3-derived endocannabinoids, DHEA and EPEA, in the cortex and hippocampus and reduced 2arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) concentrations in the cortex of the offspring. Furthermore, maternal n-3 supplementation also increased PKA phosphorylation in the cortex and ERK phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Synaptophysin immunocontent in both regions was also increased. In vitro assays showed that the increase of synaptophysin in the n-3Sup group was independent of CB1R activation. The findings show that variations in maternal dietary omega-3 PUFA levels may impact differently on the ECS and molecular markers in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the progeny.

AB  - The pilocarpine-induced (PILO) model has helped elucidate the electrophysiological and molecular aspects related to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It has been suggested that the extensive cell death and edema observed in the brains of these animals could be induced by increased inflammatory responses, such as the rapid release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (Il1b). In this study, we investigate the role of endogenous Il1b in the acute phase of the PILO model. Our aim is twofold. First, we want to determine whether it is feasible to silence Il1b in the central nervous system using a non-invasive procedure. Second, we aim to investigate the effect of silencing endogenous Il1b and its antagonist, Il1rn.We used RNA interference applied non-invasively to knockdown Il1b and its endogenous antagonist Il1rn. We found that knocking down Il1b prior to pilocarpine injection increased the mortality rate of treated animals. Furthermore, we observed that, when exposing the animals to more Il1b by silencing its endogenous antagonist Il1rn, there was a better response to status epilepticus with decreased animal mortality in the acute phase of the PILO model. Thus, we show the feasibility of using a novel, less invasive approach to study genes involved in the inflammatory response in the central nervous system. Furthermore, our results provide suggestive evidence that modulating endogenous Il1b improves animal survival in the acute phase of the PILO model and may have effects that extend into the chronic phase.

AB  - We investigated the neurological effects of the varied erinacine composition of different mycelia cultures in mice with trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neurodegeneration. Forty male ICR mice were randomly divided into five groups of Sham-veh, TMT-veh, TMT-EME, TMT-EMR and TMT-EME/R. The TMT groups received 2.6 mg/kg one-time intraperitoneal injections of TMT. Oral dosages of 200 mg/kg erinacine combination from each Hericium erinaceus mycelia (EM) cultivated formula (100% eucalyptus wood [E], 100% rubber wood [R], or 40% eucalyptus wood/60% rubber wood [E/R]) were given for two weeks. Spatial learning, memory, flexibility, and anxious behaviour were evaluated alongside brain tissues' oxidative status and histological analyses. Erinacine composition from EME/R exhibited significant positive effects on spatial learning, memory, flexibility, and anxiety (p < 0.05). These findings emerged concurrently with the significant mitigation of hippocampal lipid peroxidation, CA1 hippocampal, cortical neuron, and corpus callosum white matter degeneration (p < 0.05). These neurological benefits were associated with the EME/R composition of erinacine A, C, D, G, H, I, K and R. The best neuroprotective effect against TMT-induced neurodegeneration in mice is offered by the EME/R erinacine composition according to its anti-lipid peroxidation, its nurturing effect on neuronal and white matter, and mitigation of behavioural deficits.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide range of skin diseases such as bacterial keratitis, follicles, psoriasis, cellulitis and atopic dermatitis. This study aims to investigate the S. aureus mediated molecular modulation, and the effect of HR in reversing the deleterious impact of S. aureus in keratinocytes. Human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Subcultures were divided into three flasks: control with no S. aureus and extract (C), S. aureus infected (SA) and S. aureus infected cells and extract (SE). RNA was isolated and microarray analysis was performed. The data was annotated using GO functional analysis and DAVID functional annotation. For each comparison group, significant probes were filtered out at significant cut off by fold change (P < 0.05 and/or > twofold change). For SA vs control, SE vs control, and SE vs SA, 204, 9369, 9900 probes were filtered respectively. In SA vs control, TNF signaling, NOD-like receptor and chemokine receptor signaling pathways were upregulated with key genes such as CCL2, CCL20 and BIRC3. The SE vs SA, showed significant expression variations of a number of important genes. Molecular pathways associated with ILs, TNFs, TGFs, IFNs, FGFs, MAPKs, MMPs, caspases and Wnts were either up regulated or downregulated. This effect was reversed by the extract, possibly through downregulating various proinflammatory cytokines and apoptotic pathways. Our study reveals that S. aureus inserts a negative impact on the regulation of various key genes which is apparently reversed by the HR extract.

AB  - Long-term opioid therapies are severely limited by the development of analgesic tolerance and gastrointestinal side effects. Camelina sativa, a plant of the Brassicaceae family, modulates the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha receptor), which is involved in the regulation of pain processing and gut physiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Camelina sativa defatted seed meal (DSM) supplementation on the development of analgesic tolerance and side effects after repeated treatment with morphine in na & iuml;ve mice. Co-administering Camelina sativa DSM (1 g kg-1 p.o.) and morphine (10 mg kg-1 s.c.) increased the efficacy and duration of the opioid-induced acute analgesic effect. Camelina supplementation also delayed the onset of tolerance to the morphine analgesic effect. The same result was obtained through either simultaneously administering morphine and camelina or administering camelina 24 h before morphine injection for the entire duration of the experiment. Camelina also counteracted intestinal damage and visceral hypersensitivity caused by morphine treatment. The beneficial effects of camelina on morphine-related analgesic efficacy and gut side effects were prevented via pre-treatment with the PPAR-alpha antagonist GW6471, though the latter did not influence the development of morphine tolerance. In conclusion, Camelina sativa DSM could be used as a supplement to improve the therapeutic profile of morphine.
